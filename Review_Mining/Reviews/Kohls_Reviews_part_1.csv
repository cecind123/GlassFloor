rating,review
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Managers were rude no one showed me what I was supposed to do no support at all. They just were not at all helpful or supportive in my job.  The managers barely spoke to you.
bad,"I hated working here. They paid below minimum wage, and made it all about future advancement (which would only happen if you work there forever). Obvious favor toward managers over hourly workers."
bad,Another place that is a joke.  Low pay for everyone except upper management. Place is messy and over priced. Inconsistent hours and required holiday hours. Close it down and do us a favor
bad,"Working was fun, but dealing with the people were hard.  THEY ARE ALL STUCK UP, and the managers aren't any better.  They are rude, and will lie to your face."
bad,"the leads have it out for the store manager and rarely help each other out for simple tasks.  they have cameras in their stockrooms to catch their employees so you really cant trust anyone that works at that store. human resources lady doesnt know how to order supplies for anyone and if anyone has an issue  with pay or anything like that it takes forever to get it resolved.  there isnt really anyone ""qualified"" to work there  its all just learn as you go and no formal training at all.   shoplifters steal from there all the time and they have plenty of ways to do it."
bad,"The managers are unreliable, closely knit together (like a clique), and will lie on you. You are expected to do a lot of things at once with no help and watch as the others who are favored do the bare minimum. When putting your foot down, they find a way to fire you."
bad,"Awful support from management, you get promoted even if you arent qualifies for the job.No training. Manager and Assistant Manager treat people like dogs and talk to you any way they please. They support from management is so awful nobody stays. All of the regular workers are overworked with no acknowledgement. You are tossed from job to job. The expect you to work multiple areas at once and it better be perfect."
bad,You will get A lot of hours as a new employee and they give all the other employees no hours that have been there for alot longer . its supposed to be based on seniority but its not . management is horrible no communication at all and bad management just get sent to another store .
bad,"This company has no opportunities for advancement, and people that are given management or assistant positions are lazy and don't pitch in and carry their load."
bad,"This is the worst retail company I ever worked for I am a seasonal employee  and  I only get one day out of the week to work , I have open availability not to many employees can give a company that I be worked retail before and worked all week. I would not recommend this company to people so many new hires have quit they get excited to work for kohl’s only to get let down I hope they close this store!"
bad,"It's a call center, you will be treated like a slave. You will be terminated if you can not stick to your schedule regardless of the reason. You will not ever be paid fairly for the work you do."
bad,Kohl's doesn't treat their employees fairly and they're all about getting Kohl's carts and your hours will vary in on how many Kohl's cards you can open
bad,Management was horrible. All the mangers were ladies and they all gossiped about everyone and distracting people from working messing up online orders making the rest of the team look bad because of all their mistakes.
bad,wasted 9 years here expecting to get employee discount for life after 10. coming up on my 9th year they tell me its discontinued. ABSOLUTE TRASH. CAnt believe they would do this to a long time employee.
bad,The managers over work you and treat you unfairly. They don’t train you to do everything that you’re supposed to do. Managers always have one casual clothes but doesn’t allow others to do so.
bad,For how much you work for this company you do not get paid enough. I was a seasonal employee and most of the time you do everyone else's job because no one showed up and you would be doing every department. Management as well never helped out. And employees would talk about everyone a gossip. WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT WORKING HERE.
bad,"Kohls is a horrible place to work for let alone to shop at. horrible pay, snappy barking managers, and no more than 20 hours a week.....who can live on 150 bucks a week?"
bad,Management does not value their employees.  Feels like they are out to get rid of a different person each day i worked there.  I am glad i o longer work for them and the season is over.
bad,"They work you like a dog, customers are complete jerks and you MUST cater to them. Minimum wage and you do maximum work. It's retail so what do you expect.  The best part...they take used stuff back, tag it and put it back on the sales floor. They make employees work on Thanksgiving Day. The only thing Kohls cares about is their bottom line. not you!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"You are just a body filling a space. Management doesn't care about the needs of the department heads, just the amount of credit cards are opened. The do not hire for quality."
bad,"Unfortunately, kohl’s is one of the worst places to work. I was denied full time benefits (while working full time hours) because I “took too long interacting with customers” instead of making the process speedy.Not only will you be worked to death and receive little to no compensations there are department leads who’s worked for 5-10 years and only make $9.75!!"
bad,Managed berry poorly did not support in anything. Did not like the administrative support either. The work did not consist in any of my attributes. Will not recommend to anyone.
bad,Kohls sucks from the managers coworkers and clientele. All they care about are credit card applications and the managers were constantly inappropriate with their employees
bad,"They never let me cashier. Was not paid enough. Too much work in the shift. The managers were unavailable, unhelpful, not supportive. The team members weren't nice and the amount of work was overwhelming."
bad,I wouldn’t Recommend working for this company because it has the worst management I have ever worked with. They won’t train you to in the department that your in correctly
bad,They were messing up the schedules and not holding their side of the deal with my off days and scheduled me for 6 am on a Friday when the sechedule came out that same Friday at 1pm
bad,"The company isn’t bad, but the district manager was horrible, Donely time you came into my store was to come see female associates which he will Google over."
bad,"Horrible management at my location. I took on a regional manger role when I was in an office manager role since the management  team was lazy. I knew how to improve scheduling and day-to-day operations, but no one would adapt; so I move on and got several call backs to reclaim the position after I left."
bad,The pay rate is terrible and the only time you'll get hours is during the holidays. Hours are slashed immediately after the holidays.  They do offer a good employee discount.
bad,They treat your hours horribly & the managers suck don’t work here even if it’s seasonal you won’t start getting hours till mid November happened to me twice each year
bad,"I didn't like working for kolh's .  I didn't get many hours and I felt unappreciated.   "
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work for this company it is one of the worst if not the worst company I have ever worked for!  The company looks out for itself and no one else! They are just horrible!
bad,"I am a seasonal employee. I heard people saying how much they love working there, so I applied and was hired. I hate it. The seasonal employees are nice but the permanent people are not. The pay stinks for the amount of work you have to do during the holiday season and I was cheated on my pay for Black Friday. The store is under staffed and is a mess. The ones who work are over worked and nothing is said to the people who shop during their shift. Glad I am quitting."
bad,I get worked once or twice a week for four hours each shift im out of high school and i need more hours than that the most I've made  in a paycheck was 78 dollars.
bad,Pay was little and points having to be 2 a day when customers never wanted that so you'll get fired if you didn't get them.strongly disagree on working here if you want a better job do a factory or work at walmart.
bad,The Kohl's location I worked at had a serious management issue. The Store Manager and Operations Manager really needa to be replaced. The only save grace were the department supervisors and fellow coworkers. Plus the hourly pay is totally laughable compared to all the stress and work that's dumped on you from the Store Manager and Operations Manger.
bad,Do not work here stay away from here very nasty employees who does acknowledge you it was a very bad and unhappy experience for me i am very upset how I was treated when I had an issue DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY they will make you do things that you do not want to do they force you to do things very hurt and upset by this company how i was treated as a seasonal associate!!!
bad,"kohl does not have good work ethics"
bad,I was hired in October as a seasonal retail associate and I’ve already quit. I experienced a very heavy work load especially on the afternoon/evening shift and management was very rude on this shift especially a manager by the name of Amber. They don’t even train you they just assign you with other associates that have just started working there as well then complain when you need their assistance with a customer! So not worth it!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Glad I finally quit. Management was awful. No training. Wicked store manager and lower management. They took credit for our sugestions and work. HR manager was a joke. She schelduled to suit her and not your availability. Total disrespect towards employees. They didn't care about anyone but themselves.
bad,"Don’t pay you on time. Thats if they pay you, I’m still waiting on my paycheck, Kohl’s doesn’t even know what happened to it."
bad,"Company does not treat their employees fairly. Over-worked, underpaid, and very unappreciated. Mangers are very childish. There discounts are whatever. Never any hours to give part time employees unless full time! So might want to have a second job if you have serious bills!"
bad,"wouldn’t recommend for a long term job... pay is not competitive at all. management is good. around the holiday time, that’s when things get really hectic"
bad,Don't work for them it doesn't benefit the employees just management. it a waste of time. even when doing over time I wouldn't recommend them to no one.
bad,Working for Khols was a terrible experience!!! Customers returned dirty clothing which we had to handle and put back to sell cheap. Customers can curse at us and do whatever they wanted and manager never took up for us.
bad,Management was awful the hours wasn't good the pay wasn't enough to live on for the amount of work that you had to do no over time no benefits it's not worth working for them it is a waste of time.
bad,"Only management get any health benefits, worked all weekends and holidays, low wage, managers promote only their friends. I would not recommend working there."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend it, unless it is temporary. They are usually understaffed, pushing solicitation of High interest credit cards every 5 minutes, and no training or advancement. Poor management and training."
bad,"They got rid of the best HR manager they ever hoped to have   The rest all liked to sit on their rears and try to run a 100,000 square foot store from their desk.  Raises at like 9 cents to 15 cents a year   If you lucky.  Management has a lot of internal bickering and no respect for employees who work the floor   "
bad,"For around 3 or 4 months Kohl’s was great and I was getting plenty of hours and learning everything that was inside the store. "
bad,My boss seriously was never actually at work. I would always have something to discuss with her and by the time she told me to come see her she would be gone for the day or on another vacation.
bad,"Terrible place to work, dont care about your effort or actual productivity. Managers sit around talking in the office and accomplish nothing while associates are over tasked and constantly hounded on their progress."
bad,Not worth it you will have to over work to get things done and they are unfair with your schedule and work hours. Management support is the worst and they give favoritism and fail to be fair with giving promotional positions to hard workers. Kohl's in Fairfield ct is not the best place to work I've been there for 6 years and never have seen such a place and many others that have been there 15 left and are happier.years are
bad,"They want you to have open availability then they only schedule you 4-5 hours a day and under 20 hours a week up until Thanksgiving. Then they give you 40 hours a week plus offer overtime from Thanksgiving until New Years."
bad,"they are unorganized and will always have a problem with their system . I do not like kohls. I do not like kohls they need to be restructured from Human resources, to the supervisors and managers, they are a mess."
bad,"If you had a family to take care of Kohl's is not the place to work at. They had me working twice a week when they lied and told me it was a daily position. I work one day for 4 hours from 6am to 10am, and next day from 6am to 2pm. The money and hours wasn't enough to pay monthly bills and to take care of my family. It was poor management at the location as well."
bad,This place is a joke. Telling part time people they'd be lucky to work 10 hours after holidays and only pay $9/hr. No you'd be lucky to keep me at $9/hr!
bad,This job is terrible work to hard for little money especially around holiday time it gets ridiculous there point system is a joke nobody cares about you long as your numbers good your more like a robot
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Less technology focus. Hard peers. Not so friendly env. Harsh people. 1Less technology focus. 2Hard peers. 1Not so friendly env. 1Harsh people. 2Less technology focus.1 Hard peers. 1Not so friendly env. 2Harsh people.
bad,"The Loss Prevention Manager shows blatant favoritism. If you are one of his favorites you can adjust your schedule, bump people from pre-approved time off and pretty much come and go as you please with little to no recourse. The manager will just instruct the supervisor to ""document it"" but will take no action against the associate whats so ever.  If you are not one of his favorites you're treated as an insurgent and he will actively try to fire you. Every mistake you make will be aggressively investigated, while his favorites can make fireable offensive almost daily and it is quickly swept under the rug. What makes the situation even worse is the manager is completely incompetent and has no idea how to actually do his job.  The job of loss prevention to catch theft's but the manager has employees spending most of their time completing google docs. The employees who point out his errors and give ideas on how to properly do things are the ones he doesn't like. If you're former/current law enforment he hates you the most. Since you know more about the law, and actually catching criminals than he ever will. You can't fully comprehend the manager's ineptitude until you work for him"
bad,"I spent over three years working as an Loss Prevention Associate Kohl's and while the first year was great, the last two years have been awful because of the Loss Prevention Manager that's currently there. The manager plays the favorites game with his employees and if he doesn't like you then you'll most likely be on your way out the door. Life is miserable there under the new LPM and I would recommend to anyone looking to work in Loss Prevention at this location to steer clear. If you don't get suck up to the LPM then he'll actively search for a way to fire you. The culture is toxic in general and it's one of constantly telling on your coworkers to make yourself look good. Kohl's prides itself on not being the highest paid company to work for but wants to be in the middle of the pack so don't expect a great hourly wage there."
bad,"You get hired in with them telling you we have a flexible schedule. Unless you have open availability you’re not really worked. You are taken advantage of and treated like garbage. Management all talk about their employees to other employees some stand at the front of the store and literally do nothing you wear what is called a wire and you are talked to like a slave/ dog. Most of the people there are rude there is "
bad,The managers were okay except one.. She had a ugly attitude and was real disrespectful.. Working there was okay but it’s was that one lady who messed everything up.
bad,"I definitely do not recommend anyone work for this company. I've worked here for a few  years and have seen employees that have worked here for years leave abruptly because their mental health was being affected because management is constantly berating you in front of coworkers&customers. They are only decent to you if you get them a lot of new credits,  that's all they care about.Most of the managers gossip about employees to other employees and tell personal business as to why 1 person was fired or had to take time off . The 1&only park that comes along with this job is the discount. Save yourself a lot of time and lost self confidence and do not apply here. They'll do nothing but bring you down. You can ask anyone who works there or has and I guarantee you they'll tell you the same thing."
bad,"Everyone should try retail for themselves. It was not for me. I was able to learn how to be a cashier, and learn how to count money as a first job. People can get rowdy because they want there coupons."
bad,It is laid back depending on where you work. There is always something to do. The pay is good for working part time but not for a full time position. The benefits are non existed.
bad,"I have no more words for this employer.they will hire you,and never give you hrs.but when ever you just decide to stop by. there are worker who are there literally everyday.theres a labor law for this .if we're supposed to be part time.then why are certain people getting full time hrs."
bad,"I knew more than management and was expected to do management level job when I was merely a customer service cashier. They refused to give me yearly reviews claiming, ""I was a part-timer and did not need such things."" I had informed them repeatedly that I wanted a full-time position which they refused many times."
bad,"Ok if your a student. Does not pay enouph to live on.low wages, no.incentives to stay. Was not a good fit for a truck driver and someone who worked in tbe woods"
bad,"I worked at Kohl's Corporate Office for a decade.  When I first started working there, it was like a normal workplace.  Managers acted like adults, they delegated tasks to trained employees, underlings did their job, everything was reasonable.  Near the end of my tenure there, and my reason for leaving, managers became friends with pet employees, no one could make a decision, no one wanted to claim responsibility for anything (unless it was a good thing and they were stealing credit), people were nasty and demanding, and I was expected to be working at all hours of the day and night, seven days a week."
bad,"My store has a very clique-defined management group whom you are either in line with or fired by.  Not only this, but management overworks anyone who they find the chance to with no regard for local or federal laws.  I've been a part-time associate who is indirectly refused meal-breaks (30 min) on 6+ hour shifts and regularly worked 40 hours."
bad,I believe that there are way to many managers and department leads and not enough employees. I also believe that the workload they expect you to maintain is not equivalent to the pay rate.  The hours vary so much from week to week that you can’t plan anything. One week you’ll work 4 hours and the next week you’ll be scheduled 35. There is not way that you could pay your bills off this job. It doesn’t pay enough and the hours are to irregular.
bad,"If your looking for a first job, kohl's is a great start. However the pay is not enough for the cost of living .  We would have to stay till 3 am during the holidays to put away clothes that customers would leave at the return desk. "
bad,Management isn’t fair. They don’t expect doctors notes for any missed days. You are expected to work holidays. During the holidays is very messy and you don’t have much help
bad,Bad management and they do not care about home life if your scheduled to be there you have to or you get a write up they suck period do not work there
bad,this is a place a decent but its not a place you wanna work year around its a place thats only seasonal with its hours  you end up being bored and with nothing to do
bad,The co-workers here are very nice to work with. The goal is to get a lot of Kohl'scredit cards. The atmosphere is kind of stressful. I am just glad I do not work here anymore.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"They dont care about you , "
bad,"Wow these guys are a piece of work. I got threatened to be thrown in jail by my manager because I used MY MOM'S Kohl's cash which she gave to me. NEVER EVER will return. I was treated like garbage and did my absolute best to make the managers happy, but nothing worked. They threatened our jobs all the time over the walkie talkies, so all your coworkers could hear. It's embarrassing! They made me stay until 2 AM one time on a school night. I quit soon after that."
bad,"Management is rude, unorganized, lazy & unprofessional. They always focus on the negative & will never acknowledge or appreciate you for going above & beyond. Oh, & if you ever need management’s help to resolve an issue don't even bother calling them because they won’t show up, they’ll be too busy sitting in the break room or hiding in their offices for their whole shift."
bad,This place was very unprofessionally and you had to do a lot of kissing up to get anywhere in the company. They would overpay you in bouns so they could come back and either take ur whole check or take from your check till they felt it was paid back. They didn't care about your family life. If it wasn't about kohls they didn't care. One time they didn't pay the warehouse workers for a whole month.
bad,At first it was cool then they took my commission and forced me to do things outside of my job description. I’m supposed to but next I’m line for the supervisor position but the new manager wants to hire is own team. I’ve worked here for 2 years. And I also find it funny that they fired all the managers of color and there hasn’t been one hired since. The customers treat you like garbage and so does corporate
bad,"They NEVER care about floor associates, if you were a cashier and you're getting credit then you'll quickly become a favorite. The current manager is horrible! Stays in the office 95% of the time, talking down to the floor associates and truck team; he has easily created a hostile work environment. Holding hours so him and the assistant manager can get paid extra for saving on payroll. There is no longer anything enjoyable about the job, it has become such a high school drama, clique based culture it is almost toxic. What I've learned overall is that this branch has no regards for its harder working employees and are out for themselves and themselves and their favorites alone."
bad,There was no training and the other employees were very rude at the facility I was working at. I have never worked at a place as hostile as the Kohl's I was at. The work was easy once you figured out what you were doing. Definitely not a professional work environment.
bad,I worked there 6 years and it was horrible! Management is so fake an far from professional! The big manager was intimate with his employees as well as the executive there! They pick on associates and bash associates to other associates! I’ve see management steal and when you report them you get fired! Don’t waste your time they are not nice people! Coworkers were amazing but the management is very twisted
bad,"Don’t work at Kohl’s if you plan to work full time, my acceptance letter said full time with a high right of pay and both changed when I started.....!"
bad,"Not enough employees, working the good employees way too much until they quit, minimum wage, felt totally disrespected. Loved the job, but had to work way too hard and too much for minimum wage! Never felt appreciated for the amount of time and effort I gave. Employees very unhappy!!"
bad,"I went in for an interview looking for an easy part time job for a little bit of extra money for the holidays. I was not expecting to find company to be so laughable. I had never shopped there before and I understand why now. The pay is abysmal, no benefits what so ever and expect you to work hard be a team player and just bend over whenever they feel like. The whole store was part time except for what seemed to be there 10 managers and 3 department leads."
bad,They are hateful and discriminate. They only want professionals working for a low wage here. You will waste your time unless you have a bachelor's degree. It's a joke. Haha apply anywhere else
bad,The managers at Kohls don't care about you as long as you come in to work. They didn't want to give me more than 10 hours a week and that was during holiday which sucks.
bad,"Was told I was hired for ""operations""...but, only ever ran the cash registers because of all the call offs all the time."
bad,Do not recommend they say false information. Are not about family horrible communication between management. Make it seem like such a great place to work but not after awhile.
bad,"Kohls in conyers management team is terrible. They treat you like you aren't a person, they don't give you time off, and they don't care about you at all"
bad,"They hired me as a sales associate, and after 3 months of working, they tried to turn me into a janitor. I guess cause i was hispanic and they thought to stereotype me... Who knows. Not cool."
bad,They expect a lot for little pay with no recognition unless you are the teachers pet. Fast paced and multi task and now they are doing Amazon returns . Wow
bad,Store manager and the assistant manager are both very rude and talks too everyone like they are trash and never scheduled me for the hours i wanted! They would tell you too do one thing and couple minutes later ask you why you havent cleaned out the fitting rooms or something else that you weren’t scheduled too do that day! I asked for weekends off due to not haveing a baby sitter and was told i could have weekends off because it wasnt fair too otger employees but both the store and assitant managers got the weekends off! And they both walked out with a blue bird in there hands one day when we were told that they couldnt leave the store!
bad,"If your looking for better job I would suggest working somewhere else , "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Management sat and bossed everyone else around while they sat and did nothing! You were only recognized if you met their credit quota for the day!! Claimed to give promotions within then hired outside sources.. terminated for things I didn't do, then was refused the PTO I had already earned over 3 years!!"
bad,"Let me tell you, I've worked here for 4 years and it's never gotten better. Only worse. The management is extremely aggressive and not understanding. Schedules will be changed on you without your consent. There's basically no opportunity for advancement, and no raises. The managers are constantly yelling at you if you can't get credits. It's always understaffed so you get yelled at for not being able to get everything done. This place absolutely sucks."
bad,"Trust me, I would not work again for this company if the offered me a bonus on top of salary.  This is the first retailer I worked for where they paid absolutely NO attention to their employees. You get the worst hours when you first start at Kohl's then, I think Loss prevention pays more attention to the employee's actions therefore missing all the stealing going on by customer's.  Smh...."
bad,"Our hands were tied by friendships between associates and HR. Management wasn’t at all supportive, and did nothing to help us grow as managers. Horrible horrible horrible"
bad,"If you work the stockroom, they'll try and rope you in to also doing everything else in the store for the lesser end of minimum wage and never promote anyone good for a position."
bad,I felt stagnant the whole time I was working there. Just grew to despise the company. Being cooped up in a square area for 8 hours doesn't really raise moral or give your life meaning. Some might like it. I did not
bad,"The store management team at my store location, despite the LP side being separate from the store side, was horrible. They actively made it hard for me to do my job and regularly cost me apprehensions due to sheer laziness. They were more interested in sitting in the office and gossiping about every person who worked there. If they did have to come out and do actual work they were rude, not only to customers, but to employees also. The supervisors in that location did all the actual work and tried but they had little direction or feedback unless it was rudely directed to them. The regular store associates were amazing though. I feel like once I had trained them on what exactly it was that I needed and took the time to respect them, that they would have done anything I needed. The store associates were total MVPs."
bad,I was hired as a Sales Associate at the Altoona location and prior to working here I had over 8 years of retail experience along with management experience as well. I was treated poorly by management and the other associates expect for several would hardly ever help me when I was new and had questions. I was yelled at when I made a mistake or didn’t pick up on a task right away. I wouldnt recommend to work here at all.
bad,"the store i work at is terrible. awful management. never takes responsibility for their own actions, always has an excuse and make us run around like slaves while getting paid bare minimum. most associates are lazy and the ones that are not, never get recognized. made to work shifts we do"
bad,"If I was able to give 0 stars I would. Employees are nice and friendly, but the management is poor. Nothing ever gets done on time and properly. No one ever leaves on time. Though some employees work very slow paced but no one gets help either. People are always calling out and one manager will give an employee 2-3 departments to do but they expect you to be out and everything done by  their time. Not all the managers but some will see  you struggle but try to seem very busy to even bother help you. This is a place I wouldn't recommend to work anyone. If you're trying to get a summer job and leave after its perfect but everything about it is just  bad."
bad,This job is horrible . The managers would flirt with the cashiers and other workers on the floor. Everyone would talk about each other and it was just a bunch of drama.
bad,"Working up to 8hrs with no breaks, working at the desk alone and when you ask for help to get lines down you stood a good chance if not getting the help."
bad,"Shreveport location is horrible. Favoritism and all. They don't work together or stick together I HATE I worked there. Everyone is out to get someone in trouble, do not want to see the next make it."
bad,An awful place to work filled with self-righteous customers and a completely incompetent management team. The environment was constantly reminiscent of high school.
bad,I have worked with Kohls 10+ years as a department supervisor.  There is no advancement after becoming a department supervisor. We have a fairly young manager after going thru 4 managers. He tends to hang with the younger girls at my store and they seem to get all the extra training. You can not bring any issues up to him as there is always an excuse for it.  Pay rate is terrible and then they try to push you to do more and more. I imagine alot of places are like this though. Shooting for retirement soon
bad,I started when the Beauty had just had big changes. There were two full time Beauty associates. I was treated in begining with respect and as I was the lead in Dept. First seminar was amazing. Other fulltime girl got let go due to call outs and being late. So It was just me for a while. I had no trouble. I have 30 yrs retail exp. Retail management exp. For 5 top retail companies. I found out at one point with my exp. I should have been hired. At a higher pay rate. We did at that time have incentive made over $ 1000 at Christmas.  Went through many part timers call outs late. I basically did everything in department.
bad,"awful pay. awful management. not entirely the store manager, but corporate forces stores to stick to a payroll too low to pay even the underpaid staff and fill up the store with help. every day is stressful and pointless."
bad,"During my time there I was given an additional department without a pay raise, additional staff support and I was never asked if I wanted an additional department, I was told that this was now also my department."
bad,"Most stressful job to be part time. Bad management, can never have enough people working cannot hire enough people. Employees always walk out or leave due to bad management & underpaid. Never have a weekend off. Overworks their employees. Never got a pay raise."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,The demand for apprehensions is too high for the traffic the stores get. The lack of actual help is ridiculous and no understanding of what officers actually do. They pin officers against each other and belittle the managers. It’s by far the worst company to work for in ANY position.
bad,"Like my title implies, this was the absolute WORST JOB I ever had, and I emphasize the word job. This is not a place you can have a career in. I worked for their LP department. This job is better suited for people with absolutely no experience in the industry. They start off paying little to no money for your experience, education, training, or industry knowledge. I was told, ""It is not in the budget"", and was offered chump change. The pay starts at $13.50 an hour, and goes upwards of $25.00 per hour. (Don't get your hopes up., The guy making $25.00 per hour, has been with Kohls for over 20 + years)"
bad,"I worked here for a short 3 months and it was awful. there was a certain manager who though she was the GM and treated everyone unfairly , and they wonder why they’re always hiring"
bad,Upper management does not care about hourly employees wellbeing or work life balance. They wouldn’t let me take Thanksgiving off even though it was the first one after my grandfathers passing. I was even fired on my last day.
bad,This company has a lot to work with or maybe they need new management. The managers that I had in my store had a lot of favoritism. I got really low hours. I had two get a SECOND JOB WHILE WORKING AT KOHLS.
bad,I worked there as a seasonal worker for the holidays.  They paid only $7.50 an hour an expected you to bust your but.  The main thing that they were concerned about was how many people you could get to sign up for a Kohl's charge.  Not a good experience.
bad,"This place only cares about themselves. If you’re sick they still expect you to work, favoritism, and hours aren’t consistent. They do not like constructive criticism. Day to day equipment barely works. Management is very lazy."
bad,"I overall had a terrible time working at Kohl's I found they do not care about their employees well being and are too worried about the store itself. I received a phone call that my mother was in the hospital and my boss would not let my roommate and I leave to go to the hospital because ""who is going to close your areas then?"" absolutely horrific place for my mental health and I do not regret leaving at all."
bad,working 6 pm to 6 am was one of the worst experiences I've had at a job. This job gives you no social interactions with customers and you were stuck In kohl's for 12 hours with one of two other people
bad,"Never give you a steady days."
bad,"Horrible management, pay, hours, and no benefits at all for part time employees. Favoritism is at an all time high at this company as well. Hopefully they will wake up and start treating there employees better"
bad,"They give you a lot of hours when you are first hired and during Christmas season. After Christmas, it is like the Sahara Desert, one week you will have 7 hours the next, maybe 20 if you are lucky. It's either feast or famine. Management is awful and unprofessional. I would like to say that they are on separate pages, but that is being kind, they are in different books. They try to mess with your breaks (which is illegal) and never say good job or thank you to the people that work their butts off/ stay past their shift to finish the truck. The one thing they all care about is numbers. The store runs on credit, credit, credit. If you have any self respect or care about someone who is thinking about applying tell them not to. This is coming from someone who wasted three years with this company and whose soul has gotten sucked out of them. "
bad,"Majority of the coworkers I was with ,were not really friendly or helpful. Especially the supervisors I had there and management. They did not treat employees fair and always kept us under the ladder."
bad,"Want an existential crisis, extreme boredom and to get bossed around by some clown that's on the same pay grade as you? Work at Quincy, Illinois Kohl's! I hope not all Kohl's locations are like this one. It's like the right hand doesn't know what the left one's doing, and I have a feeling the left hand made it's way to the hind quarters, if you catch my drift. The store manager was the most milquetoast man I've ever met in my life. He let customers and employees alike just trample him underfoot. Some people I guess try to compensate for this by being incredibly bossy, even people who were on the same pay grade that I was. Don't waste your time. I'm sorry I wasted so much of mine."
bad,"We were understaffed, poorly managed, and not organized. One of my managers came in so intoxicated she passed out in the back stock area. The GM of the store would stare at female cashiers while they worked."
bad,"I hated working at kohls, it was a terrible job led by terrible management. I have not stepped foot into a kohls since I left there, and never will again. And the stupidest thing is they make you sign up for a kohls card when you work there! So stupid"
bad,"The schedule was unwavering, there was no flexibility at all. As a high school student, this employer had no consideration for my school time,which is why I resigned so quickly after being hired."
bad,Horrible place to work for unless you love being stressed out every single time you work. They give you tasks to do that are literally impossible if you don't complete them they treat you horrible. Way too many managers and they all say something different so you never know who to listen to. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH 9.25
bad,"Very very poor management, did not train me, yelled at most employees in front of customers to the point customers were complaining about it. Hours were not flexible at all."
bad,"I did not stay there too long, always understaffed, people were coming and going, nobody were staying there more than 1 month. Overall is a good place for a student to get some money working over the summmer"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Horrible, racist, Managment, no support. Showed favoritism towards certain employees............. stressful environment, misleading during interview process......."
bad,It just got worse and worse it’s not even good as a part time job complete waste of time just go apply at target please. The pay is absolute garbage and the Head 3 managers have no idea what they’re doing the two  newest managers ran all of us off. Don’t even waste your time to do the application.
bad,Management plays favorites and managers are promoted for no apparent reason I think it has to do with people pleasing if you catch my drift $0.25 a year is not much of a raise especially if you've been there for a long time it's not a job where you get a lot of accomplishments work can be boring and routine
bad,"Slow work place."
bad,"Providing customers with excellent service. Cleaning out fitting rooms, and helping the cash registers. Hardest part of my job is when a customer isn't happy, the most wonderful part is helping my customers."
bad,Their peak season was barely anything to blink at. Was promised work through 3 months but barely had work for 3 full weeks of work. The only way you advance is hy staying there forever.
bad,"Kohls overall felt like an ok job, wished I had a better management team. Did not allow me to grow as a person. I learned how to be in charge of departments as well as to be in charge of the cash at the end of the night."
bad,Kohls Credit and Customer service RMO is a very stressful work environment employees are treated like robots and have no room to grow.You are given goals and tasks that management know you can't meet and if you can't meet those goals you are treated like you don't matter and then terminated mandatory over time limits on bathroom breaks unless you have a doctor's excuse.They will burn you out and terminate you when they feel they have used you enough.
bad,"Poorly managed, dirty, and underpaid.  If you're looking for a job that expects you to do everything under the sun without training you to do any of it and then pay you minimum wage and give you eight hours a week,this is the place to go to."
bad,"Worst place to ever work, they do not care about there employees just push to make themselves look good. Management is so Low Level Educated. I have nothing positive to say about Kohls."
bad,"I was not appreciated at this job, no matter how hard you worked. The store manager did not notice and treated everyone horrible.There was always extremely high turn over rate."
bad,How you can pay a person only $7.50 an hour and then require them to work a 50 hour week is just evil. No benefits and the discount was not worth the time spent
bad,"The only way you can advance in the company is by kissing the managers behind, they don't reward hard work. Nothing was to difficult to get used to. Easy job just terrible management at the Kohl's in Roseville"
bad,"Do you enjoy being treated like a piece of trash? Do you enjoy being sexually harassed with the perpetrator having no consequence because the store manager is good friends with the perpetrator? Do you enjoy having your hours randomly changed with literally no notice so you end up showing ""late"" for a shift you technically were on time for? Do you enjoy your overnight manager making racist jokes and talking about castrating people while you eat during your break? Do you enjoy having a store manager that will do literally nothing when employees bring up serious issues, and then continuously lie in your face about it? Then Kohl's is the place for you."
bad,The people were extremely rude there and tried to always tell me I should leave. They didn’t like me. I was in school and they tried to schedule me when I had to go.
bad,You don’t get training and then get argued with when you ask for help. You get put on a register with another new associate to try and figure things out yourselves.
bad,Low pay and there’s no room to grow there. Very poor management. They don’t care about their employees. If you’re not willing to suck up you won’t get anywhere there.
bad,"Just like most retail jobs these day you are given ridiculous days and hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Don’t waste your time at this location. Tinley Park management is absolutely awful. They will watch you struggle on the registers and not offer help. They will never give you hours either. Never enough people scheduled on the weekends. The misses lead will not help you zone or work the fitting rooms if your in the WJM fitting rooms by yourself. The fitting rooms are impossible to accomplish when by yourself when you also have to help on registers All around a poorly managed store. Save your time and go to a better location if you are considering working at Kohl’s.
bad,This is a position for young teens in school looking for a few bucks in they're pockets. I was looking for a 2nd job part time btw 20 to 30 hrs a wk early mornings. I worked a total of 16 hrs in two wk. Both my checks were $35. What am i suppose to do with that? I spent more money commuting there. To make it worse i haven't been on the schedule to work for the last 2 wks and haven't heard anything from Management on when my next days to work. The training method is horrible and all they cared about is getting ppl to apply for it's charge card. It's so bad they even went to employees to ask them to apply just so they could reach the store goal for the day or week. I never called or went back. I already had other job offers on the table. Don't waste your time!!!!!!
bad,"What I learned through this company is that not every company is as fair and positive as they say. One has to understand that yes, work is a competitive field. But when one proves to be above and beyond in the work field- they are not always treated or recognized as one would hope. A typical day for me in this workplace was viewed as a ""lower"" positioned employee and not given enough credit regardless of my visible, above and beyond stand out in the field."
bad,"Non-engaging management team.  Internal conflict amongest management team.  Poor training .....Kohl's will ""hire anyone that has a pulse and can fog up a mirror"" to meet the hiring demands of the holiday season."
bad,People were always calling in sick.You had to do way more then one department.Managers were always petty and there was favoritisms.They don't care if your a student.They'll make a schedule based on when they need you and not when your available .
bad,I didn't like it. The company treated their employees poorly and I am glad it finally came to an end. I deserve better than this. I will never work for a retail company again.
bad,"Managers are all rude and not nice at all. Way too much gossip. Not a friendly environment. Understaffed most days, customers would complain and I couldn't do anything because the managers did not care. Managers always made you feel stupid and not good."
bad,"constant budget cuts, dying company, cut hours often, management is horrible and disorganized. everyone is always stressed and upset, very clicky workforce."
bad,Kholes  was very stress full poor management not very positive or friendly very little teamwork short breaks poor communication from management poor salary.
bad,"Horrible experience, I was a college student taking 6 classes per semester and I gave them my schedule, yet they still scheduled me while I was attending classes. They schedule too many people at once or not enough, each day was different. I either had nothing to do or had too much work load for one person."
bad,They overworked the employees and don’t pay nothing they fired the employees for nothing when they go over payroll budget you work by yourself in the floor and they want you to do millions of things at once and the managers and supervisor always are in the office never help their  employees.
bad,"Working at Kohl's specifically Gateway Portland, had the worst management I've ever had to deal with. The supervisors would ridicule us and not help if say a customer had a question or we needed cash for our drawer unless we got a credit first. They would keep us overtime past our shift end time (off the clock) until we got our daily credit. For me, it was hard because they would never let me on the registers to be able to even get credit. And the manager themselves was a hard person to deal with. I had asked for a store transfer to another location that was closer to home and my school. I was in contact with the other store manager and he was very nice about things and kept me updated on everything. When I had gone to my store manager, they would always come back saying the ""he's on vacation"" ""he'll get back to me this day"" ""I haven't heard back yet"" till finally, she said ""He doesn't have any room in his store"" meanwhile, the other store manager told me that they had not once contacted him about anything. Another thing that was set up poorly is the hours. I was working part-time, having to pay bills and go to school. I needed the hours and as many as I could have. My store would only give me 4-5 hours a week. I would tell them that I needed more hours and they would bump me up to 20 hours one week then it was back to 4 hours the next. Shortly before I quit, I learned that Kohl's bases your hours off of how much credit you solicited."
bad,"I applied to be in the Truck/ Stock position yet they place me in different departments or on cash registers which I hate. That is not what I applied for. The manager is nosy, she is always in my business. She is rude and is forceful when I am on the registers."
bad,"Managers are rude and have no idea how to run a store. I was yelled at on my first day because of something someone else did. I was the one getting I  trouble for EVERYTHING other people did even on my days off. Pay was awful, barely 11 an hour when you need closer to 24 to actually live in the city I'm in."
bad,"i would not recommend anyone to work for this company. they give me one 5 hour day a week. i can't even pay my bills with that i have see so many people come and go. most people just walk out and never come back i can't blame them. i have worked in retail for awhile now i have worked with better managers then this store has. one thing i have leaned is to never to work for kohls. the hardest part of the job was coming in for my 5 hour shift. its a waste of time coming in for only 5 hours."
bad,"They expect you to do the work of more than one person, but you don't get compensated for it. If you are not full time there are no benefits and no raises to speak of."
bad,Terrible place to work in flagstaff store   Like working for hitler  broke blood vessels in right foot running all over so much An still not good enough for those jerks
bad,Working at Kohl's was great at first got lots of hours and met some wonderful people. However the management team is horrible they always talk down to employees below them on the totem pole. Absolutely awful people skills when it comes to handling employees and treat them like they are less than. I will never recommend this job to anyone save yourself the stress it's not worth it especially at the Walpole location.
bad,"Kohls is a place you go to work if you want to get paid nothing, go nowhere and be nothing, now as a young person starting out part time or full time its fine beyond that it is not a career."
bad,"We had a great store manager, and then he left and got replaced.... worst thing to ever happen to the store."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of cashing out customers at point of sale, and folding clothes in the meantime while trying to get customers to sign up for the Kohl's credit card. I learned how to properly fold clothes and work a cash register. Management needed a lot of improvement. It seemed like everyone who worked there hated life. The culture was terrible, there was absolutely no motivation. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet the company's credit goals given that not everyone wants to sign up for a credit card. There was not anything enjoyable about the job for me."
bad,"As an adult it is nothing but a smack in the face to work here. You work your butt off for a piece of candy. Not to mention the holidays that you have to work or you will get fired,"
bad,"I honestly didnt like the job. The only good thing that came from it was some register experience, good friends, and some good customers.  I wasnt working frequently, id go from working 2 days a week to 5 days a week, to no weeks to full weeks."
bad,"They expect you to kill yourself with little to no monetary gain.  Career  development is a joke. You literally get pennies for annual raises.  Very much a ""what have you done for me lately company""."
bad,Don't know too much about this company and I had no experience working in the retail or department store before.  I only worked for the seasonal job around Christmas season.
bad,"At the Kohl's I was working at, there was terrible communication between management and employees. Also, we had ridiculously high credit card sale goals that we could never meet. Employees had to borderline scam people into applying for a credit card. It made me feel like a horrible human."
bad,"management incompetence,  no "
bad,The management hours and pay were the problem at Kohls.  They lost a lot of good people that went on to be successful at other workplaces.  They could make a better workplace  if they would listen to their workers.
bad,"The managers are unfriendly and treat their employees rude and meanly. The environment at Kohls in Salem is cold, filled with drama and not fun. The associates are friendly, caring and eager to help any customers that come in."
bad,Been there for a few years now. very stressful and management wants more out of workers then what we get paid for. don't recommend the job and work at Kohls.
bad,Ten and twelve hour shifts on hard concrete floors are not too great for anyone's bodies. The hours are up and down during different times of the year.
bad,"Started off great but seemed like they played favorites, promoted only women in a predominantly women field yet the men always got all the heavy lifting assignments yet women had to do them too.  Women get help provided at all times but men just have to endure it.  Meanwhile, supervisors take longer breaks than they are supposed to making others go without because of lack of floor coverage yet they talk bs behind your back.  Was called slow by another manager when I asked about the kiosk, and a supervisor complained to me about how much stuff we were getting on truck and how I was placing it in the stockroom with minimal help."
bad,The manager was rude and unprofessional. When you ask about receiving more hours I lost hours. Was nice when my son was younger they do have toddlers clothes at a fair price.
bad,the management at the kohls i worked at was very very poor. the managers talked dow to the part time employees. the pay was never enough and they didnt give me the amount of hours they ppromised when i was hired.
bad,"Can't speak for other locations but the one in fresh meadows is a disaster. From all the condescending managers to the hazardous work environment you should only consider working here if it is a last option and you're desperate for a job, other than that i advise you look somewhere else."
bad,"Horrible place, not happy with the managment people you guys chose. Need to do better picking. The people underneath managment there, are straight forward but they lack communication, being helpful, and just overall I was unhappy with this place."
bad,"kohls is like any retail store, it not the best job but you pick up skills as you go. they over work you and under pay you but hey thats just retail, so suck it up"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I worked there for a month and I had to quit. This was over the summer. My job was to “shop for other customers” and find items and pack them and sent it to the customers. The store in media is so unorganized and it makes the job so much more stressful. I literally spent an hour trying to find one green shirt and I ended up on the floor of a stockroom crying because I couldn’t find it and I was tired of looking. I would get scrutinized if I took too long to find something. Some of the staff are very friendly but the managers are not the nicest. They would often move me around to different positions without asking me or even training me in those positions. Then, they stopped giving me hours. I wasn’t getting hours for weeks and weeks at a time. At that point I had no choice but to quit. If you’re going to work for Kohl’s, don’t work for the one in Media PA."
bad,"This was the worst company I've ever worked for. You were never supported with the right tools to get the job done but expected to figure it out. Seriously, just don't."
bad,"Like any retail places, it can get pretty boring, how it does get pretty busy during the holiday and a little bit after the holiday. I felt I was kinda well trained, they didn't throw me in a station out of the blue and not knowing what to do. Management has to be the worst. Honestly, I would recommend getting a 2nd job or you will die of starvation, they hired way too many people during the Seasonal and that will also effect your hours a lot.  Also unless if you have a friend or a family member who way loved by the managers or you get a lot of people to sign up for Kohls credit, then you won't get the hours you need or get kept after the seasonal."
bad,Management was awful. Would not work here ever again. There are decent times breaks. The discount isn’t very good considering how much this company makes and should be rewarding employees.
bad,A customer came in and yelled at me for something i didn’t know how to do because i was still training i told him to calm down he proceeded to yell at me then i called my manger and she solved the problem but i got in trouble for it
bad,the company gave me no hours and even when i request they still didnt give them to me.  They had me schdueled every two weeks and i think thats ridicoulous and shouldn't be called work.
bad,i worked for them a long time ago. management not friendly schedules not flexible awful employees  was treated unfairly. i was threatened by another employee took it to a coorprate level and nothing was done about it.
bad,"Hard work, no guidance, too flourescent, no where to put an over abundance of stock, no one knows what to do with the overstock so it sits in piles in the back rooms"
bad,"Not even ok for a student. The pay is horrible and so are the hours. The schedule is inconsistent, the breaks are to short. You get no time for lunch if they do make you do overtime during holiday season."
bad,"Management was the most UNPROFESSIONAL and UNORGANIZED set of people I have ever ran across in ALL my years in the work force!!! They treat seasonal workers with NO RESPECT!! I would NOT recommend this place for employment to anyone!! Troy, Ohio kohl's awful place to work!!!!"
bad,"The management treat rudely the workers. They use them as much as they can and pay very low. Once they dont need you more they will find any reason to fired you and treat you like you are thief and horrible person. "
bad,Honestly I wouldn't recommend working here. Typical day at work is you get to the register and start getting harassed by upper management to get new credit card applications made from customers and if you don't then they cut your hours.
bad,"The managers there have no respect for how you feel or your schedule, they will schedule you for hours you’ve mentioned you cannot work multiple times just to cover their schedules"
bad,"I worked here for literally two days. First of all, the staff here is uneducated, old, and ridiculous. They’re very unprofessional. I got the door slammed in my face the first day I worked here because the lady didn’t know that I was here to work. (I was early). NO ONE trained me. I sat on the floor dusting stuff. A customer asked me a question and i said to go to some where else because I couldn’t even answer the question. They also STILL haven’t paid me. I quit back in October and they still have yet to pay me for my unnecessary time there. I quit and they tried to terminate me too. Like what? As Kohl’s for a company, they are probably great to work for. I felt the pay was fair and the benefits were  mediocre. As a store to work at, this one is a joke. It is also full of old people cliques. My first day only two people said hi or introduced themselves."
bad,It is a department store my first and my last one i will never go back because there is favoritism and the most popular people get the hours not for me
bad,"Management does not treat employees well. Very hostile, publicly reprimand employees. Store manager does not know how to respect his employees. Shifts are always on light coverage so you are running around the store trying to help all the customers. Very high turnover."
bad,I am a new hire and have worked in retail in the past. For training Kohl’s management just gives you a book for cashier training and expects you to learn as you go. Then shadow a cashier. When management didn’t tell you that you needed to do that. The management doesn’t train you. Then management expects you to know everything when you haven’t really been taught anything. I’ve worked at the store for months and still don’t even know who the head store manager is. Since they haven’t really introduced themselves. Along with all of the other managers. Then they expect you to know who they are. Training at Kohl’s is poor.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Poor management and unfriendly staff."
bad,Kohls is a more of a place for an entry level job seeker still in high school. It just wasn't a job for me. Of course I saw the few ritual customers that were just so ecstatic  about life that I had really enjoyed short conversations with. But the employees were inconsiderate and management was lacking structure. The last week I worked at Kohls I was scheduled for 4 hrs. I begged for more hrs but the seasonal workers got majority of the hours. So I found a better opportunity elsewhere.
bad,"I’ve been employed with them for at least a month and have worked maybe 10 times, I get 4 hours a week 8 hours if I’m lucky, the management is terrible, they ask me to do tasks that have absolutely nothing to do with Kohl’s, currently looking for another job"
bad,Had to change signage for half the store as the other 5 of 7 works wouldn't do anything but screw around all night. Was constantly blamed for signage errors that were caused by working coming in and moving merchandise after signs had been changed. They never moved the signs. Eventually had to tell a supervisor to stop messing up my signs and do their job right. Issue was solved after that.
bad,I am a hard worker and wanted hours and even after asking for more hours I hardly received any and some weeks I would only be scheduled for 4 hours for the week. The management is the worst! They do not care and do not show any appreciation for what their associates do. The pay is pathetic and I hope and pray that you do not have to work black Friday here because the management could not be any worse when it comes to the treatment of their employees. It isn't worth the employee discount the mistreatment you will receive when working here.
bad,"Terrible management who cared very little for workers. You could work there for 10 years and still be stuck to a register. No room for advancement - same small circle of management are the only ones who get promoted. No training, everything is self-taught here, down to the customer service. No order of operations whatsoever and customers get to do whatever they want. The store is literally always a mess and management has no consideration for workers and the work environment they're in. Only good thing is there's lots of things to do and if you really try, you can get a decent amount of hours and very decent pay and there's opportunity to learn a lot. But found myself doing supervisor and assistant manager work but never got recognized or compensated for it. Great for someone out of high school but in the long run don't get committed. And definitely don't get a credit card."
bad,"management acts like high schoolers, talk behind employees backs, start rumors, etc. they treat employees poorly, make sure they let you know who is boss by making you feel like a piece of garbage."
bad,Would not reccomended ever working for kohls. They do not care about anything. Many people call out and work you way to much. I will not be working there again.
bad,"A typical day at work becomes a daily supervisory occurrence.  I've learned that the retail industry has changed in many ways.  Management scrutinizes all their employees to where you wonder why you were hired.  The workplace culture seems indifferent and you begin to question whether or not your employer supports you and stands behind you as a valued employee.  The hardest part of the job is remaining 'Optimistic' in lieu of the atmosphere which can at times, feel emotionally overburdening due to the store climate. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and greeting perspective clients/customers and ensuring that their shopping day has proved to be an enjoyable experience for them."
bad,"So I got officially hired at Kohls and went and did orientation. After the first day of the job I didn't get a schedule. They literally forgot I existed. For some reason I couldn't reach them through their number. I wasn't fired or anything, not sure what happened."
bad,Absolutely worst management I have ever worked for. Horrible attitudes from most managers. Made it miserable to work in such a nice store. You would have 25-40hrs one week then 6hrs the next week. 5 min training for all jobs.
bad,"Management Needs Leadership classes from outside of Kohl's, management favors their favorites, they are not fair in how hours are given and it is not by seniority, and they are very big on pushing credit cards on sales associates to get customers to sign up.  No real OTJ training, A lot of self-training, lack of management knowing what they are doing.No real inclusion or diversity. Only if you are gay or lesbian or Hispanic."
bad,"Horrible company to work for.  Management creates a very hostile work environment. Work expectations change depending on who is managing that day. Support is no given when needed.  Customers are treated rudely by management.  Workers are belittled and chastised for asking questions.  Given just enough hours to not qualify for breaks- ex.  schedules 6 - 9 pm, 3 hrs, so you don't get  break (working 4 hrs entitles you to  break. Special treatment is given to favored employees- more hrs, special projects.  Fraternization between employees- staff who are married, manager-to-employee dating (violation of company policy)."
bad,"They treat their employees as slaves, do not follow any kind of human right, very uneducated staff. It is like a nightmare to work at this company, will never recommend anyone to go."
bad,The management was kind of rude and made you feel dumb if you asked a question or for help. The schedule was all over the place and they had an online schedule and a paper schedule and they never matched.
bad,Overall they promisebyou one thing and do another. I bust my burg always doing over time and go over top. When it came to me going back school they weren’t having it
bad,"The dallas call center sucks. This is a job you take cause you don't have one but you will be looking shortly for surgery job once hired on. The management sucks, they don't follow they're own mission, the integrity of the company is is sad. I would not advise anyone to work for this organization unless it was the last place to work even then I would still consider other options. The only place I know that management looks for things to get you fired. They have nothing but time. They show favortism and especially not a professional place to work."
bad,Worst place to work ever! Management does not care about work/family/life balance. They play favorites with employees and they screw over long time employees.
bad,that’s all i have to say about it. the people were awful to work with and it was a very dirty store. i got yelled at on a regular basis for no reason and i never even got training. worst month of my life
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"store manager was very rude all the time, and wasn't not willing to cooperate with employees, even if they have worked there for years. very discouraging job environment ."
bad,A typical work day i would just punch is and go straight to the sales floor. on my first day there the manager told me to shut up because i 100% sure on what to do because i was new. i lean how to deal with mean employees. management was terrible. the workplace was slow. hardest part of the job was the managers/employees you always felt out of place because nobody will talk to you or help. I didn't enjoy anything
bad,"Super unorganized and understaffed.  The place is always a mess and when asking for assistance, workload is increased.  Very high turnover rate.  Just seemed too unorqngized and wasn’t run very professionally."
bad,"you can learn alot about selling credit to customers and dealing with people working a cash register "
bad,"Kohls in Conyers is awful. The managers there are very disrespectful and petty. They micromanage you every chance they get. They demand that you stay late even when you can't. They would rather put the work load on you rather than hire someone to assist you or ask some of there other 100 associates to help you. The store is always a hot mess because they do not ever have anyone on the floor to keep it recovered. The pay is low and you barely get raises maybe $0.10 a yr. This location has cliques and they show favoritism to the ones that they like, but if they don't like you then they treat you bad."
bad,"The only good thing about working here is having a few good coworkers. Management is completely horrific to employees and base hours on favoritism. Promotions are often lost due to store manager's bully-like business acumen. Hours are almost non-existent and often times, most receive 4-8 weekly. Good job if you don't mind being attacked by hour-hungry associates or unprofessional leadership. Loss prevention spends most of their day looking for any and all minor offenses committed by associates. Turnover rate is obnoxiously high. This company does not like to have associates with any outside obligations and will ensure a hostile environment if elderly, parent or elderly. Upper management will verbally abuse hourly associates when in building and will have you written up over anything they find. Do not recommend this job for anyone let alone shopping here."
bad,I've been at kohl for a year and got an 11 cent raise im currently pregnant and have been subjected to non appropriate circumstances resulting in an ER visit there always understaffed and no one ever gets lunch or brakes on time plus theirs rarely ever air conditioning so we are always hot and have miserable customers
bad,A lot of managers went threw this company once you got to know rules by one another one came along with a whole action plan honestly it wouldn't have been so bad if management didn't change what seem to be every 3 months. On top of that the store was always a mess not enough employees to keep up with the demand.
bad,I got no hours I had to work only one day a week and then management was horrible all you do is push you to sell credit card and when you didn’t deviate why didn’t you sell it in the stand over you and watch you and also they don’t help with closing most of the managers tell you were stuck need to go when they can put it up themselves the brakes were so small it was always hot in the store and when it says that you would close you’d be there like 30 minutes after
bad,"Underpaid people for the work you, often stressful but it was a job, very hard working, HR department were real rude and were not willing to help you out with a work related situation"
bad,"Not a good place to work at. Leads to a stressful day and the hardest part is having enough patience to deal with cranky people, whether they are customers or management. Lack of support system from management, low non-competitive pay, and do not expect any type of advancement or raises. Only apply to work here if there is no other option for you."
bad,Overall I didn't enjoy Kohl's. My management was annoying aswell as my coworkers. Also I was not paid enough for the many jobs they had me do. No overtime was provided to me even when I desperately needed it.
bad,"When I was hired, I was promised 25 hours per week.  Within the first two weeks, I was only assigned 13 to 18 hours per week.  I had to quit tp get more hours.  Also, the manager of cashiers was very hard to work for.  Constantly in your ear about credit cards, etc.  It was very stressful."
bad,The management and store security where always watching the employees for theft.  Made working there very unpleasant.  coupons were very stricked..  Would not recommend Kohl's as a place for employment.
bad,"Do not apply here.  The pay doesn't reflect the amount of work the diligent employees put in. Management is horrible at this location, they are not team players, usually stay in the office area and don't offer assistance. They cut your hours in retaliation, and do not give hard working employees a decent amount of hours to begin with. The store is understaffed leaving the few same people to take on a heavy work load every shift. There is no room for growth here, promotions are very seldom."
bad,"If you plan on working seasonally for Khol's I wouldn't really suggest it unless you're a high school student looking for work experience in the ""Real World"". Khol's don't teach you anything new except you can develop great communication skills or customer service skills on your own."
bad,there was a lot of pressure to sell credit. you had to hound everyone who came threw your line to make a purchase and ask them if they wanted to apply for a credit card
bad,This company was one of the worst I have worked for. They did not treat the temporary/part time employees very well. Did not set us up to succeed. I would not work here again.
bad,"didn't like the job, company didn't care if you came in to work, people are weird, very boring. rather talk to customers. very organized tho, honestly"
bad,"No comment , job needs more management that willing works with their employees and understand them. Need to give lockers to employees, and lunch need to be longer"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"your first 90 days are easy they make you feel welcomed, but after your 90 days are up you are forced to make people sign up for the store credit card and if you don't meet the 5 a day you start to lose hours"
bad,Management threatened to fire me right after I came back from medical leave and then hounded me about it for weeks after. I reminded her it was illegal to do so but it didn't stop so I quit
bad,"I was so happy to get this job but then management ruined it. First they begin with a group interview, always a bad thing. Then they throw you on the register with all of these discounts after little training. They tell you to ask other employees for help, who are all wanting to stay after the holidays and are not above giving you wrong information. This happened to me and I caught her doing it. I had an appointment to see the doctor and appointment ran a bit over and they counted it against me even with an excuse from the doctor. If you think that great customer service, work habits, and expertise will get you anywhere at Kohl's, think again. Whether or not you stay is  based on credit openings. They have high turnover, the only employees whose job's are safe: managers and supervisors. Did I mention lowest pay ever?"
bad,Almost all  I did was recovery and I did not like it at all.  I wanted to help the customers and that was not allowed.  Being at Kohl's showed me that for any future job I need to interact with people. The most enjoyable part of the job was every now and then I helped mothers locate clothes for a beautiful child or children.
bad,"You are not valued as a person, you are expected to work limited hours, and for a wage that cannot support any individual.  The employers expect everyone to be friendly when their culture is clickish and very high school minded."
bad,"I wouldn't let my dog work at the warehouse in monroe, ohio. They treat their employees horribly. The entrance is a revolving door for management. They treat you like you should be a robot. It's all a numbers game with them and their quotes are way too high. You never know where you will be working from day to day and they don't care if you've been trained in that area or not, you better learn it on your own."
bad,"Honestly the worst job I've ever had, your hours are based on credit card numbers, management does not care about you at all, manager I had me crying on the floor and did not care at all."
bad,"Stressful no fun unless your a favorite. Always on you for the smallest things, I would go home everyday not wanting to return, the credit card sales were most stressful"
bad,typical retail job. the most is expected from you with little to no compensation or end goal in mind. great place to get first work experience for young people.
bad,This company may look good on the outside but the inside is Not. I worked there for five years and did not advance to any supervisor position even though I knew every department. The manager was way too comfortable in his position and did nothing to advance his career. The only good thing about it is the discount and the prices aren’t too bad. Good for a part-time retired person.
bad,The management was very poor. I learned how to work the cash register and to handle cash. The people there were pretty nice but the mangers made it a boring place to work. It was a good first job
bad,Everything about working at kohls was horrible. The managers care about no one but themselves and get paid very well to literally stand and do nothing.
bad,"Human resources is a joke"
bad,It is a retail job. I have learned retail skills. There is a limited culture. It is a part-time job only. Customers are the hardest part of the job. Management is management.
bad,"No life or work balance.  Constantly scheduled max hours then dropped to like 15 so they did not have to pay me as a full time employee.  Was bounced around shifts.  Closed one night at midnight opening again at 6 am type of schedule happened all the time.  Difficult to get management to answer or help when needed.  Never enough coverage for Dressing rooms, so racks were always piled high outside.  I could go on and on."
bad,Worst place to work. They dont explain all policies fully! They need managers that actually care about their employees and dont care about the store numbers.
bad,"Store managment was one of the worst had ever worked for, never did work the the departments that was hired to be in as an E3. Worked up in returns and on the registers, did trucks and freight.. Had one co worker who seemed nice and anyone else's was very rude to me...had one incident followed a wrong plan o gram and the assistant store manager came out and flung the display cart around and chewed me out on the sales floor in front of guests as the store manager just stood there reading the news paper...no one worked in teams, such a bad store culture and terrible employment experience...was let go after 90 days...."
bad,An hourly manager that is lucky to make a living wage. Must move in order to advance. Must have open availability so good luck doing anything else on a regular basis.
bad,it was by far the worst experience of my life. they throw you in with  extremely little training. the management is awful. every aspect of working at Kohls was terrible and i do not recommend.
bad,"Come to work trying to find a manager for the duties for the day because they were not, all the same, every day. Cashier for over an hour when I was a floor associate and then get talked to because my department was not clean."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The manager is a jerk that yells at everyone. You are treated horribly not only by the staff, but also by the customers working there, it is the worst place i have ever worked in all my life"
bad,Advancement is very minimum to none leadership does not support internal growth but to the regular hourly paid worker pay and benefits are decent.You are utilized to the needs of the business and do not have a set position in the building if you are a floor associate.
bad,"starting pay is 8.25 and the raise only comes after one year of work; but the worst part is that it is only 1% of 8.25. at least at my location. the managers pushed you to sell the credit cards even if the customer said no already. if you are the closer you will be working alone 9 times out of 10 even during peak season. id work form 5 pm to 10:30 or even 11:00 pm monday-thursday on fridays/saturdays 5 pm to 11:30 or even 12 am (if things were really bad) and lastly on sundays 5pm-9:30ish. i know you are thinking that it is not bad, but on top of that imagine dealing with finals and graduation not to mention starting college."
bad,It is very hard to advance at Kohl's. The management seems very preoccupied with how the run the company and they don't give good feedback to they're employee's. I personally would try not to get sick because they are not understanding if its you or your children.
bad,"terrible place to work "
bad,"was interviewed for a cashier position and told I was hired for that position, but then they scheduled me to unload tractor trailers at 3 am. I was not trained very well"
bad,cutthroat. YOU WILL NOT GET HOURS IF YOU DO NOT SELL COMPANY CREDIT CARDS. God awful management and staff. Not welcoming or helpful environment all round terrible experience and would not go back or recommend
bad,"Management is clueless and rude, low wages, no work-life balance, if you aren't willing to come in on your days off, come in early, and work indefinitely late all the time- you will not be treated well."
bad,"Not a good company to work for."
bad,The managers were very snobby and rude especially to their employees. They made it a place where you felt dreaded coming to work. Overall the coworkers were cool just very poor lack of management.
bad,"When I first started, I loved it! Now, the management team makes it a terrible place to want to work. I am sure not every single store is like this, but this one is not a good place to work."
bad,"Bad management, stressful unpleasant work environment, high turnover.  I would not recommend them as an employer.  All employees are required to wear headsets and management just belittles everyone on the radio most days."
bad,"Talk about stressed. They always offer to work with you, just like every other job. But yet I never see any of the same teenagers working in there the next time I go back. I signed up for a part time position over the summer and they had me working almost 40 hours a week and 10-12 hour shifts at a time."
bad,I was fired after four years at kohls for selling credit the way management told me to.Instead of informing me their tactics for selling credit were wrong....Corporate decided to fire me and management doesn’t even get in trouble for misleading their associates!!!! Favoritism!Kohls has the worst corporate management team of all other retailers!!! Working there was a waste of my time and my talent!!!!!
bad,"I worked here for 3 years and it was the worst job I have ever had. The manager was terrible at managing staff. They would train you in many different areas, but would never increase your pay. On my 3rd year working there, they raised everyone's pay you was under $9/hour to $9/hour. The new people who were just hired then were getting paid the same as I was even though I worked there for 3 years prior and was trained in many areas. They are totally unfair, understaff the store, and have terrible management."
bad,"Kohl's has treated both myself and others I know unfairly while employed. The local management and employees themselves are often fine, but the corporate management and HR department are unjust and money mongering robots."
bad,"Everyday was a different task involving carrying objects that require two people. Also, when on the register and customer had a problem with the policy management would say I was wrong and give customers whatever they wanted and made me look bad. Management is horrible, I would ask help for a customer and no one would answer over the mic. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,the other employees were very nice a lot of younger kids or very old women. The management was terrible and the head manager was very rude and not very nice. He was sarcastic and seem to come off a bit nonchalant about a lot of things talks down to you. if you are looking for a career dont work here
bad,"I have nothing to say that won't end up getting me fired. Since I still need this job, that's about it. Interviewing while you are enraged is hard to mask. Don't interview angry. It has a way of leaking through, no matter how positively you try to spin your words."
bad,No room for growth pay raises are 7 cents a yr. That's not acceptable things done against guidelines of company. No clear way to get better raises. Too focused on creating debt for their customers
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"dont train well, hated it, worse place ever,would never go back nor shop there, not enough hours, schedule stay jacked up especially if you aint a manager"
bad,"This job was very stressful and very under paid, the management is very unorganized. The amount of work was huge compared to the amount of hours worked."
bad,"I do not regret having the retail experience of working at Kohl's. It taught me patience with people and other retail workers/companies. Working here started out really well, but when they started cutting my hours, for a reason I am unsure of, I got another job to pay my bills. When I advised my schedule restrictions due to having a second job, they cut my hours even more."
bad,"I will not recommend this job to anyone.. Management is horrible,hours suck and there is so much favoritism at Kohls it's ridiculous..there is no dress code so you can basically wear whatever and get away with it.. No respect,nor do they be courteous towards customers.. And there is a lot a backstabbing individuals working there and the politics and gossip it's like being in a reality show.."
bad,"A typical day can be very hectic with heavy foot traffic or can be very slow allowing you to catch up on work or work on projects assigned by management. "
bad,"i was the MJM department supervisor. the job was terrible and got worse during my ~2yr stint. i was paid unfairly; when starting wages were raised, mine was not. this meant that, despite my immense workload, new cashiers made only 80 cents less an hour than i did. i was given too many tasks to complete nearly every day, even when working at full capacity. i have never had problems with this in any other workplace and my peers had the same issues as i did. i was reprimanded regularly for my failure to perform by their standards. i was alone in MJM for multiple 6-8 hour time periods - this meant i had to manage each dressing room (there were 3), do service walks every 30 minutes, and backup cashier. "
bad,It was messy out back. Alot of the head phones didnt work. Hours where horrible only 4 hour shifts unless it was a sunday. Constantly being called in to cover hours
bad,I wouldn't recommend my friends to work for kohls retails stores. If someone wants to have a short term goal then its ok or may be you can say it is better to have the high school students to work at kohls but then you will have lack of work experienced people around.
bad,There is nothing special to write about. I worked so much and received little compensation or gratitude. I was promoted quickly from cashier to intimates dept manager.
bad,I did not enjoy working at this place. Little management and when there was you would not get the reconization you needed to move up.we went through three managers and Rochelle was hands down the best one.
bad,"I worked for Kohl's for 4 years and hated it EVERYDAY! The management was horrible, tons of favoritism and neglect. If management doesn't like you they give you awful hours. One of the worst parts of working for this company is the credit card goal: each employee is required to get people to signed up for a Kohl's card, so they are constantly soliciting the credit. Not only is it annoying but its unreasonable to put high goals in small cities like Bakersfield. If youre just looking for a holiday discount go for it but expect to work crazy hours and be treated poorly by both the Kohl's corporation and customers."
bad,kohls is a great place for a child to learn how to work as for an adult with a family its hard to pay bills with such low hours.i would suggest 25 or under to work their.
bad,"This company is a horrible place to work. They do not care about their employees at all. Would short shift me and schedule me for hours i could not work."
bad,I worked at Kohls for almost 3 year.I always came to work ontime stay over worked over time cover people shifts andpicked up shifts and yet Kohls fired me for no reason worst place to work
bad,They never clean up anything if some one bleeds and it gets on the floor they just let it dry and forget about it.  Also there is poor communication between department heads and managers.
bad,The pay was nothing and you get paid every week. before they hired me they made it seem as if they was hiring me for a cashier but they actually hired me as seasonal. I was not aware and no one told me.
bad,"It is my first job, I was not properly trained or prepared for how to do my job. Also, the environment wasn't for me, mostly elderly people ignoring me."
bad,"Poor management. Breaks were never given. If you wanted a break you had to just take it on your own and everyone would be upset because it was so busy,"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Way too low of a salary, $7.25 per hour, for any employee to work there and make a living at it, either full time or part time. Wasn't worth the 25 mile drive for such low pay per hour, but a job is a job. Also applied for other jobs but was also not even given an interview."
bad,"i worked here seasonal, the full time employees were EXTREMELY rude and they let the little power of that go to their head, vivian the trainer told us in orientation that Kohl's did not need a reason to fire us because we're just seasonal, we were poorly trained and our trainer wasn't or manager wasn't even there when we needed them the second day, they didn't explain the scheduling. Seasonal worked twice as hard as full-time because of the fear of being fired but yet we were not compensated fairly or equally as full-time especially the holiday pay out"
bad,"The manager was rude, and decreased my 35 hours a week to 5 a week. Usually a day before I was to work they would call me and tell me not to come in. Until they stopped scheduling me all together."
bad,My advice and experience. You can work hard for yourself. But management will oversee your hard work and dedication and will think of themselves. Management will curse at you and harass you for your hard work and fast paced dedication. If your considering this an extra money in the pocket type job or coming out of high school. Don't do it!!! Run away from this place. There are way better and deserving places to work. It is not worth it. I was the happiest to walk away when I was approached from the freight manager cursing and yelling at me when I was so excited and happy to get my job done in the early morning hours. Trust me it is not worth your time. Remember managers will not care about you. You deserve better!!!! Happy job hunting
bad,"Management was weak and unethical. Non-understanding. Pay was completely, and utterly, weak. Minimum wage ($7.25/hr) was a slap tp the face. Security only knew half of what they were doing."
bad,Slow on some days and fast on some days. Poor training and poor management. Poor supervision. Supervisors and management are awful and show favoritism and talk about customers and employees. It's like being in high school all over again. Very immature and stressful working environment.
bad,At the mount prospect kohls I was over worked and under paid. my raise was 14 cents after i was there for a year. So would I ever recommend this job. NO
bad,Store employees seemed happier depending on dept manager. Corporate culture was awful. No regard for personal time. Never been treated so badly. Would never recommend.
bad,"I loved working at kohls! But we were understaffed and always had to work multiple departments,and still were expected to deliver excellent customer service. I learned to come out of my shell at registers.  Our "
bad,i did not like working here .. they don't pay enough. they will not promote within the company at all. just not my cup of tea. but i stayed because i needed a job
bad,This job was okay. Management was very understanding and helpful. The workplace culture is very productive and fast-pace. Co-workers are friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers.
bad,"the bosses are spawns of the devil himself. i got yelled at after i worked there for two months for calling off because i was in the hospital dehydrated with strep throat. also got yelled at by a manger for helping a customer with her merchandise and her cart because she was in severe pain because i had already clocked out and hey weren’t paying me for any overtime. poor management. poor attitudes. poor EVERYTHING. most days i worked, i didn’t even get a break because i wasn’t a priority in the managers eyes."
bad,"They always advertise for full time but there is no such thing.  I don' even know if management is full time.  no benefits, no raises, no nothing.  punished if you don't get a customer to open a Kohl's credit card.  They take hours away from you to punish you.  it's a non thinking job so i learned nothing.  it's like being back in high school.  once you're on you register you are forgotten about as far as breaks and lunch."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked. I was excited when I first got the job because the store manger who I interviewed with was SO NICE and fun. But then I showed up to my first day of work and realized that everyone else wasn't as nice. It was very cliquey, the managers expected you to know exactly what you were doing after only 1 day of training. You have to push the  Kohls card like crazy and if you didn't ask the customer at least 3 times about the card , they pulled you off of registers. The managers also watch you like a hawk and know your very single move which I find creepy. I get there are some untrustworthy people but to hear in your ear when you're putting something away ""your name that item goes to your right."" It's creepy.  The employees are not helpful and the managers will say to you ""it's ok, you're just learning""  only to get mad at you when you ask them a question about something.  You don't get paid enough to be treated the way you do at this Kohls. I 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND working here. My experience working here has honestly made me hate Kohls and not want to shop there ever again."
bad,"I work in the shoe department and ive learned that working in the department can be kind of demanding. we most likely don't always carry the shoes customers are looking for. working in shoes has also been high maintence such as constantly having to clean and pick up after customers. Also it is required for you to help in other departments that you have not been trained because most likely there is no one working in that department. For some it is required that you know how to work the cash register but I've been working there for a little over a year and have not received any training for working the registers. I've learned how to have patience with the type of customers kohls have. I've learned how to basically run a shoe department by myself. The work environment itself is good all the employees seem to get along great. with the managers ive seen and heard them be frustrated or irritated with their employees because of lack of training. Not to long ago a few managers resigned and im not sure when they hired new managers but i know it took me months to even figure who the new managers were because they didn't introduce themselves at all; And whenever i saw them they didn't speak. Hardest part of the job working in shoes is keeping it together during the holidays. Holidays are the hardest because it consist of crazy holiday hours, busy all the time, not much merchandise to sell, not much holiday pay, and they do expect you to work on holiday but they will also work around your schedule. if you like to work in a busy environment with needy customers and having to constantly clean"
bad,It wasn’t very well thought out; my employment. I haven’t even been properly trained and I’m already done. I hadn’t even been there for a month yet so it was a pretty bad experience
bad,"Management was rude. Disrespectful about other employees in front of others. "
bad,Long Hours and hard work which you dont get paid enough for. Management is horrible and no one cares about you.unfair hours and too much taxes taking out
bad,"First day I was asked what days I wanted to work, I said if I have to work on the weekends I would rather pick Sunday so I can make more money and the manager which replied very rudely ""Who interviewed you!?"" Second day I was put in a room in front of a computer to train myself which I'm sure everyone has to do. I passed above average in all the quizzes. Third day I asked what do you want me to do today and the same manager said go on the floor to fold and pick up. Next day same thing she put me back on the floor to fold and pick up which is not the position I applied for but I would have been okay with it if I didn't see a girl that was trained on the same day and I have much more experience over her, I was told she was put on the register. That's when I realized they were being unfair and punched out and left. If only after 5 days of working they put preferences on their employees i would rather work somewhere else."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,They don't like to give any hours always complaining of not enough staff but wont give the staff that does want to work more the 10-18hrs this is dumb
bad,"I feel like this place was a very inconsiderate place, its like the worst job ever long hours and it's hard on your body standing on concrete floors.."
bad,"Backstabbing ,rude,uncaring.  This place is all about corp not about the employees. If you have a problem it never gets handled correctly. Bad mangers"
bad,"Management would post the schedule on days you had off or days late and would fire people bc of missing a day they had no idea they worked, seriously do not work here everyone is out for themselves and they give you very poor training and then huff and puff when you ask a question about what you need to do."
bad,Management does not work well with you. They hire so many people that everyone is scheduled a few hours a week. Its stressful when your trying to keep money in your pocket but don't get enough work hours.
bad,"""If your looking for a Seasonal Job and something temp than go to Kohls, but do NOT stay yearly.(not enough hours to maintain household,slows down after peak season of over). As far as the people at Kohls warehouse. I say work hard, stay busy and stay to yourself."
bad,"Look somewhere else where"
bad,"I had to clean the bathrooms, equipment room, and I had to sweep, mop, vacuum, plus refill the toloiet paper as well as paper towels, soap, and garbage bags. I had to make sure I did everything that was on my list for the day in order to make sure I didn't forget anything to clean, pick up, or put away."
bad,"Management was horrible. Hours were not consistent like I was told they would be in the beginning. Supervisors were great but had to fight with managers to exist at that job. It was very cutthroat. If management liked you, you did well, if not, they made you work harder and gave you horrible hours. Benefits were horrible."
bad,"unload a truck. stock merchandise. I learned to use a scanner, find different areas of the store etc. Some of the managers I did not care for. they were rude and picked favorites. diverse maybe.The hardest part in the day for me was; standing for all them  hours, in them dress shoes. Most enjoyable part of the day was getting off my feet."
bad,"Show favoritism"
bad,"The managers at khols had no idea what they were doing. They had more than enough people and yet we were ALWAYS understaffed, to the point where costumers noticed and complained."
bad,Managers would use bad language at employees. We were always  told not to call mangers when needed. And would get in trouble doing so. It also took a very long time to get a manager. The dress code was enforced to only to some employees. Managers dated employees.
bad,"You must be competative and agressive. I asked multiple times to be moved from that position but managment refused to listen. This did not just occur with me but with other cowrokers as well. Managment made harmful comments such as ""You need to get medication for your mental problems""."
bad,"I really enjoyed working for kohl's because i was able to interect with people.I had a chance to provide customer service based on our daily sales and upcoming promotion."
bad,don't trust this company - they will kick you to the curb in a sec.  They say 'open door' then then hit you with on the as they send you off to the unemployment line.
bad,"A typical work day is very busy and helping lots of customers. "
bad,"The corn nuggets took a while to come out. In the mean time, the other parts of my order was boxed and bagged. The worker even walked it out to give to me as I waited for rest of my order"
bad,Management unprofessional horrible place.  Too much gossip not recommend to work here.  Feels like your in high school. Too many calls a day.  Stressful place.
bad,I felt I was not rightly treated I put my 200% effort but was not ever acknolowdeged I worked night day when they called any department any shift but not appreciated at all
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Working at kohls was a living nightmare. I could never get things done with the amount of time I was given. not to mention the fact that I was forced to close half the store down in four hours, had to look absolutely perfect too."
bad,"Working at Kohls is a joke. You are paid minimum wage, no matter how long you work there. You also cannot work more than 26 hours a week, unless its the holiday season. Management expects you to be able to do everything in the store but won't give you any sort of raise or reward for doing so. Also, they do not allow tennis shoes even though you can easily do 20,000 steps in a 4-hour shift."
bad,"Management sucked. I hated working there so much, literally wanted to bawl my eyes out every time I had to go in for a shift. The place caused me to have that much anxiety."
bad,"they dont care about their employees and they don't take the time to listen to you. I was so unhappy here, and treated so poorly. I would never tell ANYONE to work for this company."
bad,"horrible management "
bad,I worked at kohl's in Brewster for about 12 years. The management wasn't very good and they didn't know what they were doing. They never had enough cashiers scheduled on any given shift so they always pulled people from the Departments including the supervisors to ring register. So on top of doing Department sets and helping the customers I had to ring register so getting anything accomplished in an 8 hour shift was nearly impossible.
bad,"disrespecful management. no benefits for part time employees. "
bad,"I was a temporary worker for the warehouse. I was hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and had a high turnover rate. I didn’t like the shift that I was assigned,it was an overnight shift."
bad,I dreaded going to work everyday because of the rude management that made me feel like a lesser person just because I was new and she didn't like me for whatever reason.
bad,horrible expirence  i idint like the change hen john left the store. Before he left the store was fun and live. People here couldnt wait to get inside to work.
bad,"there is a lot of favoritism, hours are not very good and vary.  some associates do not do work, they just goof around, not very reliable.  they need to work on getting people to do their job and not just hide or goof around.  Need to be more structured as well."
bad,"I worked there for over a year, and it was honestly a terrible job. I hated the managers, and the job itself was redundant and uninteresting. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"While currently woking at Kohls, I barely get any hours to work. Also they moved me to different departments without no one training me & it was hard for me to help customers since I didn't have knowledge."
bad,this job was terrible. never got hardly any hours. it was mostly seasonal. only 3 people worked 40 hours. not a good job. very hectic and disorganized.
bad,i will never work at this company because they pay less than minimum wage. and I was going out my way to come to work on time and I still didn't get any hours.
bad,"I worked at Kohls in the Customer Service Department, I was feeling sick and pressed the button for manage help plenty of times, nobody came; as I tried to excuse myself from the customers I fainted and hit my head on the counter and floor. I suffered ptsd for almost a year, I did not receive disability or Workmans comp."
bad,This company is so stressful and the pay wasn't good at all. They worked you to death and they didn't care about you having a life. They didn't care about you being in school.
bad,"While my direct supervisor, floor managers, and most associates were amazing people we were all at the mercy of a horrible store manager and awful admin and very poor pay. In order to keep costs down hours were slashed for many, overtime was absolutely not possible, admin would schedule associates to work on days/or at times when associates had made it clear in advance they were not available. "
bad,was poor management and not enough workers at times. there was never enough help when I worked there to where I could ask for help when needed. not enough workers
bad,"Working at Kohl's is a stressful under appreciated environment, I hope they get all new management in the future and treat their employees better. I hope that they can provide a safe environment for their employees, instead of letting customers abuse them. Under paid, under trained, under appreciated."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,They put a huge emphasis on their associates getting people to sign up for credit cards. The pay is terrible. Customers get angry when you as them to sign up for anything.
bad,All they care about is credits. They don't care about your needs. They don't care if your in school. They favor people. If you get a lot of credits you can do whatever you want. They don't care about customers. They will tell at you!
bad,Kohls was brand new when i started in 2014. You have to be careful because they operate based on business needs only. They do not keep their schedules consistent no matter what they have you sign
bad,In a typical day not busy most of the day not including weekend most of the time is slow . Usually workers just stock merchandising and clean the floor .
bad,"Limited, unpredictable hours, poor salary, no benefits; management is unapproachable and often times is unfair. The company does not care about an individual's  financial need for hours. You are obligated to work every holiday that they are open and weekends. Frequently understaffed."
bad,"Friendly co-workers only, store manager needs much improvement, always put the pressure on whenever the BIG BOSS was to be coming into town to view the store, (So if you don't like folding clothes, I don't recommend a job for you here!)Everyone pulled to to make store look good(lots of folding clothes from customer mess and most stay until job is complete) for the store manager, treated just like another number, so if you decide to take on a job here be prepared to deal with lots of pressure from managedment, only appreciated if you get those credit apps in from customers, pay is terrible other stores pay better and treat you better, just our opinion. overall Great co-workers! Poor store management!!!"
bad,For anyone that is looking for a flexible schedule then this is the place to be. Do not expect to be paid alot and there are a lot of incompetence at my store.
bad,Training was severely lacking.  Not a positive environment. There wasn't any leadership.  After being hired I was put on sales floor and was given very little direction as to the duties that were to be performed.
bad,"Don't work here. This is the worse place to work. Management is never there. Always on ""vacation"" they always want you to push Kohls cards and if you don't, you get a write up even if you ask and no one wants one. Hours are awful. Like four hours a week. A week! It's like dying a slow death and everyday you are beaten down to nothing by customers and management."
bad,management had no compassion. did not understand that I had second job and was agreeable for me to change my hours. employees were mean  to myself and hardly manageable. but now they're fine...
bad,"Clock in and head to assigned area.  "
bad,They work you pretty hard for minimum wage and they are super uptight. i was literally scared of like two of my managers. I was 18 and it was my first retail job. NEVER AGAIN.
bad,"life at kohls ,, = FAKE"
bad,"As a current associate, whenever I see people coming in for interviews, I always want to warn them of the chaos they are getting into. The customers are entitled and will scream at you, belittle you and make your life awful and the managers will let them. No training whatsoever and it only gets worse at Christmas time. Several people walk out during interviews and during the training sessions and I can't count how many customer service associates walk out in the middle of their shifts. I can't count how many arguments I get into over Kohl's cash. Save yourself because your soul will literally die."
bad,"The company is poorly ran"
bad,"I thought  this company management would have changed and have more room to advance since I gained more skills over the years. I was wrong, management is unorganized, no use of strategy, no relationship of trust with staff. You will be hunted down and chastised in front of other associates and customers. You will not be trained for other areas in the store because the manager over that department just won't allow it. the store to store experience for customers sucks, you stay on hold even as another store calling. hours cut no matter what, no communication on schedule. And the store manager keeps changing the same recycled staff. Give someone else a try its 2017, people was to learn new things to."
bad,"It was not a pleasant place to work. Not enough hours, not enough pay for what the sales associates do on a daily basis. Customers are always right, they do not hear what their employees have to say they just side we the customer every time. The manager was very demeaning and condescending. When you make a mistake she doesn't pull you to the side and talk to you she does it over the walkie."
bad,"Not a great company to work for. No concern for their employees, but rather mainly for raising profits. Too many meetings and not enough time to actually focus on work."
bad,I was a male working in what was known as the female company. My DLPM was a female and would treat all male LP as low as she could. You got no respect.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Its very stressful and there is no support from managers and corp. Favoritism is practiced. If you don't solicit  enough credit you will never hear the end of it. Managers are not concerned for the safety of customers.There have been cases where older men have been allowed to enter fitting room with their young teens in the fitting rooms. Lost prevention watches you not the thieves. Unprofessional language is exchanged between some employees. Older employees are discriminated. Hardworking employees are underappreciated. At first you will get a lot of hours when you start. During the holiday season all your hours go to temp. hires. When you are not wanted anymore your hours are dropped until one day you haven't work for a whole month. But your experience may be delightfully different.
bad,Kohls is a ok starting job. If you are just starting out and are building up your work history. You will have experience and customer service knowledge.
bad,"Retail. One of the busiest retail stores in the nation. High turnover rate, not suprised. They treat you like it too. Don't get me wrong, they'll keep you busy with lots of hours, you just won't get to enjoy your hard work with the little pay they give you."
bad,"Very unorganized, no training, people are very unfriendly unless you are in their clique.  No schedule to follow you have to chase people down to get answers."
bad,this job was only seasonal I've learned how to use a RF scanner gun and taking inventory of the sku numbers. job wasn't bad it wasn't long term so I had to move on
bad,Kohls does not know the meaning of family and how to properly treat their associates.  Management has no integrity and set unrealistic goals for their associates.
bad,"The pay is awful for the work and the verbal abuse you receive. If you're not favorite or don't talk to management often they cut your hours. They were completely inconsiderate about outside obligations.  I couldn't openly talk to my staff about things, and I felt frightened at my job. This is not a good company to work for. They're unprofessional and unorganized."
bad,"Management had a poor attitude when discussing issues involving paychecks."
bad,working at khols is ok for people who just want to start off part time. but you get no hrs and the pay is really bad bc of being a part time job. but for people who go to school its not a bad place.
bad,"When I first started they just threw me into my job with very little training.  Some people quit because of poor management."
bad,"This was my first job ever and I hated it. Communication was awful, if they raised your pay, they cut your hours, they never give you the hours you request, management had very obvious favoritism. Very stressful and not good place to work."
bad,"The HR department is not pleasant to deal with it, does not have good attendance or time work practices.  No job security, hours can be cut without notice."
bad,"Was a seasonal employee and they promised 5-6 days a week on 10 hour shifts and after the first week not just me but every seasonal employee got 10 hours a week and you're not aloud to go to your car on breaks. "
bad,Always in your ear asking for credit. store is always a mess. if you are hired for reg and you do not make the right amount of credits they will take you off and make you do the floor.
bad,"Do not work for this company if you have other options. Most managers do not take care of their employees. you are either over worked and underpaid, or get no hours at all."
bad,"Working here is very stressful. As a part timer I only get to work 4 hrs a week meaning I only work once in a week then they're gonna call you to come in to work everyday I am not scheduled to work. Stressful because E3's will pressure you to get credit card application, how is that even possible if it's the same customers that shops mostly everyday. Customers with Kohls charge already. You can't expect to get credit card application every single day."
bad,If you want poor management and high school drama this is the place for you. I have nothing nice to say about this company and I have been there 3 yrs
bad,"No proper training, expect you to do everything without any idea what you're doing. Didn't give any hours even if it's a seasonal job. Management didn't care."
bad,"This company or maybe just specifically the Robinson store is extremely disorganized. The pay is LOW compared to other companies. In 5 years expect to make only $2 more than when you started. Management is critical and praise is only given if you are picked as a ""favorite."" The work can be extremely stressful and for the low pay and lack of support from management, I would recommend you look elsewhere."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Good stepping stone"
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance= none"
bad,This Is A Terrible Place To Work For. The Manager Told Coworkers Personal Things About Myself Also Screamed At Me Over The Phone And Treated Me Like A Dog.
bad,"enjoyable to work there, fun place, good co-workers managers are nice and friendly, customers are also nice, customers love shopping at kohl's"
bad,Opening the store and assigning task to our team members. Morning huddle to inform team members with business strategy
bad,"I was a semi frequent shopper with Kohl s prior to working there, and as a customer I enjoy their products. Having been an employee though, all they cared about was selling credit cards. The people I worked with were okay, but the management was mostly awful. I wouldn't recommend working for them"
bad,"It started off good at first, but when I was moved from the registrar to the floor (as a sales associate), that's where most of my problems began. I was mostly on the night shift and it was one of the worst shift to work. Most of the people in my department would often call out leaving me with lots of work to do. I couldn't get any help from anyone and management would never send any help unless they wanted to. "
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work until they started cutting out vacation time.  Had three weeks vacation and corporate cut it down to 2 hours,  Management is a joke!  If you had to call in sick, manager would hang up on you!  Would never recommend working there!!!!"
bad,"I only worked maybe a day a week for four hours maybe five for less than I was being paid at the YMCA, people didnt explain things very well, confusing environment"
bad,"never ever gave any hours, because they thought i never showed up to my shifts and i know they did that to other people as well. they would not give hours and yet other coworkers would nit show up to work so those hours went to waste. management was rude except the main manager."
bad,"People won't work with you to train you right or at all. They talk to you like you are stupid. They expect you to to know things right when you walk in the door. They expect you to hurry up in your work. And if it's not done in that time, they get upset with you. And if you don't answer them on the walkie in a matter of seconds, they get upset or even helping another customer. They get upset with you."
bad,"This environment is a mess of poor communication among a large number of managers who at any given time have little understanding of the tasks they are given to delegate. Poor pay, Long grueling hours. Thankless environment Very litte in teh way of incentives beyond a soda or a plastic coin voucher good for a candy bar of your managers choice."
bad,it didn't work out which is why i don't work there any more the fact that this is a requirement is ridiculous and this shouldn't be a factor in my looking for another job
bad,Ok so I worked here for two years. At the beginning it was a great place to work. But towards the end the managers were horrible they couldn't communicate and I would get yelled at for not doing my job when I was being told 3 different things. The pay isn't worth it. Now I get dirty looks from the managers. First of all I found out I no longer work there from a coworker. Not a manager. So I called them out to corporate. Still have yet to hear anything.
bad,"No work/life balance. They tell you to find it on your own. Management is terrible and only care about themselves. DM is a micromanaging control freak. Example of work hours for a LPS would be 9-530, 10-630, 11-730, 12-830, 1-930. So if you have a family get used to not seeing them. Store manager will call your DM every chance she gets to complain about something."
bad,"Worked here for almost 2 years, hated every second of it. Management plays favorites and doesn't care about anyone else. Few managers actually do anything, supervisors are about the same. Lots of drama, could be easily confused for a high school."
bad,"When I went to reapply after my semester at college I was told i never worked my last two weeks, when I did and handed in my two week notice."
bad,Management needs to learn to be on the same page. They say one thing and do another. The store manager at the Missoula store is a very poor example as a leader. When the employees have to take a test on Ethics so should he because he lacks a lot.
bad,For a grown responsible person with bills to pay. This paycheck is like weekly allowance and they never have hours to give to actually rally up a good enough paycheck.
bad,"Seasonal associate so not too much in the way of hours. Not enough  to pay the bills, just something on the side to do until full time opportunity. No chance of that happening here. Too much attention on Credit card - one individual in management described as a psychopath. Would take away as a learning experience. Praise your hard workers when they do a good job instead of only recognizing their existence when they make an error. Too much expected for such little pay. Respect is a two way street."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I enjoyed the work and the associates and the over time. I worked. Their almost 20 years. Did all the jobs and work extra hours and e-Com .  Over all. Loved my job.
bad,"the job was way too high stress for retail. constantly being pressed to make people apply for the credit card or if you are good, they will never move you up."
bad,There is too much work to do but not enough pay. The hours suck and you have to pretty much work all holidays. management is not the greatest .
bad,"Helped customers and Handled Merchandise. I learned how to work some of the instruments that I needed to, as well as how hard retail can be. It overall wasn't a very enjoyable experience towards the end of my time there."
bad,"I was hired to work on the sales floor but was never moved off of cash register.  Had one day training then was left to work cash register alone on Black Friday.   Management cares more about opening credits than actual customer service, they even require the housekeeping staff to push the Kohl's credit card.  If you do not meet your new credits quota, they do not give you hours, no matter how good you are at your job."
bad,Unloading the truck was fast paced and great co-workers however you get paid minimum wage to unload an 18 wheeler truck on your own while your co-workers just wait for you to push product down the line. Management was very unprofessional and lazy overall. No chance to move up in the company.
bad,"Making mistakes is a big no no , which is wrong because nobody is perfect. Many managers lie to you and they hire too many people so it's hard to get enough hours. The pay is roo low. The way they schedule makes it so you can't have a lunch break hardly ever."
bad,Worked at Kohls for a year only made $30 a week the managers were not nice never gave me for hours if I asked for more I get we don't have enough money to give you more hours
bad,"Overall, the biggest problem is the lack of opportunity for advancement. Also, part-time employees get the short end of the stick when it comes to hours and aren't even guaranteed 4 hours a week. Management, at least at my location, was not kind or fair to the employees. Nor did they help to promote employees advancement. Their main concern was pressuring employees to have customers sign up for the Kohl's Charge Card. This is of very little benefit to the employees and much greater benefit to the managers."
bad,Management could not manage along with unreasonable working hours during the holiday season - employees are unable to take days off to spend time with family.
bad,i worked for kohls I always thought it was like a revolving door because they always have new people that wouldn't last long the pay was minimum wage and they played favoritism a lot if you were not liked by the managers you do not have a job I would not recommend working for Kohl's because they want you to do all this work for little pay and they're always pushing credit and if you didn't make the credit goal you would hear about it they would always talk down to you and make you feel less of what you were the only good thing about it was you would get paid every week I remember times where I couldn't even go to the bathroom because there was nobody to cover me
bad,I was trained one day and didn't even have a trainer the whole time. You have to give three weeks advance for time off and the schedule isn't even posted until sometimes the day before. I've been repramanded by management in front of customers.
bad,My days were fun because of the associates. They gave little to no hours to work. The management sucked big time...............................................................
bad,"Seasonal freight associates can expect a ""trial by fire"" environment at Kohl's. After your first day of ""training,"" which consists of four hours of video viewing, you are thrown straight into the docking bay. No walk around the store to familiarize yourself, no explanation of departments or their products, just head to the doors and unload the trailer. After all of the merchandise is unloaded, you are grouped with other associates to place the merchandise on the sales floor. Other than the clothing departments, there is little to no organization. Nothing on the shelves are labeled to tell you where to place product, it's more of a ""put it where there's room"" mentality. Management is very strict, apathetic, and uncaring towards associates or their needs. It's less about the people and all about the money. The hardest part of the job is your one break a day (if you work anything less than a full shift) when you are often left alone to sort merchandise and help customers while full-time associates get two breaks and a lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving and going home."
bad,"Where do I even begin?  The company portrays themselves as a great place to work and how much they live their employees which is great but the only thing is; their management doesn't. Only if you go there trying to be friends with the management team is when you get great benefits. There's so much gossiping, bullying, retaliation, and ignorance within the management team. They're all about perception but when it comes to mess hitting the fan, they back door you and make it seem like you're the problem. Work here if you really need the money but be prepared to deal with ignorant coordinators and managers and human resources who could care less about you."
bad,"If you're a Point of Sales, you better get people to sign up for those credit cards. They are what determine how many hours you get, no matter how hard of a worker you are."
bad,I'm a pre-veterinary student who needs a part-time job to get through school I take approximately 21 credit hours a semester and I'm also a theater and in band and they would get huffy with me if I would write off for anything school-related. And I didn't appreciate the fact that I couldn't leave state to go visit my family for the holidays because of the Black Friday policies. Also there was little to no possibilities for getting a raise. They allow customers to treat the associates like absolute garbage and they are so understaffed that it makes the job even more miserable up to the point where my psychiatrist told me that I need to find a new job
bad,"hard work, low pay, no benefits, clueless managers, no chance at overtime, no work- life balance. Typical day was coming in to do a truck with no crew and no equipment because the company can't get associates because of low pay. Getting yelled at because you can't accomplish your tasks according to an insane timetable the company has created. Management is clueless because most have never worked on the floor so to speak. Co-workers are the hardest working people because they need a paycheck. Only the toughest people work for more than 6 months at Kohls. Most leave within weeks because it just a three ring circus. Hardest part of the job was going through the front door to work. The most enjoyable part of the day was leaving through that front door."
bad,"Schedule is horrible."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I was hurt off the job and had a doctor's note to come back and  they gave my job away in just a few days if you didn't hit your credit goal your hours would be cut for the following week
bad,Working for Kohl's was ridiculous. They make you work like a cow. Intense labor for only minimum wage. Also they have so many managers that they are always contradict their ideas.They like to act like you are part of the family. But as soon as you need their help. They put you always. Over it was a learning experience.
bad,"I have found the training I received at Kohl's to help me in all aspects of my life and situations dealing with people.  We did not get 40 hours as promised, they kept changing our schedules to ""meet company needs"" without regard to the employees lives and I was cheated out of my benefits."
bad,"This company is not aware of the issues that their employees are having. The attendance policy is horrible. You receive 12 occurrences a year, but you have no sick time or fmla available if you need it. You have to use your occurrences or pto time for everything. They have a very high turn over rate."
bad,"Horrible hours, low pay, and terrible management. Not all locations are as bad as others. A typical Kohl's store is dirty, understaffed and under stocked. It seems as though the company could really care less about the customer. Note that west coast stores are general more pleasant and tend to be appropriately staffed."
bad,"I learned how to work a register, how to talk to customers, how to get people to sign up for a credit card and how to work in a department store. A typical day at work would be checking out people when they are done shopping, cleaning and straightening the floor around my register while I was not busy and talking and helping customers when needed. Though most of my co-workers were awesome and I loved working them, but my boss or the manager was not very nice and did not do her job to the best of her abilities. She made the work environment uncomfortable and sometimes unpleasant. The hardest part of the job would have been trying to get customers to sign up for a Kohl's charge card. The best part was getting to meet and work with new people and meet and talk with the customers."
bad,"Things were good at first, but without warning they unfairly fired me because I didn't get enough credits. They will demean you if you are no longer bringing in more credit applications. They even went so far as to cut my unemployment. Worse company in history!"
bad,Retail life just wasnt for me. I have nothing bad to say about the company. Retail works for some people and for others not so much.
bad,I have never worked for such a dysfunctional Loss Prevention Department. The DLPM has no idea what he is doing nor does the RLPM.  Store management treats their employees with no respect. The company does not back their associates or treat them with respect. Horrible place.
bad,"Kohl's and its management claims to be flexible, but will penalize you if you have to call out for reasons dealing with completely university assignments.  If you are a students they never give you enough hours to be eligible for assistance from the state, because they are more worried about an employee gaining eligibility for benefits than whether or not they can feed themselves or pay all their bills.  This company is notorious for giving short 4 hour shifts over 4 or 5 days so you do not make any money or have any time off to study or work on other things.  Also they give a 6 hour up to a 7 hour and 15 minute shift in which you only receive one 20 minute break and this causes you to be exhausted, hungry, and unable to perform great customer service.  They treat their employees like criminals when it comes to return made by an employee and discounts.  Customers can do anything regarding a return but employees have tons of rules regarding shopping, discounts and returns."
bad,I will not recommend anybody to work here. The management is horrible and they pay sucks. i was getting 7.45 and i would go in at 6 pm for a closing and not leave to 3 or 4 am because everything had to be perfectly closed.
bad,"This is definitely not a company you can ""grow"" with,they give you no set hours,sometimes as low as 4 hours per week at only minimum wage. Not at team environment,management expects new associates to automatically know their job duties with no explanation or training. Very disappointed with Kohl's."
bad,"The pay was low, little benefits. There was at least vacation time and a generous attendance policy. The coworkers and management were ok."
bad,"Store manager and a select few managers are very un-professional, rude, talk down to you and make you feel like your the dumbest person, they lie and put words in your mouth and cause drama whenever they can.  Very high turn over rate because of this. Hostile work environment."
bad,A typical day at work is just getting my job done. I learnd that a lot of people take there jobs for granted. When I was a store manager I wouldn't ask my employee's to do something i wouldn'd do. The hardest part of my my job was being away from my family. I worked 8 hours a day 7 days a week... and I was still on call. To be honest the best part is making the customer wanting to come back.
bad,Horrible no respect no matter how hard you work. God for bid you have any type of surgery they will still work you like a slave. I would never ever recommend this place to work at
bad,"It was overall a good job. it was very hectic and unorganized around the Holidays. Spend a lot of time on your feet. If you go in and work as holiday help, the people that are permanent workers aren't very welcoming or friendly."
bad,"I worked here part time for some extra cash.  Awful place first they only pay me $6.50 and its graveyard shift. The job always took much larger than needed and it was very understaffed, this is a BAD place to work.  There was some crazy lady with big hair that was so unhelpful. They would ask questions are ross and other department stores. so they were making us participate in surveys without compensations."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,This was a good starting out job but I would never recommend someone making a career out of working for this company. The managers were very rude and unprofessional towards employees.
bad,"The store was always understaffed, and I had to clean up other people's messes all the time in different departments. Some of the  mangers were rude and incompetent."
bad,"Never was picked to remain with the company on a permanent basis"
bad,"Management never took the time or effort to listen to employees. They never praise you for your hard work, but are quick to yell at you if you make a mistake."
bad,Management encouraged communication with them by maintaining an open door policy.  Encouraged and explained the importance of achieving operational goals.
bad,Managers have nothing better to do than to talk down to their employees. Also do not try and ask for help because they will not help you. I worked both as a cashier and a department supervisor and hated both positions. The pay is bad for the amount of stress and work you have to do. Also the customers are extremely rude they yell and belittle you all the time. So if you do decide to work here good luck !  And a tip if you want to move up fast just make sure to be buddies or related to the management and you can move up without even being qualified.
bad,Poor management low wages favoritism  rude customers over working racist please run as far as you can !!!!!!!!!!! Co worker have attitudes everyday co workers are disrespectful when you ask questions .... poor train in the work place
bad,"The management team that was in place when I was employed there was very inexperienced and juvenile in their action.  The culture of the store was more Jr. High or High School,  Complete with bullies and petty end fighting."
bad,"Horrible management, bully subordinates. Low wages, work you like dogs, get mad if you don't work overtime. Talk down to you in front of customers."
bad,"management was poor, miscommunication even after several group meetings about what could be done to improve performance, forgotten about , had to remind managers about breaks, some days would not even get any because there was no one to relieve another in certain areas, co workers made it enjoyable to work, insight from them on the job."
bad,"A horrible company to work for. They do not care about their employees. Management is rude. 3 hour shifts. You get yelled at for things you don't do, like other employees leaving things at your registers and walking away."
bad,"I was hired, by Kohl's, as seasonal P/T cashier. My general orientation consisted of approximately 1/1/2 hours which consisted mostly of filling out their required paperwork. My orientation to their cash register consisted of watching an experienced cashier for 15 minutes, then being supervised for another 20 - 30 minutes of simple transactions. After the 30 minutes, I was on my own.That was the extent of my orientation.  As a member or the ""Kohl's team,"" I was to know how to open card accounts (which was strongly stressed) and ring up purchases both simple and complex, and make exchanges. The management and fellow-workers were not supportive. The hardest part was trying to figure out how to do my job competently without. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving after my shift"
bad,I feel this job for this company is something for a young teen in high school or perhaps a college student. Also hard work and dedication goes ignored. The max hours you can get a week in the company is 26 with no way of advancement.
bad,"treat their employees terribly, horrible pay, rude customers, over a terrible place to work, everyone gets the same pay increase after 1 full year and ever year following of about 10 cents. horrible"
bad,Kohl's doesn't care about their Associates at all. You don't get Credit applications no hours. Plain and simple. One mess up at the register you are fired.
bad,Loved this job had to leave the job due to miscommunication and peak season was only given 1 day off and was mandated to work both vortex and pt schedule was simply unable to handle the load and requested to change hours no one ever called me back .
bad,"This company is absolutely terrible. There isn't any job security, management is always in a bad mood, the benefits are like none, the environment is not playful or fun at all, and they want you to work all hours of the day with only a 30 minute lunch break. I refuse to abuse myself with this place."
bad,I did price changes a couple times and they would hike the prices up and then mark it down with a 30% sticker. They weren't loosing any money.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Typical work day started as we came in logged into our computers, received about 150 calls daily to assist customer with their online purchases. Also assisted with the tracking of shipments."
bad,"The 7.25 pay sucks, management, as well as the hours only get 4-10 maybe 15 if lucky.  The play favorites here as well on if you get hours or not.  Somewhat okay if you are a college student or a high school student looking for extra cash other than that they are a horrible place to work for.  The raises are based off of how well they think you do and then only offered pennies at most for it."
bad,"Was there to set up store and assist in Grand Opening and first Christmas season."
bad,"I performed in the customers service work area, the co-workers I worked with where hard workers that help me in becoming a hard team player. The management also gave us the skills on building the company up to meet are goals each day."
bad,Kohls can sometimes be boring and some of the co worker are nice and management is sometimes mean and rude. Not much more to say
bad,"very professional company the pay was good kohls had a strict attendance policy, the staff was professional as well as helpful, the starting pay was good and there was always room for growth"
bad,"it was an overnight position so it was tough adjusting but once did it was a good team to work with, especially when we did the remodel. Great Team work."
bad,that place is just a job they realy dont care about there workers they do alot of good talk but never back there there word the one part about this place is if u r a lazy worker they like u more then the people that work hard there pay raise is the same from a lazy worker to a hard worker u will never move up at this place they play favor to that butt kisser
bad,Work life balance was the worst I ever had.  Managers seem to think that people will be productive if you make sure they live in the cube for at least 50 hours a week.
bad,Horrible place to work hours are really bad other then during the Christmas holiday the management is really bad they are not a great company to work for
bad,Working here was a challenge a bit disorganized at times and really hard to stay in the loop of communication it was likeno one ever had a game plan and it was always thrown together lst min.
bad,This company is going through a lot of change and seems to have a younger work force that is brought in as interns to replace employees with higher salaries.
bad,I've worked at Kohls for about 3yrs proudly and only received one raise during that time was the top sales representative throughout the entire retail store and felt cheated occupationally.
bad,"typical day at work would be a lot of foot traffic in and out of the store. I would constantly have to clean fitting rooms, work cash register and fold clothes. I enjoyed almost all of the co-workers. The hardest part about the job was trying to get the entire department store cleaned before being able to leave."
bad,"Boring not enough to do and not enough hours."
bad,Georgetown location management was terrible. The managers always kept us well after hours and when our shift was meant to end.
bad,All the supervisors ever did was gossip and talk negative about the entire store. NO flexible hours. NO training. NO help. You get bossed around and talked down to like a dog from day one. If they don't like the way you look right off the bat they will treat you like dirt. You always feared for your job because all they did was stand around in groups and whisper about employees. Management was terrible. One of the assistant managers was just some young kid who did absolutely nothing but flirt with the boys and take long breaks. Complete and utter chaos all the time there. No one knows what the they're doing. Stay away from this place its disgusting.
bad,"Very unprofessional environment, they play favorites and they will work you on minimum wage until your fingers bleed. They also wouldn't let me take time off to visit a family member that was dying in a hospital."
bad,A typical day at Kohl's would be helping customers open a Kohl's credit card and assisting customers in finding merchandise on the sales floor.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,lot of drama between girls and hours suck for part-time employees no benefits for part-timers pay sucks as well co-workersare ok to work with
bad,"Went to work everyday and picked up after people, without the care of managers or cowokers. I never got a ""good job"" or a congrats."
bad,"love working here....i love shoes , so to have the chance to work with shoes all day was wonderful..the customers were awesome, the employees were welcoming. i couldnt have asked for a better palce to be!"
bad,Very horrible place to work. They make you solicit credit but don't pay you much. raises are in cents. They make you fill in at every job but cut you hours to give you the bare minimal. The training is inefficient. If you complain about anything they cut your hours. I would not recommend anyone of this job or company.
bad,"I was seasonal there and they paid minimum wage and saved money by having the seasonal employees work the overnight shifts (where we were paid time and a half). By the end of the holiday season, so many temps had stopped showing up that my schedule was changed constantly, often without informing me. The store manager only emerged from her office to yell at people and would retreat back into the back to avoid the customers. On a petty note, they waited to have their holiday until all the seasonal employees who managed to make it through the New Year wouldn't be invited."
bad,"not enough hours, poor management , long shifts, fast pace, good pay"
bad,Just didnt enjoy the work ethic. There was no respect at all and no matter how hard i worked i did not move up.
bad,"Great way to get your foot in the door in building a resume. "
bad,"Most of the management was rude. You had a required amount of credit card apps to get and if you didn't, they liked to show their disappointment. The cashiers just had to stand there. It was nice when it was busy but there were a lot of rude customers that liked to yell at you for prices."
bad,"Kohl's management was either incompetent when it came to enter employee payroll information, are they simple don't care. Not only did I not receive payment for hours, I worked on the proper payday but was informed I would not be paid until that following Monday. Not only are they careless with there payroll but rude and have no disregard for there mistakes. How hard is it to recite number in front of you. I will never work for Kohl's are anything affiliated with the company. They expect work without pay.who treats there employees that way a day after Christmas?? Khol's that's who!"
bad,"I worked here for three years and they treated their employees like throw-away cups.  No respect, no due compensation for jobs well done, etc.  Several people let go over trivial matters and i personally experienced harassment and embarrassment. For example, based on my years of experience in the field, i was considered senior. However, people that i trained, were given positions over me many times.  I started school and gave them a schedule, then they continued to harass me to provide the schedule, every couple months.  They do not listen to their employees, nor do they provide a forum in which we could express ourselves.  Also, when business was slow, they let us out early, or told us not to come in, and we did not get paid, or had to take a personal day to get paid. This happened fairly regularly."
bad,"Days were spent cleaning up behind people. I learned to be more courteous when trying on clothes,(someone has to put them away). My co-workers were ok. Hardest part of the job was not being trained properly and being left to fend for myself and doing 3 or 4 different jobs for minimum wage. Best part was meeting new people all the time."
bad,Kohl's Was horrible they required you to do a lot more than your job description and do not fairly compensate your pay with the amount of work you do for them. Horrible experience overall
bad,Each and everyday is always a challenge. I learn how to keep the store operating with all the obstacles that can get in the way whether its big or small. The most important thing is to get through those obstacles and staying focus while assisting in running a business. When I do my job right I am gaining experience in assisting a multi-million business.
bad,"set up the dock for the truck and unload the boxes to their own carts, then get them out to the floor."
bad,"I expected some descendent after all I am a customer and I worked very hard for minimum wage. The other employees did not train well and the manager gave minimal guidance. She blamed me for there lack of focus and direction. They lost a great employee and trusting person. Management asked for all feed back but when I gave it she resisted everything and then fired me. No training no process, no class. I know it's Kohls but I liked the store and I trusted they would be decent to me. Employee were back stabbing even though they showed me how to do things incorrectly and I told the manager like she asked me to. Only to get let go. Not nice!"
bad,Meant to be a place for kids to have fun but was more like an adult playground for the workers.
bad,I was so dedicated working here until I realized what this employer really does.  I got terminated Because my ops manager wouldn't open the shipping bathroom door or send cover when I had a emergency and requested assistance three times for it. Then he hung up on me the last time. So I went to him and called him unprofessional and it's messed up how there's favoritism and discrimination in here.
bad,"Working here was pure chaos, and it showed in the fact that employees seemed to be hired and quit on a daily basis. And the pay was horrible, especially considering that every time I walked into that place, I wanted to take a gun to my head. "
bad,"A typical day is busy, a high volume store with many things to do daily. Management are lazy, not motivating. Co-workers are frustrated, unhappy and non motivated. Hardest part of job....to see and hear the lack of appreciation to all of the hard workers. Most enjoyable part of job....making the customers happy and laughing with co-workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The Management were not helpful."
bad,"No Structure, supervisor wouldn't help employees, lack of hours"
bad,ringing up customers trying to open kohls accounts. had great co works fun people to work with.
bad,too much responsibility and not enough staff. Hated the high turn over rate. Never up to date on any tasks.
bad,The low pay results in having unqualified and inadequate employees doing jobs they can't handle.
bad,"I worked a lot of retail but this was the WORST by far! Management was a joke and there was absolutely little room to advance, it wasn't even spoken off."
bad,Horrible work environment. everyone was mean and the management played favoritism and it was very obvious to workers.
bad,"The pay is terrible but I like the customers and employees."
bad,"No one was a team at Kohls. I folded clothes. I helped with the cash register. We were always understaffed or overstaffed. The managers were always angry. Kohls was not a good place to work at, but I always tried to have a positive attitude."
bad,"My typical day at work is slow and can get boring! I'm use to working at a fast pace, I love a job where I'm able to work from the time I clock in till the time i clock out! At kohls, I'm given an assignment when I first get there and I'm finished with it way before the end of my shift! So I usually end up helping out on register or folding in the junior department. The managers do not give notice when things are going to change in the store and that makes it stressful on the associates!"
bad,"The team was nice, helpful, and very organized. Always on point and on time with everything."
bad,"Worst management team ever.You will work every holiday.Pay is under poverty level you get 20cent. They will PROMISE you  fulltime and,will not get.They do not care about employees.If it was a good place to work I would not be looking for a new job. If looking for full-time job keep looking.They will send you home all the time and get no hours.."
bad,Over worked and under paid. Oversea sweat shop workers get paid more oney than we do. It is a crying shame.
bad,"Overall easy job.  Nothing too straining for the brain to handle.  Lots of walking on concrete floors.  "
bad,The typical day at work consist of counting diamonds and jewelry that needs to be accounted for and documented daily. What I did learn was how cheap Kohl's really is when it comes to their employee's.Management is scarce when it comes to fair treatment. I had 1 really good manager and his name is Hank in the jewelry department. My co-worker's were clueless most of the time.The hardest part of the job was the diamond count. The most enjoyable was I guess paydays.
bad,I disliked working for this place because it lacked organization and managment.
bad,ring up and bag customers orders  and try and get them to get a credit card
bad,"All i can say is worst place i have ever worked."
bad,I had to put freight away as well as clean dressing rooms.  I learned good customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they need and my co-workers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Run workers like slaves. Can't get close to anyone because they hire a lot of workers. Seems like managers don't care for employees because they have so many of them.
bad,dont work here and waste your time unless you wanna be an underpaid slave..not just saying that to be a disgruntled employee either...this company is does not care about your wel being what so ever
bad,"The co-workers were ok to work with in this store. The customers are no different than they are in any job, but management harassment was about everyday. We had three different store managers in a short period of time because of how bad they were. I one day dislocated my knee; thus I was in a cast for three months until I could work properly. Till this day I still have problems and random extreme pain in my knee. The day after I went to the hospital I called out. A manager called me back and told me that I have one hour to come in or that I am fired. I told her about my situation and that I won't have time to get dressed as well as drive from an hour away to work. She told me that it is my problem and if I don't show up that I will be fired. I went and everyone told me to report her to corporate, but I never did it because other managers talked me out of it. The last manager treated me as if I did not understand English; thus I felt as if he was being racist towards me."
bad,on my second day of work I learned how to do the shoes department
bad,Awesome. The job really isn't that hard and everyone is pretty nice up there.I just wish they payed a
bad,"Felt like you are in boot camp! A lot has changed for the worse. Had to wear thick-sole shoes or your back and feet will hurt. Supervisors made themselves more than what they should have. The most enjoyable time at Kohls was lunch and going home. What I've learned co-workers always are sneaky; can't trust them but always be polite and talk very briefly, cause whatever you say can be used against you!"
bad,The management and supervisors were really rude especially in front of customers
bad,As a cashier/customer service associate I interact with lots of people on a daily basis.  I enjoy customer service and making sure that they leave the store happy and willing to come back.
bad,Kohl's is not a place for people with health problems to work at.
bad,"Bad management- was not fair at times toward employees views."
bad,I didn't like working here because they would have only one person to a truck and expect you to work fast but be safe both at the same time.
bad,My review of this work place is very low. I helped with truck restocked store and did some cashier work.  Management treated me horribly.  So my review of this job is it was stressful do to management.
bad,"A typical day would consist of standing in a 2 x 3 foot rectangle at the register for your whole shift without any break or lunch because they were just ""to busy"" to get to you. Management was very rude, disrespectful, and degrading. Managers would gossip and talk bad about fellow employees in front of other co-workers and customers."
bad,"Too many chiefs and not enough indians, almost nothing gets done and the blame is always placed on the understaffed workers. Practically no raises, no hours given to those that want to work, and the sense that you are always being watched and objectified. Not worth even going for an interview."
bad,This job is more for a retired person. Not fur filling at all and they don't treat you well.
bad,"One of the worst retail workplace I have ever worked.  While the sales staff are a great team. The management team manages through intimidation and overworks the underpaid staff. There have been many sales days when the staff have been minimal, which leads to long checkout lines and frustrated customers."
bad,"how to work with touch screen cash registers, I learned to multi task and help people apply for kohls credit"
bad,This company had very little respect for its associates and fellow employees and employers caused lots of drama. Very stressful environment.
bad,"A typical day at work is organizing, and putting back product where it goes. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Worked during the Christmas season so it was very busy. Busiest day was the day after Thanksgiving which made the job challenging. I liked meeting the customers.
bad,"Not understanding people, unperfessional, they dont work with college students so beware, their very vendictive and spitful people, they are full with dishonesty and dont bother calling the human resources because they are just as bad as the managers and dont ever get sick because that counts against you to "
bad,not respected worked hard and not enough breaks.learned how to work a PDA. co workers some were okay
bad,I like what I was doing but I did not like the way we were treated.
bad,as my first job don't really know what to expect. they paid very little worked bad hours. late one night early next day. i just liked having a job then but looking back now i wouldn't put up with that again.
bad,"Overworked and incredibly underpaid. Managers never took their job seriously, which resulted in a lot of layoffs."
bad,"I didnt like working here. To me it was just a paycheck. All they wanted was you getting those credit app out there. Your customers dont need to be harrassed the whole time they are shopping to get the credit card. You have the advertisment playing the entire time they are in there you dont need people walking around asking them or asking them when they get in there or when they leave. There were people who thanked me for not asking. "
bad,"This is horrible company to work for. The hours are horrible, the management is not pleasant nor do they care. "
bad,"environment friendly,face pace work,clean and stock shelves"
bad,"Will never work there again , will never shop there , the staff blows"
bad,Worked retail sales. Liked the work and the conditions. Got to dress up every day and loved interaction with customers and vendors. Not enough pay or benefits to support a family. Worked part time to augment family income while husband was very ill.
bad,This company is changing for the worse daily. They allow thieves to continue to work for them. They claim to have a work/life balance but that is a joke. Salaried managers work extreme hours. They are unappreciative of hourly associates until it comes associate survey time then they kiss associates butts to get a good number then they forget about you until the next go round. They are changing policies daily to benefit the company not the employee. I highly suggest not choosing this employer
bad,I will never work for this corporartion again. All together the company was a very unethical place for anyone to work. It was truly a shame.
bad,"Although I did learn a lot of tasks, it was on my own. No help progressing at all. It was the first job where I got promoted, and was thrown to the wolves with no training what so ever."
bad,When I started at Kohls I loved it so much. I loved talking with my co-workers meeting new people. But it slowly started to change after some time. I felt that all they revolved around were people signing up for a Kohls credit card and those employees who did not get a customer to do so were not praised for the other good work they did or even for the effort of them trying. It does every now and then feel good to hear your boss say your doing a good job and here they failed to do so.After awhile I dreaded going to work everyday because I felt I wasn't appreciated for my hard work.
bad,Okay place to work for students or single people but not for anyone with a family.
bad,"It was like walking on egg shells the entire day not knowing if the store manager was going to blow-up or be a friendly person that day. I did learn many skills working in the store. I just wished there was room for advancement. Management team work cornor people and make them feel bad about their job, it was very unprofessioonal. I didnt agree with their personal work ethics making fun of your sales associates isn't professional at all. Most enjoyable part was the few good people that worked their tried to make it feel like you were working with family."
bad,"When I got hired for Kohls it was a seasonal job during the Christmas holidays. It was probably the most high paced,muti tasking job that I have yet to work. I was constantly on my feet running around doing this doing that. But I enjoyed the people I worked with."
bad,This is a very unfair company to work for. They will work you to death and then they treat you unfairly. They gossip too much and talk about each other and don't like to work.
bad,"this job really wasnt for me. you get horrible hours, its super quiet."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I worked for Kohls for a little over a month when I quit because couldnt take the verbal abuse any longer. They PUSH PUSH PUSH credit card apps and emails and if you dont meet the quota then you got a verbal lashing. Most of the time it was in the breakroom but sometimes it was right out on the sales floor. Also the paricular store I worked for was ok with fratinising, the jewlery counter manager was dating one of the CSR's and heaven forbid another female associate talk to him for any reason even work related and the managers would just look in the other direction."
bad,I liked working with the different sales associates and helping the customers. The management was uncaring and unsympathetic to the needs of the employees.
bad,"Kohls has no opportunity for advancement. I want to move up, but i cant working there, so i'd like to venture out and look for better opportunities."
bad,"I worked at the returns desk, my day was filled with processing returns; purchases; exchanges; credit card payments; answering phones; and handling customer complaints. In this position I learned how to look up merchandise in the mainframe inventory computer. I got along very well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a management team that did not care about their employee's, I was in this position for almost three years, yet when I left the company I was working between 4 and 9 hours a week even though I continually asked for more hours, and the managers were unapproachable if there was a problem, unless it was a customer complaint. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people."
bad,"A typical day consisted of stocking merchandise, tending fitting rooms and shelves, and respond to customer inquiries."
bad,"Kohl's in Peru, Illinois very likely has a turnover rate matching the amount of time their supervisors and managers spend sitting in the back office with their high heels on...around 98% would be my best, educated guess."
bad,"I have to say the interview process was no good. That should have tipped me off right away. They did a group interview with a bunch of us there. No one looked at my resume or asked about my previous experiences. They just went around the room asking everyone questions and if you didn't hurry up and give a quick answer you could tell the manager was impatient. Before letting us leave the manager stressed how he had difficulty finding good workers. Well, maybe if you actually read the applicant's resumes and spoke to them in a more private interview you would be able to tell who was a decent person and who wasn't. But I suppose it's a lot easier just assuming everyone applying is an idiot not worthy of your time instead of placing blame where it belongs - your interview techniques. I now have a decent job elsewhere. Will never consider working at Kohls again. Nor will I shop there again."
bad,I learned that retail is very difficult work without much input from management. The schedule is not conclusive to a good work/life balance.
bad,hate it no hours or anything. plus managment is not all on the same train.
bad,It was a stressful environment with the constant pressure of selling credit cards and soliciting e-mails. Associates and customers were rude. I did not get the hours I wanted to work and I worked from 1 PM to 1 AM. Too many late hours.
bad,Low Pay long hours very busy. Working all weekends. on your feet all day.
bad,"Review daily replenishment ,ensured deep fill area for the day is being blitzed, provided best customer service, smiled and encourage others to smile, supervised and assist in the accurate and efficient processing customer transaction, conduct one or two- minutes touch bases with associates, monitor breaks and lunch , monitor daily credit and solicits e-mail addresses from customers for daily goals from associates, opening and closing the store, daily cash verification in vault, performed other duties as assigned sales floor and fitting rooms"
bad,Did not get enough hours and having to work hard of every time I worked. No attention from anyone unless you do something wrong.
bad,I did not like it. The cashier basically works the hardest and gets looked down on by all. Having to get customers to sign up for credit accounts so that the managers can get credit for it.
bad,Retail stores are usually very crowded with personnel and they only give you approximately 15 hours a week and instead of raising your hours they go and hire another person.
bad,This was a part-time job. It did not pay well. I work evenings and knights. The store was very un-organized.
bad,"they failed to respect me as an associte, did not resepct my wishes when i asked for any thing. the biggest issue i had with them was the fact that i was never fired and i never quite they just stopped schedualing so when i filed for unemployeement they did not give it to me"
bad,"The manager was a nasty man and I got out as quick as I could. When you run your company with short staff (1 person) running 3 departments while also stocking, setting the floor, dressing room and returns... and and while you are at it, we need help at SOP to cover everyone's lunch and then why did I not get everything done? Really?"
bad,"I would never work at Kohl's again, They do not give enough hours I was dissatisfied with Kohl's."
bad,thye didnt work with me at all the boss or mananger was very rude
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Management is inconsiderate and don't care about their workers at all. Kept calling and telling me not to come to work because they didn't have the money in their budget then laid me off three days before Christmas. Had been told the entire time that I was there that I did really good work and was going to be hired on permanently, only to get sent packing at the most inappropriate time! Technology Manager only gave out work he didn't want to do, pretty much grunt work that was unacceptable or beneath him."
bad,"I would clean, manage cash register, handle conflicts with customers, stock shelves, and manage returns of merchandise."
bad,horrible customers that are rude and management that isnt very helpful when dealing with them. high demand to sell credit cards if you fail to do so your name will go on a list for all to see i guess its a way of humiliating associates. but for those who do outstanding when it comes to credit like i its a awesome reward on your check
bad,"I love Kohl's and I am sure that they are a great company to work for, but my experience was not that good."
bad,The management was not organized well. It was not a pleasant experience.
bad,"NEVER work for the Kohl's in Corpus Christi, TX. The store is run horribly! The current store manager is terrible, and the assistant managers are so lazy! They take advantage of their employees and give pitiful raises, and don't ever promote from within. They will literally work you until you break. They hassle you about everything. When you call in, they tell you that you need to come in and try to guilt you into coming in anyway. They make promises they can't keep, unless what they say is in writing they don't stick to their word. The store is seriously messed up. Not to mention the store has been running without a misses or home supervisor for about two years now. They are interviewing people to have documentation, but never fill the position, because they have regular associates to do the dirty work, without the pay raise. I worked there for two years and I am not proud to say it. They have completely ruined the idea of working for any other corporation ever again for me. Corporate doesn't even help with these problems either, I know several associates that have called and they side with the store manager because he sucks up/lies to them to make them happy."
bad,Kohl's is oriented around the objectives of the company without regard that employees are more than just someone to stand there and look cute. Treat your employees right and they will be happy to be at work. Happy employees make happy customers.
bad,"no recognition or pay increase for the amount of work you put in. management does not communicate with one another, which makes taking orders and tasks very difficult. some co-workers are very nice and some are just rude. the hardest part of the job was trying to balance all the tasks assigned, given the lack of communication. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
bad,"I was hired as a Loss Prevention Supervisor with no background in retail. The District Loss Prevention Manager stated that I would go through a 3 month training program, which I only received approx 19 days of so called training before I was placed in a store ( less than 1 month ). The DLPM would then call or send emails asking why I didnt complete certain task and I would advise him that I was not trained or had not been advised on all the task the job required. On several different occasions I ask the DLPM for further training and assistance and I was denied everytime. Finally, my daughter developed Pneumonia which required me to stay home with her for several days, I ask the DLPM for a leave of absence and that was also denied."
bad,"Management was rude, didnt feel as if customers were there first pority."
bad,i never got called into work enough and the costumers were rude and disrespectful
bad,Not enough hours
bad,employees. are great.lousy mgmt team. 2 out 4 are unfair which lead to my departure
bad,"This company hires you for one thing and expect you to do other jobs, that you were not hired for. They also expect you to stay after your scheduled time without asking. I would not work these people again even if I was homeless & they were the only ones to hire me! The starting pay is $7.65/hr and they send you home if you reach 40 hrs for the week. I worked for this company for 6 months & never got a raise or my 30, 60, & 90 day reviews."
bad,Management is extremely rude and they have favorites. They are never there when you need them. training is horrible and they give you no hours even if your full time. Very Ghetto Would not recommend.
bad,"Very unprofessional."
bad,"At first, management was great. Then, it went downhill quickly. If management dos not like you, your hours will be cut dramatically. Working in retail, I do not believe that management should be talking about their associates on the sales floor."
bad,"terrible experience - no support- from associates or management- too many bosses and none of them know what they're doing, I don't see how they will be in business much longer"
bad,"Do not work here run away. I worked here for 2years, and the work is ok. The mangers aspect a lot from you and even if you are part time. My coworkers are ok some where nice. What really bother the most is the customers think they know better than you or talk down to you like your less intelligent because you work retail. Run away do not work here!"
bad,Very low pay. Constant walking and standing. Employees are not happy. Management not nice to employees. Only get full time work if you are a checkout  associate.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I was supposed to train for 4 weeks. I got to the 2 week mark and I was expected to know how to use the camera system efficiently- even though half the time I was on the computer doing training videos or watching my supervisor be on the cameras since there is a strict quota for them too. ( I couldn't catch anyone until my 4 week training was up and I was certified.) From South Jersey/city areas all the way to country areas with less foot traffic, all stores are required to accommodate the same number of catches a week. even if you stare at the screens all day and don't catch anyone- it looks very poorly on you and the manager will start micromanaging you until you are fired (if you don't pick up the pace). I thought I had a loyal co workers but out of no where the people training me started talking badly about me and spreading lies to the other store co workers. I know people aren't always nice everywhere you go but they were spreading the type of rumors that put my job on the line. Very drama filled and clique-y. The one girl training me had a mental breakdown and was about to quit and go home at the beginning of an 8 hour shift..."
bad,"this is a good job if you like constantly being put down and treated poorly by your managers and people that wish they were managers. also if you’re in high school and don’t want to work over 30 hours, don’t work here. however, i did meet some of my closest friends working here."
bad,"If you would like to spend your days getting yelled at by both management and customers alike, having hours disappear from your paychecks, and being lied to about a nonexistent holiday pay, then Kohl’s is the place for you!"
bad,This was my first job at 19 yrs old and it was stressful!! My manager only wanted my discount to buy herself makeup and sneakers and I never got a thank you. I was a cashier and I was vulnerable surrounded by costumers with no help from anyone! I always felt relieved at the end of the day when I could go home. I'm glad it was only a seasonal position
bad,"As a student with a difficult major and planning to go to grad school after graduation, I wanted something with 10-20 hours a week which is what was promised to me during the interviews and after interviews as a seasonal hourly sales associate. However, during exam week they scheduled me for 34 hours and when I told my manager that I was not able to come into work for two days because I have 5 finals (after not missing any since September) they told me I needed to either quit or come in as well as telling me that I needed to start studying for my exams earlier ending the conversation with ""that is your choice good luck"" and then hung up on me. "
bad,"There are very mean and rude women who work there. If they don't like you, they WILL find a way to get rid of you. Plus, they ""Kohls"" takes out "" associate tax"" ?! Please don't waste your precious time."
bad,"Bad management, negative environment with co workers on top of management, little to no training, with high expectations and managers constantly yell."
bad,"The process and the store seemed disorganized. Not enough computers for training and every bit of space was used. "
bad,They really fired me because of their irresponsibility and lack of good leadership skills and I would never work there ever again and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else either
bad,"This is for Kohls Lynnwood, specifically. People are hired and quit within a month. There is no communication from managers to the rest of staff. You get paid sick time but you aren't really able to take it because if you do you'l get harassed by management. I had a coworker who got food poisoning and came into work a few days later, still hardly able to talk and when she almost passed out on the sales floor she was bullied so badly by management that she cried. She filed a harassment claim but it didn't go anywhere. We're paid less than everyone else around us and are worked harder than we have any right to be. There is no life/work balance, it's just work and then go home and sleep for the next day. I'm full time but I'm only getting 2 hours more than the part timers, so 37-39 hours is normal here. The store is filthy the customers are filthy, there's so much garbage everywhere and the salesfloor looks like black friday everyday (compared to the Redmond store's black friday). 10/10 would not recommend."
bad,Not a fair work place no hours and always the bottom on the totem pole no matter how hard you work. Management cant keep your request of days off right and when they mess up you have to fix it.
bad,Kohl’s is a company that expects you to catch shoplifters in stores that do not have high foot traffic. If you don’t catch a certain amount of people or meet their hpa goals you will be put on probation or even demoted. Management is never in touch with you and never checks up on you. Training was not helpful at all and you have pass a LP exam with a 96 or over before being certified to stop dishonest customers. You will also receive constant emails from managers praising other officers who are catching more people then you. No room for growth.
bad,"Inconsistent hours that are typically on the low side, but when you are there then expect to get worked like crazy. Some managers were great, some were rude and condescending to the point you have to bite your tongue during every interaction. The training was very short and skipped over much important information, which you’ll be punished for not knowing even if it isn’t your fault. Selling the credit card is pushed to borderline religious levels and makes the job stressful. Breaks are rarely on time or sometimes not given at all and the schedule is only flexible for some favored employees but not everyone else. You won’t do much here but make spare change and learn to tolerate the most entitled, rude customers."
bad,Kohls Loss Prevention is a pathethic excuse for Loss Prevention. The company has no idea what Loss Prevention actually is. They prefer you catch $5 jewelry cases all day long but dont seem to mind when someone runs out the door with $3000 worth of merchandise. Was never actually taught anything and sent on my own to figure everything out. Training was horrible. The people i had training me were more focused on their $5 jewelry cases than actually showing me how to do anything would never work there again.
bad,No work-life balance and the management is constantly turning over. I loved the staff that worked for me and made the best of my time there. I learned a lot.
bad,"Aside from the fact the GM would complain about her life in morning meetings and then degrade everyone there, she would micromanage and had gossip puppets that she'd give more hours and preference to. and whilst I was at the top 2 of credit apps in the store nearly every week, I asked for Sundays off and an occasional Saturday so I could actually see my stepson, and she said it was her time and her weekends and I couldn't have any off. She's the devil incarnate and I know people like her should NEVER be in ""leadership"". The whole store couldn't stand to be around her."
bad,This is the worst place to work. I hear corporate is better and fun but does that give them a right to treat store employees as nobodies. The idea of do more with less is taken to an extreme at Kohl’s and they actually think they give service.
bad,You get great discounts on clothes but if you r expecting supplemental income or additional money to pay bills - at $9.00 an hour forget it - this is definitely not the place to be.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I got minimum hours and management accused me of doing wrong things when in reality it was their own mistakes. Favoritism towards certain employees. If they didn’t like you then you didn’t get a lot of hours at all.
bad,"Poor treatment of people in all ways: learning, pay, hours, d2d treatment. Would never work there again. Shop there. Recommend shopping there. And horrible, condescending so-called “management”."
bad,This is a waste of time and very stressful. The High school environment gets old real quick. OVER WORKED and UNDER PAID. Management acts like they care about you but they don't. And don't make the admin mad cause she'll cut your hours. What a joke. Allot of bull.
bad,"The store manager boasted about not knowing how to do many of the tasks in the store during morning huddles, allowed one of the area supervisors to do absolutely no work and STILL get a raise. One of the assistant mangers is simply going through the motions while she plans her escape strategy. The other assistant manager transferred from another store, stating that she would quit if she did not get the transfer. She also spends all of her time talking and absolutely none of it listening. The tenured associates in this store make their own rules. They are constantly committing time card fraud, getting away with not doing their job and angering other team members off trying to be a manager while nothing more than a lazy uneducated department lead. The store manager choses who she will write up for attendance issues based on how much you brown nose, she does NOT know how to make a schedule that is conducive to the workload and and lacks any kind of leadership qualities."
bad,"Very Very low pay.  virtually 0 opportunity for advancement.  There are very few full time jobs within any given store and they rarely open up.  The pay for the guys in the warehouse unloading trucks, sorting cloths, setting up displays, heavy lifting is the same as employees standing at a register all day.  Most employees do not value or care about their job because most are part time and the pay is so low that it attracts the bottom of the barrel.  I worked with former convicts."
bad,"Don’t waste your time working there. They start off giving you 20 or more hours then the following week the cut your hours, sometimes you’ll be schedule 4hrs and that’s just a waste of gas. You always have to work short staffed"
bad,The admin girl was a real witch.  She did not like me from the minute she took over her position.  She gradually reduced my hours to only 4 hours PER WEEK.  Others that were hired after me got up to 20 hours per week.  Is THAT fair ??
bad,"The management team is the worst. They all fight with each other and as a supervisor you are damned if you do and damned if ya don’t. "
bad,Will cut your hours without notice.  Store manager is emotionally abusive.  Store is constantly hiring bc everyone is chased off by toxic environment.
bad,some of the management was terrible you could tell they had favorites. Always would treat younger employees badly because they knew they could get away with it. not very nice at all they would treat you badly if you didn't get credits that day so you just fell like a number.
bad,"They’re very under staffed and there would be one worker assigned to multiple different areas which was almost impossible to recover at the end of the night. The way (some) management speaks to the associates is ridiculous and absolutely disrespectful. Depending on who closes the store there will be so much to do because you walk into a mess. It was an okay place to work over the holidays because there were enough employees to get everything done in a timely manner.  I was a full time dual enrolled student and in my last year of school. I requested time off in April/ May for my finals and studying which was previously discussed with my manager. I spoke to them (days before) about not getting off one crucial day that I requested and instead of working with me to find someone they told me I would need to find someone or call out. I worked to find someone and couldn’t so I had to call out which I tried to do hours before my shift. One of my assistant managers pleaded with me to come in and told me to call my manager later and let them know. I called my manager and he gave me an ultimatum, I could “make kohl’s a priority” or “part ways”. They do not care about other commitments (such as school) that you have and was a complete waste of my time. I wouldn’t recommend that anyone work here unless you’re trying to devote all of your time and social life to it."
bad,"I had two days of training with the one other girl that worked in the department and then was never scheduled with her again. We were always understaffed, so I was expected to run the beauty, jewelry and intimates department by myself as well as back up on registers. The general manager at the store I worked at has an absurd amount of complaints against her and yet she hasn’t been fired, so it seems that HR just doesn’t give a hoot."
bad,First off they only pay you 9.25$. Most of the employees at kohl’s Pittsburgh Pa are older people who are kinda rude the younger staff. The Mangers always put their stress that they had on the staff which made it overwhelming. They don’t pay you at all and the training process was unorganized and wasn’t done properly. Overall everything is not organized. They had me cover all of the women’s section and Juniors by myself ..... Then they would get upset if everything isn’t done properly. They need a bigger staff 2-3 people per section . I don’t recommend working here honestly I hated it so much :(
bad,"Managers are not helpful at all. Managers expect unrealistic expectations and bombared you with daily tasks no matter how busy the store is. They are more focused on sales goals and credits then the overall satisfaction and well being of thier employees. If and when at anytime you become less useful to their agenda(which basically means if you're not practically living there working) they will cut your hours DRASTICALLY which to be honest I believe is a premeditated tactic to make you put in your two weeks or quit, that way they aren't required to offer you severance or unemployment for letting you go. This Corporation is HONESTLY THE MOST GREEDY AND UNREALISTIC AND UNFAIR CONPANY YOU CAN WORK FOR."
bad,"Working at Kohl's was a horrible and stressful experience. They gave me multiple different jobs, but most of the time wouldn't give any direction. Was yelled at and harassed for not asking customers if they wanted to open a kohls charge and was accused of not doing my job. Overall a very poor experience and would often cry in the bathrooms because of how i was treated. Would not recommend working here as they treat people who can't get credits unfairly and do not pay properly. Very negative experience as I've worked retail in the past and have had a much better experience than this."
bad,The team is good everyone is super nice but the managers are the opposite they just care about what looks good for them. They also pay way to little for everything they want you to do as well as deal with on a daily basis.
bad,Do not work here I was a sales floor associate for the men’s department and on a busy Saturday or Friday they would oftentimes only have one person scheduled for the whole shift. It was way too much work for one person to clean out all the fitting rooms and “recover” the whole department I did my best with what the managers told me but they were very hands off and when you didn’t do something that you were never told about they’d get angry and wouldn’t understand that THEY DIDNT TRAIN THE EMPLOYEES! There were many things I was expected to do that they never told me about! Sometimes they’d call us up to cashier for extra help when it got busy and because there was no one else on the floor it was just a mess to clean up. Would never recommend anyone to work at Kohl’s. Fellow coworkers never did anything to help and most were super lazy!
bad,If you need a job use it as a stepping stone.  Management is lazy and set in current ways. You wont get promoted till someone is fired or dies.  Run as far away as you can!
bad,"It's a mess from the first minute you get there until you leave. You'll be given ridiculous tasks and actually be expected to do jobs that aren't yours. I learned that my time was worth way more than $9 and a 15% discount. Management was ok, but most of the time they would give you one job to do in 6 hours, from organizing each and every isle to folding all the towels and rugs...literally for 6 hours.They have those walkie talkie earpieces that most questions asked by the low level staff are answered very condescendingly. The hardest part of the job was just juggling all the extra non sense you have little to no training for. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find something, they were typically grateful as long as it wasn't over the phone. I would recommend this job to girls 16-19, not a job for guys; as you will more than likely be bored out of your mind and be expected to do all the heavy lifting and the dull jobs, it's not worth it in your 20's."
bad,"I was initially hired as a seasonal associate.  I experience chronic migraines which started getting worse and led to me calling in sick.  I provided a note from my doctor indicating that this is a serious medical condition and I may have to miss some work due to it.  Management then told me that I needed to have a form they provided completed by doctor.  I had the form completed turned it in and then was told my last scheduled day, which was a few days after I provided the documentation, that they did not need me anymore because I was hired as a seasonal associate and they did not have enough hours.  A week or so later I was looking for another part time job and saw that they posted a job opening for the position that they supposedly did not have a enough hours for.  If you have a disability (which chronic migraines do fall under the ADA) I would not recommend applying for a job at this company because they are not understanding at all."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"When I started working there I asked if it was a seasonal position and the manager had told me no. After the holiday's I had been called into the managers office and was asked if I'd be willing to come back after the 3 week waiting period and 3 weeks later, I got a letter in the mail saying I was fired."
bad,"There was nothing exciting about my position here, If you are a student and looking for extra income, this may work for you, but the managers expect for you to put this job before schooling which is unfair. You work so hard physically and don't get acknowledged for it. There were co-workers who were prejudice and the managers payed no attention to this activity, so sometimes it made your days harder there because teamwork is required to get a job done."
bad,The management is very poor. The hours were not flexible. The company expects the best but devalues the employees. Not a place one could grow and advance in.
bad,Cashier come into work.  Clean area. Ring up customers.  Reminded by supervisors how many credit cards sold and advised how many you will need to sell for the day. Everyday. I learned how to push products onto customers.It was hardest standing all the time.  Breaks were hard to take after standing for hours (min. three).  New employees are not a part of the cliche in Waldorf store that the long time employees enjoy.
bad,Nothing good to say about this company. Pay is low and management is totally clueless! Would not recommend this cmpany to anyone. Management is out of touch.
bad,"This was my first job years ago, and lets put it this way it is your typical retail job that pays minimum wage with maximum work load. They will schedule 1 to 2 people for a department of the store to close. Let me remind you that department requires at least 4 closers to calmly do the work. They try to save on payroll and will schedule you the bare minimum, so if anyone calls out you will be desperate to accept that shift when they call. The work amount was insane, especially in the misses department. The favoritism is undeniably unfair to those who deserve promotions. You are not judged by your work ability but your ability to charm the managers, digusting. I have never been so unhappy at any job in my life. I know employees that are still working here to this date, and say not much has changed since 2013. Absolutely despicable in 2018 this company still carries on this way."
bad,"The general manager played favorites constantly. They undermined the employees, and did not treat them fairly. Fairly easy job, but not worth working with the terrible management."
bad,I worked in Carmel Indiana. I had three female bosses that were always in a bad mood and or starting drama. They all thought there were the GM. The culture was literally awful. Not a fan at all. Very very low pay
bad,"There's only a few managers that truly care about the stores well-being, the rest seem so careless and mean. "
bad,"This job is good for just like a seasonal or summer job. If you decide to work here full time, you're not gonna like it. At my location there is not enough people here to have everything done that they want to. A lot of the customers you get are very  rude and mean. The management only cares about getting credit and they don't really care about you and they gave the customers whatever they want most of the time. The only part I liked about this job is the discount and one of the managers. It is very fast paced and demanding on everyone but if you learn how to do a lot in this store, you'll be the crutch for everyone. They also don't pay a lot here and don't give you many hours even though they say they will."
bad,"I personally didn’t like working at kohls , because a lot of them were very disrespectful . Depending on which manager was on duty they were rude when you hadn’t to call off , and couldn’t cover the shifts they need . The only reason i liked it was because if i needed more hours i could get them! They barely worked around my schedule . The person training me left me hanging and only taught me how to put the clothes away didn’t tell me i needed a walk or did tell me i had to answer the calls or what to do i had to either figure it out or ask the managers which made them upset . On the plus side almost everyone else there was SUPER helpful and all , but maybe 2 of the managers was very nice !"
bad,"Drama drama drama...the store was always understaffed no one knew what they were doing, people always late, always calling out, poor communication, disrespect from the managers to employees they belittle you in front of customers and other employees."
bad,I didn’t not appreciate the management. They would tell us that we were low on budget and that everyone needed to lower their hours just so they can save money for themselves and get bigger bonuses. They do not care about their employees. Terrible working place.
bad,This store was a total nightmare to work at. SUPER stressful for the minimum wage they were paying. A couple of people would work themselves to death while the majority of the associates would sit on their phones and avoid working whenever possible. Cashiers would be rude to customers and talk back and forth to each other about personal issues while checking out customers. VERY discriminatory to certain races on the front end...so terrible that I no longer shop there.
bad,I loved shopping there but it wasn't my favorite place to work. I liked all the employees I worked with except they had poor management at the store I worked for.
bad,"I've written one of these reviews before but Kohls has an automatic response set up to this website in order to contradict any negative. All I can tell you is I lived it. People in corporate environment have no clue and they are candy coating things that never happen to them."
bad,The managers were horrible. You couldn't get assistance from managers. The managers were also rude to the customer flat out. Having to play many roles at work due to not having help from a manager. The managers did not help me when I told them I was scheduled for an exam in school. They are very inconsistent.
bad,The  associates were good people. The management was not good . The Schedule was inconsistent  and the timing of work to get done . The mangers was rude and didn't take the associate seriously . We had to stay over night to clean up the store even as cashiers when they had overnight crew to fix things .
bad,Clock in walk through metal detectors start work awful training learn as I go along management expect you to know everything with only entry level experience the buddy system is in effect the hardest part of the job is employees An temps trying to get you fired the best part of the job is going home
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Management is very poor, they play favorites. Work hours can change the night before. Pay is very poor for the stress and work you put. I would not recommend this job as a forever job."
bad,"This department store is fast paced as expected in retail. However, the workload is highly stressful (if you work on the floor in a department) and not compensated fairly in my opinion. You do get help however you must communicate clearly with management or else they assume you are doing well. You do have the ability to grow within the company but expect raises to be much lower than expected. Thankfully they do provide 2 paid 15 minute breaks and an unpaid 30 minute lunch for a full 8 hour shift which is great and much needed."
bad,"The manager and assistant manager made this the most aggravating first job. I would get 19 hours a week but would be forced to stay much later and come in every single day off meaning they called me in every single day I was not scheduled to work, so 19 hours turned into 4 hours every single day (they say you can say no but you are manipulatively expected to say yes.) Honestly not a huge deal, I got a job to work, it would just be nice to have a schedule that reflected what I would actually work rather than never knowing and always anticipating having to work not getting to enjoy life. I could go on but management has changed so complaining about that won't mean anything, I just hope they fixed their ways of business."
bad,"The management staff of my store was highly opinionated and had ""favorite"" employees."
bad,"Did not like working there. Never felt comfortable or apart of a Team. There was no room for advance. No cross training as a cashier to other departments. Wanted you to go after a customer if alarm went off even with a long line of customers, which is not safe and very annoying and aggravating to customers. The pay was every week with little unfair hours that paid you really nothing. The manager was very uppity and fake. She had no sympathy for in work or out of work personal feelings, even though you'd be told by her to communicate whatever your going through, to her, so you can compromise so it wouldn't affect your work day. It was not good."
bad,"They will never give you hours even if asked, the managers and staff leads are incredibly racist and hostile to customers, and the overall interaction with fellow associates is less than desirable. If i could take back the 3 months i worked there I would."
bad,"Not doing this part because Indeed will not allow me to speak the truth on this company. Let's just say equality is not there and certain people will rarely, if ever, be promoted."
bad,"For the first several months on the job, I thought Kohl's was great - until you realize that the culture is the exact opposite of what it actually is. From what I experienced at Kohl's, managers are mainly tenured individuals who have run the business into the ground - literally circling the drain. Little room for advancement (due to tenured managers with ""I am next in line for promotion"" mentality"" and managers who do not have the skills or core competencies to be in the jobs they are in).  Company operates way too lean, causing unbearable work hours (no work life balance).  Salary and base compensation extremely low for expected work hours and demand. Bonuses for non-management contributors minimal. Inability to even take advantage of perks like the wellness center due to unbearable work hours. Not a good company for millennials."
bad,"As an employee of this company for over a year, I witnessed first hand the poor ethical treatment of employees. Myself, and anyone else the manager seemed to dislike. Numerous occasions where favoritism and bias were shown in a very unpleasant and unprofessional manner. No support for the Beauty Department at all, and even animosity and disregard for the workers of this department."
bad,"Not only was management fake as could be, but majority of the coworkers were just as fake. Everyone either spoke to you because they wanted to be nosy about your life, or they wanted to have a reason to judge you. Management wasn't obviously biased with the coworkers, the managers seemed to hate everyone equally and only care about themselves and their breaks. "
bad,The amount of work they make you do for the little pay is absurd. The management at the time was very fake and you could tell she did not care about each team member. The hardest part of the job was he dressing rooms which I was always assigned to be in charge of. Kohl's has no limit amount of clothing to take in the dressing room and so customer's would have 30 items inside out on the floor. It would give me the worst back pain and would have to wear a heating patch to get through the day.
bad,They never schedule you like they are meant to my schedule would interfere with my other jobs managers and supervisors enjoy humiliating you and its just so bad. Nothing is good. Tried many time to speak to the manager that i had a second job didnt care still would keep me there claims they are flexible they are not even close
bad,"difficult place for a college student to work due to the hours, not flexible and miss communication with management hectic work placd with not enough coverage to run the store"
bad,I regret working at the Kohl's warehouse but it was honestly quick money for the end year. Was a hot environment and the only thing that made the job good was the fun and caring employees around me. Maybe I didn't enjoy the job as my first job and me being 20 years old also.
bad,"Kohls is the best place to work. Our co-workers are friendly and will stop to help you if needed."
bad,"The supervisors played favorites and the only offered minimum hours, they were not accommodating to anyone with a family and hours that were given were very low so they did not have to give benefits"
bad,During the aspect and duties of my profession we were very limited on what we could do and not do. This became very dangerous on apprehension especially in the area where I was located
bad,"This is a miserable place to work, it is no wonder why they have such a high rate of turnover for employees. The management doesn't know what they are doing, and constantly mislead their employees about what exactly they are supposed to be doing. The company requires you to push credit card applications very aggressively, requiring you to ask each customer a minimum of three times if they would like to apply for a card. Even after they have said no, you have to ask again and again. Yet they can't seem to figure out why their customer service ratings are so low. Management doesn't know what the store policy is, and training is minimal for a cashier position. Their cashiers are very under-trained, and after making mistakes, the management is very demeaning rather than helpful and motivating. I would not recommend that anyone work for this company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Although i enjoyed my co-workers, management had very poor leadership skills and schedule flexibility was nearly non- existent. I worked here when i was in high school and they had me working until 11pm on week nights recovering the store. It was always under staffed and pay was low at $7.55/hr. The experience completely ruined a place i used to enjoy shopping at."
bad,management did not want employees to peruse higher education. Just want the job done. does not have the best working atmosphere to help employees advance careers.
bad,"Let me start off by saying work-a-holics run in my family and I was starting to burn out after 2 years of working for Kohls. Kohls has job security however, advancement and raises are few and VERY far between. Management is ever changing, and there is a lack of energy all around. The schedule is usually incorrect to what days you can or cannot work. It takes a lot of talking with management to get your schedule right, example, you write what days or times you need off for schooling purposes, they will try and schedule you during some of your classes. It's fine if it's a one time deal but if you work during a class once they will assume you can do it all the time. In other words they take advantage of you. It's a good starting job for a 16 year old looking for work. But after a certain age, just cut your losses and find a better job."
bad,"Had unrealistic expectations on the amount of Kohls cards to sell for each shift for cashiers. Expected customer service reps to deal with angry customers yelling at them about things that hey could not change. Managers were completely inefficient and the store manager promoted people she liked, not based on qualifications. Often expected closers to stay 2-3 hours after their shift to clean store."
bad,Redmond store is managed poorly by both district manager and in store managers/assistant managers. There is no people management. Only task driven. Management cares nothing about associates
bad,When i worked here i got maybe 5 hours a week. I was only payed $8.05 a hour. When i spoke with the managers about something they had attitudes about my perspectives. When i got injured they were very rude and not understanding.
bad,Getting verbally abused by customers while the only appreciation displayed from management is for getting a customer to open a credit card.
bad,"The only good thing I can say is I met some wonderful people."
bad,"Not worth the $9/hr  I was paid. Hired on for seasonal and constantly had to call every week for hours. Was never put on schedule unless I got hold of a higher up manager and when I did get hours it was all of 8 for the week. Later I found out that the reason I wasn't getting hours was because I was ""accidentally"" termed along with half the others that were hired with me. Because they had to put me back into the system I missed a weeks pay. "
bad,"I was excited to work in a place that i love to shop, but quickly discovered the majority of management are rude, condescending and   belittling.  They treat employee's like we are children and are unintelligent. Staff morale is low and EVERYONE talks about management negatively. Favoritism is shown to people who have worked there for several years, and those employees are also rude to new staff. I frequently witnessed managers barking orders, talking down, and disrespecting cashiers in front of customers! incredibly unprofessional place to work. There are a lot of talented, hard working people who work in this location, but they are unappreciated and treated less than by ego toting managers and assistant managers. The employee discount is not worth being treated poorly. Also, good luck getting a break when you need one."
bad,"I witness first hand that with all the opinions and ""leaders"" that nothing truly gets done correctly because too many people are concerned with what others are doing. Since every one is trying to be a boss in every one else's task very few people are pulling their weight in what their task at hand may be. Many people spent the entire day on only one of the days task because they were never provided the support that the section required."
bad,I have 5 years experience as a cashier and customers service. I have never had a bad experience with an employer before until I began working with Kohl's.I only had 2 hours of training and the managers and permanents would get mad if I asked questions or for help. the managers are rude and sarcastic in a passive aggressive way. I had asked help from a permanent and she called me out on my mistakes and pretty much called me stupid in front of a customer. I only lasted 3 weeks and I quit. People there are arrogant and not helpful at all.
bad,this is a low paying job with work hours all over the place. the employees are not very happy to be there and their bad attitudes reflect on to others.
bad,I worked here seasonally this past winter and that was all it took for me to see that i didn't want to work there full time. The managers do whatever they want and I'm being honest when i say that they don't care one bit about customers. The work was very fast paced and no one is treated equally. There is way too much drama between coworkers. The only good things about this job were the breaks and the discount.
bad,"The mangers and supervisors don't have the right skills to be leading  the employees. Some of the mangers don't bother helping out the employees when they need it the most. Some of the supervisors don't respect the employees, and they talk about them with other employees. It is an uncomfortable place to work at."
bad,"its an place where you should avoid working for.... management treats it employees very rudely and when you want to either get more hours or promoted, they reject you without cause or reason"
bad,"The managent team at the Acworth store is awful. They do not communiate with each other or the associates. The store manager is useless except to hand out kohls cash to any customer with a complaint. You have to drag her out of the office to do that much. Kohls has way too many chiefs an no where near enough indians. Kohls takes away more and more binifits from associates each month, but they reward lazy rude customers with more  coupons.Kohls markes everything up so high even clearance to compinsate for the coupons. If you like cleaninging out fittingrooms and being on the register for long peirods of time, then this is the job for you."
bad,Cooperate has taken away all part time employees incentives. We suspect it is so there can be more vacation incentives for management. Our store manager was only too happy to tell us that she gets to go to FL this year through Kohls. Most likely on part time employees dime. Kohls is no better than Walmart now and I wouldn't recommend employment to anyone I know. They use to treat their employees well and respectfully but not anymore.
bad,"They will tell you anything to get you in the door but the lies unfold quickly the customers are rude as well as upper managment. computer sofeware suck  you have to note in 3 systems average handle time is 10 per call when nothing works you wear many hats with little pay no one care about employee concers dress code not enforced most employess have red, pink, blue hair is a hot ghetto mess. Employee discount is only 15% BUT YOU CAN ONLY USE IN STORE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A KOHLS CREDIT CARD!!! Please do not waist you time on this trash company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Working at Khols is the worst job decision I have ever made. The store went threw 4 store managers in three months. The last manager cut all the hours of the employees who have been with the company, only to hire new underpaid associates to take the hours until they quit. There are constantly making up rules that is not store policy. There are never enough people to cover shifts so the store stays trashed. There won't be anybody in the department days at a time and they expect you to clean the trash that had piled up or you wont go home. Not to mention the managers are rude!! Most of my co-workers,including myself, are terrified to ask for help or a question about something without being harassed and embarrassed. The only pro is direct deposit and pay every week."
bad,"The management isn't allowed to manage, the Store manager is responsible for all disciplinary actions and the staff is allowed to do whatever they want. Terrible company to work for unless you're a slacker."
bad,"A typical day at work would start out with determining which area you were in charge of cleaning, going to your section and start pulling unfolded, misplaced items off the shelves and cleaning out the fitting rooms and putting things back where they belong. The management was never around when we needed them, they were always very rude, never welcoming and every issue I presented to them was never addressed. The co-workers weren't team-oriented and almost always hated each other because they couldn't come together and help each other. The hardest part of my job was being able to keep up the mass amounts of customers and demand for cleanliness on our busiest days. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to learn several different areas of a retail facility."
bad,"The administrative assistant position at Kohls is a time-consuming and stressful position. Several months of training are required to get you into the full groove of your job duties, yet you will only recieve a few days of on the job training. This job is not for the weak-willed! Criticism is an every day part of the job. Stress is a key factor from the minute you punch the clock in for work, until the minute you leave. There is always something for you to complete while you are fulfilling another task. It is never-ending. Once you caught the swing of things, the job is pie.l It took me 6 months to nail all the paperwork retention, and miscellaneous job tasks. Enjoyed the job, just wasn't enough pay for me."
bad,I worked for this company for 5 years. The management treated their employees like the dirt under their feet. The manager was arrested at our store for driving for a long time without a license. She picked and chose her favorites. And she was very demeaning to the associates under her like they were not as smart as her. I brought things to the attention of the District Manager and the Corporate Offices and no one wanted to hear anything bad or negative. Just wanted me gone even though I worked like a dog for this company. And if you have any kind of medical impairments then good luck on them working with you. More likely to pressure you into quitting or looking for a way to fire you. All this and not only did I work hard for this company but I helped catch lots of shoplifters and they didn't even care.
bad,"love my co workers"
bad,"Resist to promote from within.  Base your qualification against everyone elses and not what you yourself can provid.  Promotions and raises based off others as well, you are blocked into a percent tile.  Viewed as very replacable."
bad,"Worked at the retail store for almost two years.  The first year, I worked during the day and evening hours but now, I worked during the evening hours since I have another job to be attend.    "
bad,They DO NOT CARE about their employees. Went work days without a break! Some of them will not let you go seek help if you injured yourself on the job or if you become very ill. They exhuasted you. Some of the assisants treat the customers they same way. So many people have quit or were fired with in a year and a half. I find that strange. I don't reckonize anyone when I go there anymore with family. Its left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't buy any thing from the greendale kohls!
bad,"I worked for this company for about a year and the Store Manager was truly incompetent. She didn't know her job but would try and tell you how to do your job. If she did't like you your hours would be cut. She has lost so many good employees including 2 Asst. Manager within 6 months! The O3 wasn't much better her management style was't that much different from the Store Manager. I wouldn't recommend working for Kohl's especially at the West Ashley location. Also this company doesn't pay well. Some of my co-workers were great and I miss them, Didn't learn much cause I was an experience manager myself."
bad,This place has no work life balance. It is like high school all over again. The pay is not that bad and even the management gossip about you. They promote based on popularity not talent. I use to be a manager and I was out numbered when wanted to reward good workers versus popular workers. They are blatantly racist as well. They don't care about work life balance. For hourly workers they schedule you to work till 11pm and have you come back in at 6AM. If you cant work that shift they'll reduce you to 4 hours a week.
bad,"Good people work there, but are undervalued by management staff."
bad,i worked here 2months and quit because of the awful customer service. also no employee appreciation. i got 10 hours a week at $7 and hour. none of the managers ever cared to even try to earn my name. the people were just rude.
bad,"price changes,"
bad,"When I decided to continue my education, I was a minimum wage employee and I was working part time. However, they scheduled me full time hours alot, and continued to pay part time. I changed my availability and made it very clear to them that I was not available outside of my specified hours listed because I needed to be in my classes.The managers took me into their office and told me that I had to choose school or them. I chose school. When I had exams they scheduled me forty hours that week, and told me I had to show up to work. They told me if I did not, then I would be terminated after the third day in a row, and they would list me as non-hire-able. They did this out of spite. I went ahead and continued with my exams and did not go into that store ever again."
bad,Most if the time you just go in circles and do same tasks over and over and over again. Advancement is if you get $0.50 a year so don’t expect much if it
bad,"Would not recommend, unless you are retired and only need a few dollars to live on. No real advancement. The wage gap is very large from employee to managers. No benefits or extremely expensive benefits"
bad,Too much favoritism. Not enough hours for everyone. Most managers were very rude. No set schedules. Left at 1:30am one time when the buses stopped running by midnight.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I enjoyed working there until I put myself in a program through pine rest and even let the managers know, they still put me down for missing two days of work and fired me. Knowing I was unable to show up because of the program I am in."
bad,Worst pay imaginable!! Defintely not compensated for work done pefectly. Employees are allowed to treat customers and fellow employees with disrespect. Terrible schedule is given that does not even make sense.
bad,"I worked almost ten years at kohls it will be ten in summer 2020. I find it not much challenged and not enough to learn new things. it not steady hours. "
bad,"lack of professionalism when dealing with workers"
bad,The staff here was mostly bad and would talk behind your back although the pay was good the schedule was not flexible at all and managers were terrible
bad,"Over crowding, too many people per supervisor, bathrooms constantly full of people avoiding work. No comunication with h.r, not scheduled guaranteed hours."
bad,Do it your soul will die I know you probably need a job but if you can avoid working here you should they hire anyone and then force you into making other people other people open a line of credit and if you don't get enough they will threaten your job... try to avoid at all costs
bad,"My very first shift the manager in charge said ""go run the juniors dressing room"" I said ""this is my first day and my first job, can you explain what that means?"" Literally left me standing there for 15 minutes before coming back and spending 2 minutes telling me to put the clothes from the rack back where belong. Also expected me to fix the clearance section in 20 minutes which I only got because I was ""new"" (it was a mess and needed at least an hour) . They offer NO training. Of you ask a question to another associate be prepared to hear ""it's not my job to train you"" "
bad,Worked at Kohl's 5 and a 1/2 years as maintenance supervisor then they decided to outsource  Job. And cut hours under 40 and getting 36hr and saying 36 is still considered full time. Then forced people out. Sad part about it is I liked working there.
bad,I worked from November to January as a seasonal cashier and I got talked about working there by some managers and some associates felt uncomfortable working there. Felt judged and uncomfortable did meet some associates who I am friends with till this day but overall terrible. The ladies restroom was terrible always smelt bad and was dirty.
bad,"Poor management. Lousy hours. "
bad,"High expectations and customer demand, low pay and acknowledgement of accomplishments.  Management lead by intimidation and barking orders at staff from her office."
bad,"not a good place to work"
bad,I cannot believe how low the pay is for such a big chain! I only make 9.00 an hour and I made that over 20 years ago working in retail!  There’s been a lot of turnover in the short time I’ve been there  it’s too bad they don’t put 2 and 2 together and realize if they would just pay their employees more maybe they would  stick around!
bad,"I was hired on a sales associate, but as soon as they found out I could run a register that was all I did. It was always slow so I never really had anything to keep myself busy. I was paid minimum wage and only scheduled to work at most 8 hours a week. I was basically only working for gas money for the week, completely NOT worth it."
bad,"Just don't. I could go on for a while about why you shouldn't want to work at a place filled snobby people, and how you'll get paid next to nothing, but I won't. Just look for a job elsewhere. You'll be happy that you did."
bad,"They never give hours to employees who actually work and show up for their shifts, they give hours to the ones who always call out and don't do their job."
bad,"Kohl's is one of the most hostile places to work at. "
bad,In the break room. They post notes like work comes before your education. Management plays favorites and will schedule you during your college schedule and then give you a point on your record if you can’t make it.
bad,"The only pro to working there is a flexible schedule. They will pay you minimum, but have you performing duties of a supervisor or multiple departments at one time. They don’t make their policies crystal clear, and they are extremely unforgiving. I worked their for 2 years, applied for a supervisory role, and got passed up for someone outside the store. I then had to train them.. (training is a joke by the way. They just threw me out on the floor to figure it out on my own, and didn’t show me the register for 2 weeks) "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Wasn't a great first time job the co workers weren't friendly nor helpful all co workers had attitudes and management was a little bit on the passive aggressive side
bad,Often talked down to by managers and department leads. Usually no option for getting higher pay or placement. No options in choosing department. Sets unrealistic goals.
bad,"If you are young it's good for u but not if you have a family a pay check once a week of 159 is not enough Mangment sucks they play favorites they"
bad,They do not value people who have been with them for years. They will hire a new person with 0 experience and pay them more than someone who came in with 8 years of experience and been with them for the past 5 years
bad,Management does not care about its people all they care about is there numbers too busy sitting in their offices talking to each other the pay is way too low for the amount of work they want done
bad,They push the silly charge accounts hard. It is easy to get people to sign up for them. It is just a dead end position and company. Only do it part time if you need a little extra money.
bad,I felt as an employee that the managers were not too concerned for there employees feelings. I really dont have anyting more to say about the place. just dont work there
bad,"Management was in their own little world at times. Sales targets for their own line of credit was outrageous and, at times, impossible to reach."
bad,"I’d encountered a few racist co-workers who’s harass me.  The management, mostly one in particular, who’d speak to me unprofessionally and yell at me and other coworkers.  I also found out they were watching my every move on the security cameras, whether it be because of my race or not.  But as soon as I found that out I left a few weeks later. After holidays past the hours for me was only once a week if not I didn’t receive any hours and this was a consistent problem with the rest of my coworkers.  Lastly, everyone there is worried about drama and the latest gossip so it’s a pretty toxic “job culture”."
bad,"I was a cashier and i told them i needed a part time job that gave me about 30 hours a week and they would barely meet 25 for me and they completely ignored my availability and had me do a lot of closing shifts, the management here was very bad and rude. They did not care one bit about their employees this is at the Owensboro KY store and i highly do NOT recommend anyone to work here!"
bad,You go in with one shift then have to fight year after year to keep it or change it. Your schedule can change from one week to the next. They are constantly taking benefits or incentives from employees and trying to convince them they are doing what’s best for them.
bad,"Look  elsewhere than here. This company talks about flexible scheduling... It's a lie. As soon as either you let them know that you have a second job that's when they begin messing with your availability. This is the store where I'm currently working and I can't wait to leave.Store manager doesn't know what she's doing and on top of that she's is rude,condescending,unprofessional and most of all vile.Many employees have complained about her and she is still in the store.Most of the people that was working there before me left because of her and any new ones don't get past the second week.That speaks volumes. Some managers are ok and then there are others that treat employees like they're in high school, when majority of them are adults. Customer wise there's always that needy one but the majority are fairly nice.Pay it's ok if your a student or looking for part time income.If you're an adult look somewhere else."
bad,"Every employee thought they were better than everyone else. No one ever did their job. Mostly college aged employees with horrible management. People always stood around talking or stayed in the break room for hours of their shift. New employees weren’t welcomed. All of the people I worked with were extremely rude and would always talk about me behind my back. "
bad,Very understaffed all the time and very rude management thats always trying to get you to sign up for the credit card even though you already said no.
bad,"I felt management had there favorite employees, I was promised I would work in a certain department and then was asked to do things that was physically hard on me."
bad,"On my first week i got yelled at in front of a customer, it was my first morning shift my manager on site, Leah, yelled at me cause I'm suppose to know everything though i was still in training. i had no idea what a daily was and told me to figure it out. I was to see who was working in intimates because a customer needed help. there was no one working in intimates. i couldn't believe a manager had just yelled at me when she knew no one was working that department."
bad,"Overall the company is a cool place to work for. Your full time is only going to be 32-35 hours but the people you get to meet while working there makes it worth it. Overall, I really enjoyed my job however the management of this place is not only unethical but down right abusive. I have never in my 10 plus years of retail experience encountered such abusive, intimidating and malicious management in my entire life. The store manager is a straight up joke and so is her bff the administrative assistant. If you are prepared for getting screamed at on your day off and off work time - this is the place for you!!"
bad,"have to wear black, inconsistent schedule, one week you would"
bad,working at khols is very hard work . long hours on your feet and very little pay . No advancement oppurtunites and managers are always micromanangeing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Not a loyal company.  I worked there for 8 years, devoted my time and life to them to be let go because I saved a shoplifter from falling and cracking her head open?  So, for protecting public safety? Which was one of my roles as LP.  Kohl's doesn't care about me as a husband, veteran, or father of 8... they let me go for saving someone? VERY very very disappointed with this company."
bad,"Anyone who is considering applying for any position at the Warwick RI store, please reconsider.  Kohl's may be a fantastic company to work for but not at this location.  The management team lacks the skills to produce positive results in a retail environment.  The communication in the store is non existent and there is no consistency in the leadership.  The store ranks very low in the company and it is apparent in how the store is run."
bad,Worst place ever to work barely any training lack of follow through hit or miss schedule they just don't care about there employees lack of consideration training was a joke they have you watch videos one day and then have you come back another to do computer training which is a joke then throw you on to train with someone for a few hours and then basically it's sink or swim
bad,"I worked overnights. Zero chance to advance. I reported to the store manager that I was being harassed ... I was told I was the only one, so they would not do anything. Kohl's may be a decent company, but the store I worked in was the worst place I have ever worked at."
bad,I wouldn’t work here. The hours arent great and the management is terrible. Shifts end at 10pm but when the store is trashed (especially during the holidays) you’re stuck there like all night
bad,A typical day would at knolls consists of mangers not doing any work or even trying to help there associates without giving them attitude. The work place was not exciting for me and down right not for me. The hardest part of the job was just picking up after others in the store.
bad,"Standing around waiting to either go on break or for a customer to walk up, most customers would get short with you and become completely unruly. I didn't appreciate being considered less than any other service provider."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here. Especially overnight. Sometimes it felt like the overnight staff wasn’t treated as part of the store team. They also wouldn’t allow you to take your break or lunch outside, you’re litterally locked inside the store."
bad,"Honesly i would recomend some where else this place takes the life out of you, executives demand so much from you yet do nothing to make improvements,biggest lack of communication and unprofessionalism in this work place"
bad,"management was terrible, schedule always changed, no time off, if you took time off it would have to be three months in advance to even get considered the day off."
bad,"The management was horrible at this location, along with bad hours."
bad,"Near Constant changes in management the entire 7 years I worked there.  The last was the most unbearable."
bad,"Leadership is the worst, made me never want to work for a  department store ever again. Me and a couple of my coworkers at the time left because of the managers."
bad,working at kohls was a good experience. they didn't give out many hours because of how many people were working. but overall kohls is a very challenging place to work if you love money.
bad,"Kohl's is a very family-oriented aspiring environment. Typical days included many many projects either by planograms and communication books or by putting your own creative input that have different dead lines. Higher management lacked a sense of motivation which effect me to learn things on the job, that was the hardest part. Although, teaching associates or simply making a customers day made up for it all."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I did not overly enjoy working for Kohl's because they were very unwilling to work with my schedule and weren't understanding with what other things I had going on.
bad,Most horrible place I've  ever worked!!!   An 8 hr work week is bs!!! This  job wouldn't  even put a loaf of bread on the table!!! Don't apply here unless you have other employment. A complete waste  of fuel  and time!!!
bad,Store is well organzied and friendly associates. Great team to be a part of and provide great opportunities for promotions. Hard work does not go unnoticed.
bad,working at kohl's was ok not a lot to complain about and not a lot to brag about. i remember there being a lot of complaining about pointless things but the company has changed a lot since i worked there.
bad,I was given only 4 hours a week to work while other employees were given 10-15 hours a week. I was the hardest working employee they had and did not allow me to move to the next level. Training was very corrupt. I would show up to work to find that I was taken off the schedule and replaced with one day pay. The only good part about Kohl's is the manager who seems to not have full control of scheduling employees as they are needed. My class at McNeese ended at 4:55 PM while I had to be to work for 5 PM although I have put in a notice two weeks before school even started. They have done this three times.
bad,"Kohl's looks great on paper. But once you're in it's a terrible a company to work for. Associates are allowed to get away with anything. HR does not support coaching or terminations of any hourly associate. As a salaried manager I felt like an hourly supervisor, district level management doesn't allow the store management to control anything."
bad,Kohls Valencia has a lot of complaints from the customer and employees as well. The management of Kohls Valencia is very poor when it comes to taking care of employees or customers.
bad,"Left position,  applied later just for part time and got turned down being the manager didn't like me. If the manager doesn't like you forget a position at this company."
bad,"Typical day would be standing around trying to figure out what to do. Mind you on my first day everyone that works at kohls already acted like i should know what to do! Hello Im new never worked at a kohls before! They give you absolutely no training. I got yelled at numerous of times and it was my 4th day on the job. Basically dont work seasonal there the people that are their and not seasonal think their better than you and will pick on you for everything you do."
bad,Management is extremely out of touch with what goes on day to day in the store.  They hire/keep their friends and threaten others to get the work done.  Very negative work place.
bad,"My workload is insanely heavy. Workload is not ditributed evenly among team members. Kohl's does not live by their pillars. Men are always promoted before women, even if the woman has more knowledge, skill and seniority. My time is wasted by senseless changes midway through projects, with no good reason for the change. My manager spends her day taking care of personal business, while using company time, phone & computer. She is rarely available if I have a work related question. She also discloses private information to people who should not hear it. One of my coworkers has a substance abuse problem. Several employees are carrying on affairs in the workplace. The culture is very vicious, mean spirited and completely toxic."
bad,Everyone was very nice but so many people worked there that they were very unorganized. I enjoyed working there and being cashier. I enjoyed how busy it was during the holiday rush
bad,"No benefits, low pay, low hours and it seems like at least once a month now full time positions are being cut by corporate while the workload increases. If you have any concerns you're told to contact HR, HR tells you to contact corporate HR who says to talk to you store manager who tells you to talk to corporate HR. This is extremely unhelpful. "
bad,"to much drama and competition for a job that is so easy, yet they make it too hard."" work smarter not harder"""
bad,"They over hire during peak season so they can cut people lose that don't make the grade.  HR / Benefits off site - no personal contact with HR.  IT dept horrible.  Cheated me out of my benefits, said I did not sign up but I did."
bad,"poor pay, most of my co workers had 2nd and 3rd jobs. no guarantee of how many hours you would get.  not enough workers scheduled to do the work that was necessary."
bad,"Paid way too little to do an obscene amount of work. Coworkers were wonderful, however, management couldn't have been any worse. They were bullies that made you feel extremely replaceable and unimportant."
bad,The kohls in i 10 and fry has poor management i was a supervisor there and my managers never did really help me move up at all they were always rude do not work here pay sucks even when u become supervisor low pay
bad,"Whether you are going for an executive or hourly position, I am warning you to stay away. I wasted 11 years of my life there, am finally out & wish I would have never stepped foot in that store. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,The most enjoyable part to the job was working along side my colleagues and learning from them. Needed support from management so you know how to do thing the correct way.
bad,"Kohl's is all about getting new store credit card customers. The management will sacrifice the good customer experience of 20 customers for 1 credit card application.  Being scheduled 4 hours a week is normal, except during the holidays.  Stability is almost unheard of as are logical policies and procedures."
bad,"There was always some sort of big event they were throwing to distract you from the fact that they treat you like a number. Management was always hovering and making sure that you were doing what you were supposed to. They were mainly concerned about how much they could overwork you while showing no appreciation. Their idea of appreciation was throwing cupcakes your way while barking orders. Management was always stressed out, which trickled down into their management style when conveying information to their team. I always felt on edge, under appreciated, and overworked."
bad,"Very stressful, never any help in the departments. You have one person in each department who is excepted to do everything. Not only are they in charge of their department but also fitting rooms, cashier and customer service. The management staff hardly does anything. This job was just awful."
bad,This place is so unorganized and offers little to no help with new hires. they start you out in an area and pretty much just throw you into something and dont tell you what to do.
bad,"Too much work for minimum wage, everyone except management gets less than thirty hours a week during Holiday hours then after Jan 1 you are lucky to have ten hours a week. They always have you doing something no down time ever."
bad,I never received my first pay check which they said was in the mail. The environment was nice too work in and the managers was nice. My day always went good when I worked there. When starting the co-workers were nice and very helpful. There really was no hard  part. I never got my paycheck and I called corporate and even went too managers and still never received my money and aslo they pay rate is very low.
bad,"The pay is minimum wage with no prospects of promotion or moving up within the company. Kohl's is a typical ""Big Box"" store whose only interest is profit. Coworkers make the job bearable, but the minimum wage pay is hard to get by one for the amount of work that is expected from you."
bad,Working for Kohls is a great experience for a first job. But all experiences are different.
bad,This job was fun and we worked while the store was closed to the public and we had to have it done in a few hours so it was a challenge but we could do it easily
bad,"The Walkill store is a rough store to work in due to the large influx of customers. The lack of staff that is scheduled on a day to day basis makes it very difficult to give the customers quality customer service."
bad,The management team from corporate all the way down to the store level does not conduct business with any ethical standards. They are abusive with many employees and do not provide proper training. If you want work/life balance this is not the place for you.
bad,"It was a great job for students, high school, and college. I would highly recomend it, it is a great opportunity an I would highly recommend it."
bad,"I worked at a new store that opened up in our small town. Everything was still a learning process. I enjoyed working here, the hours were good and it was easy to pick up extra hours if I needed it. They worked with my school schedule. I was happy to work here. I enjoyed working here so much that on my days off customers would recognize me and ask me for help and I'd help them. "
bad,"Working for Kohl's, you are everyones slave. Other workers, supervisors, managers, customers, and even the cleaning company. They tell you one thing, but expect you to do something else and when you don't do what you want, they throw you under the bus. There is no job security. If someone doesn't like, chances are you won't be there long. If you do have a problem, management couldn't care less. It's easier to replace you than deal with it. Or they sweep in under the rug, so to say, if they themselves are guilty of what the issue is."
bad,"The customer is NOT always right. I was constantly yelled at by the management because I did not believe the customer: ""I left my coupon in the car. I have a 30% off coupon but not with me. I want my coupon to work today. I want a $9.00 price for a $60 item. I want this, this, this."" When I saw management GIVING items away I got mad. Yet "" I"" got yelled at. ""We overprice our items to compensate for the cheats."" Well, I shouldn't have to pay for the liars and cheats, as an honest citizen. It's just unbelievable what they do to make a buck. I quit."
bad,"This job was not pleasant. I was hired on as a truck unload employee as the truck thrower. I was just a member of the team and only worked about three days a week. For a part time job, it wasn't that bad. I moved up fast and was promoted within a year. I picked up my duties as the Replenishment Supervisor and ran with it. I learned everything I could in the time I could. I went from unloading a truck to managing a team of individuals to unload the truck for me. I still participated, but it was made very clear to me that I was supervisor only. The management there was horrible. The bosses had no idea what was going on in the store. Most of them only came there for a pay check and then left. They had no unity, no ethic, and no aspirations to help the company become a better place to work. I say this about my bosses but most of my co-workers were the same way. The team I ran knew how to work hard when the time came for it, but it was always a struggle to get them to stay on task. Most of the people in the store were either just starting college, in high school, or old. The work ethic that came from that particular store was almost non existent. In my own opinion, the hardest part of that job is having to ask your supervisors for permission to do things and then have them tell you no, because it was not to ""standard"". ""That's not by the book, we can't do that, and NO""......all these things were said whenever I had an idea to benefit the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had a short shift. It's not because I didn't want to work. It was because I hardly ever WASN'T"
bad,Management was not that great. They did not care about your personal life. I learned how to operate a register well but not much after that. A lot of people had attitudes and you would have to remind them of breaks and lunches. Only good thing was I met some people that were great. Got paid way too little for the hard work we did.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"We are legally suppose to have breaks and I went a few days without recieving one! The women employes at our store don't get treated as well as men. As far as managment goes it seems the women have to do more work then the men for the same pay. Also if your get hurt on the job or seriously ill. Some of the men in charge still expect you work it through. A customer hurt herself at the store and one of the other employees was didn't really help he just spent his time trying to convience her not to sue ever though she didn't bring up anything about suing the store. We would revieve 15% discounts but its not worth when most the junior clothes now are so tacky. I feel like it is probally more so the store's fault for why things are the way they are than chain itself. But when it first work they did not explain everything with training the just toss me in. I figure out most the stuff on my own though. To do all the work they ask for 7.45 an hour is not worth it. strike pionts, helping customers on the floor and on the phone, dropping and picking up stuff in the stockroom, working on registers, hanging the clothes then sizing them and colorizing them, picking up huge messes organizing racks, ticking, reporting stolen or lost items sometimes kids. I feel bad when there kids lose their parents. You also have to clean out the dressing rooms as well. Like I said not worth $7.45 an hour."
bad,as long as you kiss up to your boss you get hours as soon as you begin to have a life like have a family or go back to school and rearrange your schedule they cut your hours completely.
bad,"this was a horriable expirence, management and staff were not helpful, they did not train well were not hands on at all, and basicly hanged out in the office all day and then would get mad when you did not know something that they were supposed to teach you"
bad,"For those who have not been in leadership long, this (Macon, GA) may seem like a great opprotunity. The Macon facility will suck the life out of you. I guess it has the approval of corporate management, because if you question the unfair practices....you will be fired."
bad,"Management reg does dumb things then backtracks & treat employees like trash. Lots of rude Karen customers. Job advancement isn't skill based but how free your schedule is. Working here eats up all your time and you don't get any holidays off nor do you get any bonus holiday pay. Loss prevention doesn't actually catch thieves, they gets a bonus for watching employees over customers so they're incentivized & you can get in trouble for things like talking to coworkers and customers"
bad,"Terrible place to work. Managment is awful. They pick favorites and treat other employees very poorly. I worked alone in the shoe department. I was never guaranteed a break. It was the busiest section of the store and I had no help while clothing sections stood there gossiping. They expect going to get 3 or 4 things done at once while covering every cashier's break. Literally. I had to organize a sale shelf, while unpacking, while changing pricee tags on everything. In a matter of ten minutes."
bad,"You will not get paid more than $10 starting out here. Dont value employees that work hard and go above and beyond for the greater good of the store. They dont care about the hard work you do. As long as it gets done is all that matters. Supervisors play the favorite game with employees. No communication, you've got to think on your feet all the time. Assess and execute any problem or task that needs to be done. You can get plenty of overtime here during the holiday season."
bad,Corporate has no clue how things should be done. The do less with more attitude over works everyone in the store. Raises are non existent. Lots of lazy coworkers and managers with attitude. Coworkers are lazy because there’s no benefit to working hard.
bad,"Nothing that you do seems to matter except how many credits you get. Very stressful and sad. I’ve been in retail 34 years and you feel like you know nothing.Customer service is first for me and I’m good at it, but it was never enough."
bad,Management is TERRIBLE. No communication between management. The most unorganized place I’ve ever worked. They think their employees have no life outside of work and constantly talk to them like they’re stupid. Would rather work at McDonald’s.
bad,Very unfair treatment to both management and hourly if they like you.  Very good work life balance.  If your an ops supervisor they expect you to do everything.  Very indecisive when it comes to making decisions.  Reluctant to change.
bad,"I started off as a seasonal employee. It was fine up until I decided to stay after being offered a year-round position. Before long, the hours they had me working were NOT conducive to my school schedule and the management would guilt-trip you when you call off for legitimate reasons. The pay was awful. Management really only valued you if you were able to sell their credit card. Will never work for this company again."
bad,The new manager brian would not cooperate with my school schedule after we both agreed on a set time that I could work while in school. He set my schedule for weekends only. If you are a student I wouldnt recommend. Retail jobs do not care they want to trap you. The pay is $11.50 and if you’re a supervisor the pay $13.
bad,Very poorly managed or not managed at all. Contractors are treated like cattle. Kohl’s employees won’t even make eye contact with contractors. Very adversarial. Huge foreign contractor base that makes any US contractor feel like a foreigner in our own country. People with expired visas coming and going constantly. But management only wants foreign help. Absolutely crazy place!
bad,"The Kohl's I worked at was absolutely horrible. "
bad,"Kohls always wanted you to have integrity but they don’t have any. Management was useless, company kept saying they weren’t going g to close, not even a year later they closed the whole Dallas Texas site!!"
bad,"Kohl’s has horrible management, the work environment is unorganized and you’re over worked. They only value their employees if they get credits and disregard you if you don’t make your goal. Your work hours are based solely off of how many credits you get. All “managers” were messy and talked about everybody. There were too many people on a power trip for control and didn’t understand their positions or should I say job description. Only benefits were the employees discount."
bad,"For starters management is a joke. They expected so much to give so little in return. I quit because of 1 specific E4 L.C. she was the worst person I've ever worked for and to this very day I still hate her with a passion. She was Rude, obnoxious and very annoying and bossy. I worked there from April 2017 to September of 2017. Those were the roughest 6 months of my life. I'd of never thought working for a department store could and would be so stressful. They expect you to pick up on things instantly and if you don't they treat you poorly."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Watch the decline as far as how much they appreciated their employees with longevity. Started out great then steadily declined. Took away programs that helped associates keep store clean. Piled tons of work responsibly as the cut hours. 2 people were expected to keep store clean. Left after 12 yrs without so much as a bu your leave!
bad,"Honestly not much to say, it was my first job and I didn't know what go expect. Now that I've worked for decent businesses,  all I can say is that I would not recommend working here. The customers are terrible and rude,  the management was the useless and they treat their employees terribly."
bad,"Didn't like working here. I worked as a cashier and I worked a VERY busy store. It would usually be me working by myself or with 1 other person. I would call for help when the line would get too busy and basically get none or they would take forever to come over. The management always made you feel bad if you needed help. If I needed to go to the bathroom they would tell me to ""hurry up"" which made the work environment bad. Also when there were no customers I would be cleaning or tidying a clothing rack ect.. and when I would be like walking back to the register or something the supervisor would walk by and act like I wasn't doing anything when I just was but they would make you feel bad for not doing something every second you were working, which I thought was really ridiculous. They would also push the credit cards sales and I would get like 2 a night and not get any praise for it. I mean I get that is part of the job but it made it feel like what was the point. And if there was a night where I didn't get a credit card they would give me a lecture for it. They only give 20 hrs a week max. This place really sucked. I quit here after 2 months and found a better job."
bad,"A lot of things have changed in the company, inside and outside the store level. There is no longer a cooperative air about the store; associates are very nasty to one another and management hides it's head in the sand. Corporate makes unrealistic demands on stores and customers are rude & only seek out ways to scam the store. There was a time when everyone helped each other and worked as a team, now it's very stressful to be at work and you have to guard what you say and who you talk to for fear any gossip will come back to bite you. No one is willing to help cover calls, breaks, or feel empowered enough to handle situations on their own. New associates are lazy and there is no accountability."
bad,"unload truck 53 foot"
bad,"Kohl's is not the kind of place where a person would want to stick around for a long time. It is a summer job or part-time kob to earn some extra money if you are desparate at best. They do have flexible working hours if you have another job or you are a student. They do give a decent employee discount, but no one buys anything at Kohl's unless it's on sale anyway so that really doesn't matter."
bad,"Lousy pay at both the retail store and the distribution center.  There is no room for advancement and the ""managers"" there, except for a few, are petty and unprofessional."
bad,Anyone tht is looking for a real career... This not the place for you. The managers flirt and sit in the office all day... While the the PSolvers do their job and managements.
bad,"A typical work day would be to unload a truck, stack boxes on pallets, back stock items, put out freight. I learned how to do all those things, and to not always trust the people you work with. Management is very favorable with certain workers and lets them slack off, then micro manages the good workers."
bad,They have hiring events on during the holidays! You will only work for 1 month and then they call you and fire you or dont put you on the schedule! They will mess your checks up by not paying you any money and then tell you it will be on your next check only for you to wait and they tell you the next pay day tou have to talk to a hire person in HR! Whom they tell you they have to email! They fired 3 of us for the same thing said we were altering time only to not pay us put bonuses after we went to HR about not getting paid! But since we got the person in trouble who messed our times up they fored us days later! We only know because we are all on facebook! They called 3 of us who went to HR about not getting paid 2 weeks in a row! They call you on your off day and then if you tery to go there to talk to HR YOUR WORK key doesnt work! Then you ask for corporate number and they tell you they dont have it!
bad,This is probably the worst LP job I’ve ever had. The east setauket store is a huge store yet they have the oldest and worst camera systems in the district. Terrible input lag.  360p. Constantly blurry and can never make out anything. Tons of blind spots. They zoom in and out by themselves and aren’t responsive at all. The genetec system always fails everyday so you can never review or record footage when you need to. There is no direction for LP or support from any management.  Kohl’s has a quota on shoplifters for every store. Setauket is considered a low risk store. The company says if you don’t catch cases you are going to be fired. They clearly stated that after I got hired. Even though in the interview process I asked if there was a quota and I was told no.  I was finally getting situated with learning everything the job entails and getting used to all the procedures. I got certified and not even two weeks later the DPLM pulls me in the office and says I am not getting anything when I basically just started and am just getting acquainted with the job. They tell you not to stress about it but how could you not when they threaten to fire you. I have never had a company put the gun to my head ever in my life and expect results. No LP job I’ve ever had has done this. Now I have to scramble and find a new job when I haven’t even been in this company for more than a month and a half. The only good thing is that they are accommodating when it comes to scheduling and any emergencies that may occur or days that need switching. I recommend you do not work at kohl’s as LP as this
bad,"We would have a huddle to start the morning off, If I opened. We would have to wear walkies to communicate with other workers. I straightened clothes and cleaned up after customers."
bad,"Managers are constantly bugging about credits. If you ask to leave or gin on break they ask yo a million questions about how many credits you sold and if you haven’t sold any then they ask you why not. They Micromanage you when you do anything whether it’s on register or in a department. If you need to change your availability, they give you 4 hours for the next few weeks because it made them actually do some work. They don’t understand with school. They don’t work with you if you want to move departments. If you try to talk to managers they just brush you off to get you off their back"
bad,"High stress environment; high attrition rate across the board, from agent to mid level to executive/upper management. Poorly  maintained / outdated systems being replaced with new systems that operate at a sub-par level at best. Policy and procedure vary greatly based on who you ask and/or who you know."
bad,The main manager was not there for their employees. The departments were always a mess due to associates passing the blame onto others. Most of the employees where a joy to work with.
bad,"I worked for kohls 7 years, and quit shortly after working 7 years with them. Managers do not care about employees at all, the workload for one person is not realistic. Managers are never at fault, they will point the finger to an associate so quick. They are lazy & do not know how to run a store properly. They love to play favorites!!!! People that work hard and have been with the company for years never get a fair chance to move up. Even though they say "" you have to have this experience, etc"" but once you learn everything you need, theres always another excuse to not move up. They pick who they like personally. They lie, tell you what you want to hear to get their way then screw you over in the end."
bad,"The co workers are sweet and so are some of the managers. There’s around 10 managers. Some of them are so rude and no matter how hard you work, it was never good enough. They would get mad when things didn’t get done but that’s because they’d try to make us do 6 different things at once. It honestly sucks so much. There were only like 2 managers that were genuinely nice, the rest... not at all. Especially ones that complain about my work ethic when they barely did anything."
bad,Management didn't seem to really care about the employees. They do not spend a lot of time training  new employees. The hardest part of the job is the low pay.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend anyone work here, I had a terrible experience at the particular kohls I worked at, they wouldn't even contact me directly when I was let go. Very unprofessional work environment"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Good for college kids. Flexible hours. Managers were nice people. Mostly didn't give you a hard time, but you'd have to stay late a lot. Store closes at 10pm may be there till 12pm or longer."
bad,"As a former Kohl's employee working with this company was the most treacherous,After the store opened I was only getting 4 hrs a week on a daily basis(most of us that were hired were part time) they work you like a slave while the others are joking around with other employees or if they're short staffed. You get a pay raise every 3 months based on your evaluation and the only way you get promoted is if you are best friends with the managers or area supervisors(in other words if you ain't friends with the manager you aint getting promoted) favoritism and clique mentality were the norm at my location and they also push you for credit and emails and if the goal aint reached its a YOU problem!!!! I wouldnt recommend working for this company unless you are in high school or college and looking for your first part time job"
bad,"Very easy work, but very low wage. Extremely unorganized to the point where after working there, I have never returned to shop. Management is a bunch of young women that act like a clique and tend to belittle and bully, and are generally very petty when you call in sick or have an emergency."
bad,Management was very unorganized. Not everyone pulled their weight. Under staffed. Store was very messy. Pulled associates from the floor to register too often.
bad,"Typical day at work? Customer yells at you because the coupon that expired 2 months ago should ""Still be honored"". You won't get ahead if you don't get people to sign up for credit cards in this position. If you don't get credit  they give you 3 hours a week. They do little events and give you food sometimes but it's not worth the pay, at least not for long."
bad,low pay not a lot of hrs if you don't have any bills to pay this is the job for you if your looking for part time this is a great place to work at....
bad,I was not able to balance my work life and personal life. I would go into work and never know when I was going to end my day. The training was basically sitting in a room by myself and watch videos. I was treated from day one as an outcast because I was not promoted from within.
bad,This place was fun at first. The management was awful. They would just promote the people that they like not who deserved it. They would schedule you to close til 11 and have you come back in the next morning at 6 am. They didn't care about your well being at all.
bad,Worked hard in a fun environment! Wouldn't trade the experience for anything!  Best part of the job was working with wonderful people.  Worst part was the late house.  The managers were great and I learned so much about people.
bad,"It was great at first because I was new, however, afterward, the workload was ridiculous. Paid part-time, 10.50 an hour for a supervisor job, not worth it. Underpaid and the lack of management in the company is extreme."
bad,"-coworkers were often much slower than me up at the register, if I had other people up at the register to begin with"
bad,"Constant payroll cuts. How can you manage a team when the team isn't given hours to work!?"
bad,Management was horrible and didn’t care at all for their workers. They cared about credit cards selling and you don’t get commission off of them. They are always short handed and you can be doing 5 jobs at once
bad,It was an okay job not the greatest I couldn't really advance at all. The managers didn't really talk to people at all. They weren't really seen that offten
bad,Very ghetto..there has been several fist fights in the warehouse since I began working there. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Management doesn't care about employees.
bad,I was under appreciated and not valued for my hard work. I was asked to do more than what was required in my job description. Not everyone was friendly.
bad,"I did not like the CEO nor did I like the management at Kohls. When I first started they sold me dreams on advancement and culture, but it was a mess soon after starting."
bad,The head manager does not know how to do his job and doesn't even know the names of all his employees. Many people have left working here because of the poor managerial staff
bad,"Unprofessional procedures, few good managers, childish tactics, breaks not allowed when there are long lines, etc. The only good thing are the co-workers and flexible schedule.  The customers are extremely rude and the management will side with them to get them to come back.  Being pressured to open charges is ridiculous!"
bad,you don't get more than 4 hrs a week unless you make alot of customers get kohls charges. I wouldn't recommend working here at all unless you want to push customers into getting credit cards.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The management was extremely unprofessional, instead of hiring well experience associates to be managers the store manager would hire family members with poor work ethic. My hours were cut more than half less than a month into working here even though I was guaranteed at least 30 hours in the beginning also, no benefits were offered."
bad,working retail on Kohls from my perspective was a total and complete joke they would put me down for work during days I did not put i was available for and 7/10 of the managers were rude and harassed you 90% of the time to force people to open credit cards.
bad,"Staying after each day and loyalty does not mean much to the managers. The general manager is a lovely man that truly cares about his employees, but some of his colleagues do not."
bad,"Building a relationship with your department co workers was the best part. The pay is no where near worth the headaches majority of the customers bring. Also the extreme late nights at that place were not worth the pay. It was also very much like high school with all the ""cliques"" and gossip that went on."
bad,The management could use an entire over haul and job security could better... On job integrity could change alot far as the work atmosphere equality accommodations to true hard workers are rare... It just was a poor experience to me..
bad,The management was just terrible. The managers were always upset and would take it out on the employees. I was yelled at multiple times for things that were not under my control.
bad,"The best part about going to work everyday is my amazing coworkers. They help when they can, and I would do anything for them in return. Management, however...it can be overwhelming. I have seen many coworkers quit in the months that I've been with the company, all because of them. They are not very helpful, and expect us to do ten things at once that we can't handle."
bad,Bad Management  They don't value their employees. Mismanagement. Bad experience.Managers don't help or know anything. They hire their friends. They are always accusing workers of stealing. Employees don't show up for work schedule. Work pile up.
bad,"I typically start my day by emptying the fitting rooms.  Then I move on to cleaning my department.  I've learned a lot about soliciting credit.  Management expects you to be a super human when it comes to any and everything.  Some managers are very relatable, others expect far too much.  Coworkers are usually very helpful, with the exceptions of a select few who are super critical.  The hardest part of the job is taking being disrespected to your face.  The most enjoyable part of the job are days when employees get a 55% discount."
bad,"Kohls has excellent employees working for them their mgmt. team can be better. The word to best describe kohls employees Loyal you have to be for the amount of money you are being paid to work there."
bad,"This place wasnt great at all. Poor management, bad pay and lack of teamwork. worst place Ive ever worked. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,holiday hours from halloween through december were over the top if u were closing because on weekends u might not get home till 2-3 in the morning after working an 8 hr shift.
bad,Working at Kohl's was felt very lonely always. I'm surprised anyone even knew my name. The company is extremely pushy about getting customers to apply for kohl's charges which is difficult sometimes because customers that come in often already have kohl's charges which is majority of them. E3's (Managers) seemed they always favorite certain employees as well which made others feel not so welcome to the team.
bad,they expected you to go above and beyond. I learned many new things working at kohls. I was one of their top cashiers with the most credit applications during each shift. I even received an award for it during a team meeting. management was ok co workers were amazing. they find the most worst way to fire you to put a bad rating on your record. they don't like employees to get unemployment from their company so they will fire you for petty things and make it look really bad on your record so when you do go to apply for unemployment you get nothing. in store employee theft is not is not something I would ever do. it was a misunderstanding and they didn't care. a price tag was changed on a purse a customer brought to the register and I decided I would bye it cause she chose between three purses. but I was wrong in that situation so a few months later they heard I was going to quit and brought that up in a meeting and I got fired. I don't recommend kohls for employment.
bad,"The management is very unprofessional and petty. They'll start problems with you before they even introduce themselves. They make you do so much work and there's hardly every any associates working so we few who are there are always overloaded with work. We're expected to recover the store, help customers, answer pages/phone calls, and clean fitting rooms. That wouldn't be too bad if there weren't only one person covering sometimes 2-3 departments. We have to stay well passed closing just to recover the store because there aren't enough people closing. The closing shifts are usually only 5 scheduled hours but you won't leave until well after. They typically only give you a 15 minute break for that because you're only SCHEDULED 5 hours, even if you are there for a total of 8 hours. On sundays, I'm usually scheduled to go in at 5, so that's a 5 hours scheduled shift because the store closes at 9 and we are ""expected"" to leave by 10. I only get a 15 minute break for that, even though the store is so messed up and there are so few people (sunday is the busiest days of the week, idk why they don't schedule more people) I usually don't leave until around midnight. SO, that's a 7 hour shift all on a 15 minute break."
bad,A typical work day was very productive. I was able to manage my time wisely. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was pulling the carts down the aisle colliding with other carts and merchandise.
bad,I learned how to not just be a cashier. But how to correctly merchandise on the sales floor. My co-workers were very helpful and caring surrounding environment.
bad,"Kohls only gives their employees part time hours, unless you're management."
bad,"Working on the floor meant working everywhere including registers.  Instead of working one department they would have you all over the place doing other people's jobs. They expected so much of the fitting room staff in a small amount of time with low pay.Low hours and hard work went unrecognized. Managers talked and laughed and ate all day among themselves and had no knowledge of products on the floor. There were never a fair amount of employees working to cover the departments so they stress the fitting room person out by having them do register shifts, fitting room duties, recovery for the floor for closing and whatever else they could come up with for you to do in a few hours. Very stressful job. Other departments and favorites had it easy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Not enough work hours to go around, the Store 790 would have too many new hires.  Fellow employees also left due to that they could not live on the paycheck that was given to them.  Many are parents, many are students living out of state to attend college, and many just want to make living working for the store but cannot.  Management would sometimes be unreasonable, they would force employees who could not stay passed their shift to stay by penalizing them in cutting their hours.  It was unfair because again, many are students and do not own vehicles to commute making them miss the bus and exposing them to possible dangers that they could encounter on the way home.  Some had families to tend to (new born babies)."
bad,Was very slow most days also did not cooperate with school schedual
bad,"•	Helped rearrange men’s department by following the store Plan o gram provided by the Management."
bad,management sucks and they are very unorganized. Very little personal and management is bad
bad,A typical work day is working the night shift. You take down pre-existing ads and replace with current ads. I've learned that timing and accuracy is everything . My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of job is the pressure to work fast and not always accurate. Also the attitudes of the supervisors and the managers. Lastly the pay was not good at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking and helping customers.
bad,"As a freight associate, I assisted in unloading the weekly truck. That's right, one truck a week. So unfortunately for most freight workers, we only got one day of work a week. During the season, when we were hired, we got tons of work. Up to 3 trucks a week, and bonus days involving replenishment and organization. Afterwards it plummeted. Some people working there were trying to continue to pay for their families needs, but one day a week just doesn't cut it. The shift was from 6:00am to 12:00pm and occasionally they would ask if you want to stay an extra 2 hours or so. Management was alright, but it didn't matter; nearly all of the freight workers were not loyal because they weren't treated well enough to care about the company."
bad,Challenging environment to balance customer service objectives while meeting financial expectations.
bad,Kohl's definitely does NOT compensate for all the work one has to deal with during a single shift.
bad,Working at Kohl's was a different experience. It's like a family there and employees get a lot of recognition.
bad,"I was employed with Kohl's for 4 years.  I enjoyed the Customers and fellow associates. Working at Customer Service I learned a lot and was number one in customer engagement.  "
bad,Unload and load my hand.  Also use power equipment to move boxes. They usually have boxes that are over 70 pounds and they we have team lift on the boxes and they still want us to lift them by ourselves.
bad,"One of my managers was cruel and borderline abusive. I was lied to, singled out and humiliated on more than one occasion. I would never work here again"
bad,This company has no sense of consistency or respect or anything for as long as I’ve worked for them they have disrespected me and my character i will not recommend this place of work to anyone who has a soul
bad,If you are not a brown noser you will be fired. No matter if you meet all goals and get excellent ratings. There is no job securitywith this company at all.
bad,"I didn't have the best time working there.  There were a few members of management that made work fun but for the most part, I couldn't wait to get out for the day."
bad,The management was only concerned about themselves and their customers. Employees were required to do everything and anything the customers wanted without needing management approval. They would cut our breaks short because they didn’t have enough staff on the floor.
bad,"At first it was pretty good but the longer I was there, the more I could see how certain individuals did not do their jobs, like putting away things customers didn’t want. They would leave it for the next shift. If cashiers were needed up front, these same people wouldn’t go. And some of the managers, well, not so nice. One in particular, if you ask her how to do something, she would get snotty with you. So you’d have to wing it."
bad,"-Day at work sucks"
bad,"I Wanted To Be A Team Player, The Players @ Kohl's Didn't Want Me On Their Team, The Management Was Happy With Me And Offered Me A Full Time Position,But Other Associate's That Had Been There For Years Made Me Feel Less Than Welcome, By Their Comments And Actions, That Was My Reason For Leaving."
bad,"Kohl's DC 855 has great associates, but the work is hard labor and the supervisors expect everything out of you and if you don't hit your number or perform well they threaten to fire you. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They give too much work for one person to handle and they won't send help when needed. They make the hard workers work harder while the lazy people that the supervisors like do nothing and they make you do their work. I've wasted 4 years of my life here so I know what I am talking about. Do not apply here the supervisors and higher ups talk to you like your dumb and some are low-key racist. They act like they care about you but the moment they get to report you or fire you they will. Human resources doesn't even help because they work with the supervisors and higher up so they tell you it's confidential when you talk to them but it's not. If you have any problems call the integrity hotline they have hidden in the bathroom because they have to have it due to company policy but they try to hide it so you can't call them. And if you do call them they will be nice to your face but they will low-key target you until you are fired so tread careful. Overall if the supervisors or higher ups don't like you you're pretty much screwed. I'm sad to say I put up with it for so long I would never work there again or ever recommend anyone to work their. If you don't believe me apply for yourself but don't say I didn't warn you"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Worked there for 3 years during college. Got 1 day a week despite asking for more several times. Truck lead was a awesome  boss almost all the rest where terrible.
bad,"Don’t fu—ckin work here if you’re looking for a ‘forever’ job. No body helps you and no on ever will, in you work 4 hours you won’t even get brakes or something similar. Not even 9 fu—cking dollars with ease your fuc—-king financial woes."
bad,"Work hard and not get enough pay. They also can't keep good managers and when they get a good manager, they ship them off to another store. Some mangers are in it for the money and not for the store."
bad,None of the managers want to be responsible for anything. Positions were open because employees kept leaving. Better and open positions werent given to employees who have worked there for years because we were always told Kohls doesnt have money to pay us. So no career advancement here unless a manager takes a liking to you personally.
bad,I didn't have a good experience working at Kohl's. People were not nice. And they were not flexible at all. It was hard to mix the job and school because of their schedule.
bad,"Job is fairly easy and quick to learn.Managers like to throw you into a department where you have never been trained before, they just tell you ""let us know if you need help.""  No real training given.You may be scheduled in one area and you show up for work and they put you somewhere else. This happens A LOT!  The orientation is a joke.  Managers are friendly though some can be a little clicky, as in high school cliques. Some of the workers who have been there for years treat you as if you should know everything already, are rude and unwilling to be helpful and complain about you wanting to take a break. Breaks are constantly forgotten and sometimes not given at all. Lunch breaks never on time. "
bad,"This job is fun if you make friends, however, the management is terrible and the overall workplace is a mess constantly and is highly under-prioritized. The pay is ridiculous, only 9.45 for minimum wage, and I was a supervisor. Be careful what they talk you into because they are sleazy and don't care about their associates."
bad,work in a different area every workday so unable to get familiar with any one area.  Scheduled as a cashier for 7 hours with little training. Not enough employees scheduled for the work load.  employees leave after a few weeks Part time employee scheduled 20Hours in 3 days then off 4.  Not distributed equally
bad,The environment was just not up to my expectations. I felt I was not growing as a person after being there so many years. The benefits are great if you are full time employee and know how to use them wisely.
bad,"I was a Loss Prevention Supervisor. I was told I was being terminated due to not making enough apprehensions in first 90 days. However, this news was given to me after 5 months. After I was terminated, for months afterwards I received court supeanas for cases I did do. It didn't make any sense."
bad,Wasn’t a terrible place to work as a temp but was extremely boring. My supervisor wrote me down for voluntary overtime that I didn’t volunteer for and time staffing and Kohl’s fired me for it. Would never work there again due to that treatment.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Kohl’s, We had great discounts, I also enjoyed some of the employees and managers were goods. I enjoyed working on the sales floor putting clothes out for the customers."
bad,I worked there for 10 years. I worked many positions. When I left the new employees were making what I did after 10 years!!!! Many other retail stores pay a lot better. Over worked and under paid. Seniority means nothing to them unless you get to retirement age.
bad,"If you want to be belittled and discriminated on a daily basis, then this is the job for you! You would be penalized for using discounts and told to work like a mule on a low wage and constant disrespect from management."
bad,"pack boxes, moving constantly. "
bad,"At one point this was an amazing place to work but after 12 years it was clear the ambitions and values declined drastically. Management is extremely hostile, dictatorship, poor communication, and almost impossible expectations that they can’t even manage. I’ve given them the best of myself with nothing to show for it, I’ve outgrown it I suppose. And I’m tired of feeling not good enough or under appreciated. I shouldn’t be worried to go into my job but I am. I’ve never endured such mental/verbal abuse before in my life. And I will never recommend this establishment to ANYONE!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"This place is a joke for several reasons:"
bad,"Kohl’s is an okay place to work at first. It is a good first job however once you have been there for a little while you start to notice all of the drama. Only part of the management team actually cares about how employees are treated. Also,if a manager ever does anything unethical or retaliates against you for saying something about the behavior nothing is done. They could care less about you as they only care about the amount of credit applications they force people to sign up for. Pay is also very behind in the modern times."
bad,"The pay, even after a few years for some associates, was not good at all. The hours I was given were terrible, and even though I performed well, it was not rewarded. Morale throughout the store was less than favorable, and managers did not know how to effectively deal with unreasonable customers. Overall, I would not recommend working here at all. Scheduling was made to strategically keep breaks short."
bad,"With kohls it can be something else u get good pay every week for sometimes easy work but not all the time. Theres no advancement at kohls unless u kiss butt. They will push u and push u for credit sales harassing u for not hitting there crazy goals and make u stay way late just to clean the store im talking about scheduled to leave at 10pm and stay till 2am and u get no benefits."
bad,"DON'T waste your time! Spent almost three years in this company bending over backwards to get new customers to sign up for their stupid credit card, and in the end it didn't matter. The company doesn't value or care for employees. They spend millions of dollars per year donating to children's charities but won't give employees incentives or a decent raise. Raises are never given unless minimum wage goes up, there are no real opportunities for advancement, and the managers are disrespectful to employees. On top of that, if you're a cashier you won't get any hours unless you get customers to sign up for the credit cards and it got difficult after a while. From January to June 2018, I only received 4 hours per week and sometimes none at all! Know how much money I made last year from this garbage company? $511!!!! I kid you not! I had to leave because I was losing money traveling to work because my paycheck did not cover transportation or anything else for that matter. Only thing that is somewhat okay was that employees can stack every coupon and kohl's cash at once. But the clothing sold at this place are so poorly made no one should even have to pay for it to begin with. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company!"
bad,"The jb duties were acceptable, but the hours were only part-time, unless you were management! pay was low for the work you were required to perform! the atmosphere was stressful and they put to much emphasis on acquiring credit applications from Customer's!"
bad,"I hated working here. I was hired seasonal and was told that it ended at the end of January but I went to look at the schedule and I was missing. So I asked the management and the said the period ended. To make it even worse, I had only worked for them for 5 days before missing from the schedule. I did my job and arrived on time so I was confused on the situation."
bad,"As an associate you are consistently pressured to solicit customers into opening Kohl’s credit cards.  I was approached by management and several associates pressuring me into opening a Kohl’s credit card, which is completely unethical. You wear a walkie talkie connected to an earbud and the majority of the talking is managers pressuring associates to get customers to open Kohl’s credit cards. Each person has a “quota” of how many credit applications they need to successfully solicit during each shift. The likelihood of your position as a seasonal worker turning into a permanent position depends on your ability to successfully solicit credit applications. These applications can hurt someone’s credit score, the company really pushes “discount even if they’re not approved”, which would logically mean someone’s credit score is already damaged. Pressuring them to process an application “even if they won’t be approved” is wrong and unethical."
bad,Ive has this job twice. I was let go last Christmas working my butt off but I work again here now and since ive turned 18 I get almost 30 hours a week plus school and college classes. Saying they have flexible schedules is a lie. Don’t listen to that it’s wrong. Safety measurements arent followed for doing freight with a minimum of four feet tall as I was almost crushed by a box a few days ago by a 7 foot tall tower. I get no recognition for all the extra I do and I miss one day and my manager guilt trips me by saying I’m letting the entire team down. Ridiculous.
bad,"Not great, it was a fine job. Depends on the management. Issues with scheduling for employees attending highschool. Employee's we're promised increased pay for holidays but we're never received."
bad,"Kohl's is a ""Yes We Can"" company. So no matter what the customer is asking us to do, we have to say yes. Normally this isn't a problem, but Kohl's takes this too far. It lets customers walk all over us, and it drives managers to breaking points. WE the associates are the ones who get beaten up and scolded then from customers and management. Management couldn't care less about us. Management   needs to step up their game or they're going to keep losing employees. I loved this job in the beginning, but it went downhill fast. Such a disappointment."
bad,A typical day would be meeting many nice people and co-workers. You will be soliciting credit card. Managment changes throughout the day. Workplace culture is very upbeat. The hardest part of the job is your on your feet your whole shift (except break time). Its a new experience. You learn how retail works. Most enjoyable part of the job is when your customer leaves with nice savings and is happy.
bad,"My mangers give me a lot opportunities on how to run each department, working with new merchandise that came in and putting it on the floor, I know how to run majority of the store, I am still working now how to run customer service and the jewelry stand."
bad,"A typical day would depend where they would put you as an associate. I would happen to fold clothes, clean fitting rooms and sometimes set up displays. The hardest part was trying to get enough time to be able to finish making the store presentable. The most enjoyable was making the floor plans to make everything according to the company."
bad,It's just a place to start off the regional manager was really fake and not friendly doesn't greet Associates and always coming in complaining about something never great job
bad,They terminated my employment for having a verbal altercation in the parking lot while off the clock. The other associate was off the clock and not supposed to be on the property. After almost 9 years .... Smh
bad,"The Niles Kohls was anything but wonderful to work for. The employees were great, but managment(at the time, in 2015) was awful. Jobs were threatened and hours were cut if credit applications weren't made."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Let me start off with a positive.  I enjoyed my coworkers.  They are awesome and hard working.  My supervisors as well were great.  Only when our beloved Store Manager retired and a new Store Manager came in did the store turn upside down.  I maintained my good work performance but it was not worth it to me to continue to work for someone who is very cut-throat and honestly the WORST manager I have ever worked for.
bad,I am so glad I am with a much better Company.  The best and most fair manager at this location was the assistant store manager.  I felt like a janitor because I was constantly cleaning the sales floor 90% of the time with no help and being constantly switched from task to task and then always being asked why wasn't the sales floor clean.
bad,"The management was wonderful, but the overall customer interactions were horrible. People are very rude and employees should get paid more for the horrible stuff they go through."
bad,"Managers were rude and always looking for drama and gossip to start/ talk about. I overheard mangers smack talking an ex employee for quitting without a two weeks notice over the earpieces so all other employees could hear. One of my co workers was told that she was a waste of a hire because she couldn’t work on Christmas Eve of Black Friday (she quit after that in case you’re wondering). EXTREMELY understaffed 100% of the time. Always a skeleton staff working no matter what. We were understaffed by 30-35 people the whole time I worked there. Not to mention the horrible $9 pay rate for cleaning up a massive department, cleaning out fitting rooms, covering registers, and basic customer service in one shift. EXCESSIVE use of “the customer is always right!” By the managers. Customers almost always got whatever they wanted (even if we were going to get in trouble for giving it to them). I was also told that my epilepsy was “fake” and was told that it was just anxiety when I put in my two weeks notice. They scheduled me after my last day of work (I did not show up obviously). So in conclusion, Kohl’s is an AWFUL place to work. Don’t waste your time applying here. It’s not worth it at all."
bad,Usually the floor can be a mess. To get a good amount of hours you need to be favored if you are not favored than you do not get enough hours. Some superiors tend to take advantage of their power. The one friend that i met there makes it fun when i work with her.
bad,"They work you like dogs. My 3rd day i had to load 21 trucks. I had no help, and my pay is ridiculous. Seasonal are cpming in right now and making more and working more hours then me."
bad,"I get around 8 and a half hours a week, and im supposed to be part time. I usually am put on the slow side everytime i work, making it harder to get credit sales. Then i get in trouble for not getting as many credits as needed, but i am never given a chance to do it well. I thought this job would help me move out but the most i get a week is maybe 67 dollars. Management is OK, i like the managers but i feel ripped off with my hours."
bad,"In my experience at Kohls, there was hardly any training and I was expected to know how to do things I had never done nor had experience doing such as visualizations, graphics, jewelry responsibilities, etc. I would have enjoyed the job more if I had proper training and support from management when I needed help."
bad,"I would not suggest kohls as a place to work. This is the worst job I have ever had. They give you little training and expect you to be able to do your job. Management is always too busy to tend to the questions and needs of the employees. They hire a lot of people, so you're lucky to get a whole 8 hours a week."
bad,Did not enjoy working here. management has no sympathy for individuals with families. None of the employees were happy to work for Kohls. Even the brightest of smiles will disappear in this place.
bad,I do not like retail. I really just did not like working at Kohls. I thought the job was dull and did not challenge my intellect. I do not care for repetitive work and Kohls is repetitive.
bad,"A typical day at work was wonderful. The management at the Annapolis, MD Kohls was horrible. Rules didn't apply to everyone they gossip about their employees openly, and I could go on and on. Ive called Human Resources and Cooperate on them 6 times in the year I worked there, and they were uncaring and didn't do anything to fix it."
bad,"Promotions are promised only to certain people"
bad,"All I can really say about this Kohls is that "
bad,managers bribes you special treatment to rate the store well.  they keep you well past your scheduled time. your extremely under paid. you are over worked. managers are unappreciative and treat you like nothing. lots of racial remarks and slurs used against black employees. overall it was really the worst job I ever had.
bad,The view of kohls was the bes experience I had. Also it was my first job. They showed me how to be a great cashier. Kohls has good team work. I have great memories there because they know how to treat there co-workers.
bad,"no support from management, favoritism, backstabbing manager and learned not to trust management. made great friends and liked helping people."
bad,"Management treats you like dog pooh, and they will walk pass you all day long and will not even speak to you like we are beneath them or something, and the point system in crazy even if you have an excuses from the Doctor they will still give a point and after 11 points your out of there. And lets not get in the pay."
bad,"For part-time employees, the schedule is made three weeks in advance, so for college students requesting time off is sometimes difficult. The hours were terrible. We would start at 5:30am with no idea of when we would get off. I never worked one week below 50 hours and overtime is calculated by your…"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"It was an okay job for a while, the people were not very easy to get a long with"
bad,I loved the setting working in a busy environment. best part was organizing the departments and items and dealing with customers.
bad,I enjoyed working in this enviroment with the ability to multi-task in my job.  Each shift was a little different from the last because I worked with the public.  Each shift I learned a little more about retail and how and why the store operates the flow of merchanise.
bad,"Open and count drawers daily."
bad,"Didn't care to much for Kohl's, laid back job. Very demanding hours, paid weekly. I had great management here."
bad,Training needed for the management team and the company need to be more aware of who there policy is been translated on the shop level
bad,"My days consisted of mostly folding clothes and arranging products on the shelf, while occasionally directing customers towards desired products. I did not enjoy the retail environment, as it was not a good fit for me."
bad,"Manager doesn't know how to use the cash registers or stock or sets or customer service even. The daily employees have to work their fingers to the bone while not talking, not asking for help. Most of the supervisors are great and will get down and dirty and help you out. But managers at these stores just walk around all day going from employee to employee asking ""what are you doing, what are you working on?"" If you tell them you could use a little help or have a question they scurry away as fast as possible because there IS not one extra employee available to help you and of course the manager can't be expected to know the answer to your questions because all they know how to do is walk the floor and ASK questions. Worst run store I have EVER known."
bad,These days a typical day at work is trying to figure out how to fit 7 hours worth of work at least into 4 hours.
bad,"Worked as a seasonal employee in California then applied for the store opening position in Bend, Or. Within my employment the ""E3""s or top 3 supervising managers had been replaced along with plenty of other turnover resulting in an unfair work load that was placed on multi-area trained employees."
bad,"Kohls compensates its employees well and offers competitive benefits. I do not, however, recommend working for a big box retailer such as Kohl's unless you don't mind the crazy schedule. It is difficult to find any kind of work/life balance working for Kohl's and if you are like me, interested in eventually raising a family, this is not the place for you."
bad,"The hours are bad.. the only time you get a lot of hours is during the holidays.. And the management is the worst.. Please don't make it your only job... Breaks are only 20 or 30 mins. And sometimes you may not even get one if you don""t say anything..."
bad,You can go from working 16 plus hours a week to only doing 4 hours a week for minimum wage. If you ask for more time the scheduling manager at the Michigan ave location will belittle you. No benefits. No advancements. You’d be better of working anywhere else
bad,"Kohl's is nice and all for some quick money, but if you are a worker under 60, they don't care about you. They always forgot to give me breaks and some days I would be working for eight hours and they completely forgot to give me my required half hour meal break and 15 minute break. If you tell them that you need a break they get mad that you asked. They always forgot to pay me and took massive amounts of money off my paycheck. You have to tell them the days you definatly cannot work, for me it was Tuesdays and Thursdays. I also told them that I end school at 3:00. They gave me work on Tuesdays and Thursdays AT 3:00 SEVERAL TIMES then DENIED my request to change my shift. A friend of mine told them weeks in advance that she was going to be out of the Country for one weekend, and they put her down to work that weekend. She then told them that she will be away and cannot come to work and they denied her request. They give minors illegal hours and work them past their legal limit. After my time was up as a seasonal associate, they just never paid me for my last week working. Customers are bitter old people who don't believe anything you say, unless, your manager tells them that you were correct. If you want to work here for an employee discount, don't. You merely get 15% which they claim stacks on top of all other coupons, but I have made purchases where it took no money at all off because it didn't work with other coupons and sale prices. Overall, I would not recommend working at Kohl's, save yourself the time and brain cells. Your salary is extremely low anyways, they promise"
bad,They tell you that you will have all these hours and make great money. They have no work. You will be lucky to work three days a week and not to say how far the place is just to be sent home in a few hours
bad,"You are demanded to push credit apps “every customer, every time”. Although it’s important for the Co., it’s embarrassing for the employee.  "
bad,"The facility runs as ineffectively as a start up with no business plan, and the company as a whole isn't much better. They are regressing in terms of how they operate, making simple tasks more challenging to complete because they refuse to make the necessary financial purchases for efficiency. They don't consider how their measures to increase 'productivity' negatively affect staff, resulting in decreased productivity overall. They will push you to improve all the while making your job harder and more complicated to do than it should be. Management is rarely organized and will run you around in circles without making changes to be more efficient, which has apparently been happening since the building opened."
bad,The job functions were not difficult due to training provided constantly.  The managers were all nice and easy to work with.  I learned a great deal about customer service.  All the co-workers were pleasant to work with (very family friendly atmosphere).  The most enjoyable part of the job was the town hall.
bad,"If they want to keep good employees they HAVE to give them the hours, proper pay, and benefits. Its just the way the world works. People NEED those things and cant survive without them. Period."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Kohl's overall is a great place to work. Unfortunately I ended up in a store that really lacked leadership. This lack of leadership made it very difficult for me to perform my job well because I constantly had to clean up after others. This caused me so much stress as my job could be audited at any time , not only by the company, but by the state as well."
bad,Company did stand by their associates when it came to dealing with the 3rd party Workman’s Comp Company. Started noticing the older associates got and the more they made company was constantly trying to push those associates out. In my line of work company was not willing to further any kind of education for certification not even OSHA training.
bad,"Poor management, not enough room for advancement, work/life balance especially around holidays suffer greatly wouldn't recommend if you have kids!!!!!"
bad,"Jimmy John's Walkers Point location is now hiring Sandwich Makers/Inshop Workers for all shifts (Lunch/Dinner/Nights). Fun, fast work environment. Flexible schedules. Advancement opportunities available. Train to become a Manager! Interested applicants should apply in person at 1312 S. 1st"
bad,Was a fine place to start a job but they do not promote based on skill. They have their favorites and promote them rather than those who deserve it. Associates you work with will also cut you down and to make themselves look better.
bad,the management did not care about employees only their goals. discount was good and other employees were always a pleasure to work with. hours were very incositant ranging from 3 hours a week to 30 hours a week.
bad,Environment was focused only on gaining credit card applications and not ascociate and customer needs. If not for the “credit” push it is otherwise an enjoyable place to work.
bad,"You walk the floor to see what need to be done, pick up your go backs and head to the floor and putting them in their rightful place. I haven't learn as much as I learned at Dunkin' Donuts. the work culture is fair. the hardest part of the job is when the kid from the movie theater comes in start running ,stealing, and throwing the items that you just got done with."
bad,There is no communication and no accountability for anyones actions. I myself was a very dedicated employee and helped eveyone I could that still was not enough
bad,"The best and worst parts about the job are the co-workers and managers, respectively. All the associates got along but we all hated the managers. I would not work here again."
bad,I worked there for a year and a half and they consistently hire new people in all positions who take hours away from you. They would bring in new people and I would get FOUR HOURS PER WEEK. Very frustrating but overall an easy job
bad,I could be better if the managers/district managers backed their employees up instead of being more worried about profit. Treat your employees better you would make more profit.
bad,"Balancing work and life is easy. Management is only concerned about meeting credit and rewards quotas. They also lied about promoting me and my salary said stayed the same even though I moved to the Customer Service desk, and would have to run back in forth between the Customer Service Desk and the register several times during a shift. Your hours are based on how many credits u get people to sign up for."
bad,"Don't recommend this job. No chance of advancement and few hours. Not an ideal job unless you don't mind getting paid very little. Staff is great, but the pay is horrible, raises are only once a year possibly and very, very minimal."
bad,Do not like working here. Employee's constantly harassed to get sign ups for charge cards. Customers and E3's can be extremely rude. Hours cut for minimal amount of charge cards signed up for. Uncomfortable work environment at times.
bad,"Like any retail job, it could be very very boring but this is an understatement here. No good direction in training either. First few days were on the computers filling out info and then registers which they explained thoroughly but when it came to the section I was hired for they didn't train me at all. Told me that you put away the returns(from customer service) to your section and that's all I was told except that takes 20 mins, the shift is four hours.. Literally had to ask all the time what to do or wait to be told. A four hour shift felt sooooo long. I've worked retail before and it was never this bad. Couldn't last there longer than a month."
bad,Just day kohls in warsaw fired me for a misdemeanor. Worked at warsaw store for 3 years good place to work but not treated fair but not fair for firing me for misdemeanor. Would like my job back enjoyed working there.
bad,"I do not enjoy working at Kohls, it is not a good environment. The employees don't help when you need it most and than they get mad at you for not ""doing what you can"""
bad,"Unorganized to such a standard, truck would begin to be unloaded at 6:30am in the morning and would not be finished tell 3:30 pm. Many workers offered alternative solutions to the management and every solution was turned down. I ended up leaving this job after working two jobs for a short time."
bad,If I could underrate the wadsworth Kohl's I would!!! I was seasonal and glad they hired to many people and kept only 3.and give only a 15% discount. Which the might as well not give one at all. Not only were the coworkers and managers mean and rude. I never got any hours because they kept hiring to many people I wasn't even cashier and I was on the cash register like all the time. They just threw me up there without the proper tranning.! I don't advise anyone to apply there Especially around October- January. That job was a total joke.  So glad I'm outta that place
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,A typical day at work only included unloading trucks and stocking shelves. The management team did not really interact with the back room workers making for a strained working environment.
bad,"I'm currently in my two week period before I'm gone from this company for good. For a solid year, I didn't have too much of a problem with working here, and my typical answer when asked how I liked working there was ""Well, I don't want to quit I guess."""
bad,when i wrok at kohls for the holiday my manager never update me or give me any hours.
bad,"At first it was a joy to work here, they treated everyone with respect including temps, seasonals, and regular associates. Now management is horrible, some of them are just plain rude talking to people how ever they want to with no respect. Favoritism is shown to a lot of ppl. Too many vto days when they should have work especially during overtime days and holidays sale. Unorganized when it comes to work structures, they treat the temp and foreigners like slaves. and the restrooms are nasty there is either no toliet tissue or no soap to wash your hands. They make it hard to work overtime because you either have to work 8,10, or 12. It use to be 2,4,6 hrs. They are constantly messing up on your checks,and than when they fix it you are double taxed on the money they already owed you. It sad when you have to train your own boss to do a job that they should know how to do. Health benefits are now horrible, went from united healthcare to athemn which is bad when most of the drs in their network are far out and your paying more outta pocket than the insurance company. You rarely get any recognition for hard work. Worked here two years"
bad,"Most of the management were very nice and help me fit right in with my new job. I was only receiving four hours a week, which is $20.00-$25.00 a week, I could not pay my bills or get any personal necessities."
bad,"The managers are fake and they are not good with your schedules i even told I couldn't come one day and they still put me on it. "
bad,Sexist SM at the store I worked. I complained multiple times about his behavior and nothing happened to him. Then I got let go after reporting his actions. Pure retaliation. Wrongful termination.
bad,"I love working, a job is my escape, but being at this company made me hate it. There was a lack of good communication, a lot of disrespect, and favoritism. There is associates that have worked here for 2+ years that never had a raise. I will never recommend anybody to work here."
bad,Horrible pay & over worked. They play favorites & keep people who would be fired else where. Had luggage & metal bars fall on me while fulling orders.
bad,"Review"
bad,A typical work day at Kohl's for myself would be about 4-6 hours in the evening on a weekday. Within our store team we all are assigned to different work departments. We're expected to keep department organized all while helping customers locate desired items and overall assisting them in any way possible.
bad,A typical work day at Kohl's store was the same. Stock the shelves with whatever they wanted you to. The management was unclear with their messages regarding when my end date was for a seasonal job there. I was told one day before I was laid off that I was going to be. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers and their stress on Black-Friday on my second day of the job.
bad,I was a student at the time I worked for Kohl’s. they refused to work with my class schedule and worked me until close even though i explained multiple times i cannot close during the week. The managers were constantly yelling about getting customers to open credit lines with us. i was yelled at by customers for asking twice about the credit card. the 15% employee discount wasn’t even worth the trouble.
bad,This place is good for a first job but not forever. The pay is very bad for a retail associate and you do more than you have to. The company is very strict too in everything.
bad,"When I started in 2011, Kohl's was a great place to work. It's not that the company isn't a good company to work for, it's the management. The store manager at my particular location was very conniving, condescending and overall a horror story to work for."
bad,This company would not give me or my coworkers any more than 4-8 hours per week (even though we have asked for it) and still continued to hire more employees even when there was not enough hours to go around. The managers push you to solicit customers about the kohl's credit card and you get punished if you do not meet the daily quota.
bad,"After getting hired in, I was told Kohl's only allows for a max of 26 hours to be scheduled, which I was happy to hear; I received one day a week. Not enough worth to even drive there."
bad,"It was Just stressful, no one trained anyone. We were all thrown into the deep end and only learned once the higher-ups yelled at us. Co-works were nice. There was a lack of communication."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Pay was low, was only part time, got 12-25 hours a week (4 hour shifts), worked early in the morning so it was nice to have the rest of the day to do what I wanted. Head manager of the store sucked a LOT, but the other managers below her were all really nice."
bad,This clothing store was very clean and the management was very nice. the customer service was wonderful.  the store was updated and stocked very well with update clothing.
bad,Kohls is very fast paced but very boring. I wouldn’t recommend any one to work there. I didn’t like the atmosphere. If anything I liked working behind the register
bad,"A typical day at kohls is boring and really rude bosses. The bosses will over work you past your scheduled hours, give you insane tasks such as covering 4 fitting rooms all by yourself and when you ask for help they definitely do not give it to you. The hardest part about my job was covering all four fitting rooms during the Christmas break with no help!"
bad,"Worked as a cashier. Got short breaks, and standing on my feet for long periods of time. Kohls has a nice atmosphere but very poor management, they don't care about their employees. Managers only care about making ""credit goals"" (tries to push customers to hard to sign up for a kohls credit card)"
bad,"At first the job was fine, but then I learned that they're policies are far too loose and they have no sense of employee accountability, forcing the rest of the employees to make up for the lost help. Plus the store in general was always just unorganized and dirty."
bad,Fun place to work. Pay isn't good and corporate approved raises are menial. Would reccomend to someone looking for extra spending cash or something to do.
bad,"Company policies and management is usually difficult, great discounts and enjoyable to work at depending on what store you work for. Expects one person to do the job of many, but the discounts and benefits are great. Compensation is very poor unless you're in upper management."
bad,"The absolute worst management team to work for. They take no responsibility for anything that they do. They love to talk about their associates to other team members with each other. "
bad,"No communication,no team work,store looks a big mess always! Not enough hours to have associates to assist customers! Store manager is no help,she's clueless on how to run the store"
bad,"My experience was great initially. I was excited to work at Kohl's however, it all changed when I began to notice that Kohl's Corporate runs on the basis of micromanagement.  When you get tired of the nice building and surrounding landscape your eyes will open and see things in a different way."
bad,"Well some of the E'3s were rude, other workers tried being the boss of other peers. Favoritism, no explanations, also no one ever noticed my hard work and or apperciated it"
bad,"Typical day, will always be a repeat of the day before. Clean racks, move in new stock, clean dressing rooms, run registers, train new employees. Repeat. The staff was wonderful, very nice ladies and gentlemen. Hours were flexible. Hardest part of working here, your driven to do more than you can handle, but are expected to have multiples of you to handle any given task. Moving up in the business is rather hard. I frown upon management, they used me for training as a head of my department but wasn't being paid as a HD. Enjoyable part, being able to advise customers, and help with styling."
bad,"Kohl's was the worst place to work, but at the time I needed the job. Once I got in, there was no management, no one told us what department we were working in since it changed almost everyday. They have you walking for hours and no supervisor is anywhere in sight. I was working in replenish and it was the worst! I actually got switched to packing and that was a lot better. My body was so sore until it didn't have time to heal before going back in the next day. The pay was okay but they loved to use people to their advantage. Someone in replen. should get more than the ones in packing."
bad,"VETO was a requirement if the center did not have work. If the accosiate's met there numbers. They reward was to go home. No job secuity, no employee say so or thinking outside the box. Meet your required numbers & the employee was identified by number only. Even if they made the numbers on the employee board."
bad,I would clock in to work an go get a RF scanner an then a basket an start to find product that the gun is advising me to get.
bad,"A lot of customer service, Go backs and always something to do... This job required a lot of independent people, Learned as I went on my own. The hardest part of this job was having so much to do in a little amount of time on my own. However, I managed to get through it on my own. Upside to this job learned a lot about my job, my customers but mainly about myself."
bad,Horrible place to work. Typically asked to do the work of 4 to 5 people and completely unaware and uncaring of the that fact. Management varies wildly; can have one manager that is caring and understanding that expectations are unrealistic and another that is 100% into the kohl's thought process and does nothing but berate you for not completing daily goals. Routinely make you try and force every customer to apply for the store credit card and make it a top priority that every customer has one.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Its a job, I cant complain it has some nice people there that try to make your work experience there a good one."
bad,Had problems with the way people talked to me. I told supervizer n things changed then went back to problems. they would not work with flexiblity and had a sheet to fill out for hours of change. I liked working there. Stocking shelves. They also put people any were as needed n they dont know what they are doing. they get to much freight in. No room in stock room and no room on retail floor so things just get put were ever. you dont get a break til the truck is unloaded. By then u r beat n hurting cause of no break. There is a time limit to get the truck done then they ask you to leave cause its done even though your Schedled time is not there yet. Mangers dont work with you. They also want you to work like you r making $10.00 hr. You only get salery.
bad,Atypical day at work enjoy workign with co-worlkers. I have fun talking to and helping my co workers
bad,I liked working with thw public and my associated but the management was not nice at all.
bad,"Company does not care about associates at all. They only care about getting credits, e-mails, and the ""customer service score"" because if those goals aren't met, THEY don't get their raises. And they will openly tell associates this! So if you get credits, you'll get more hours; if you don't, you'll get nothing. Hard work and quality of work has nothing to do with it."
bad,"I worked here seasonally and wanted to stay on past the holiday season but management only cares about how many new credit cards you can open. Which is difficult if you're like me and you weren't hired to work the registers. They don't care about how well you perform. They only care about the credit cards. On my first day, they gave me almost no training and threw me in the women's department. When customers started asking me for products in the back, I had to teach myself how to search the inventory because no one trained me on that. Only good thing I can say about Kohl's is their flexibility with hours."
bad,"Staff was rude, management was rude, pay was very low which didn't work well with very little hours. Every time I came into work I had to ask what my job description was it was just unorganized"
bad,"Be sure to tell them the exact hours you are willing to work in the interview or what you thought was part-time, 9a-10pm will end up full-time, every hour of the day, 24/7. And no, you can't request time for Doctor's appointments during the holiday season."
bad,"I have worked for Kohls for over 10 years. When I started there I loved working for the company. Over the last 4 years the company has gone to caring about nothing except the bottom line. We are always short staffed, the workload is overwhelming and the store Manager does nothing to help run the floor. The air conditioning in the store hasn't worked all summer. Even though the associates all complain about it, the manager doesn't care enough about our comfort to call someone out to look at it.  I have worked here over ten years and my wages are only $16 an hour.  Our store is always losing good people because of the manager and poor pay. Even though we are short staffed I have told the last 3 people who have asked me about working there that they shouldn't work at Kohls."
bad,As lead of women's and Juniors' apparel my main job was to keep the areas clean and tidy; picking up and folding clothes and assisting customers.  My other main task was to make sure the fitting rooms stayed clean and return purchased merchandise to the floor.
bad,"I started off as a seasonal worker then decided to stay and work part time while I was in school. Throughout the holidays there was plenty of hours to go around so only making 11 something an hour wasn’t bad. However once the season was over and hours were cut I was barely working. Most weeks I worked one day for only 4-5 hours and overtime was not an option. I had classes right after work and even if I could stay for another 30 min it was not allowed. "
bad,This employer would only be good as a secondary job or even a job for retirees since they don’t give a lot of hours per week. Wouldn’t recommend as primary employment.
bad,"I fairly enjoyed my time at Kohl's. Accociate discount, paid breaks, and weekly pay are a plus. Very little room to move up, and even then it depends on if the store manager likes you. Mine had practically barred me from moving up at all, instead choosing brand new employees- despite what the other supervisors suggested. The last thing is, The ability to access Human Resources is able to be denied by any of your bosses, which may become an issue in case something happens with another employee. Nobody at my store has access."
bad,Workload to compensation ratio is not balanced poor scheduling and not enough staff in each department not enough selections fo customer in store available more online
bad,As the lowest paid associates in the store around 9 a hour it's sad. But even worse is the hours you get like 10-20 hours a week and weak 4 hour shifts. This new ceo needs to care more about associates trying to pay bills. Also we are pushed so hard to sell credit but we hardly get the foot traffic.
bad,"When I first started there, the managers were great and willing to work with your schedule no problem. They were also eager to teach new things and to help advance their associates. After becoming a supervisor, I worked REALLY hard to get my raises. However, they raised everyone up to $10, and I didn't get a raise. I was doing 4x the work of most of my peers and only making $1 more. It was ridiculous. Then the manager changed, and boy did he micromanage. After I left, I know a lot of other people that left because the manager was just not a good person, and didn't care about his employees. They also changed their PTO policy, so where I was getting 2 weeks a year, I ended up getting none. That was ridiculous too."
bad,"To say the least, this job probably was my least favorite due to the lack of urgency in the store.  I like to constantly be doing something and a lot of times we would be standing around waiting.   Other co-workers are friendly but a typical day was dragged out."
bad,"Drugs rampart across the warehouse, incompetent management, I was in charge of the shipping department for several weeks as the acting problem solver (Assistant Supervisor) and wasn't allowed to clock into the function to receive the extra compensation"
bad,The work and management is highly unorganized. The team performance is pretty slow. A lot of politics goes around . Most likely you will not work what you are hired for.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Wouldn't allow me to have my job back after having left for the military and came back. I wouldn't recommend having this place as a reliable job. Otherwise, wasn't a bad job"
bad,I really enjoyed the opportunity to work for such a company. it was the best in the whole wide world. the in in in in in I n in in  in in
bad,"Great Company, Management was terrible!!!!! Management was messy and racist. Everyone was upset and talked about each other."
bad,"Do not work at this co. Management does not work as a team. the hours are flexible, but when it come to management they are not accessible or knowledgeable of what they should be doing in order to train you. this store does not have any order and the store reflects this at time. I work for this company for over ten years part time and because management wasn't good that was my reason I never pursued full time. If you are looking for a co that will invest in you like you would invest in them through good work ethic this company is not a company I will recommend you working for."
bad,The management was absolutely awful.  The company takes care of its own but when one gets down to the management level there was a lot of issues.  people play favorites and find reasons to fire those who aren't liked by managers.  Wouldn't recommend.
bad,Working in the cash office preparing the registers and deposits from the prior day.  Pulling items from the dock to put on the floor keeping the store stocked and  keeping the dock organized and clean.
bad,I did like the work here but it is only seasonal work for most who get sent here.
bad,I loved this position but the store manager always had me doing so many other tasks I couldn't get my actual job done so I always felt way behind with everything. I wasn't getting the hours I was promised and it just caused too much stress for me to work here. The store manager also acted so nasty to everyone. The last shift I worked I don't even think the heat was on. Everyone was so cold and some had mentioned they might have to leave because they couldn't work in those conditions
bad,"wasn’t ever given enough hours even when i requested more, the boss sucks, very rude & judge-mental workers and environment. plz escape while you can."
bad,"I worked at the distribution center in grain valley MO. That was the 1st and only time during my work experience, I felt I worked in a racist establishment. There were many Trump supporters who praised Trump and spoke of being gun owners during daily morning meetings. I felt as if I was working with people who looked like the characters in the series, The Ozarks. I will never work in such a racist establishment again"
bad,Toke this job for a seasonal job at Christmas last year. I was placed in the jewelry department. It was ok at first until you were left alone and you have 20 different customers staring at you. The customers at Kohl’s are super rude and all they want is to make sure they get their discounts and kohl’s cash. The hours were horrible considering it was Christmas time and I had to work until 1:30 in the morning. Do to the ridiculous shopping hours kohl’s wants to stay open for customers. Management wasn’t to bad but they push the kohl’s credit card pretty hard. The employees range from different ages and gender. Some nice and some not so nice. So overall if you are considering a job at kohl’s especially seasonal be prepared for rude child like customers and long hours on your feet.
bad,I didn’t quite enjoy this job. There was a lot of work to do such as putting away items from the bin back to its original spot. The manager was mean. There were a lot of customers.
bad,They return policy is rediculouse they will be bankrupt soon they do not care if you say you are only available certain hours due to family kids they still put u on to work  they dont work with you there rude judgmental
bad,This job sucks !! They work you like a slave while management sits on their behinds! Talk to you as if you’re beneath them and worthless because you’re new ! Just disgusting! Maybe it’s just this location and not the company as a whole but i will not be working there again
bad,"Not bad; just a temporary job. Boring. People are boring. Not someplace, at which to become rich, working. Hours are horrible. They schedule you for 3rd shift without even asking people."
bad,I was only there for a couple months during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I had no training whatsoever. My first day I was left in the breakroom after completing my computer assessments where I waited out the rest of my shift for sometime to come give me a tour. My seasonal position was over when they stopped putting me on the schedule.
bad,Terrible place for advancement. Takes too long to move up and the pay is horrible for the work they expect. The benefits aren't great either so the only reason the job would be good for is a part time second job or something to keep you busy.
bad,"If I'm being honest, I took this job at 17 when I was extremely immature and not ready to work well. I quit when I felt the job was too stressful and began to interfere with my school work, as I was in my senior year of high school. From what I remember, I received very little training on anything other than cash-handling and then was left alone."
bad,"Working there made me extremely anxious and stressed, I received NO training except a couple hours at the registers when that wasn't my actual job. I was just thrown in with all the uppers expecting me to the job that I received no training for. I didn't even know why my manager was. They scheduled me to work until 12 at night as a minor, even after I asked told them that was extremely too late for me. I was forced to quit after being scheduled too late too often."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Kohl's started out a very good place to work then the management changed they stopped the bonus pay outs changed the way you could get increases then had a major lay off.
bad,I disliked my co-workers and my managers were keeping up drama. The overall business is good but not the people working there. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"As a seasonal position, Christmas and New Years, the store was always very busy.  I felt the training was poor  so I had to ask questions when there was a problem with the point of sale system."
bad,When i worked there they had extreme markdowns after christian so anyone who returned without a receipt would get like two dollars for there items. also things were marked as 50% off but the prices never changed.
bad,"worked part time at kohls in Branford,CT. management was bad always pushing you to get customers to apply for the kohl's charge which made the job stressful."
bad,Kohls is the worst job i've ever had. It's also the lowest paying job i've ever had. Management was okay but it's either slow and boring or busy and stressful
bad,I worked here seasonally. Barely got any hours. Management is disorganized. I don't know if it is that way year round or due to the fact that it was during the holidays. Sometimes I would get called in and once I would get there I'd get asked why I was there. No room for advancement. They are really lacking in their training department.
bad,The typical work day involves sorting individual items and scanning them to the appropriate location and once location order is complete you package them while exercise quality assurance.
bad,"My typical day at work is pretty simple. I simply get the day started by having my co workers unload the truck within a certain amount of time. Afterwords we stock freight out onto the floor, set up departments and assist customers. The hardest part of the job is working with people that dont have the ambition to want to see the store succeed. I learned that sometimes those around you dont have the same attitude to see things thru. Kohls is a company that you cant advance too far in, its no structure into making the company succeed, and the rate of employees leaving/staying is 4 to 1."
bad,Keep the conveyor systems operating. Note needed repairs for when the system was down in order to make the necessary repairs except for a break down which would be repaired then
bad,i learned that not every manager isnt your ally but if with the right night shift employees i was able to get my work done faster and more  effecient
bad,"For such a large organization, there should be stronger leaders in the HR department.  The goal is to be political and not do what is best for the company.  It really is a shame"
bad,great place to work at coworkers are great cashier was fun got to meet a lot of new people the most enjoyable part is getting make new friend.
bad,"It is a busy store. Even for part timers there is lot to do."
bad,"First retail job. Sales associate is assigned to a department and your job is to keep the store looking nice and clothing out of the fitting room. Job was ok, the worst around christmas season because of the returns."
bad,if you dont have much to do in your life than kohls is the place for you 
bad,"If you are apply for the shoe lead, please beware, it's a very demanding job, that you will not get any help and no support from management. "
bad,"When I first started, I thought this was a great place because of the people and management. Laid back and relaxed. I loved it. But in 2 years, I had 3 managers. Crazy. There are only 2 positions in maintenance which is poor for a career. "
bad,The side I was located on my managers just seemed racist to me they wanted to over work us like we was slaved we had to do work from our shift the night shift and more and when we needed help they pressured us to hurry up when they as managers suppose to be leaders should have helped out not stand around telling us we moving to slow or not to talk why you work
bad,dont give enough hours if your not fulfilling credit goals regardless of other hard work  they feel like getting credits  is most important . fast paced and stress full
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The management at the Medina Ohio Kohl's is simply rude. There are only two E3s that were nice. The store manager is very nice though. If you want a day off you better write an extreme reason why or you likely won't get it. It is slow almost everyday and the minutes take hours to pass. And don't kill time by talking to an employee- you should be doing work (even though there is nothing to do). Their ""generous"" employee discount is less than I got at Macy's. They are also very annoyed when jewelry asks to go on scheduled breaks or to the restroom. Most of the time they ignore the request, so it's better to call a manager over and then ask. They also push credits too hard. I can't force someonw to sign up for a Kohl's charge, which has even been stated as one of the worst cards to have! The one good thing I can say is that the dress code is very sensible."
bad,"this store is very good with working with my school schedule, letting me off to makeup test and makeup days and such. the work load is completely unreasonable for one person. the credit goal and email goal is completely crazy for one day and that is all the management cares about in the store, they will make you feel bad because no one wants to open a charge card and/or they already have one."
bad,"our days would always be different, some days would go by slow, other days would be fast. I learned how to handle money transaction for the store, how to do store inventory, ticketing of store items, add set, and returns. Management was great, co-workers were amazing to be around, I've gained a life long friend through kohl's. Sometimes the hardest part was the really hectic days where it seem like the go backs for each departments where never ending."
bad,full of drama management sucks they don't care about nothing they say they do
bad,"Over"
bad,I worked at Kohl's for a couple months. I got the job right around when I found out I was pregnant. They knew I was pregnant. I very clearly told them this. I went 6 hours without a break which usually isn't an issue. But me being pregnant my body took it harder then normal. I ended up in the ER not being able to walk with severe back pain. I had multiple managers making fun of the pain I was in behind my back. It just overall wasn't a good place to work.
bad,Don't apply to Kohls right now. The managers there don't know how to manage at all. They treat the employees like dirt and make everyone very uncomfortable. The don't train you on anything so when you have questions you're left feeling like an idiot because they don't want to help. They never even come up to answer customers questions.  We have one manager who is pregnant. She uses that as her excuse to act out maliciously towards employees and supervisors there. She screams demands at employees and if you don't respond fast enough she threatens to pull you into her office. I wish I could write out all of her actions because it is the most disturbing example of management I've ever seen. Plus when it all comes down to it the store manager doesn't care AT ALL. She allows this behavior and seems that she wants her store to be a complete failure.
bad,worst management I've experienced and don't cooperate if your taking classes as they would keep you longer than expected even if you told them early that you have mandatory classes
bad,"They don't have hours, they hire so many seasonal workers but there's no hours for them. They work me one day for 5 hours then off for two weeks. They did not bother to train me. Ridiculous"
bad,"Great place, nice people, loved working at my own pace rather than following someone else. I am a fast paced person and Kohl’s was excellent for that."
bad,"Kohls is a very friendly work environment good with job description, need to work on scheduleing for seasonal otherwise recommend to work there !!!!!!"
bad,Management not respectful. Had a great manager but he left. Our assistant took over and she is terrible. Everyone hates being here now. Wish it could be like it was.
bad,"I would give less stars if I could but Kohls is not a good place to work at."
bad,The entire store is just a game of favorites. Management does not get along causing a lot of confusion when trying to get questions answered. Training is poor and the schedule is not flexible.
bad,"it's not a hard job, but you can have some very difficult customers. the pace is very chaotic, one second it's busy, and then the next minute it's dead, and then it's busy past closing time. never expect to get consistent hours, nor the times you'd prefer. also one of the managers is very sneaky and vindictive."
bad,If you're applying for a job at Kohl's do not become a cashier your life will become a living nightmare of credits and competitive nonsense all the other positions are cool cashier though just don't do it
bad,"Most of the managers are kind but none agree with each other, 1 manager will tell you to focus on something that day and atleast 2 others will try to get you onto something else and try to put that previous project to the side for another day."
bad,They regularly did not listen to what employees told and had numerous issues with problems that could have been avoided had they listened to us. Also favoritism.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,was cashier from november of 2005 to january of 2006. ring up customers and helped them with their purchases. fast paced especially around the holiday season
bad,"Very unorganized company with poor management. The people who worked there were very kind and easy to work and get along with. They paid $1.75 above minimum wage, but did not treat their employees with care."
bad,"They always scheduled me at the end of my availability. So I would work 6:30 to 10:30pm. Not enough work hours, revolving door, pay is horrible. Management was OK. All they really care about is credit card sales. The clothes discount was 15% which is OK. Would not recommend working here if you need to pay many bills. It barely kept my phone on."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. Let’s start with the fact that the management is the most pathetic immature group of women. It was truly sad the see them acting like a bunch of high school girls.. gossiping about their employees to OTHER employees... as well as each other. Their behavior caused this establishment to have terrible work morale... and nothing but drama that they did nothing at all to resolve or put a stop to. The one male manager was profoundly inappropriate which also was never addressed or dealt with. A good deal of associates here were also incredibly disrespectful. They displayed racism, homophobia and xenophobia. Even if you can find a way to get passed all of that.. the job itself is an absolute terror. They would have one sales associate covering half the store.. and expect to not have a single piece of clothing unfolded or in the fitting room. Which is also tricky to do being that the second there is more than one person in line you’re being paged to the register. Lastly there is an intense pressure placed upon associates to trick customers into applying for their credit card by having them think they get a discount even when not approved (which they don’t) and if they do get a discount it’s a very small one that was already in the catalog. Which you don’t even need to apply for credit to get. When they are not meeting the credit goal, they then direct their attention to their associates.. pressuring them to apply for credit. Very inappropriate and unprofessional. Also extremely high turn-over here...... after all this it’s hard to wonder why...."
bad,"With the management staff there, it was their way or no way. They didn't listen to others ideas for sales, were ignorant of complaints about lack of work ethic from certain employees, and only rewarded cashiers for their ability to open a credit card."
bad,kohls was good got paid weekly co workers got along the only bad part was the customers they sucked and we always got blamed for theyre wrong doings even when it had nothing to do with us nothing was enjoyable i learned nothing and the managaer was a weirdi
bad,Working at Kohls was literally the worst thing ever. Management if full of insulting and belligerent people who have no problem not doing any work and solely putting all the work on the other associates. I will never work there again.
bad,"The management here is very unprofessional, there was so much gossip you would think you are back in high school. The hours were inconsistent and managers did not follow our availibility. This job was stressful because mangers will schedule one person to cover almost every department and be on the registers."
bad,Customers are allowed to call you names and scream at you if they do not get their Kohl's Cash. I finally got the point I gave Kohl's Cash away without the customer saying anything.
bad,"While working at kohls, the hours were inconsistent, the pay is horrible and the raises are pathetic. they do not provide healthcare if you are not full-time... yet they never have any full-time positions available or room to advance."
bad,"Kohl's was great as a starting gig during  college, but the place is too full of High School tendencies when it comes to promoting candidates from in-house."
bad,Secretary does the scheduling. Mangement tells employees to mark items as damaged so they can purchase items. Upper management talks about lower management behind their backs to floor associates in the warehouse.
bad,"Mass confusion, no one really knows who is in charge or the manager on duty will just pass the buck so no situation gets taken care of. Schedule just seems to be a ""guideline"" and not something that gets adhered to."
bad,must be willing to be a hard worker and a very flexible worker. Being flexible in hours and tasks. you may get called in at anytime which is good due to more hours.
bad,"Kohl's won't pay you and promise room for growth, but only allow ""friends"" to obtain promotions. Prepare to be called on your days off consistently only to have your hours drastically cut soon after."
bad,Working at Kohl's was great in the ning. Everyone was so nice and helpful.After training ended and i knew all my basics everything slowly went down hill. There was a lack of organization and many scheduling errors.
bad,"Ok place to work, unrealistic deadlines given for floorsets."
bad,"I worked for the janitorial cleaning company Kohls hired and it was the worst job i ever had. Within the first month of working there i had my car keyed and hit. The employees would flood toilets, lock stalls, completely destroy the break room. They fired me cause i did my job. They really didnt have a reason and this is right before xmas. They never found out or even talked to me about my car.They just tbrew it uder the rug and said their camera didnt xover that area"
bad,The place is never clean. Clothes are all over the floor and always everywhere they aren't supposed to be. The managers aren't understanding and are constantly rude to you even if you are doing exactly as you are supposed to with our being told and they tell at you for nothing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I thought that the managers criticisms were not constructive and often times unfair. While they were understanding people, they often used things against you at other times. They were very baised and the new hires were often mistreated."
bad,"Very slow stood at register and cashed out people,hard to walk around and be productive when sometime u are the only one at the register"
bad,"Not a fan of Kohls. When i submitted my application, i told them cashier and they put me on  the floor. Every shift i worked was closing and as a student, I cannot work 8 hour days, 2 jobs, and close. I was not happy here"
bad,Its the same thing everyday assist customers and back up register.
bad,This position afforded me the opportunity to receive income during a transitional phase in my life.  The work load was steady--just how I like it!
bad,The staff was a mess and very unprofessional. The staff should really consider being more helpful to new employees.
bad,Rude and mean management. Bullies staff and staff will slack as revenge. Too much stress for too little pay
bad,"Kohl's is a fast-paced work environment. You have a chance to make lots of new friends. However, one of the main reasons I quit is because I was being scheduled 39 hours per week (they didn't want to give me the benefits of working full-time) while I was full-time student. I asked them several times to reduce my hours, and was passed around from manager to manager every time for a month and a half, so it never got fixed. I ended up struggling to get homework done, and as a result, failed some classes. It wasn't until I told them I was quitting that they immediately offered to fix the schedule conflict, but I told them I wasn't interested anymore, unless they paid me for the classes they caused me to fail by not fixing the problem sooner."
bad,"The training sucked, the management sucked, the pay sucked, and the environment and snooty people that worked there sucked as well."
bad,It is a really nice to work and to interact with other people.
bad,slave shop. don't care bout anything. maintgenance manger is a  joke
bad,"Bad experience, self centered management falure to train new or seasonal employees it takes more then one day to learn the pos system falure to give hours or be put on a schedule.Constantly calling to come in .HR shouldn't be doing schedules and manging the store."
bad,"worse job that I had in five years there. non competitive pay, awful management."
bad,This was a ok place to work. It was late hours but fun. I didn't really talk to my co-workers we'd all always be listening to music in head phones since it was after hours.
bad,"It's a typical clothing, retail position.  There is a lack of inspiration for their employees."
bad,It had horrible customer service.  They treated their employees like diry.  The had no respect for their employees.  It was a horrible working environment.
bad,"I love the hours they gave me, its mostly more than the usual retail stores. There are a lot of customers, and with it being a bigger store its more messy than the usual. Holidays was alot to deal with, but I still love the environment. The management and supervisors are not really in to making small talk. They are always down for business, but that's it. Working there felt like impersonal."
bad,Nice place to work to far of a drive though..................
bad,I loved my job at Kohls but it simply did not work with the new semester of school I was starting.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,5am shift. Merchandising. Folding clothes. Take shipment off the truck. Learned time management.
bad,This was a seasonal job that lasted for three months in which i unloaded trucks overnight and set up fo the next shift.
bad,"it was ok, very nice clothing, and co workers. you meet new customers everyday."
bad,"I learned about sales, how to treat customers, the only hard part was that if you didnt get any applications for their credit cads they would cut your hours until you dont work anymore."
bad,"Management wants to run the store on a skeleton crew and then wonders why the department is not clean and recovery is not done. Hired  in as a “lead” in a department. “Leads” at Kohl’s are stocking. No one to lead because there is no one below a “lead” at the company. Was lucky enough, with my previous work history, to negotiate my rate for more than people who have been there17 yrs."
bad,It use to be a great place to work at. I have nothing great to  say about working at Kohls Distribution Center...………………………… ………..………………….. ……. …………...
bad,"Time here was so long ago and mostly as a high school job, however it was nice. Cant complain, if you went to work and did what you could do then you were fine. It was pretty hard to get fired."
bad,"early starts, good pay, leads are lazy, favoritism, high expectations, sometimes there are no orders, tedious work, loading/unloading, no communication, most workers are lazy"
bad,My direct supervisor treat me so bad it was a nightmare go to the store every single day . Management did not do nothing  about it. She cut me the hours when I was a hard worker. I did not forget this place ever  because the bad treatment I received here because management is worthless . Look for another place to work not this one! If you want to have a healthy environment work !         th
bad,"the store, I worked in had nothing for us to do on break not even a TV to watch while on lunch break. If they would have giving me more then one day a week I would've stayed with Kohl's the work wasn't heard and it was a fun p;ace to work."
bad,"The Bosses were terrible. They lied and told me that they were planning on keeping me, but fired me off, along with multiple other individuals."
bad,Kohls likes to shorten peoples hours and have other people pick up the slack. They are spiteful and you have to deal with rude customers along with rude management.
bad,My job was one that was in high demand. I learned how to multitask while being organzied
bad,Overall the company is great. Management in the store were great and co workers were also good.
bad,"Enjoyed working at store 385, we operated in a family setting, work hours were exceptional, best management you could ask for.  We were family.  A lot of free lunches and associate in action events to make you day go fast."
bad,"A typical day of work is dealing with customers."
bad,"cleaned dressing rooms, cashiered, racked clothing, customers came first"
bad,I  loved working at kohl's. I learned how to operate a cash register. Got better at my communication skills. Every co-worker was there when I needed help.
bad,Nice co-workers. Very fast pace working environment. Learned how to operate a cash register. They keep a clean and safe work environment.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"One of my more favorite jobs, everyone was so nice and warm and the customer service skills always make people feel welcome and coming back for more."
bad,I was a seasonal associate and it was horrible. The managers there arent really helpful when it comes to calling them for help. Management is horrible. but this job would be good for students still in school. its not s decent pay unless they actually give you full hours. The work culture was pretty calm the employees are nice. but i just didnt have a good experience there and i worked my butt there.
bad,"Part-time job"
bad,"Full time lasted 2 weeks during a holiday then cuts you down to 24 , 18, and 8 hours for a week! Made me work midnight shifts sometimes doing markdowns, when I was hired for 5am freight shifts. They don't care if you need the job to survive or not. Everyone who isn't management needs a second more dependable job to pay their cost of living bills. Very disappointing company ."
bad,The workload balanced with being a mom and wife is very difficult. It’s discouraging and disheartening to put all of the time and effort into work and then being so exhausted you can’t spend time with your family.
bad,"The managers played favoritism, the hours where just all over the place, if I needed help with something the managers would give me attitude for it, also I went to a funeral before going to work and they were making fun of me because my eyes were tearing up"
bad,This job messed with me I got sick & had to keep going despite that. They made me do one thing then came to check on me so they can say they didn’t tell me to do that said they needed me on the other side of the store & I clearly seen them point in the direction I was in
bad,"If you want to have a balance between school, work, and personal life.. cant say that I recommend this place. "
bad,worst management i’ve ever encountered. managers talk bad about employees to other employees. they forgot to schedule someone for two weeks straight so they ended up leaving too.
bad,The level of thinking you need to perform the work is very little. The staff is not motivated to advance. And if you want to do little no thinking then  this is great job for you.
bad,Just no  some people were nice to work with  overall worst work experience I’ve ever had  managers were rude  they would purposefully make work life awful for people so they would quit if they didn’t like their personality
bad,Some days they were slow paced and they told some people to go home early. Pay not enough especially when they tell some people to go home because it is slow.
bad,"I have always really loved Kohl’s. Got hired for seasonal work over the holidays. Very disappointed. Favorites are played, gossip is awful, no training, no meetings, store stayed a wreck even though we worked nonstop, hours were minimal, management mostly just watched instead of pulling their sleeves up and helping their employees, zero structure whatsoever."
bad,"They hired me on in a ""group interview"" but nobody else showed up to the interview. They scheduled me for 4 hours every friday for I'm guessing what would have been just for my first few weeks but I wouldn't know. This was my first job and I had a good attitude and work ethic, however I struggled a bit doing seemingly basic tasks such as cashier work. Instead of making an effort to train me up, they decided I was too much of a liability and let me go. One day they just stop scheduling me after I had only been there for 4 weeks and this being my first job. They even straight up told me when I got hired that they hired seasonal employees and let people go after the season is up if they do not meet standards. I was not informed that this would be terminated at any point in the position before the season was up, nor was I told about the poor lack of work hours offered to me. I definitely would NOT recommend this position."
bad,Did not like working holidays and late hours during the Christmas season.  I continue to shop at kohl’s as I was a customer prior to my employment there
bad,"Overall, I loved working for Kohl's as a company. But management at our local store loved to take advantage of their ""Open availability"" requirements. I have 2 children, and knew I couldn't get hired on unless I had open availability. But management took advantage of that and wanted me to work almost 40 hours in 3 days during the holiday season. Running on less than 3 hours of sleep and not eating for days wore me down. If I mentioned anything about needing a little more time to actually be a Mom, they constantly told me they didn't have to have me and I was free to go anytime."
bad,"Worst place I worked for, knew what to do better than my manager did. if you argue with management about how to do something better. they will label you as not team player and cut your hours."
bad,"Stressful, coworkers would rather watch another coworker struggle instead of helping each other. There a clicks, you can either be in one or bee looked at weird. They will just stop scheduling you and that is how they will let you go."
bad,"I was technically a part time worker but working full time hours. I was forced to work for too long without a break. I was forced to open a store card because the ""numbers for the month aren't where we need them"", as the STORE manager put."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Terrible Management. Managers did not care to help when I was being harassed by a coworker and refused to work with my availability while being a high school student/
bad,I worked hard and made sure all my task were done to the best of my ability. I open and closed in the jelwery dept for 3 years. I never felt appreciated nor did I ever feel totally safe due to lack of security I. The store
bad,Management hard to work with. No kind of advancement at all. I worked there just shy of 6 years and never was promoted anywhere. My pay was not enough to make a living on. I did everything in that place but one department and I didnt want it cause of the responsibility. There was no team work with anything and ALOT of favortisium
bad,"Hostile work environment, gossip flooded the sales floor made for an awkward work atmosphere. Management was inconsistent with how the proceeded with my hours"
bad,"If you’re lucky you might get a good group of management, but I’ve worked at several Kohl’s and most of them are terrible. The only good thing is the discounts and seemingly low prices."
bad,You should only work here if you want a part time job while in college. It's exstreamly difficult to have a good position if you are not a manager. The manager's are very poor at doing their job right they will hire anyone. They treat hard working employees bad. If you do work hard then they make you do all the work while the people they make friends with does nothing and they get praise for doing nothing.
bad,"Stay away from this company! No wonder their sales are dropping due to fierce competition in the retail world. Work somewhere else, a work atmosphere that resembles a cult."
bad,"A typical day is on the dock most of the 4 hours unloading the semi. I really learned that most people do not follow the rules there. Management was crazy I had 4 managers in the time I worked there and one was drinking and popping pill on work hours and came in drunk all the time and took it out on me (yelling), so i was always in trouble for being too ""slow"". The hardest part was putting up with that manager and a couple of other people that were always yelling at people."
bad,I was not happy with them. they threw me on the floor on black friday after 2 weeks on the cash register. I had no idea what I was doing and people could not help me because they were so busy doing their own thing.
bad,"The only thing that saves this job is the E3s. Or the floor managers. They leave you to your work, trust you with the outcome and are fully open to questions. The upper management usually doesn't know what they are talking about and usually treats its employees like plain idiots. The store manager is a great one though, he gets the job done quickly and efficiently."
bad,You are immediately put at the bottom of the barrel when you start working. They do not care about any other responsibilities that you have. They expect your number one priority to be working and to Kohl's.
bad,"a typical 6 hour day"
bad,"Very stressful and you are not appreciated I would not recommend this company"
bad,this company has an issue with management they choose people who don't consider the feelings of their associates and talk behind their backs. it was not a fun place to work and i felt ridiculed everyday.
bad,The team of people you work with here are great and they are very friendly and helpful. Management however not so much. The store manager in particular belittles you if you ask a question and has a bad temper.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Loved working there. Hated that they wanted you to ask customers at least 3 times to sign up for credit card. Had nice people to work with. The hardest was no training to speak of. "
bad,"My crew has been short since April. Management has yet to hire anyone for my shift. When there is a hostile person they overlook it and do not address accordingly, meaning this person still works here even after this person got in the face of a manager. All other crews are fully staffed and its unfair. I like working 3 days on and 4 off I would love to be on the shift I have requested for months but don't know if that's going to happen. Management needs an upgrade badly!"
bad,"in fact i only give it two stars because they always have food in the break room but other than that, this company is 100% terrible. the managers are just the worst human beings!"
bad,I only worked at this company to pay my tuition which barely did that. It was a horrible disgraceful job even for a teenager.
bad,"Most of management is lacking. On the phone most of the time. "
bad,"A place to make some fast cash but not a place to grow and become a team leader, not very many friendly supervisors that's all that I would have to say about them"
bad,"Due to their corporate policies that make the customer always right, even when they are abusive, it is a very hostile place to work. Management focus lies only on the numbers, not on reality of achieving goals, building teams, or actually giving customers a good retail experience."
bad,"Working at Kohl's was ok, the hours were all over the place and when people called in, you had to stay and work their shift. The customers were great, very friendly."
bad,A typical work day in merchandising is unloading a lot of new merchandise. When I was there the poor management sat in the break room all day while a few people scrambled to get the job done.
bad,"Go in and report to manager. Go to designated side of store. Ring up customers, scan coupons,and help them to car. Management  were ok with helping with any issues we had with the coupons, complaints etc. Hardest was to make sure the prices are right, coupons worked. Most  enjoyable was to be able to learn  and work with people."
bad,"Unable to grow in the company."
bad,I worked over 40 hours a week and never got promoted to full time. It was all about the all mighty dollar. Really high turnover rate.
bad,"I learned a lot in my 7 years at Kohl's. I'm at a point where I can no longer advance, and the company has shifted the daily and weekly duties, so with that and being short staffed the expectations asked of me are unrealistic."
bad,"Working as a Loss Prevention associate is fun, get to chase thief, follow them with the cameras."
bad,"low pay,  most people who work there do not care about their jobs or how the store looks, probably a result of the low pay"
bad,"They didnt want to give me a supervior position that opened up, no mater how qualified i was"
bad,"This job was an uncomfortable environment for me, the costumers had its perks tho. The management team did not even look out for there employees and were nasty"
bad,"This was a very stressful job, with very little or no training.  Management did no communicate and only looked out for themselves.  No one was held accountable and everyday was chaos."
bad,"Kohl's work culture was alright. Although, it is a warehouse so the job still sucks. They have small perks which make the job semi tolerable. The 2 biggest grievances about the job were they hire temp heavy, and they don't really have a lot of work. So when that happens, they send all the temps home. And as you can imagine, when the holidays or busy seasons are through, the temps are kicked to the curb. Back to square one with no job. It's not a good look."
bad,Rude management and staff worse job start and stop times. Also never gave any room for input on anything dealing with the work day
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Management does not care about their employees. While working there I was being blamed for things that I didn't do. Would not recommended working there the pays sucks no set hours and no benefits. This store just doesn't care about any employees
bad,not great. worked long hours over night for very low pay. machines are easy to use. easy job
bad,"This particular store I worked at was terrible.  I was treated poorly by co-workers and management. I was bullied and called a liar, and I was punished by only have 6 to 11 hours a week.  I was incredibly disappointed as I had always wanted to work for this company and I was treated so badly.  One co-worker's distaste for me was taken into higher regard than anyone else's who liked me and I was punished for this woman's immaturity."
bad,"Nice people to work with, mostly assisted customers & did a large amount of stocking and tidying the area. It would get very busy with everyone in a rush"
bad,"A typical day is completing my ad set jobs, making sure all signage is correctly displayed and current. I also make sure my departments are clean and organized and all packages are correctly displayed. Since rejoining the workforce I have re learned time management in my position, making sure all tasks are complete before my shift ends. I have also learned how to complete my tasks even when unforseen events or problems arise in my work day.  I find my co-workers to be supportive and friendly and enjoy spending time with them outside of work and I would consider them one of the most enjoyable things about going to work everyday. I also enjoy organizing and take pride in how the are I am supervising looks to management and customers.  The hardest part of my job is the hours. A typical week for me is a couple overnights with double shifts sprinkled in and adjusting is difficult."
bad,JCPenney was a good place to work at the time because I was just getting out of school and living home with my parents but job security is very iffy because after the holidays almost no one gets hours to make any money.
bad,"Working there was a nightmare. Why, you may ask? When I was there and I was very sick and had to go to the hopsital and I received points when i couldn't make it to work. It is a horrible company to work for."
bad,"If you are in high school yeah its a good job but if this is your only job the benefits suck cause you basically get nothing for your hard work. I worked my butt off during the holidays and cant even earn paid time off. And then your hours get slashed badly to the point you hardly work after the holidays. And the management suck they ride you all day about the fitting rooms and the floor, and the kohls charge."
bad,It was a long and hard days that I had at that place. I was all about management and not about the employee.
bad,they favortize people and dont give you enough hours! i ended up quitting bc they would only work me one day a week!
bad,Its ok job but no supervisor enforcement. Not set scheduling.
bad,I am eloquent and have confident in whatever
bad,"Terrible to work for, pay is minimum wage at best. Lucky to work 4 hours a week even when reliable and never calls off work."
bad,Almost all of the employees are always in a bad mood and did not like or want to help customers out. Most of the time there was a lot of bickering and attitude from management.
bad,"So when I was hired on, I was trained for the Shoe Department for the Holiday season. After said season, the decided since I was a temporary help anyway, they threw me into Home Goods, Intimiates (despite having no knowledge), and both Toddler/Kids departments. They started me off by folding and organizing display racks of clothing, attending to dressing rooms, and assisting customers on the sale floor. I felt like I was the only one helping on the floor while everyone else just stood their and talked. Once I was pulled away to organize some back stock for a floor manager, only to be paged ten minutes later to clean up said shoe department. Even though there are 3 of us in this department, I was pulled from place to place, often being scolded at for not doing said task when I was occupied by another. Despite the treatment, I tried my best to provide customer services, answer calls for my department, get my department task somewhat completed, and put away all go backs, even some in not my department. I will never work for this company ever again."
bad,Company used to treat associates as well as their customers. Company used to develop associates into leadership programs and now out sources. Company treats associates poorly. No support from HR when having problems with upper management.  High School environment created by management. Negative atmosphere.
bad,when I was hired they just threw me on a register without showing me anything. then management got mad for me asking questions when they didn't do the proper training.
bad,"They under pay for the work and bs you have to put up with...The managers are disrespectful and search you before leaving after shifts, Not worth my time"
bad,"If asked a question to management got a different answer depending what manager you talk to. management team Loved the customers, After we would tell the customers we weren't able to do something per company policy the manager would not back me and say yes we can. Made to feel I was thrown off the bus."
bad,No support from management. Too much drama. From day one of working here I loved it. Then management soon changed and it’s been down hill since then.  Sad to see.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I thought this would be an alright seasonal job. I also thought I would be cashiering or doing simple stocking. Well I got the flu (fever plus extreme mucus for 5 days) and upon missing one day the manager basically said they would call me back and let me know if I had a job still. They never called me back. In fact I had to bug them to get my schedule to begin with. There was no hey get a doctor's note or anything like that. And then I get my next week's schedule and it's all 530am shifts. No one said anything about working that early. Honestly it felt like they were gonna punish me for being sick. So yeah management sucks. The staff was miserable. And the pay was way too low to unload trucks at 5am.
bad,Working here is a super stressful environment. People rarely show up for work. Others rarely do their own work and blame everyone else for their lack of completion.
bad,I had just finished school and my school loan was about to be due. I just filled out many job applications on line and kohl's was the first to respond and gave me a job.
bad,"I worked for this company for over 13 yrs.  But when I transfered, the company promised me that I would get 36 hours.  They lied, I got only 5-10 hrs a week. "
bad,"ABSOLUTELY don't work here!!!!! "
bad,Job is tough and hard.  management was no so good as to make sure it was a fair environment for everyone. I would see people on their phones while others where unloading the trucks.
bad,"The place is disgusting, they dont vacuum. The lack of hours, i been for some many years and only give who want to give. Management is horrible, they have no compassion."
bad,"When Kohls first opened years ago, making customers feel important&welcomed was important. Now focus is meeting the daily goal of opening new credit accounts. As an employee you are only treated well by management if you are contributing to those credit goals.  Working well with your fellow employees&treating your customers within  true kindness, &doing your job well is not reconized. Team work is not part of the culture there either. Communication is lacking as well, especially from managment. Moral is very low. Many employees are under appreciated."
bad,"Most of the “H2’s” were unprofessional and they constantly talked behind their employees back about things not pertaining to work. There were multiple scandals caused by the “H2’s” yet they’re still there. Some would harass the younger female employees using their power over them because they had an interest in them. They constantly question what their employees are doing in a condescending manner and would try to embarrass them. None of them are on the same page, one will tell you do one thing while another will have you do something else, then they both get mad that you’re not doing what they asked. One has admitted that they will use what little power they have to take out their frustration on the employees and when the employees complained to the store manager no changes were made.  The work load is terrible, they will have two people on the floor and expect them to maintain the floor, fitting rooms, and back up the registers yet they get upset when they see the floor is a mess. And finally whenever  corporate would come to visit, they would be on their best behavior and praise their employees but as soon as they left they would go back to their old ways."
bad,"It was very slow paced,  only worked during holidays it was ok until after Christmas.  Then less than stellar hours and pay. Management was very clicky, not sure I will recommend."
bad,"Wasted years of my life trying to advance in a company that cares more about money than their customers or associates. Hr is a joke, management is a joke, and they have issues in consistency in what is actually happening."
bad,"Khols did not provide training, they expected you to know everything. Scheduling was off and no planned training for new hires. Always have to wear hills or flats for women although you were on your feet all day"
bad,"only worked at this location a few months"
bad,Worked here 3 years and they wanted to train me on every job to work and fix mess ups but no extra pay. Then after you do all the work no advancement because it's all about who you know and who is with who.
bad,"too high of standards for a retail position, illegal activity and shady practices,the push to be the top store in credit, sales, and customer service was unreal, i hardly shop there just because of how poorly everyone was treated.  Management would berate you in front of customers, harass employees, promote friends and use tricks or tactics to engage in unfair practices.  People were denied breaks and lunches, then the HR person would fix the punches by hand. We were also not allowed to leave at the end of our scheduled time, for the first few years, anyone closing was required to stay in store, yes we got paid but were at times only allowed to go home either after we pulled a full shift or if we had class in the morning.  I onces was forced to stay until 5 am."
bad,"Coworkers are childish, along with some of the managers. Pay is barely decent. When you express concerns to management is goes into one ear and out of the other. My particular manager is scared to talk to one of my coworkers so she gets away with everything."
bad,"expected to work off duty hours without pay, requiring to fill in when someone calls in, while also being required to perform your duties.  Expecting to go to charity events which is fine, but get in trouble when family responsibilities won't allow"
bad,"When working with the right people the job can be very pleasant and positive but certain managers just have a way of bringing everyone down. They take no consideration that you have other obligations, considering this it is a part time job. The scheduling manager is one of the laziest and most incompetent people I’ve ever met. I have no idea how she even got the job. Usually not enough enough people scheduled to cover the floor which leaves the store looking messy and is unfair to other associates."
bad,Management team needs to be improved. Managers always lost. Always messing up people’s hours. Favoritisms takes presidency over job ethics.  Managers need to not be rude
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I really wish that once they keep you after seasonal your pay would increase. At least by a dollar. There's really nothing else to tell. After the holidays the comrodery is gone! Very cut throat.
bad,"Could be a fun place to work, but workplace politics and finger-pointing ruin the potential of being a happy and helpful associate. When things go wrong management looks for a scape-goat instead of taking responsibility and protecting the workers that do the heavy-lifting so that they can appear to be successful leaders."
bad,I’ve worked for kohl’s for almost a year. I was hired to be someone who worked on the truck and I only work one or two days out of the week resulting in a pay of 30-40 dollars
bad,i have a hearing impairment so i was made fun of and judged. i was made to feel uncomfortable. i was just learning how to adjust to mey hearing loss. it was very uncomfortable to work there.
bad,Management often scheduled outside availability and asked you to perform jobs that you were not hired for. They are not interested in taking care of their associates. Overall they only care about other managers.
bad,"It was fast paced and coworkers were friendly. Management was a mess. Worked as seasonal but wanted to stay. They let me go without telling me in person, or at all. They pretty much just told me that if I was on the schedule I was working, but never specified if I was still employed by them. Went in weekly for nearly two months to see if I still had a job, only to receive my W2 stating the last day I worked was when I was terminated. To my understanding, it was just the management at that particular store."
bad,Very stressful job environment. Multiple job functions without additional compensation. Most management is not knowledgeable or helpful and lots of favoritism. Room for advancement is mostly based on brown nosing.
bad,"This was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had, even in retail. They haven't kept up with competitors with pay, and the discount is a joke. Zero work/life balance, and even consistent workers who stay on for a long time get treated poorly by the store manager."
bad,"This isn't a horrible place to work and most of the people you work around are kind, but the management team, outside of a few, were very brutal. When you need help, it is frowned upon to ask for it. In my 8 years of customer service oriented jobs, this is the one that I felt I got to help customers the least, and was at the discretion of managements opinion the most."
bad,The management team is shady and is often skirting the rules and practicing very unethical behavior toward employees in order to manipulate a situation to their advantage. Not a company I would ever recommend if I liked the person.
bad,"Store manager was negative, manipulative, egocentric. Eliminated all assisting mngrs that advocated for associates,  ended up with her own spineless crew that were only driven by their own self interests, being $$$, so they stoked her ego to remain at the top. Raises that were supposed to come regularly, came intermittently, if at all. Kohls open door policy and ""no repercussions,""was a joke at this store. Entire staff was either super intimidated, or they spied around to relay info to store mngr to elevate their positions. What was a fun place to work, in over-two years became an unsettling, stressful environment!"
bad,u get locked in for 8 hrs or longer and every 1 there was rude and constantly looked down on other people it was very clicky  and total favoritism from mangement
bad,managers don't care if you work like a dog to get things done they employee is not appreciated they just want faster and then they give insignificant hours. many customers have complaints about the treatment of the khohls employees and rightfully so because they are not able to be attended as they should because there are either too many workers that can not fully help because they must get their things done asap or risk getting yelled at or there are NO employees available because they haven't given anybody any hours.  a customer once told me that it wasn't fair that they had us working like robots and I replied it's ok it's a job and it puts food on the table... but she was right ... not only is working at khohls stressful and demanding but on top of that you get managers that begin to implicate ideas that they believe will make us work faster but it is just extra weight that is thrown onto if the employee and then we get yelled at for not doing things right... your ideas don't work they just end up stressing everybody out. the only good things about khohls are their discounts and most of the people that you meet.. the people that work at khohls are extremely hard workers that go above and beyond but once again are never appreciated.. there are many times were the kohls employee do not take their break because they want to finish their tasks but instead of saying thank you .. management disapproves and tells them they need to work faster and better... WE ARE NOT ROBOTS... don't take advantage that I order to feed our families we need and have to work ... we work really hard
bad,"I did not like working at Kohls one bit. The only upside was that I made $9 an hour. The hours were sparse and hard to come by, management was very uncooperative, and the customers were very rude in the area that I had worked in. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere."
bad,I spent time in several different positions at Kohl's.  It felt like each position kept getting worse and worse.  Management was awful.  The company direction was awful.  The culture was awful.
bad,Management is not flexible when it comes to student schedules and student sports obligations.  The hardest part of the job was being the youngest on the team and everyone on the floor staff dreaded it because it was non stop labor and they weren't willing to team everyone everything. Slight sense of favoritism.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Overall I did not like working there at all, they expected too much for a first time worker with no prior experience in the work force. Often they would forget to let you go on break, get mad when you didn't get five credits a day even though you try and no one really wants them, because no one wants a new credit card. They could also be mean donkies."
bad,"I was employed for Kohls to 2.5 years. I was never in trouble with HR (never got a write up). I doubled my performance compared to the prior year. Never missed always moving my schedule around to satisy the ""business needs"". I was in a very bad situation that I did mention to my new recently hired manager. I was forced to move out from my apartment and only had 30 days to do that. With everything that was going on including a mass shooting that occurred I was terminated because I missed 2 days of work. I explained what happened and a week went by and I was terminated. Kohls prides themselves for caring about their associates but it is not the case."
bad,"they would not make me a full time employ in order to pay me less. when i asked for more hours they gave me 12 hours per week. they fire good workers and reward the ones that kiss up to the managers but do no work. most of the managers do nothing to make it a safe environment as i was harassed and bullied there, it only stopped because HR finally got involved. they also take over two hours to let you go on your break and instead pick their favorites to take their breaks first even if you've been working for over four hours and the favorites had been working two hours."
bad,"I would really have a hard time recommending working there for more than a few months and look for another job "
bad,"I  enjoyed and did not enjoy, Management clueless about productivity, Work could be strenuous and tough, no checkout between shifts, management incommunicative"
bad,"A typical day was either working on registers or in the shoes department.  I learned how to use a register. Management was bad, very unprofessional. Multiple occasions of harassment, no manager took action. People were kind, but it felt like they were bothered by customers or questions."
bad,"Retail is stressful, especially with the hours, minimal wages, no benefits, and the pressure to sign people up for email and credit accounts.  The schedule is inconsistent and it doesn't attract high quality managers."
bad,"Was an okay experience for a seasonal part-time position for a high school student. Don't really have any complaints, but also don't have any praises either."
bad,"As a seasonal employee, not much time or effort was put into me...and I got the distinct impression that I was entirely disposable.  I had this notion that perhaps they would treat me as a guest...after all, I´m helping them out, right?  That was not what happened at all.  In truth, I felt exploited....working exorbitant hours a day (over 8(and they didn`t even ask) and then the next week I was only scheduled 4.  There were practically no benefits, merely an underwhelming 15% off products in their store and practically no training.  There was little to no direction...I kept myself busy by tidying up departments because it was so utterly slow, even during the holiday season.  The employees would complain about the minuscule work to be done and how ""busy"" it was.  Their Black Friday was just like a typical Saturday in the retail store in which I used to work, so their complaints seemed absurd to me.  Half of the management were kind and friendly, the other half were hostile, impatient and quick to rage.  I particularly didn`t like the constant whining and pushing to trick customers into singing up for a Kohl`s charge card...one in which you can only use at Kohl`s.  They force you to wear a radio in which they are constantly barking at you to persuade people into singing up for their credit card.  It struck me as particularly predatory and went against my particular set of morals.  "
bad,If you enjoy working with the public this is the place to be at. You also get to enjoy employee discounts throughout the year. You get to meet new people and learn the business too.
bad,"Seriously consider whether or not getting a second job in retail is worth it. I wasn't trained on everything I needed to know when working at Kohl's right away and my performance suffered as a result. I was rushed through training and not given the support I needed in order to succeed. Great store, horrible, overworked management. Sales associates aren't paid enough for all of the work they do, raise the minimum wage given to people."
bad,"Not Enough POC/Cashier, even though they hired over 100 people and we still have one cashier on both sides and department members have to come up and help"
bad,"when i first started working there it was great everyone was nice and helpful and understanding. a week into the job all the managers demeanor changed. for example they became more impatient and irritable. everyday i went to work one of the managers would send me to another department to do work that i wasn't trained for and when i tell them i don't know how to do it, they would  get mad because they have to train me and when they do train me they will teach me once and expect me to get it right away. one of the managers made me go to my lunch  because she didn't want to miss her lunch so she made me do what she was doing and after her lunch she came back and sent me to lunch and i was completely confused because 1 i didn't know what time i should be back to work and 2 i didn't know what floor i was suppose to be on."
bad,I didn't mind at all working at this company as a start but the lack of management just made the work steady stressful and lost of people left because of the managers. Also they were threating a lot of us shorting our hours due to lack of getting credits so it was a stressful environment and managers always tried to keep you shorthanded hours if you didn't meet the quota.
bad,"Working at kohl's was stressful at times but what job isn't, as for as teamwork and coming together for a common goal it was fair. What I hated the most was the time workers were released, sometimes it would be 3am in the morning."
bad,"I am  a people person, so I  always  do  my best to  make sure  that  my customers  have great  experience. Working  at Kohl's gives  me chance to  help."
bad,"I didn't really enjoy it there. The managers at the time were cool. As an employee it sucked, as a customer it was okay. They said they were flexible but they were never willing to really work with you."
bad,"Too much focus on pushing the credit cards, made me and the customers feel extremely pressured. Lost a lot of regulars that way. "
bad,"only concerned with customers' needs, aggressive behavior from management, management bullied employees into using their own personal time and resources for the betterment of the company"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"the environment of the job is good but the management is bad,They are not equal when it comes to being fair to all employees,I have watched complete racism,"
bad,The management is changing so I am not sure how long it will remain like this.  The store is structured in a disorganized way.  There is no opportunity for advancement here unless you give them all of your time.
bad,"Typical retail store with management that is stuck up and uncaring, Gives little to no hours. Unorganized. Very little opportunities and training. Tedious work."
bad,I worked for Kohl's corporate office for about 2 years and I am not pleased with the lack appreciation and the lack of honesty I have encounter throughout the years of working for the company. I am also sadden by the lack of diversity and culture acceptance at Kohl's Corporate Office.
bad,KOHL's is a horrible place to work for -- the employees are clearly overworked and scolded for even calling out ONE day. Management puts customers way before employees and does not let the employees stand up for themselves. In the incident I had with a racist customer -- I was scolded for refusing the customer service. The heat was always on and making it miserable for the employees who worked all over the store.
bad,"Ok... Where to start... I worked at a Kohl's as the Customer service representative. I was the one who took care of any customer's that needed to make returns, or had any complaints. Numerous times I was confronted by customers that were confused as to why they had a Kohl's credit card opened when they never wanted one opened. I began to see a pattern emerging and when I told the managers about my suspicions, I was told that nothing was going to be done about it because this particular employee had the highest credit card openings in, not only the store but the region as well and he brought accolades for the store and the store manager. I was let go not long after this."
bad,"Was put on corrective action for calling in sick once, ridiculed for it, no hours, poor management, overall felt like a hassle being there as opposed to being of help"
bad,"Little to no stress workplace, diverse in culture, great discounts. Monthly company meetings with give away's and prizes. Monthly performance bonus. Free dry cleaning pick"
bad,"Kohls has such a high turnover rate. The managers are very condescending and will fire any employee for the littlest reasons. I have witnessed multiple employees get arrested because of things other people have done. They have no sense of moral and even the managers have come and gone. In my time there we went through 3 different store managers, and multiple assistant managers. They are not flexible with hours, if you call in because of an emergency, you are put on suspension, if you ask for time off, they will deny it. All around terrible"
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's is filled with uneducated management, ghetto co-workers. Literally the job that you're working in your worst nightmare. If you have any moral ethics don't work here."
bad,Busy and fast-paced workplace especially during the holiday seasons. Not much room for advancement and the pay is minimum wage. Overall co-workers were pleasant.
bad,"If I wanted to give my opinion on any of these companies I would have gone to glassdoor. I do not appreciate being forced to give a review for companies I used to work for, just so I can apply to another job that is copmpletely unrelated. Stop forcing people to do reviews for you. Put in an optional button, but stop being jerks."
bad,I desired to become a full-time employee with full benefits but I was only allowed to work as a part-time employee with no benefits. But I did enjoy meeting new people & the work was quite routine.
bad,No hours. No benefits. I worked there for 3  years and my hours were cut from every day to once or twice a week. The pay is so bad.. The job is better for kids that is in high school..
bad,"Bad place to work for, you barley get any hours. You work a few days a week and then you have a huge lay off and 1-2 weeks go buy until you work again. Management is okay, friendly people but don't communicate to well."
bad,When they place you in a department and you complete it they want you to do someone else's work because they weren't doing it. The crazy schedules we worked was terrible. They only send one person in to the biggest departments and to expect them to get it all done in 3/4 hours.
bad,"Hired to work as a customer service representative and cashier.  Kohl's motto is the ""Customer is always right.""  Processed returns with no questions asked and provided replacements as needed, processed credit card payments on Kohl's credit card accounts, used the computerized system to look up merchandise at other Kohl's stores if not available at the Lincoln location, answered multi-line phone and directed calls.  "
bad,Overall enjoyed working there for seasonal. Everyone worked as a team. They really tried to meet everyday goals. Liked closing.
bad,I worked for Kohl's for one year and three months. I did not feel appreciated by this company. I worked an overnight position that required me to change sale displays. The store that I worked at was completely new at the time and I worked from 8pm-4am to assist the manager in prepping the store for grand opening.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,When I first started at Kohl's warehouse it was a great place to work for and I loved it. since it was the Christmas holiday the hours were great and the factory was full of various task we could learn. If your not used to being on your feet for long periods of time your feet will hurt. the breaks were good except they cut you two minutes short. I liked packing out the items that were about to be sent to customers that made my night go by so much faster. Overall I think the company was great to work for despite the little things that I named
bad,i have been at kohls almost 6 years and the people i work with are great. the company is the worse part of everything. the way they treat their employees is not good. i will be glad when i find another job where the company treats me with the respect that i deserve.
bad,"You are granted to take on many roles, but, you do not get many benefits."
bad,"Although I enjoyed most of my co-workers, I couldn't wait to get out of Kohls. The company does not value the employee as an individual. Tardiness and absence is tracked and termination will ensue if you exceed the allowed occurrences, however you are required to stay late and work mandatory overtime and no consideration is taken for that. Moral is low and turnover is high. In my position alone I saw 4 people leave during my time. In addition I've also witnessed the termination and resignation of several building leaders. Unless you are a work-a-holic without a family I would never recommend working for this company."
bad,"I worked at the call center in MENOMONEE FALLS, WI and the only word that I can think of to sum it up is HELL!  The AM's are snooty and all gossip among themselves, the team leads and floor walkers have no absolute idea what their doing.  This is the worst job I have ever had and boy am I glad I quit!!  Steer clear of this place.  If you dont want to be sick and disgusted at the worlds brattiest customers keep looking elsewhere.  Oh yeah and be careful what you say to the  customer EVEN after they call you every name in the book!"
bad,Typically ran all over the place trying to help customers.  Coworkers were not that useful.  Would not help me with the customers.  Management doesn't seem to care about employees.  Got injured at work and manager did not seem to care.  Had to force another manager to write up an incident report and had to have a family member of mine to get the manager to tell me where I had to go to get checked out.
bad,I hate retail. unless you hate retail too dont take my advice. managment doesnt value employees
bad,"the job itself was okay at first, but as time goes by it started to become a more-of-the-same kind of thing. Eventually the job became very boring, no chance for advancement, the pay raises were an insult, and management was becoming more and more demanding"
bad,I loved working with customers but I didnt enjoy the never ending cleaning and not being able to see my progress and hard work.
bad,"That had to be the worst retail job. Start you off at minimum wage, barely any benefits. The manager ignore you, especially if you're in dire need of help. The Store Manager barely knows how to the simplistic tasks. I was glad they fired me. I said Thank You Jesus."
bad,I did not enjoy the work environment nor the management. Not payed enough for their expectations of you.
bad,"I did alot for the Kohls corporation and I was not treated with respect. They never appreciated all the things I did for them. The management was kinda all over the place and policies were not made clear. Every manager had their own form of company guidelines. The managers never communicated with one another therefore, the associates were always confused. I learned how to work with others as a team in order to make our store strive to the top. I also learned how to work in every department in a retail store.The thing I loved most was my customers. I loved meeting all the people that considered Kohls a friendly consumer. I met people from all over the world this way. I loved my customers and my co workers. Some of my co workers became more like family than people I just worked with."
bad,"the pay is minimum, you cant be one minute late or its an occurrence, you get a lunch for working seven hours but your only going to be scheduled six hours and forty five minutes, and much more to complain about."
bad,"Although working the retail side of Kohl's allows you the flexibility you need at times; this is not the place to work if you are looking for advancement, camaraderie, or decent pay. This is not a job that should receive only minimum wage."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was doing Payroll, any Human Resources issues that came up along with updating paperwork. Communicating with management with e-mails that came in for updates to be sent to management."
bad,"Re stock products,Clean,dust, Management was not helpful with problems that arose each day, had two part-time helpers,Their shift would begin as mine would end,That was the hardest part trying to get different help dedicated to the tasks at hand,The most enjoyable part was receiving new products,"
bad,Not a good place to work for older people. This job is more suited for teenagers.
bad,"Schedule is based on the Managers & Admins Click, In the click you get hours not in it lucky to be on the schedule for min 4 hours a week."
bad,"Love working with my co-workers, and helping customers. But this place had horrible management. They didn't take there job serious enough."
bad,"It was alright working there, but someone scheduled me for a lot of night shifts on the weekends for multiple weeks in a row. I am not sure why, as I gave day time availability too."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I worked here during my last 3 months of high school. It was the worst we worked so many hours but we were only given 15 min breaks every 2 hours so i was always tired and hungry. non of the managers even knew my name because of how many people are ""in charge"" i one shift."
bad,"I was seasonal, but not one management came to tell us I understood the holidays are over but driving for 5 hrs @ 9 an hr for a week was not worth my time! Other than that I did like it there! I didn’t agree w counter out 7 drawers w No security, no management up front!"
bad,"I simply have nothing good to say except for some of my coworkers were really good people. One of the managers which shall remain nameless is rude, indignant, and highly unprofessional."
bad,Basically you do the workload of four or more associates for low pay and those in charge are unprofessional. The place has gone downhill over the years.
bad,I was hired in July and was promised 15-20 hours a week. I have only got 2 weeks where I have worked that promise 15-20 hours. In the 3 months that I have been there I consistently am get 4-8 hours a week. Definitely not enough to pay for any of my living expenses.
bad,"Hours were not what I expected. Odd hours indeed, was a stock person in the morning, also worked on cash registers when short of help... Bad Managers."
bad,I was part time and they were always calling me while I was in school mandating I come in and help. They threated to fire me while my grandma was dying on Thanksgiving day for me calling in for black friday. So glad I did because my grandma died on black friday. After I let my manager know my grandma had past on friday he asked if I could come in now since she was DEAD. 2 hours later another manager who had came on shift called mandating I come in to help. Never went back. I was raised family first and nothing was worth missing precious time after losing my grandma to make $7.50 an hour.
bad,Management was rude to employees as well as customers.  Cashier doesn’t get breaks from their registers.  They walk up and take over registers without logging employee out and then logging in on their own employee number.
bad,"I had a VERY frustrating experience with Kohl's for several reasons."
bad,if you were stuck with something there were rude about it because another person need help and didn't really care to help they were never happy to help a person
bad,"I enjoyed working there, meeting people & other employees were nice. Wish I could have liked to have stayed but for certain reasons I prefer not to state."
bad,They make you feel like your just a number on the pay role. Employees come and go there. They are always hiring which means employees do not stay very long.
bad,Not enough employees working weekends or holidays or any sale days. Frequently understaffed & they don’t try to call in more employees when someone calls in sick.
bad,"The management team is awful. They don't care about their workers and the store is always left a mess at night for closing. The store is in horrible shape and so disorganized. New employees are left to their own devices even if they need help. Nothing is explained fully, just partial explanations that doesn't answer questions."
bad,The managers at Kohls were incompetent and didn't know how to communicate with each other. Not uncommon to be thrown around at multiple tasks because managers can't communicate with each other on who's doing what.
bad,"I work 12 hours Friday-Sunday and it is murder on your feet. Mgmt keeps you on you feet for 11 of those 12 hours because you are forbidden from sitting down when there's downtime. They hire people from the prison up the road and one of them is usually high on heroine and tried to steal my coworker's identity. "
bad,"the management at the Kohls in Roseville CA are ridiculous they only care about themselves and not their employees. there is almost no room for promotion. and the hours given for part time are almost nothing. I worked on average 10-12 hours per week and that was after I begged them to give me more than 8 hours a week. "
bad,"I do miss some of my coworkers. Management is poor and passive-aggressive. I was haired before seasonal and was a hard worker. after the season was over, I was let go without being told anything by the store manager or the assistant manager. They just stopped scheduling me.  The store manager or the assistant manager are super passive-aggressive."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I was okay with working at Kohls when I was in high school. It sucked because I had to work two 8 hour shifts on black Friday, one starting on Thanksgiving night when I was going to college full time. This is not a good job if you can't be on your feet for more then an hour. I was asked to sign up for a credit card by bribing me with a bottle of perfume(I was still 17 at the time), not knowing that my credit needed to be checked and that it would be on my credit forever. Kohls should not be asking teens and students to sign up for a credit card and not telling them what it all involves and the pros and cons to it.I will never work retail again."
bad,In the 4 years i worked at kohls not once did they take my applications for advancement seriously. I would talk to managers all the time about wanting to be moved around the store but when the time comes they just hiring someone else and leave you were you are at. Very hard to move around so choose wisely where you start!
bad,"Unfortunately other retailers are excelling in recognizing how a living wage improves overall worker satisfaction, while Kohl's does not. I spent over a decade with this company and it feels more and more like they refuse to strive to be better on the store level. Approaching conflicts and unethical behavior is difficult and when you do, it doesn't get resolved. This company does not attract young people anymore, because store management is so opposed to working along with college students' schedules and expects them to have completely open availability, creating a dead end for growth and severely understaffed stores.  When I started at Kohl's I worked with a management team that was excited to have a young hard working college student on staff, I don't see that excitement about new, young, fresh faces anymore. I've seen blatant discrimination on the store level and I feel that it's something district managers and corporate need to reign in with workshops and sensitivity training, corporate has taken a drastic step back on the way they do store level ethics training."
bad,"Overall, the amount of work for this job was not worth the compensation. Work was physically exhausting, with little training or guidance. The credit goals were ridiculous (everybody has a kohl's charge at this point), and the amount of work to number of employees was unsustainable. I was constantly in pain, overworked, and underpaid."
bad,I worked seasonal when you get to February you will get one day a week and they will pick on you inhumanly until they fire you or you will quit. they provide amazing breakfast everyday for the morning shift.
bad,"I was a seasonal employee, so I can only review the 2 1/2 months I was there. "
bad,"Kohl's was an alright place to work. "
bad,management didn’t trust or cate about sickness. a lot of drama between coworkers. as a cashier they made me do more than my job intitled. also got blamed if something went wrong.
bad,"I loved this job, but it took me a while to learn how to get to an on-line order where the individual was coming in soon to pick up their items.  I think that may be why I was not tired at another store.  I finally got the concept of the blue-bird and got the hang of how to by pass orders that were to be shipped out in order to get to the order where the person was coming in.  All I can say is I really loved what I did and I always took on more hours from a co-worker that couldn't make it in. I never missed a day.  I looked for more hours and never missed a day so I think that shows how much I enjoyed my job."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here and will not return. I was hired temporarily for the holidays and was told I would be staying permanently. However, one of the other associates who did not like me told the general manager that I did not want to stay employed there, so, without consulting me first, I was fired once the holiday season was over."
bad,"Hours were minimal. Starting pay was minimum wage ($7.25). The store I worked in is a training store for new managers. In the five years I was there I only had one good manager, but she was not new. It was a temporary move for her. The last manager was quite a bit younger than a lot of us and gave us the impression she wanted to get rid of us and hire younger people."
bad,It took me over a month to get hired . Never got an orientation and only trained me for ONE DAY until i had to handle Cashier position. Management doesn't know what they are doing half the time. They hired so many people that i only get 6-8 hours a week. Very competitive with sales but its hard to get them with so many people not properly trained. Planning to leave because even working at KFC wasn't half as stressful.
bad,"Very fast-paced, but not worth the trouble. Unenjoyable due to management and not the most diverse environment.  Glad that it was only a temporary job."
bad,"kohls is not your average workplace, employees are decent to work with and management could be better but overall if you are looking for something seasonal kohls is a decent choice"
bad,"My time at Kohl's was less than satisfying.  I was disappointed to see behind the scenes at one of my favorite places to shop.  As a result, I don't shop there as much as I once did."
bad,"Didnt like the managers didnt really know what they were doing. Always confused , stressful in almost every department . The discounts were good . Expecially the friends & family ."
bad,"This is a call center. I felt like for what we were getting paid, it was honestly not worth it. They started making so many constant changes to the software and did not properly prepare us for those changes."
bad,"most enjoyable part of work is having return customers, seeing all the new fashions.  Workplace has diverse culture.  Each workday has many different tasks which include but are not limited to the following:"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day I would work would be unloading the truck. Unpacking the merchandise and putting it out onto the floor. If there is no room for new merchandise, then see if things can be reorganize to fit new merchandise or back stock the items."
bad,"Employees are not treated fairly or consistantly. Certain employees get special treatment, while others get none. The pay is not fair for the amount of work performed. Cashiers do half the work of sales associates yet make the same pay."
bad,i was never really trained on anything ust told to go do something and when i stood around for 30 minutes trying to figure it i got spoke to and if i asked how to do it id get lectured at angrilly and then reported for being a bad worker.
bad,I left after one short month due to management not providing the necessary tools to complete my job. They don't care about their associates at all and would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,There is no room for growth with this company and pay us below average for the retail sector.  Typical promotional track is 8-10 years from an entry level position
bad,The managers will work you hard without any acknowledgement no matter how hard you work and try to do the best you can. The customers are just as bad as they will also walk all over you because they know they can and managers won't do anything about it.
bad,"The job was very hard. I did freight and we'd have to be up by 5 am. With only 5 hours a week, it almost didn't seem worth it. Throwing freight is exhausting work, especially with the one break to get water. Most of the time we wouldn't get our break until the last hour of the shift."
bad,"Kohls was not the best company that I have ever worked for, but it was not the worst either. Managers play favorites with the hours and give them to their relatives first. The HR manager made a point of only giving me hours that did not work with my school schedule so every single week I had to go around asking coworkers to trade with me. They also had a habit of changing rules on employees and only telling you that the rules had changed when they were threatening to fire you for breaking a new a rule that they never told you existed."
bad,"Its fine, onot typical day of work, maangemetn is alreaight ,enjoyable part is kohls discounts and mvp membership, get to visit kohls store tour and studio."
bad,"not a very professional company to work for management is not concerned about the employees and very rude to their  staff, The most enjoyable is the end of the day"
bad,I worked at kohls for a few months as a seasonal cashier. I did not like it because the salary was very minimal and I would barely get 10-15 hours per week.
bad,It was a ok part time job if you like retail. Can very be fast paced and stressful.  You get a lot of independence but around the holidays it gets crazy.
bad,With new management comes many new changes to policy and culture. Hiring inept and extremely unqualified individuals to manage a group of people in order to save money is the most ineffective way to run a business. Many good employees up and quit within a few weeks! Many of these people were tenured and the treatment keeps getting worse!
bad,The walkie talkies were the devil. They would talk on them all day and it was really distracting to deal with customers and listen to the walkie. The hours were scarce.
bad,"Working at the merced Kohl's was horrible just really bad management , there are no benefits, and the only way you can move up is by kissing a**. i hated working there."
bad,"The company overworks manager because they are on salary. There is little to no work life balance. "
bad,I worked part time for 5 years and never earned more than 8.50/hr. It is low paying but easy job. Folding clothes and cashing customers out.  Management becomes extremely stressed out and will take it out on their employees.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,My managers were not nice and would come to me during my breaks and criticize me. Some of my fellow co-workers were great. I just did not enjoy the working environment. They make you stay past your scheduled time for 'team meetings' where they search your purse before you're allowed to leave.
bad,"Not an ideal place to work unless you're in school or older and just need a job to pass time. They're very good with getting certain days off, but you only work 3-5 hours a day, and never get off on time. They would schedule you 845am-1245pm and you would be lucky to leave at 130 sometimes. Poor management and were never on the same page. Talked to you like you're beneath them. They loved you if you got credit apps which determained your hours. If you got low numbers, don't count on having more than 1-2 days next week. Expected you to run register, fold, sort, hard tag, stock and clean while being busy. Have no respect for employees. Yell at you if you need to use the restroom or need change in your drawer. Expect more than what you can do when regional manager comes in. Horrible work place."
bad,This job is okay if your in high school with no kids and no other activities going on. But for someone that's in school with kids and looking for a part time no
bad,communication with associates and management is terrible. There is virtually no opportunity for advancement. There isn't proper training. Only good for a job to get through school.
bad,One of the worst places I've ever worked for. Asked me to quit my main job and work for them and when I decided not to they cut my hours so bad that it wasn't even filling up my gas tank. Management was so so but everyone had attitudes.
bad,A typical day at kohl's is very understaffed and having 3 to 4 managers telling one person to do 5 to 6 different things at one time. There is no communication and if there is it is not passed down to the right people that need to know whats going on.
bad,Kohls is a large corporation who could absolutely afford to give their employees a proper wage to live on.  Part time work at8-9 an hour is basically nothing.  The hours were horrible and there were few opportunities to move up within the company/get raises
bad,"The environment was fine just no benefits for the part-time and the work wasn't steady as far as hours or days. I was a Material Handler in which we did everything, so great learning experience. The culture was also fine, the only issue for me was communication with work schedules and steady work at the time."
bad,"was just awful. terrible environment, rude managers, and awful pay and benefits. raises are literally like 20 cent raises, even if you're one of their best employees. And then sometimes you don't even get raises. Don't work here."
bad,"Khol's was a pretty nice store to work at, not overwhelming or understaffed. The constant push to get a Khol's card became annoying and old very quickly; it builds loyalty but pushing for a credit card feels wrong. I was hired to work in a department, but would get pulled to work the register, leaving a department without anyone in it to answer questions or assist customers.We started staying til about midnight to clean up the trashed store."
bad,My typical day at work usually consisted of a lot of customers that were very hard to work with. The management there weren't very great at keeping up morale with their employees. They tended to use negative reinforcement and it made it really hard for me to like my job.
bad,"Kohl's manages to attract the most self-centered customers. I was a cashier, so in their eyes my life was valued less than theirs, and they let me know it. "
bad,"The pay was not good at all and it was a very slow store, on top of that I only got four hours a week.  The people I worked with were nice, but they really did not care to train me much."
bad,it gets hella boring over time and they don't give enough hours or good pay for all the work that needs to be done. always put the same people to close and just use people in general. They keep hiring more and more people and take hours away from current employees.
bad,It was a good place to work but I couldn't deal with the foreign manager picking on me. I got paid every week i liked that & everyone I worked with but my hours got cut and I wasnt getting along with the manager and I had been there for over a year already and things weren't getting better.
bad,"no chances for advancement, always feeling as though it is an uneven playing field. management always after you because you don't fit in. other associates getting away with not doing their jobs..."
bad,as a floor associate you are given many responsibilities with little to no pay compensation. its difficult to get days off that you request off even months in advance.
bad,"This was my first job. The company itself was awful to work for. It didn't matter how hard I worked, I was never given a raise."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Liked it only because of the people. Pay was not competitive and management was lacking. On top of keeping everyone below 24 hours a week many employees who had been working there weren't on the schedule for some weeks, leading them to ask management if they still had jobs."
bad,This was my first job and I feel that it was good learning experience.  I worked in the shoe department and I really enjoyed knowing exactly where and what I needed to do.  The biggest problem I personally had while working there was the management didn't care about anything other than how to make a quick buck.
bad,"Kohl's was a very basic retail job. I came in, worked the register, cleaned the floor, and got people to sign up for Kohl's charge and Kohl's rewards accounts. The worth that management held for it's employees was very low. There were a lot of in and out of new hires because of the lack of respect within the establishment. It was not my favorite job. But working there furthered my knowledge in the pushing of a product and the value of having a tidy work environment."
bad,"The manager at the time was breaking rules and allowing customers to borrow too much money. There was no advancement opportunity at all here, and I did not enjoy this job."
bad,"This was temp work and they treated the temp employees horrible."
bad,the pay is 8.40 not much. the would give so much hours but little pay. the store manager had a nasty attitude most of the time. if you come late a lot of times they won't say anything to you until its close to them firing you. some co-workers would constantly gossip and talk about everyone.a day at work you will encounter a lot of older woman and the would be rude.
bad,"My co-workers make me enjoy walking into Kohl's as they greet me and I made a few best friends there. I have all good managers and I think that's really important to get along with all my managers and co-workers to make Kohl's fun working for. The position is very easy, hardest part of the job is when I'm scheduled for four hours per night and my managers must think that I'm fast at working because when I clock in they would place me in a big department to clean and tell me that after I'm done to go into one of the smaller departments to clean. I try to please them and I do it. When I need help with anything even if it don't concern work my managers and co-workers are there for me. I've learned ad-set, doing freight and being a sales associate within my work years."
bad,"Lack of respect for workers rights and go to great lengths to get over on workers, pay is bad, won't get very far with this company"
bad,Not steady work unless you have been there a long time.  Training for departments was terrible.  They just through you out there.  HR was very rude.
bad,Kohĺs in general was a nice place but at my age it just wasnt for me. I did get along with the people there but it just wasnt enough pay or hours forme
bad,"filing, sorting, scanning, labeling and preparing letters to be mailed Ware House Floor – Tag and Scan boxes for online orders."
bad,Kohl's is a decent company and I've learned many new things since my first day working there. The management team is ok. They have good qualities when it comes to actually managing a team but need to be more professional and considerate in the way that they speak to workers.
bad,Supervise persons whom don't work and management fails to act.  Many errors occur in the Jewelry Department that aren't properly dealt with.
bad,A typical day at work was being rushed to do things around the store. I learned that for what they were asking me to do was not worth what i was getting paid so i put in my two weeks and worked up until my last day. The management was horrible and only cared for them selves. The hardest part was going in when i was called a hour before to come in on my day off.
bad,Very long hours between breaks. Treated with little respect. At no time was I trained to be on register. They throw you to the wolves and have issues with taking too much time between customers. Stressful and put way too much pressure on opening Kohls store credit cards. I wasn't treated with respect and management dwelled on negative instead of creating a positive work environment.
bad,"For being my first job, it could have been worse. I dont have to clean the bathrooms or anything like that. Dealing with the public is what makes it stressful. Management demanding high stress goals, understaffed and I could go on. There are good days and bad."
bad,"When I first started working at Kohls, I felt the favoritism the general manager had towards other employees. I can understand that she was trying to understand how each employee works, but the favoritism got worse. She would back up some other employees when they were having an issue, and give the cold shoulder to others she didn't like as much. I was one of the employees she didn't like as much. I was constantly reprimanded for actions I had to take without her assistance. They would schedule you on days requested off and not let you know, also they would cancel without communication. Here's an example, I walked in the door ready to work, and the general manager told me to go home. I was a good worker even though the job was a nightmare. The company itself is flawed as well. There is no written coupon policy, so employees get walked over and cussed out frequently over coupons. The hardest part of the job was keeping calm when my personality was bashed by both customers and staff without any consequences. My self esteem went down significantly due to this position. The most enjoyable part of this job was when I got to clock off. Also their raise, since I got one, was six cents. From $9.05 to $9.11."
bad,"Management made it seem like Khols would be a great place to work, but I quickly learned that was false. My front window was smashed and therefore didn't have a way there so I had to call off, which they felt compelled to belittle me for. I spent my days clearing out dressing rooms and restocking clothes. I had applied to be a cashier but that was not the position I was offered. I ended up needing to change my availability due to obtaining full time employment in my career field which again management belittled me for and decided to be vendictive and put me on for 16 hours a month!! I immediately quit after that."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Kohl's. It may have just and only been the store itself, but I was constantly stressed being a seasonal hire. I was looked down upon by co-workers and management. There was little communication between management and co-workers as well. Sadly, I was very happy to leave."
bad,"Working in customer service at a retail store during the holidays was not fun at all. I happened to get busy all the time, so I never got the breaks that I, as an employee, deserved. My schedule was hard to manage with school, and our managers never cared about that. They always put work first and talked in an ugly tone. I witnessed one of the managers yell to a new employee twice in front of customers. I would never work there again. Glad the holidays are over."
bad,"Working at Kohl's as a temp was productive, thanks to the 10 hour work shifts, but very unpredictable because there wouldn't be work available for the temps sometimes, so you never know if you were going to work or not when you arrived each day.  Hardest part of the job was being there for the 6 am start and meeting daily number goals."
bad,"Like any normal retail job. Managers suck. The discount and pay check is the best thing. Fold clothes, check out customers, etc..."
bad,"when arriving to kohls I took what retail skills I had acquired and used them to my advantage. I didn't like the pay the hours were hectic, it was bad when employees didnt show up.I lived the challenge it had, but didn't like the hours getting depleted."
bad,I learned quickly how to prioritize my week based upon an intense amount of projects and promotional events
bad,"Great co-workers all disgusted with the work environment and management.  Tired of understaffing, underpaid."
bad,Non stop fast paced work. The hardest part of the job was having to do multiple positions all in one instance.
bad,"Tyipical day at work was opening the registers, and our systems at the customer service desk, and issuing out equipment to the other co-workers. That being a manager takes alot of time and a fast pacing job. Other management worked very well together and helped all the other co-workers. Co-workers and i got along well becoming good friends. hardest part of the day was at the end getting all the merchandise that was at the customer service desk and at all the registers back onto the floor where they belong. Most enjoyable part of the day was opening."
bad,Working at Kohl's is ok if you're in high school or just looking to fill time. I figured it would be a nice place to work since I really enjoy shopping there. The managers don't really place you in just one area. Within the first few weeks they had me training in every department and having me help them out. The major complaint though is that they will schedule to work for 5 days but only give you 4 or 5 hours each day. The reasoning behind this is to keep from having to give you lunch breaks and health benefits.
bad,"They do not give you any payroll to run the building to the level they expect. "
bad,"at 8.25 an hour, where's the benefit in what they spew as a benefit (stacking employee discount w/store sales) if you do not make any money via scheduled hours?"
bad,"One on the worst places I've worked for, poor management, no direction, everyone is always confused...bad communication.  Unloading trucks, merchandising and replenishing sales floor. Easy stuff but it's just really bad management. Black Friday they were running around with heads cut off....I was amazed at how lost they were....how many Black Fridays have they done? Seems like it was their first..."
bad,"Don't expect free thinking or risk taking, the old way is still very much the new way.  Puppets on a string is the best way to describe it from Directors on down."
bad,This is the best to work for the start of your career and or while you are in school.
bad,The current manager over my department lacksany kind of involment with you or your day to day activities.  No credit is given when deserved and the pay raises are peanut change. Overall this is a slave ship that needs to be redirected.
bad,"Some departments are more flexible and have standard hours.  The Finance department is not run well, and current leadership does not understand the need for financial systems which are needed to streamline the business.  All major reporting is done with heavy excel modeling, and should be done through an ERP system similar to all other Fortune 500 companies.  Long hours and had to be very flexible under current finance management, which impacts work/life balance.  Current finance department is very political, unlike anything I've ever seen in prior companies."
bad,Typical work day was slow going and generally chaotic. The management was never really around to force supervisors to do their jobs so it basically was up to individual employees to get their own work done which either happened or didn't happen based on work ethic(which there really wasn't any).
bad,"Arrived in the early morning entered building with other coworkers, clocked in, got daily assignment as to where I would be working."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,A typical day at Kohl's was basically with me being on a register and interacting with customers. I already had excellent customer service skills and I learned that whatever you do in life is to do it to the best of your abilities. The management at Kohl's seemed to be interested in credit applications and sales. They never displayed how effective my service was to them. I enjoyed working with the associates. There was no hard part to my job. I enjoyed being there to empower the customer and with hopes that their shopping experience with us was the very best.
bad,Everyday was very busy. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them find items.I really enjoyed helping the elderly customers who had no idea where to find things and what size they were wearing. Co-workers were young and always required many breaks.They didn't always follow the store policys. Customers complained about the same employee's and management did nothing. The hardest part of the job was when people called out constantly and people were not called in to replace them which made employees job twice as hard and frustrating.
bad,"Answer client calls, make some outbound calls, assist clients on picking the best package to fit there needs"
bad,"Management tasks behind your back about you to other employees, tests you like a number not a person."
bad,At Kohls I assist customers with returns and checking out. I also assist with making payments and processing the returned items. I've learned how to work on my own and empower myself because the managers are not always around to assist with issues.
bad,"Pretty much a good job but not the best job for people with small children, the hours are very sparadic."
bad,"A typical day at Kohls was busy busy busy barely had a minute to your self to think. My duties for working there were, customer service, helping customers find what they came in for, cashing the customer out in a timely manner."
bad,"A typical day at work is fast paced. I have learned that if you do your job well, you will get appreciated by upper management. Management treats everybody fairly and respects each associate equally. Co-Workers are a great team to work with, everybody has each others backs through thick and thin. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with."
bad,"I enjoyed being able to work in multiple departments and learn many different things in this type of retail environment. That being said... After the realization of no further room for growth within the company surfaced, after being falsely promised a promotion to supervisor by one of the managers, along with a 25 cent raise after a year of hard work, I knew it was time to move on."
bad,I enjoyed working hard and maintaining the employee of the month award.
bad,While this does not represent the entire company as a whole it does represent how I see kohl's being operated in the northeastern part of the United States. The company has HR which use to be managers for the stores so they bow down to the will of the District Managers and rubber stamp whatever they want to do. When it comes to business ethics it simply does not exist currently in this environment. While I do enjoy some of the people who work for the company they are few and far between. The company promotes people not based upon ability or honest but more along the lines of who you are willing to kiss up to to get ahead. If you are someone who like to manipulate people and sell people out then this is the company for you. Again this doesn't represent the entire company just the practices on the east coast.
bad,"Good seasonal job, very easy but ALOT of work. Low pay with very little opportunity for advancement. Not really willing to work with your schedule as they claim they would during the interview process."
bad,Did not enjoy my time working as a cashier here. Did not feel welcomed or encouraged by any of the managers. There were excessive amount of times where managers would constantly remind cashiers to get customers to open a store credit (even when most of the time they didn't want to or already had).
bad,They don't offer no more than 10 hours a week after Christmas. They won't work with your availability. They try to schedule you to close on the days you are scheduled even when that's not your availability.
bad,Good people but poor management and poor compensation.  There was literally no training other than a few computer modules and then they throw you right onto the registers without having a clue what you're doing.
bad,"It’s not bad to work at kohl’s while in school. Afterwards it’s awful. There are next to no advancement opportunities, pay is not enough for the amount of stress ,and managers are hard to find when needed"
bad,Retail is retail.  It was a job that paid my portion of the bills but overall it was a downgrading experience.  Friendly work environment but management cut hours on almost everyone instantly. The company states they care about their employees which isn't true because they fired almost all staff without a 2 weeks notice nor did the store manager give a heads up. Such a cut throat company
bad,"There is lack of training, managers don't care about anything other than making credit, no sense of pride in the store, managers are always rude to employees"
bad,"This store company all managers are so bad and have no experience in management especially store managers. They don't know how to operate there employees especially new employees. They didn't train them and said that customers complaint about you so you are not good for our company. How do they know that customers complaint about us customers didn't talk with the store manager they talked with managers and managers talked with store managers? How do you know that managers are telling true to store managers that customers complain about you, they are not telling true because if those fraud managers like you then they won't report anything but if they not like you than they report it. Many fraud managers have friends in the store so they never report here information to the store manager if the customer also making complaint about them. So this Kohls have or hire fraud managers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"First job I ever had, really easy job unfortunately the pay wasn't great nor were the people who worked there. Most of them would stab you in the back, honestly couldn't trust any of the workers. The mangers were worse, if they didn't like you they would try anything to get you fired or in trouble. "
bad,When I started there I thought I was going to be working days. That happened for a few weeks until we got a new manager. A lot of things changed when she came aboard. I was training for customer service desk which made me feel uncomfortable working there. I had to count a lot of registers down at night. I trained as a cashier. I actually liked doing that. Then they moved me to jewelry. WorkingTtwo older ladies mainly work the day shifts so I was always stuck closing. It’s hard when you have children at home to work late all the time.
bad,"The experience at Kohls is only lacking purely because of the management. Some managers are terrific super helpful,  great with customers, fun to work with and make you want to be on their team. However there are others who create more problems bring negative energy and drama with them that ruin everything. They will sass customers make employees cry they won't listen to you at all they will be petty and act like children. And even if one has been written up multiple times and should have been let go like any other employee would have been. They will still keep them due to being ""short staffed"" there is a reason their turn over is so high and it isn't the work itself. It's the blatant disrespect towards employees and their customers."
bad,"Its was an easy interview, but when I got the job it was different very boring, unorganized. The breaks they give you are ridiculous  Not be rude but older (40+ yr olds) working there. Not enough young people. Rude employees. I plan on working here until I find a new job unfortunately.  Good discount for employees though!"
bad,My time there was not great. Some managers didn't care to teach and they didn't train you well enough in any of the difference areas. Only got 8 hours a week.
bad,"I actually really enjoyed this job at first... They only put men in housing and stuck me with childrens. No advancement opportunities, they hired someone from another company to be the new assistant. Pushing credit cards. Worked my butt off only to be fired for something another employee did. Managment was a joke. Required 12 hour shift on Black Friday. Low Pay."
bad,"Once I decided to give my two weeks, management acted very cold towards me and wouldn't even make eye contact with me or acknowledge me as a person when I smiled/greeted them. Although I was already scheduled to work until the end of my two weeks, management immediately removed me from the schedule; causing me to lose out on the money that was supposed to go towards school."
bad,Although the people I met while employed with Kohls were great the pay is low and the benefits are almost non-existant. Also there is little room for internal movement.
bad,Very unorganized with poor management. High pace stressful workplace with extreme favortism. The work is tough and the pay is low for the type of work. You can make more as a Cashier at Walmart
bad,"I did have fun working here. My friends and I joined at the same time (which you get a benefit for doing, but I didn't receive the benefit for unknown reasons) and our first day we were scheduled was Black Friday. Having not been trained in literally anything yet, just had a tour of the store, I was very stressed that day. What didn't help was that they scheduled my job within 7 hours of the last shift ending, so I did not get any sleep."
bad,"not a career you can advance in. poor managment. lack of leadership."
bad,"Primary job duties of Kohl's sales associates consist of working sales floors, answering questions about services and merchandise, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Additional job responsibilities may include stocking shelves and organizing displays."
bad,"They work you hard and you don't get much back.  Always part time never perm, too little hours.  You do get a merchandise discount.  People are fun management sucks."
bad,"Pay is minimal, and they ask way too much for what they give you. Management is rude, and obviously dont care about you. Dont work for them and expect to go home happy, or be able to pay your bills."
bad,"Not very well ran, high stress. Yes, it is retail, but it is an exceptionally toxic environment. It could be o.k. for a first job, but they have a crazy quota for cashiers to open credit accounts. The discounts can be decent, but not for any of the good brands they sell at the store."
bad,"Really fun to work at, flexible. Hours are not the best during seasonal. Not much room to move up. The store needs to have more people working to provide better customer service. Hours are pinched on when sales are low."
bad,"This is a very stressful job, no room for mistakes. management is rude and often not willing to help with issues, even ones that require a manager. you are forced to stay after your scheduled time if another department is not done restocking, even if your department is done."
bad,Working at Kohls was not a happy place with angry and fast paced customers and manager that do not enjoy life and a ton of workload!!  The overall noise in your ear with the headphones and other factors made it a sad place to work!!
bad,"I was hired at $7.25 an hour.  The store manager informed me that they were the lowest paying employer in all of Angola. Fortunately after a few week, corporate decided nationwide to raise everybody to $9.00/hr.  We were constantly reminded about being cordial and helpful to the customers .  That was not a problem but our manager did not treat us in the same manner.  You were lucky to get a grunt from her if you said “good morning” to her.  Lots of disgruntled employees and a great deal of turn around."
bad,This is only a part time job! No benefits. Hardly any hours. I once went 2 weeks strait only working 10 hours. This is only a job to work maybe once a week if you need a little extra cash on the side. Shifts are only 4-6 hours long. There’s no opportunities for advancement.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Wouldn’t really recommend working here. The people that work here are really good people. It’s just that the environment it’s really that good. Good people cool place to work. It just wasn’t the place for me. Since I’m going to be working in the medical field
bad,"I was hired at Kohls to fill a seasonal position for a couple of months. Upon arriving my first day I was taken through an extremely fast and abrupt orientation and then sent home two hours earlier than my scheduled departure time. In the next months working there I received almost no training and had about two crying sessions a day. I also have suspicions that the management disliked me and, consequently, made my life miserable."
bad,Poor management mainly the manager. Questionable unjust preferences of race was observed (discrimination). This as well will determine if you as a retail associates will be obligated to do three job's in one (completely different from your job description).  Lack of Training is of much concern. The employee's that have there antiquity here will leave you the undesired duties.
bad,"They're unable to work around your availability, the management and employees focus on interpersonal problems rather than work. Poor scheduling, only scheduling maybe 4 hours every few weeks and calls you to come in to a call out shift 15 minutes before they need you. Very unorganized."
bad,This company is horrible in regards to pay raises and compensation. They only get customers because they offer many discounts. This pony serves to create and limited payroll for employees.
bad,"I started at Kohl's as a department supervisor and quickly moved up to management. At first the management role was okay, but it quickly became stressful and unfulfilling as the changes in upper management were like a turn-style. There was no accountability for upper management only the lower level management and hourly employees. Staffing was minimal at best, so overtime for low level managers was required. Poor work life balance, and mediocre health benefits make Kohl's a terrible place to work as a full time salaried manager."
bad,"The distribution centers are no place for an introvert. The only way to advance in the company is to suck up to the department supervisors and managers; become their friends and suddenly you have every door you could possibly ask for opened. Advancement is not based on how well you do based on numbers, but how much time spent getting the supervisor to like you. Cliques are everywhere, and any rewards that are given at the company's self-indulgent morning meetings are reserved for who knows the most people."
bad,"You are never given the chance to advance to management. Never been on long term disability , heardits not good. 401K has ruined a lot of people. Mayber their fault"
bad,"Flexible hours, to a point, but never consistent. If one did not meet quota for credit apps that week, hours were cut until the computer system automatically terminated the employee."
bad,"My boss at this location was consistently rude and condescending to me and several other employees, particularly if we didn't understand something she thought we should. Not a very team oriented work environment whatsoever, lacking in warmth and positivity and overall just not a good experience"
bad,Ok to work temporarily. Not a permanent career choice but it pays the bills. Benefits are good. Leadership is not. Collections leadership is less than should be replaced. However ecommerce is thriving with potential.
bad,"There was constantly quotas, even if they did not call them that.  I earned time off but with staffing shortages rarely was I able to take it.  Management only cared about themselves."
bad,"the managers are disorganized and very lack luster.  They are horribly understaffed with expectations beyond belief. They will keep you there till all hours of the night to make sure the store is to their liking. Forget about getting sleep, especially if you are still in school. Holidays are horrible. they stay open till 1 am every night through the xmas holiday and wonder why people are worn out when they are not getting any sleep because they have to work so late and get up early the next day. They tell you anything you want to hear to get you in the door, but management will quickly turn on you if you are not the perfect staff member doing everything they want of you without asking questions or any expectations of having family or personnel time outside work."
bad,"Only worked for the summer and 2 months during the fall semester. I applied to be a part- time worker, having promised that they will work around my school schedule to fit my hours to when I'm available. However, when the semester came around, I was given days to work where I am in class (even after submitting my school schedule over the summer in advance). Tried over and over to talk to my manager about it, but no change happened. started getting 5- 10 hour work weeks. So I decided to leave."
bad,"One week I work one day, the next I work 4 days in a row. The mangers are nice but a lot have quit and now the new ones barely know what to do. One manager even hired her husband as Santa and he sexually harassed the elf. Sometimes training is not given to people and then they are either thrown in unknown territory or the don't get put anywhere that needs more help. Pay is garbage. $9 per hour. You barely get breaks, too. If you work an 8 hour shift you get 2 15 min breaks and lunch (which is 30 min). Also, they keep hiring non-stop. It's been 4 months for me and they have hired at least 10 people only within a month."
bad,"The days were monotonous and strenuous. Initiatives and changes in the building were half-baked. You will regularly fight system and equipment issues, although you will be blamed and asked what you could have done better. Equipment, large and small, is extremely antedated and needs 24/7 life support. Senior management is cold and uninspiring. We did very well as an EFC in the network, but you would have never known that from the feedback we received day-to-day. Everything is looked at in a ""what did we screw up today"" lens. "
bad,Kohls is a decent company to work for with flexible work hours and a great employee discount. They have food in the break  a lot of times and everybody who works there is really nice.
bad,"Employees were taken advantage of. Treated poorly and overwhelmed. The only full-time employees were supervisors and managers. Part-timers (many of them anyway) were very underpaid and therefore  had a ""I don't care attitude"",  called off alot, which made it very hard to succeed."
bad,"Poor management! doesnt pay enough 10.00hr hires everyone seansoal first the one who last are offer a part time job. Cant keep help big turn over, unloading trucks are timed? a lot of swearing telling employees that they not work fast enough Management dont know hope to speak to employees in the right manner none of the kiosk work a lot of empty space in store!"
bad,"Typically, the sales floor was stretched thin. I learned to be in multiple places at once and to move very quickly through tasks. The management did well with their interactions and training, however not having enough of a team on schedule made the job very difficult."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I had a major family issue. I either needed to ignore my families needs to get fired. i chose to leave Kohl's. I quit using them as a reference because they state I cannot be rehired.
bad,mangers were inconsistent and did not train properly leaving new employees that were hired to be trained buy other who also hadn't been trained at all in their department
bad,"Inconsistent shift activity due to management on staff the day worked.  Management had bad training skills, communication and direction of work needed."
bad,There are 4 managers and everyone has a different idea of how to manage. it was fun at the beginning but the last few months I worked there was not...
bad,"I had to clear dressing rooms of any clothing left behind, fix up the aisles of fallen clothes, and run back clothes from customer service. I learned that the people there took me for granted and didn't listen to me. Some of the management staff was okay but the other half did nothing but yell at me and make me feel powerless. One of my supervisors would make fun of me because when I first startedIi was still getting used to where things went and if I was unsure about something I had to ask her and she got mad at me. The hardest part of the job was to remain calm toward customers after being mistreated by the staff. But the most enjoyable part of the job was that I made a friend in the orientation class i went to."
bad,"Working at Kohl's part time is neither a great nor horrible experience. In a similar fashion, it teeters on the two extremes of very slow and boring to hectic and fast depending on the day. Hours are not guaranteed, and the managers are uninspiring. In fact I would even say that the supervisors of the departments are the people who hold the store together. There is an annual wage increase of twenty five cents or less with no opportunity for advancement, bonuses, or other wage increases."
bad,From the day of your orientation Kohls stresses on the importance of ethical behavior. However it is definitely not practiced was in the store. The management is a joke and if you are not part of the click then you will be pushed out.
bad,Well rounded company - family and work life. Its a great company to work for. The company incorporated hard work and play. They are concerned with your family life. Flexible work hours
bad,Kohls was cool to work at part time at first because they were giving m consecutive days and hours but then just stopped and started giving me one day or two a week and then even none some so I just stopped and found a new job right then and there because I have bills to Pay
bad,"A typical day at work What you learned Management Workplace culture Hardest part of the job most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,My first job and first experience worst place for first job the kohls in Middletown and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there the managers are terrible
bad,Did not enjoy any min working there  my experience was also devastating towards my social life gave me horrible hours staff was very u in friendly was all bad
bad,Every person's experiences are different so hopefully a person that is thinking of working here will go in with a positive mind set and things will go accordingly for them.
bad,in shipping at this company it was our responsibility to load multiple trailers with the product that was received. The best part was the work schedule.
bad,Everything about working at Kohl's was a horrible experience and I was there for years. You're expected to keep the store clean with minimal staff while customers continue to trash the store. The managers I worked for were pretty good and did their best but it was the way upper management that prevented them for making it a good place to work.
bad,"We never had enough people working in any departments, so of course they made you have everything on your shoulders and an 8 hour day was never enough time to do the things they expected you to do. No recognition just complaints."
bad,"I only worked for Kohls for a short period of time. Not once was the manager helpful nor did I get any training. I was pushed into the largest department and expected to know the department. "
bad,"Basically I rang up customers and occasionally cleaned and organized the floor. the employees were nice and very helpful. The managers were mean, rude"
bad,Kohl's does not pay nearly enough for the work they expect done. As for the people I work with they are great. The management is not so good they don't treat you very well. General manager at our department is very mean she curses and does not respect her employees. The rest of the managers are great and very easy to get along with.
bad,I worked there for 2 years and it was not a pleasant experience.   No matter how hard you work the Corp supervisors never see it as enough.   In stores that big you would think they would give enough payroll for all dept but that is not how it works.  During the week you could expect to see 1 person that had to run all 7 fitting rooms and all the go backs and maintain the folding and cleaning.  How discouraging as a leader to have to tell one of your employees that.  The managers that are on salary work so many hours to try and make up for the hours they don't get for full time or part time.  In the end working themselves to death.   This is not a company I would recommend to anyone.  I wish Kohls could see how they make several people feel and know that several teams cheat to get results so they don't feel bad about themselves and don't have their bosses coming down on then.  Sorry Kohls I wish it was different.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I was never truly considered an employee, as many of my files were lost in the system, and I had to call instead of receiving my schedule online. Every day was consistent of a manager guessing where they would put me, and I was ""trained"" on a register for months, never given my own to operate until Black Friday. Very low maintenance, though, and reasonable hours."
bad,A typical workday consisted of the usual customer service you'd see in a department store. Cleaning up the dressing rooms folding the clothes and putting them back where they belong.The thing was that no matter how hard or fast we worked the store was always a disaster and management contradicted themselves all the time.
bad,The store always seemed to be short on staff and management expected you fill every position regardless or not you were even trained. Speaking of training... they barely show you how to do anything.
bad,"I have worked with Kohl's for 5 years now and I am looking to move on. There isn't much room for advancement. Once a year raise, but besides that there aren't many advancement opportunities."
bad,"This job was overall one of the worst I had. Managers expected you to do everything on your own with very little guidance on how to accomplish the tasks. In my own department the only saving grace was my boss who was very friendly. However, most of the other people who worked there were snobby. Not a fun work environment and I went on to make $2 more an hour at a different job cashiering."
bad,"Was a fun job, management wasn't the best. To much gossip. Managers were to caught up in there personal lives. They would participate in gossip with other associates."
bad,I have never witnessed a management team be so genuinely obsessed with pushing store credit cards while treating the employees terribly. It was definitely not the culture that had been promoted in the interview and orientation.
bad,"The only way to advance in any of the three stores i ever worked at was if you had favor with the manager. they don't go on skills or previous history at all."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at kohls, there was very poor management and I was not treated with respect from them. The best part about working there was my co-workers"
bad,This job really wasn't what I expected when I first applied. The store was always a wreck and no matter how hard the employees worked it felt like we were going nowhere. I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,"Manager was non supportive, was a great management team the first two years and then it went downhill after that. Lots of turnover.You dont get recognized for any hard work you put in. Since I had stopped working there the management team has completely changed for the better."
bad,"Our activities is prepared for work when the truck opens up in the "
bad,"I enjoyed the job and the employees, but they wouldn't work with me to get me any more hours. I was part time and didn't make enough money there and ran into childcare issues."
bad,"This was my first job, and I was never properly trained, never knew who my manger was, had my hours cut down to 5 a week and when i tried to call and say i couldn't afford to drive there and go to school my calls would be bounced around until it disconnected."
bad,not a happy work environment. claims to be family oriented but are not. strict on attendance even with excuse. constantly on your feet.
bad,"When I started in 2013 at the Call Center in San Antonio, Texas I must have got the tail end of when the company was good. Of course any job you go to is going to seem better than your last, but I can say that the atmosphere is different from other call centers. I worked in collections, started doing early stage in outbound. Collections was not my thing but Kohls was recommended by a friend who worked there and I was really looking for a change in atmosphere. Three months later I went to inbound collections where I was  one of the top performers. I got bonus payouts each month work all the overtime I wanted, it was great. A year later I got bored and went to late stage in outbound since bonus payouts were higher and I figured I'm well tenured enough. But a month in I got a bad feeling that I may not perform well in the future and opted to go back to inbound. Apparently, even though the collections is one department,  the stages in collections are divided into sub departments, so management for some reason do not allow moves in between sub departments unless there is a posting or you are sleeping/dating a manager in your department for conflicts of interests. I begged, pleaded for months to go back to inbound side but was denied. Soon after my performance started to plummet and now the excuse that management gives is that you have to perform well to move, which was too late. The management at this facility does not care about your well being and if someone bonuses a lot they will find ways to make it more difficult to attain in the future. The environment changed, I noticed tenured"
bad,"A typical day at work I would clean my work space and depending on how busy the store was I would put away my ""500s"" and whatever department I was in I would fold the tables, so it will look presentable."
bad,"Management was very inconsistent. Hired friends, and younger people not people who wanted and deserved to work. Too many entitled young brats who don't need to work because mommy and daddy pay for everything still."
bad,"This company was not a great to work at the end of my tenure. The changes that were made were not for the betterment of the workers. I had a full time job when I was hired and I was working thirty-three hours a week, then the management changed and the atmosphere and the morale of the employees changed. The overnights continuous flow was discontinued and everything went downhill from there. I learned a lot about retail that I didn't know. the hardest part of the job was working with people that were lazy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Fast paced. Learned to learn on my own. Management could have been better structured. Hardest part was getting extra hours, best part was the people."
bad,"Typical day at work was opening boxes of clothes, hanging them on the appropriate rack to where they go. After the rack was full I would take it to the department where it needed to go. After that was done I would go out to the department my supervisor told me to and put away the clothes. "
bad,"When I first started working there I loved it! The pay was decent and the supervisor I had was motivating. However, everything changed later. They stared expecting the impossible out of you. During the summer there was no AC, so I sweat like crazy and grew dehydrated quickly throughout my shift. I had to drink water from the water fountains more often so it slowed me down a bit. They started expecting us to put away 40 boxes an hour, which was difficult for me. I am only 5'0ft tall, and they demanded me to grab carts already filled. The carts that were already filled had some boxes that weighed more than me! So therefore, it required more time for me to put them away. So then they started becoming extremely disrespectful and pushed me to do more and more, They basically started to run their employee's like slaves."
bad,only good thing i got from Kohls was jewelry experience to  get a better job... its an okay job for teens but after  19 i wouldn't bother the management is not good and they expect way more than you're paid for co- workers are great
bad,"Once clocked in, I walk the floor and the receiving dock to see what merchandise needs to go out and what is listed on the KPlanner for the day. I pull the closing records from the night before to see what departments will need the most attention for recovery. Assign associates to different tasks and follow up with them every couple of hours and pull merchandise to fill incoming online orders. Move merchandise around according to the weekly floor plans. Before leaving for the day, I file my end of shift reports with photos of clean up and get with the next on shift support to follow up with closing plans for them. "
bad,"Worked as a supervisor for 5 months without pay until I said I was going to leave, then was given it to me, and I still left. I wasn't happy with it and it wasn't fair that I was out 5 months of pay because they kept giving me excuses."
bad,In Collections it was not fun not enjoyable at all. The good thing was that the management team tried to help there employees to succeed under what they could do. The hardest part was to go against what you believe in to what that department could do.
bad,"I would  have continued my career at Kohl' s for a lot longer if they paid what people with experience should receive. They required long "
bad,"It's an okay part time job if you are in school such as high school or college and if you are retired. For someone with a bachelors degree it is a bad job no benefits, low wages, no way to move up, no hours, and inconsistent scheduling."
bad,"An average day, I will clean and refold clothes. I could not talk to a customer no longer than 10 minutes, which I never understood if they wanted us to put 'customers first'."
bad,"My day usually consisted of mindlessly folding or putting back clothes  until I was needed elsewhere. I learned mostly customer service and communication skills with the customers and co-workers. The management here was good and bad. Some managers were actually pretty good at their job, while others would take out their personal problems out on you. Most of the co-workers here became my best friends. The hardest part of this job was trying to live off of the paycheck they gave me. The most enjoyable part was the people I met here."
bad,"Helping customer with apparel selections, learned to smile at all times, management changed to often."
bad,"The constant downward spiral of taking care of more responsibilities with less and less time to do them in. Being asked to cover core responsibilities while also being pulled away to perform various projects. "
bad,"Count money upon opening and also closing."
bad,"For little pay, you do a lot of work. I was a floor associate which meant that I was in charge of not only making sure that customers knew where to find specific items, but also making sure that everything in each area categorized by brand, style and size was in the exact location it should be. This was especially hard when managers did not make us aware of any changes to the arrangements because of sales or just corporate decisions. There was not much encouragement for collaboration between the types of employees (only those with the same job title) so there isn't much of a culture. This position is for those who really want to have a career in retail and need that on their resume, or for those who just need something to hold them over until they can find a better position. Still, any position is what you make of it and I still had a positive attitude with customers and my coworkers in my area which made the days go by faster and less stressful. I was glad to find a better position though."
bad,I was hired and shortly after became pregnant. When I made them aware of it they suddenly claimed that my performance was way worse than the others when I was working just as hard and at the same pace. I left because from one week to the next I was suddenly given no hours without warning or explanation...
bad,the pay is horrible it minimum  wage and even as a supervisor  I only was making 10 and hour. but you get a chance to make a little extra money by selling a kohl's credit card to customers
bad,I have worked for Kohl's for three years. I loved the Customer- Service aspect of Kohl's. I loved working with other co-workers and putting a smile on face. I have learned a lot about team work and how to be a team player. I loved making customers happy by following the Kohl's policy and helping them as much as possible to insure a positive shopping experience.
bad,Cashier they push on the customers too hard to apply for email and credits.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Typical work day is cleaning the sales floor and putting out merchandise while also taking care of any customer needs.  I learned the best way to give customer service and deal with even the most irate customers.  Management was always contradicting each other and you could be told to do 1 thing 4 different ways depending on how many managers were there at the time.  The supervisors were even worse, a bunch of no nothings on an ego trip.  Co-workers were decent enough but you needed to know who to keep your distance from.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with imbecile management ideas and direction.  Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help out customers that were really nice get what they came for."
bad,Kohl's is the kind of place you want to work at only if you are looking for discounts on the products.  The discounts are substantial.
bad,"Kohl's don't give me full time and more days, hours to work. I want to keep more busy, more hours and days. "
bad,"it was a good first job, working in the ware house unloading trucks taught me a lot about working hard"
bad,The work environment was okay until everyone got frustrated and got jealous because if let's say you're the employee who gets most of the credit and emails then everyone else would be very angry at you. They also never increase the pay even if you do good.
bad,"When I stared in the Ad set department, I got pretty decent hours. Then when Kohl's started using e-Sings, my hours were cut down to about 8 to 12hrs a week. Every time I applied for a new position, It would never pan though. Co-workers were great, but most leave unless they get promoted."
bad,"I absolutely did not like working at kohls. One of the managers at the Merced, CA location would flirt with all the male employees and make all the female employees work while she giggled with all the males. It was a disgusting work place with so much drama between coworkers and managers. People would start rumors and bring others into it who weren't even a part of it, including me. Typical retail work, minimum wage pretty much. Got no hours, sometimes even 4 hours a week. What's the point of that? Hated working here. Lasted 7 months until I could take no more and quit."
bad,"Kohl's is not the best company to work for. In my opinion, they're stingy. They are stingy with hours, benefits, and helping out employees in general. All Kohl's cares about is PR and customer service. They don't exactly treat their employees that well and that's why I believe they have such a high turn over."
bad,"Well a normal day of work was maintaining the jewelry, helping customers, and being aware of diamonds sales and counts. There were few coworkers that were very hard to get along with due to immaturity of gossip, fake complaints, and jealousy. The management are friendly but bias of certain employees. And have also let the rules of personal conduct slide. I believe management in this store should be taken note of."
bad,the store is ok its the compney thats is the let down we wor hard all year and never get a xmas bounes . Or realy any thing that other retail stores get part timers get noting out ov the work place .Also more then 1/2 of our raise is based on smile and say hi if you as person smile and say hi you still dont get what ou should if some eles dosent say it it sucks
bad,Checked in with supervisors to see what I'd be doing for the day. Cash handling. Management was bad. Co-workers were cool. Maintaining the goal of the store. Working with my friends.
bad,"Check K-planner to see if there is any sets that needs to be done. Check to see if there is any call backs, check to see if there is any re-packs to be done. Check fitting rooms, put up merchandise that needs to be put back on the floor. Check to see if associates are engaging the customers. Give tasks out to associates, "
bad,Very low wages for work duties! Not a teamwork atmosphere! Training is poorly given!
bad,"Worked the 2012 holiday rush, got brought on full fledged in January. "
bad,"Clock in, get duties, go to assigned area and begin work."
bad,I did not like my time working at Kohl's at all the store I was employed at had management who would contradict each other daily leaving the workers like myself to basically do 2 things that would directly interfere with one another and that would cause us to not only try to decide which would be the more important task of the two to get done but cause other efficiency issues within the company. The hours were unreliable and the pay was minimum wage. Co-workers were the only light of working there because for the most part they were very nice people and we got along very well.
bad,"A typical day at work was ok. I learned a lot about attention to detail. Management was not consistence, co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was working late hours during the holidays."
bad,They ask you to always work and will blow your phone up on your off day. The management is rude and dont know how to talk to people and security is not good security! They are constantly losing employees and always hiring. 
bad,"From what I learned from Kohl's, from both locations, they want you to work for nothing.  They do not care about your previous experience and work that could lead to a higher pay.  Managers were always rude and non understanding about emergencies that would lead to leaving early or not coming in.  "
bad,"At first I liked working at Kohl's. A good friend got me started working there and we had a good time with people while working until some individuals decided to false report me for something I didn't do during a very difficult time in my life. My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and had been doing well until recently at that time. The night before I went in I got a call that he was in the hospital and things looked bad. I worked very early, and after a bad night of sleep, I went in and tried to do my job, but was overcome with grief as things finally sank in. While crying on break, I looked to my coworkers for comfort, and while two close friends did help, others took offense to my grieving and as a result of a dislike of my friend, reported that I was angrily cursing and throwing a fit, which was far from the truth. When questioned by my supervisor I explained everything that was going on as well as the break down and what had occurred. I was then coldly told that my personal business had no business at Kohl's and my story of what really happened was ignored. I fully understand that businesses need professionalism, but in cases such as this I expected better from those that are supposed to manage such a ""customer oriented and friendly"" promoted environment. That day after I finished my work day, I walked out and never came back. I was sorely let down that a store that promoted such high standards of kindness to its' workers had been cold and hateful. Our environment was more drama based then anything, so work didn't get done as efficiently as it could have because everyone"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"don't really have much to say. I had a great first year. but once management changed, it all went downhill as far as schedules and favoritism."
bad,"The best part about working at Kohl's is your coworkers (Most of the time, sometimes they aren't worth the hell there either). Other than that, it's a joke. Your discount is insulting: 15%. 15% doesn't cover anything. It barely covers the tax you pay on their overpriced merchandise. As a floor associate, you have to bust your butt for minimum wage. Almost all of the management will breathe down your neck demanding you finish recovering your area or else you will be threatened with termination. I understand that it isn't necessarily their job to recover the floor, however it would be helpful if they would get up off of their butts and help out if it is that important. A typical week consists of hardly any hours (generally, 4-8 hours a week unless you've been there for an eternity) and rarely any chances to cover an open shift. The problem was the store was EXTREMELY overstaffed. I am not even exaggerating when I say this, but literally 95% of the people who had been there for less than five years had connections to someone who was already working there. And don't even get me started with how often they hired people. It was ridiculous. You could probably walk in and say ""I want a job"" and the manager would most likely say ""Okay, you're hired!"" Even if you got fired, you could still get your job back there. Someone at my store decided they didn't want to fold clothes one day, so they stacked a six-foot tall stack inside a dressing room, got fired, and hired back on two weeks later. It's nice to have a job, however Kohl's is a pretty terrible place."
bad,its OK sometimes it can be stressful but i can handle it i do feel appreciated they treat us like nothing but what i like most about it is helping customers because they motivates me to do better.
bad,"kohls is the most less paying job in md, there is only partime work there is no fulltime work there they start you of at 7.25 and yearly rise is only 15 cents. they work you like a dog and then the next week you dont have hours, the customer are so disrepectful and we have this yes we can pliocy in the store. when there are solw weeks you only get 4 hours per day you work."
bad,"Good place to work. Will be busy at work. Co-workers are nice easy to get along with. Management is okay,needs more work. All management need to be on one page ."
bad,I really didn't like working there.Most of the employee's were very negative towards other people.
bad,"Nice employees that are trying to make ends meet. This is not a simple task given the extremely poor wages (far under the average big box retail store). Wrong personnel in mid-level leadership positions. This lack of leadership/direction only promotes low morale and disdain between employees. The company constantly moves merchandise so the customers NEVER know where to begin and the employess seldom know where items are moved (not a good combination for customer service). More emphasis is place on accrueing credits/emails than taking care of the employees. The ""Yes I can"" attitude is not shared by every store (some will honor coupons, other won't), not a lot of continuity. There basically is NO return policy. I witnessed items returned that were immediately discarded as garbage. The customers know this and more than a few take full advantage of this policy, or lack thereof. Management seldom keeps their promises for better working environment, increased hotrs, and future employment opportunities. This review comes from someone who left on great terms. Can you imagine the review from someone who didn't leave on good terms?"
bad,Typical day at work included running a cash register. I learned how to run their Cashier System. Management was rude and disrespectful.
bad,The management was horrible. It was great in the beginning working 30 some hours and then after like 2 months it dropped down to like 4 hours a week. REDICULOUS!
bad,"Treated poorly by management, poor advancement opportunities.... not worth it"
bad,Store manager doesnt know or have a relationship with employees.  Theres alot of favoritism at kohls  No one takes time to train you pretty much have to fend for yourself
bad,"I've experienced a many different supervisors but very few leaders, I notice the difference in daily productivity. I've gained so much working for kohl's and now it's time to move on and take a step moving toward my career."
bad,"For a large company they don’t pay their employees well and they expect a lot of them. Some of what you were expected to do was, in my opinion, basically begging a customer for their business and if you didn’t meet the quotas for it then you were reprimanded."
bad,"Terrible authoritarian manager at Jersey City,  will not let you move an inch without her approval. Young supervisors straight out of high school who have no clue how to train and give instructions. I was seasonal and they treated me as a disposable tool. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go through this. Apply at your own risk."
bad,"I am a new employee. I will say I am surprised at the amount of call ins and total amount of disrespect they allow certain managers to have with their employees. If you don't agree with certain people or choose not to belong in a click group, this will not be a good experience for you. Managers are rude to their employees and managers are overlooked as being in violation of polices, when a manger dates an employee. There are very good employees there who are good people and are in the same boat as you are, but then there are the ones who are just employees( the same as you) and seem to try to try to run the place and you off when you are not in their clicks. Okay hours and chances to learn other departments., but you are expendable and they remind you of that. Great customers most of the time. I love working with people and seeing all of this going on is just horrible to my view of the world of retail.  I have quit my job cause of rude comment from a certain manager who has had corporate called on them many times in lieu of her mouth. I can do better than this. Women are supposed to lift other women up and guide you, but not at this place. If you want a great job with respect as an human being look else where. Beware of managers that are the devil in disguise."
bad,"I've worked at Kohls for almost 7 months. Not that long but it being my first and only job for a while, I put a lot of effort into my work.. maybe too much effort."
bad,They never expect you to work in your dept and you will not get promoted if you do not meet their credit card expectations. You work non stop over the holidays and they expect you to spend tons of time away from family.
bad,"Kohl's was good at first. I enjoyed my job at first and I always loved and respected my fellow associates. After the first month or two, that's when the fun stopped. It became obvious that management did not want anyone to succeed and move up in the company. When the management team I worked for finally realized I was a genuine threat to their position and leadership practices, they decided to make my time at the store as miserable as possible. Most of the people I worked with were either criminals of some sort with no other options, people in between jobs who really need money or old ladies who need something to keep them busy during the day. They expected nothing but subservience and ""yes"" answers from everybody no matter what because they knew most of the people there didn't care. I was one of the only people that cared and they knew I had potential so they gave me the worst positions in the store, degraded me and cut my hours to try and get me to leave. I guess they got what they wanted because I left one day and never went back. I would seriously be weary of Kohl's and their practices. Do your research."
bad,"Kohls is a company that does not care for their employees, only about the money. I was lucky enough to have a good manager that took me under her wing and taught me. The store manager has little to no interaction with employees and they do not have training measures in place for the day side employees. This company is a train wreck."
bad,"I did not like working somewhere I felt like the people were all in clicks, just had a very high school vibe. Bad management too, worked too many days had no time for myself."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I only worked at Kohl's seasonally, but they had unreasonable sales goals and unreasonable scheduling hours. I worked on the overnight shift to fulfill online order most of the time. After about a month straight of working 10PM-6:30AM full time, I was suddenly scheduled to come in around 4AM with no time to adjust my sleep schedule and causing me to stay up for more than 24 hours straight on multiple occasions."
bad,"I worked in the Men's, women's, and Juniors departments. When you get this position, you get assigned to one of those departments for the day.  You and one other person are now in charge of straightening and putting away every single item in that entire gigantic department. This includes folding every single shirt, folding every single pair of jeans, putting away and in the correct spot every single item that was taken to the fitting room, rezipping or rebuttoning every single coat/jacket, and more. Sometimes the 2nd person in your department does not show up and the managers don't care. They tell you to finish it alone. You also get called for back up to the registers. When you go back to your dept. you have an even bigger mess on your hands. If you close they make you stay until your entire department is completely organized and put away to the closing manager's standards. You might have to stay up to 3 hours after the store closes, this is not rare. The store closes very late too, especially during the holidays. You will definitely feel like a slave working here. You are also not allowed to talk to any of your coworkers during your shift. You just put clothes away and clean like a Kohl's zombie slave maid. "
bad,Would rec. for a career. Good for first time jobs. I have nothing else to say.   Unsure why I need to type anything at all its really a waste of my time. Much better things to do.
bad,There were good and bad days but in the end the bad days heavily out weighed the good. A lot of people would call off work and you have to pick up three extra jobs along side your own. Only ones that stay are the older people.
bad,"The women where I worked were very catty and rude. The manager would yell at associates in front of customers and even disrespect customers. They would work you to death and expect you to keep going. It's like working with a bunch of high schoolers but it's a bunch of older women. I definitely would say if you have to work here, don't make it permanent you'll likely go insane."
bad,"Pros: Easy to catch on, flexible work dates, good with days off if requested early, good about getting you covered quickly"
bad,"there was too much clothing to put away from the fitting room"
bad,"My main issues I had while working at Kohl's was the extreme lack of consistency in scheduling. I would work 5:30am-2pm one day and then 2 days later be on an overnight shift. This type of shift happened quite often and took a real toll on the employees physically and mentally. Another issue I had was that you were only supposed to wear dress shoes which was very impractical being up on your feet all day on that hard floor. The opportunity to advance to Department Supervisor came quickly, however once you get there, do not expect to advance any further. They also ripped off a couple of people as far as pay and promotions went. "
bad,"Kohl's does not have full time employees unless they are supervisor and up. The hours were determined based on sales and then to the discretion of the store manager. What he/she doesn't use that month gets sent back to corporate and the store manager gets an added bonus for unused hours. The work environment declined to the point that rules and basic job duties fell onto any individual willing to get the task done, as no punishment befell the negligent employee. The only way to advance in my location was to be really good friends with the manager staff or the store manager. Passing over qualified employees for advancement was common followed by a cut in that employee’s hours."
bad,"The management likes to play favorites, and treats them with respect while the rest of the workers get belittled and looked down on.  The coworkers are nice to work with, make the job worth while during the busy holidays,"
bad,I enjoy my job because of the people. However the management doesn’t know how to do their job right let alone the job of anyone else that works there. They play favorites and just spend time in the office talking to each other or gossiping about other co workers to each other or other workers. The raise every year is a joke. Paid under minimum wage and you only receive 10 to 25 cents a year.
bad,Management is rude expect for maybe two managers. They have a hard time keeping a schedule. Need more workers. No decent benefits. Customers are decent though.
bad,"Flexible hours if you are part time but might want to pass on this employer if you are a super social person like me.  Unless you're in a leadership role you will be expected to put your head down and work HARD every second  on the clock.  At least they're good about giving employees the required breaks but be prepared to earn your money.  No nonsense, hard working, no talking atmosphere.  Sales goals are not only met but expected to be greatly exceeded on a daily basis.  If not, the management becomes upset. Obviously that's not what is portrayed in the orientation but once you're in there expect to work work work ..."
bad,Always threatened to be fired or have less hours if you didn't try and force customers to sign up for the predatory company credit card. Credit checked so many people that didn't know any better and I regret it every time I think about it.
bad,Everyone that I've worked with so far has told me how much they hate it here. Employees are not heard and are unhappy. No one can ever get a shift covered because everyone is already working every day. Employees are spread too thin to want to stay and some higher-ups are just plain rude. Credit goals are unrealistic when the majority of store traffic is customers that have shopped here for years and have the card.
bad,Lots of work to do but not enough time to get things done management is all over no one knows who's in charge and no communication everyone's left trying to figure out things on their own good for flexibility but bad for no structure and uppers dm have no clue or don't care.
bad,Kohl’s is a terrible place to work at. They make employees sign up for a charge card to reach the store goal. They only worry about a kohl’s charge application and there’s nothing in it for them employers who get it. Managers are ok for one part but their supervisors are terrible. They barely did any work and only cared about making sure the employees were doing their job. You weren’t allowed to talk to anyone without getting yelled out about it.
bad,The amount of work depends on how busy the day is or if you are working during the holidays. The job can be stressful or demanding if there is short on staff or a lot of customers which happens a lot.
bad,The environemnt and management were anything but the best for anyone working. Many unrealistic standards the supervisor roles could do themselves. The hours were minimal and very bad attitude in the area.
bad,They really stress you out and basically threatened your job if and when you don't solicite their Credit Card to people. If the customer has a social security number then you better try dying to get them to open up a Kohls card.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The pay is good, but the hours are terrible so it works against each other. There was no way to make a living working there when some of the best workers got no more than 16 hours and 4 hour shifts. People only there for a week were getting 30+ hours and people who have been there much longer got less than half. The store manager is very rude and disrespectful. I came into that job loving it and thinking I would be there for a long time, but after being treated so horribly the time I was there, I couldn't wait to get out. "
bad,A typical day was not normal since you're not in the same department everyday. Workplace environment is friendly as well as staff. Managers were understanding but scheduling was a bit inconsistent.
bad,I worked here while going to school and it was really stressful. The managers were not very accessible to employees and did not help when we had questions.
bad,"Management trains staff poorly then gets mad when the employee doesnt know what to do. Managers are not on the same page by any means which makes working with customers difficult because you never know what's allowed. Little to no job security, poor hours, unfair pay for work expected."
bad,"Working customer service is definitely the worst position in Kohl's simply because it is where everyone, customers and employees combined, come to dump their problems. All retail has nasty customers, which is especially true here. The part of the job that sucks is the management and employee side. Managers have favoritism over certain employees, giving more job opportunities and pay raises to some employees over others, even when those employees do almost the same job. It makes it hard to bring up issues to management because the harsh reality is that nothing is going to be accomplished. Management has little care about the needs of employees in the aspect of hours and pay and only really step up to their jobs when district managers come to visit, about once every two weeks. There are some good days where the environment is fun and laid back, but the bad days are really bad and dump unnecessary stress on the few employees who are not favored by management."
bad,"Went in as part time, ended up working 40 hours a week, was constantly yelled at by management, and definetely not paid enough. Overall, they just made me feel bad about myself while working there."
bad,"Great Compensation and Benefits package, Lack of communication from upper management, Confusing resources for designing the store, Inconsistent shipments of product, Long hours especially during holiday season, Store manager creates schedule and often shows favoritism, Inconsistent schedule"
bad,"I frequently felt overworked and angry. There was no real benefit to working there and I felt like I was being asked to deal with angry customers that a manager should have to deal with. They told me there store policy was to go out of your way to help the customer and make their experience the best possible, but in actions they told me I had no empowerment to do this."
bad,"It is retail after all, its fast pace. constantly moving, handling unhappy people and rude customers on the daily. heavy favoritism and poor managment"
bad,"In 2014-2015 had the best managers, unfortunately they were all replaced with new managers. All of my friends that had worked there had quit because the new management was so poor."
bad,"While working, it wasn't a tough job and it was easy to catch onto the organization of the store and the requirements of the job. What was stressful about it were the managers in charge. The managers were constantly demanding more than the workers on shift could manage and were always disappointed and talking down to us. My co-workers were amazing and we could joke around and keep each other in good morale as we worked, but overall, the job wasn't for me and I personally didn't enjoy it."
bad,The manager has no idea what she is doing and she doesn't care about her employees. I have worked here over a year and I have never liked a job worse than I like this job.
bad,Was okay.  Cashiers always helped one another.  Some of the department employees (misses especially) always walked around with attitudes and when I asked them to help customers I got dirty looks.   I enjoyed cashing the customers out.  I was always courteous and fast but management never appreciated it.  Too focused on credit goals.   Kohl's needs to ease up on giving everything away for practically nothing.  Customers get very ugly and mean when no offers of discounts or Kohl's cash.  Mean customer is why I walked out.
bad,"The managers attitudes were disgusting. They didn’t even train me, I had to figure out how to do things on my own. The store music was driving me insane. The customers are rude and disgusting but Kohl’s policy allows them to continue these disgusting acts. Breaks were short. But the co workers are nice fun and helpful with my experience."
bad,"It was cool working there. You get to go on your own pace as long as everything is clean at the end of the day. Depending which department you get assigned for the day, it can either be hectic, or very laid back."
bad,The management was disrespectful and rude. The work environment and customers were unhealthy and need to be more respectful. I think that the way things are done can be more organized.
bad,"The pay was minimum wage. hours were between 20-30 a week. management was pretty good, just a little too pushy on credit cards. weekends were always fun because of how busy it would get."
bad,"The people here are okay. There is a huge difference on age and you may get to know many different interesting people. The management at my location however, had a different ring to them. Pushy and actual bosses instead of leaders."
bad,"A typical day at work is managing all the fitting rooms, while putting freight away and answering calls. I learned how to multitask with this job and to practice patience at all times. Management could be greatly improved. The hardest part of the job is managing your time in the mornings when you're doing everything by yourself.  The best part is the flexible schedule."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,This job gave me two days out of the week to work because of lack of communication between managers and those hours were no where near the amount to live in my area and no where near the amount needed to even be classified as part time. Do not work here if you are looking to advance.
bad,"I’ve been working here for almost 2 and a half years and the management has been absolutely horrible. Ever since the store went under new management, they have been giving me a hard time with availability changes since I’m a college student. It’s almost false advertisement because they say you get flexible availability, but when you get the job, that’s it. You can’t change it. The manager takes advantage of the younger employees as well as showing that she doesn’t care about the employees."
bad,This was a temporary job that I planned on having until graduation but they weren’t being very good managers when they decided to fire me without telling.
bad,"Kohl’s is a minimum wage job, great for students. Not a good place for a career. Most associates are part-time, and most benefits are only eligible to full time associates."
bad,"I used work other store, there is 2-3 teamwork to work on clothes. This kohls is the worse. You will have to work alone to work on whole section (men, Junior, purse). I have customer mess up in fitting room. you will have stay till store close if you have clock out like 8pm, they will make you stay till 9 or 10pm to finish all clothes and must be prefect!!! This is split throat job!"
bad,"They hire constantly. The hours are very low and sporadic. Many different managers and most are nice and professional, and others are very rude and controlling."
bad,"I worked for Kohl's for almost 6 years. I started straight out of high school, and learned so much. However, the management was horrible. I felt like I lived there, and had a terrible paycheck every week. I know that it was not my managements fault, but for it to be a multi-million dollar company ... they should pay their employees more."
bad,Good place if you need a job for awhile. most of the employees are good folks. the managers are disrespectful to employees and sometimes can be a hostile work environment.  too much pressure to get customers to open a credit account. it is ok to ask a customer but they should never be harassed.
bad,"The first Kohls I worked at was amazing. The management was fun, they encouraged a competitive background and treated us like family. The days were hard but they let us have our breaks, even pushed us to them. The second Kohls I worked at was extremely cutthroat. If you didn't dedicate your life to work there like everyone else did, then you didn't belong there. I've never been written up before, but I missed 2 shifts due to class and my boss threatened to terminate me. The dress code was extremely strict with no exceptions, and you were expected to know everything before hand. The co-workers were extremely fun to work with, and the environment was also competitive, but a few of the managers kept it purely serious. There was no talking to other co-workers if there were customers in the store (even if no one was near you)."
bad,Always night shifts and weekends. Average hours a shift is 4/5 Store manager is more worried about credit apps than anything else. No room for advancement unless you’ve worked there forever.
bad,"a typical day of work consisted of constant walking for 8 hrs along with approaching every customer more than once to the point that they were annoyed"
bad,i didn't work here long enough to really form an opinion. i mostly just help set up the store before it opened. But it seamed like a good place it just wasn't the right fit for me. they pushed the kohl s card alot.
bad,Management is very forceful and difficult to work with. They expect part-time employees to work full time hours with no benefits or room for advancement. The pay is not worth the amount expected of employees.
bad,"My specific store was not a happy place to work. Many of the associates were not happy to be there. There were many open positions due to resignations when I arrived, and people would often skip work or call in for a day off."
bad,"The atmosphere and products were wonderful as were most of my coworkers, but the managers were often temperamental and if they were in a mood, the employees bore the brunt of mood swings. Hours on average were maybe 24 during peak times for part time and dropped to less than 10 per week after the Christmas holidays to almost zero during the summer. Couldn't afford to stay."
bad,I worked during the holiday seasons of thanksgiving and christmas. I was often confused about my daily tasks because no one gave me direction. I was poorly trained and rushed into doing things I was unfamiliar with. I didnt like working here at all.
bad,It's a great place to work if you love hating work. But it's ok your co-workers hate their jobs too...................................................
bad,"Good Place to work, low pay wages. Fun Friendly environment knowledgeable and hands on supervision. Management is very friendly, approachable, and understanding."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,the management was kinda rude only like one was super nice but all the other mangers were rude and talked about people and wouldn't express their problem.
bad,Management refused to allow us off the product floor to use restroom or take drinks and would play favorites to others. Was not allowed to sit down at anytime
bad,What can I say but that my time spent at Kohl's was closely the worst job I have had. Time tend to drag on and customers were disrespectful and manager was stuck-up.
bad,"Corporate IT the Good old Bots Club..."
bad,"The job itself is hectic. There's no real ""position"" so your labeled and associate because they make you do everything except if your a manager. the pay is not worth the stress and work load. management was lazy and incompetent in my store. on the bright side though I did meet some cool people who made working there more fun"
bad,The management is the reason I wanted to leave. Even when I had family and personal issues (such as death or injury) the company didn’t have any sympathy.
bad,Only a few good managers. Never felt appreciated unless I did something worthy. Too much pressure put on getting credit applications. It would make the job not exciting and fun.
bad,"The management was kind of hard on cashiers, but overall would recommend working at Kohls. Nice, fun work environment. If you like shopping, then this is a great place to start"
bad,"I would receive a total of 4 hours a week to sustain myself at a minimum wage pay of 8.90 and I had an apartment, bills, and gas money that needed to come from those checks. It was an awful experience and instead they would try to use me as an on-call worker for when someone would call off."
bad,"it was ok. it was poor hours and too much work, it was stressful. "
bad,"Retail is not a good working environment and Kohl's is one of the worst.  They pay worse than most retailers and expect managers to work days, nights, and sometimes overnight.  It takes a toll physically and mentally."
bad,"Kohls is great if it's a temporary job. But if you're trying to make it a primary job, well good luck. There are no chances for advancement. Managers/Supervisors are very unprofessional and biased toward other employees. The work doesn't match with they pay and they do not allow you to work over 40 hours because they don't want to give employees overtime. Constantly on call for day of closing shifts til 2 AM. The Associate discount is only 15% plus any other deal going on in store . Now yes the 15% is on everything including name brands (Nike/addidas/etc.), electronics, and prestige beauty but the other percentages are excluded so what's the point? Also the Associate discount doesn't extend to family members, only spouses. If you try to give other family your discount you will be fired on spot.  They make all Associates apply for a Kohls Charge the day of orientation which should be OUR choice considering it's OUR credit that's on the line. Ultimately it's alright for something temporary but for a primary job, forget about it. No respect or equality whatsoever."
bad,"The managers in the store I worked for disregarded my availability, causing me to become ill from stress and overwork, which meant I had to call out a few times. My availability had not changed from day one, so if it was going to be an issue, that should have been expressed upfront so that I wouldn't have wasted my time. "
bad,there is no show of support for the guys working the shop and the service counter.  main reason why company has high turn over rate and mechanics quitting all the time.
bad,"Had no training, just threw me on the registers a day before Black Friday. Luckily I was a quick learner and was able to be of help to customers. Not my favorite place I've worked. Had a lot of employees complaining about their job."
bad,I would not recommend working retail unless you are a masochist. It is truly the worst of the worst in the trenches kind of job you do because our current culture and society is obsessed with materialism/consumerism. Don't work here unless you truly need to survive and can't find any other job.
bad,"I know retail isn't easy, but Kohl's expects u to do a lot of extra work that isn't in the job description and then you are lucky to even get a pat on the back. One manager will tell you to do one thing then another manager tells you to go do something else. There is no communication between management at all.  People can no-cal-no-show and not get in trouble. Then the reliable employees need to leave early or come in late and they get in trouble. There were a lot of double standards.... Then the pay... As a supervisor, I was only making $1 more than the new hires..."
bad,"No acknowledgement for giving any extra beyond what is required, overseas support usually created more issues than resolved. Negligible communication from management"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I recently was hired at Kohl's over the summer and I thought that it would be a great experience. The management team was unprofessional, unorganized, and lacked the necessary skills to run the store successfully long term."
bad,"A typical day, I would have to administer breaks, handle change, act like a supervisor without having the title of one. Doing other people's jobs without a raise."
bad,"I get hardly any hours and there have been times where I get 'forgotten on the weekly schedule. Even when I provide advance notice that I need certain times or days off, I end up scheduled on those days/times."
bad,"Workday varys.  No advancement within company, all benefits are being cut, unless your in a management position there is no reason to stay at Kohls, the most enjoyable part of the job is the other employees"
bad,"Work day was stressful. There was a lack of help in many departments. Employees were overworked and management did not realize how bad things were, even when told. People working on truck team lacked skills."
bad,Direct managers were all good. For the salary offered pay rate was not worth staying for. Very difficult to manage workforce who wouldn't come to work.
bad,"The management at the Lynchburg location is in and out constantly. The workforce is so jaded because of the immense stress they are put under to do the work of 2-3 employees each. You have to work black Friday, no questions. You also have to work the overnight shifts they have leading up to Christmas, no questions. They expect full commitment to the job, but don't adequately compensate for that."
bad,"Not a desirable place to work long-term. If you have experience in retail it's an easy transition. Overall the training takes a long time, and by the time you complete it, you only want to work there for about a week. My mom was diagnosed with cancer when I started working here and they couldn't care less when it came to sympathy,  and the time I needed to take her to appointments."
bad,"When I first began working at Kohl's it was wonderful. The culture was nice, and that made it fun and easy to come to work. Over the last six months the culture has changed drastically due to the large number of changes that have been made in such a short time. The morale is non-existent at this point and it seems as though the associate is no longer an important factor to the company."
bad,Great people to work with except the management. I learned a lot of retail experience while I was there. I also learned a lot about housekeeping and maintenance while I was there.
bad,"not much to say, you need to get people to apply for credit, or you won't get hours/they cut your hours. schedule was sometimes messed up, the store was pretty messy no matter how much you clean"
bad,"The job is very stressful and there is a lack of work/life balance even during the slow periods of the year. It's very hard to get rid of poor employees and there's tons of paperwork you have to go through to do it. During 4th quarter, you're working long days with one day off and they compensate you for that by giving you an extra week off in the spring/summer time."
bad,"The job it's self isn't hard, you're either cashing or working the floor where you put away clothes, take calls and help customers. As a supervior you do more like merchandising, supervise over other employees ect. Although it can become overwhelming and stressful due to the fact that they are always under staffed so it sets the employees back a lot. Management isn't the best as well. They don't give their employees enough respect and try to intimidate you. Also they do not accommodate for availability where scheduling is concerned. Being full time you're usually guaranteed 34-38 hours, but having only a part time position you can go from having 26 hours one week to 4 the next. Not a job I would recommend."
bad,Very busy. Not very good management. Slim chance of advancement. Good part time place because you do not get many hours. But flexible with life balance
bad,"- I didn't like my time there."
bad,"This job would have been fine had there not been a suffocating requirement to solicit credit card applications. Each sales associate has a daily quota of min. 2 credit card applications, and each associate is required to ask each customer no less than three times, even if the customer becomes angry. One of the things I did not like about the store I worked at is that my managers specifically and clearly told me to put sales ahead of customer service.  Additionally, my managers made me work through my breaks or stay hours after my shift was over, despite there being plenty of associates to relieve me."
bad,This is not a place where you can grow and advance.the management only cares about credit. The company is sinking. Get out while u can. Not worth my time at all.
bad,"I love working at Kohl's. The Marshfield store managers are super supportive, know how to energize the employees, and help out when needed.  My most enjoyable part of the job is getting customers to engage in credits, rewards, and helping them save money."
bad,"Responsible for processing refunds and exchanges while managing the cash drawer."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"kohl's was ""okay"" to work for. its better if youre shopping there rather than working. from what I know there was some mistreatment. perhaps better management."
bad,This was pretty close to the worst place I have ever worked. I was threatened with termination when I asked for days off. Managers were rude and disrespectful to both employees and customers. Managers only cared about their numbers never about keeping the customers happy. If you say no when they call to see if you want to pick up a shift they threaten to get rid of you. Do not work here.
bad,"expectations were way too high for a low pay, full timers were overworked, and managers had little to no care for employees. unfortunate high part time employee turnover"
bad,"I was fired from Kohl's for using my Aunt's Kohl's cash which she earned. The company claimed that that was considered stealing. I was also hired as a cashier and then they felt that they could throw me around wherever they needed me, which I did not have a problem with until they yelled at me for doing something incorrectly on the floor when I had not had the proper training for that position."
bad,I didn't like working at kohls because the managers were mean and the work wasn't fun. Me personally I'm not a fan or retail work. I'd rather have a desk job or something totally different from retail.
bad,"Easy place to work but if you don't get people to open up credit cards they cut your hours or don't bother to put you on the schedule. "
bad,"Upper management completely misleads everyone while they continue to bail from the company. The CFO told us he's not even trying to make money anymore, just trying to control the losses. Those in upper management and the admin assistants are bailing, because Kohl's won't be around within 3 years. This year in upper management, their IDP (Individual Development Plan) requires them to save Kohl's thousands of dollars every month, so they are trying to dig up any reason to fire associates, and now I am hearing coordinators and team leads as well. If you are there flee, if you are considering going there, good luck, and have a plan b."
bad,Very flexible with you're schedule and when you need to have days off. Loved most of my co-workers. The management is down right awful. Very rude and talks bad about everyone. They talk down to you while they sit around and do nothing. Only two managers there that are decent. A manager shouldn't call an associate stupid in front of customers. That place is just a big mess. And one week you could get 0-4 hours then the next week have 30. Some of us would go two weeks without being scheduled.
bad,"I was excited when I started working here. But as time went on, the management was rude and snobby. They did alot of employees wrong. I really had high hopes when I worked there."
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's consists of many tasks. Some days you will be a cashier, others you may stock shelves or even do inventory. The only downfall that I came across for this reason is very poor management. Some days I would be scheduled and when I came in they would tell me they wouldn't need me, or vice versa."
bad,I was a beauty advisor and the pay was okay but the management was absolutely terrible. A typical work day was draining and unfufilling. I dreaded work every day because it was slow and tedious the lighting is also a factor in all Kohls its so dark and you feel like you are working in cave all day.
bad,"I enjoyed working here at first, but the managers made enjoying it hard. They expected unrealistic things from us and treated us unfairly. I would not recommend it."
bad,I dedicated 5 years and never got a full time position and I put my all into this job. trust it was =nt for the money it was because I liked what I did .
bad,"Most inconsistent schedule I have ever had in any job. People are either being used to full capacity of their schedule to the point of being worn out, or hardly scheduled if at all. Too much is expected of floor associates, especially at the rate of pay, and considering that for the many college kids hired it is their first job. They are almost constantly hiring, and yet there are employees getting little, if any, hours. There are days it is really fun and days that are extremely stressful. No balance in anything."
bad,Management  when I was there were not fair and expected you to work when ever they wanted you to even though you give them the time you are available.
bad,"I applied for Early Morning Truck Unloader, which they gave me the job. Very easy interview, very easy people to talk to, some of the nicest I have ever talked with."
bad,The management was terrible. They were very ugly to the associates over ridiculous things. There was a lack of appreciation and respect for the associates. The store manager lacked a general concern for the well-being of the associates or employees. She was very unaware of the treatment we were receiving and is she was aware she did not do a thing about it. Overall I would not work here again nor would I recommend it to anyone.
bad,Typical day is relaxed except during holidays working with customer s great experience I liked management and that it had lots of people from all backgrounds
bad,people are been asked to work long hours and only get paid for 40 hours. no leadership vision and process in place. individuals don't take ownership of their own work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Managers played favorites. Hours were never consistent, I would go from having 20+hrs a wk to 4 with no reason why. Cashiers were treated poorly if the didn't open credit. Worked in hot dirty stockroom but had to dress professionally even though customers never saw me. Poor pay, only got a raise when state min. wage went up."
bad,"The pay is very little considering all the customers you have to deal with. Constant arguing over coupons that would only save them 10 cents. Manager do not understand that you cannot be doing 5 things at once and become upset when you can't accomplish what you need to do, even though you are pulled away to cashier every 2 seconds."
bad,horrible and boring. no advancement opportunity but at least they were good at making their schedules. I wouldn't suggest this job unless you really needed a position and wee out of work
bad,"The holiday's are the best time to work the for this company; after the holiday's and they want you to stay, it becomes another thing. Hours get cut, some weeks went by and you only worked 12 hours for the entire week. This was my experience. The holiday's were the best time to work there."
bad,"Management was far from wonderful. They don't work with your schedules, don't update you when you ask for information and they claim they will, and they don't watch their breaks. Employees are meant to get breaks but I was regularly deigned mine or it was simply ignored. Was hired for one position but I was often required to cover others. NO TRAINING WHEN PROMISED. Coworkers were not friendly."
bad,"Not enough workers in the floor departments, to pushy about signing people up for credit cards, there were favorites that got better positions over people who had more experience and time"
bad,"they don't give enough training, hot, management was nowhere to be found . the coworkrs were rude. you had to walk a long ways get to the time clock so when you clock in one minute late nd they give you points so even if you have an emergency you cat call out you still get accounted for and you get a ""point"". not fair"
bad,"Truck unload was great!! Fast paced and upbeat, but don't ever got to the sales floor!! Horrible!! I was hoping to better myself and my opportunities when in fact, it was horrible!! No rotation of weekends and horrible support staff!! Two associates on the sales floor at any given time!!! Not worth the hassle. Even as a supervisor you will get your schedule one week at a time..and if there is a discrepancy, don't even bother to say anything because you will be ridiculed and harassed for making problems for them....my point...don't waste years of your life on this place like I  did!"
bad,A typical day at is stressful Loud and micro management was uncomfortable. Frequent system fails and program errors however the associate will be held accountable for not having access to assist customers.
bad,Worked in there cash office and guests services. Was only part time to help out during the holiday seasons. They schedule out of my availability.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of handling customer complaints which ranged anywhere from being pleasant and easy to being berated and verbally abused by over privileged consumers in the Ballwin/Ellisville area. I could not work in this position and keep my self respect; out of all retail areas I have worked in the past this place had the WORST customers I've ever encountered. "
bad,"Little work hours, disrespectful managers. don't care about your school life or anything. Only managers can work 32hrs or more."
bad,"It's as good as a minimum wage job retail job is going to get."
bad,Kohl's didn't really care about their employees. I wasn't getting paid on time. It would take them months to pay me for the hours I've worked. Management didn't care about the company. They only looked out for themselves.
bad,"esponsible to deliver outstanding service to both internal and external customers"
bad,"Amazing discounts, boring retail work. Constantly a skeleton crew and lack of accountability or organization. Management positions are designed to make the E3s lazy, which is reflected in the condition of the store. Constant pressure to persuade customers to sign up for the credit card."
bad,"Great job if you are looking for something part time, just to make a little bit of extra cash on the side. This is not a career by any means. There is little chance for advancement unless you work there for more than 5 years. Very low pay and low hours."
bad,helped set up new store and unloaded truck when new items came in. Didn't get many hours after store opened up. Met some new people that made working there somewhat enjoyable.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Typical day consisted of  restocking and floor clean up, as well as pricing mark-downs, as well as assisting customers with purchases. "
bad,"Gives minimal hours to keep employees on payroll, management is rude to employees, and not enough training is given to new employees."
bad,"Depending on what you're hired in as, I started as a cashier when I first started years ago, then when I came back I applied to work as a customer service associate in the back but was stuck up front as a cashier which is really boring and annoying. Never enough associates in the front when things get busy you have to page for someone to come help. You pretty much stand around most the day and ""pretend"" to work for barely any pay."
bad,"Good workplace, management could use some work. Very enjoyable with the people you work with. Constantly greet and assist customers with needs."
bad,OVERALL the store i working at wasnt very good wasnt impressed at all with anything. but glad i got to learn about retail.
bad,"Most days I assisted customers and cleaned fitting rooms. I learned a lot of things which I am grateful for, such as P.O.S. , how the retail system works, theft, customer service, and more than one area of the different departments. Management was very nice for the most part all my bosses were kind and gave me great instructions. The hardest part of the job was standing for long hours and being underpaid for all the areas I was working. I really enjoyed working in Jewelery which was a high clearance area and more responsibility but I found it very enjoyable."
bad,"I learned how to work a retail register. The management was terrible, the store was very unorganized. A lot of drama between co-workers. Most enjoyable part would have to be being able to communicate with customers."
bad,My schedule was one thing on the bulliton board and another in their books to much confusion. The people were nice and enjoyed the staff. I dislike that it was a just stand still job no movement forreal this is a great job for people who are just looking for their first job or if you have a car
bad,The managers are always nice and friendly with costumers but when you turn around and speak to them about maybe a day off they get really defensive and mad at you for asking. The store has multiple clicks made up of mainly managers and its a horrible depressing place to work at.
bad,its good for students who wanna safe money for college.Other than that its not a good plade for growth or for house hold.
bad,"minimum pay of 7.25/hr, it is an ok starter job for a college or highschool student for extra change."
bad,"Satisfying when working with your team, within your building... but be prepared for long hours exceeding 65 hours a week to truly succeed. Also, little to no interaction with leadership for months at a time; no visits, no phone calls, not even a conference call with other leaders."
bad,"At Kohl's I worked at the Home and Kids departments. I would only work one department at a time. I learned how to fold towels in a way that made them sell faster. I learned how to face or detail the aisles. Which means how to pull all the items forward on the shelves to make it appear more fully stocked, I learned how to balance several customers needs and wants at one time. The management was not the best in my opinion. There was a lot of favoritism over specific employees. Seniority of specific employees meant what you asked for or needed became second best compared to other employees. The co-workers were very clique-y. When new employees were trained they tend to stick to themselves because the other workers there didn't make you feel welcome, as if you were stepping on their territory so to speak. The hardest part of the job was learning the register. The management would hand you a huge 3 ring binder of situations to go through on the registers and left you to learn it all on your own. It was all up to you to learn new things and procedures that you've never learned before. I was never ""buddy-trained"" which was where you would work with one other employee at the registers and watch how to do specific procedures specific to Kohl's. You would only get one 8 hour shift to learn a lot of information. It was just not possible to learn all of that in one short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Being able to connect with someone on what they're looking for is very satisfying. Making a customer smile meant more to me than anything."
bad,"They like to hire 50 part timers and only give them maybe (if your lucky) 10 hours a week. I am a wife with 2 children, this does not cut it. Plus you only get minimum wage and they give you your paychecks on a money card that charges you a fee every time you use it!"
bad,I would only recommend this job for a high school student or a college student that needs some money in their pocket while in school.
bad,"Let me start by saying Kohls is a solid company with a strong foundation. The product is strong, and the business model is sound."
bad,"Fast paced, learned new back-stocking software.  I like the people I work with, some of the management needs to work and not read magazines at their desks."
bad,"Typical work day is placing the customer as the number one priority, while also ensuring the jewelry department is well stocked with merchandise, clean, organized, and easy maneuverable by customers. I have learned a great deal about how to handle jewelry and present the pieces in such a way that allows the customers to handle and wear the jewelry prior to purchasing it, while also maintaining security standards and protocol. My coworkers are as unique as the general public, coming from many different backgrounds and walks of life, with many different personalities and qualities. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete the tasks at hand while resources, such as shelving units or company designated design of floor, hinder the progress of the project. I thoroughly enjoy working with the customers and bringing them confidence and happiness in in pieces of jewelry they have purchased, thus ensuring they return for all their accessory needs."
bad,This job was very easy but the management just made it a very unpleasant place to be. They weren't opened to teaching new things to employees and they played the favoritism card a lot. My personal manager was the rudest person I'd ever met. She was very unfair to me personally. I can recall numerous accounts of times she has reprimanded me in front of customers. Just very uncalled for behavior. This was the worst job ever.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Busy days without having time to get all of job responsibilities done, regardless of time management skills.  Learned leadership skills and how to connect with a store side team.  Management store side was fantastic and helpful, while LP side was difficult and strained.  Co-workers were great, but worked alone in a store often."
bad,I have stuck with the position I had was a single mom work to give my kids what they needed. I have learned more thing with this job because I know no other at this time but I would like to father my career oppunity  if anyone can give me a chance to do so.
bad,I would have liked to stayed longer or had the opportunity to show Kohl's alot more of my office experience
bad,"Cashiering was overall easy. I enjoy customer interaction for challenge purposes. Organizing and cleaning around the store was sometimes a challenge especially when products were being moved around without any notice to employees. Lack of contact with someone in different departments due to co-workers leaving their departments or not listening to over com pages. Also, lack of management being available when needed. Lack of drug testing their security."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Did same work people who were making $3 more an hour did with no appreciation. Corporation attracts horribly rude customers. Management only cares about credits, emails, and keeping their own a*ses out of trouble."
bad,I did not enjoy working in retail. I did not enjoy working holidays and having no time for my family.
bad,This was my first experience with retail.  Hours are unreliable. One week you will be schedule for 30 + hours and the next you may be scheduled for 5 hours.  There is not seniority given to long time employees. Pay is poor. Only 13 out of 130 employees at my location was classified as full time.  pay increases are poor as well. Hours varied at all times. The availability to pick up hours is usually there if management approves you working those hours. Hours are given to those who are able to solicit credit applications the best. If you can not get customers to apply for a Kohl's credit card do not plan on having any hours. The discounts are the best part of this job. There is little room for advancement in the company.  There are many double standards to most of their policies. There is no set policy for many things. They are left to the discretion of the manager on duty. The management team is rude and unhelpful.  They do not show any desire to help you learn your job or a new job within the company. 
bad,"ok to work here. I it could be better,because they have alot of turn over"
bad,Fast paced work environment with multi tasking required every day. I've learned how to be more organized and multi task efficiently. Management has been friendly to me since I was hired.
bad,Following the guidelines outlined for me I have worked to elevate the visual presentation through out the store.
bad,Its a good work place. just would like to receive more hours than just 20hrs a week. Hard to live of that
bad,"Dealt with customers. Enjoyed solving the customers issue, Just did not like the management."
bad,"I worked not just the cash office, but then the customer service counter as well. There was very little training and management was more worried about popularity."
bad,Wouldn't refer anyone to work for this company because they don't appreciate good workers
bad,"assist customers with purchases, returns, payments, location of products and customer complaint resolutions."
bad,Managment stinks!
bad,You are expected to do way more work than you can get done and then reap punishment if you don't get it done. The compensation is horrible for the amount of work you are expected to do. You probably wont get more than 20 hours. Management is unfair and picks favorites. The co-workers were enjoyable to be around for the most part. Most of them would rather mess around and talk then get the job done.
bad,There is no work/life balance. Management does not support the employees.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day at work usually involved doing the work that someone didn't do and your own as well. It may have been due to the time frame that I was employed, but management never had time to properly train some employees."
bad,"An easy job and ideal if you only want something part-time. Staff is nice, and so are the customers. It was fun talking and interacting with the customers during their checkout. Had to try and sign customers up for a charge card and that was pretty difficult at times. Overall o.k. place to work, it was nice knowing the clearance merchandise before the public."
bad,Horrible hours
bad,"I enjoyed my six years at Kohl's. However, I witness a lot that I enjoy. For instance, falsely accusing workers of stealing, superviser having relations with their coworkers, stereotype, prejudice and etc. Kohl's started well, but slowly ended up being a pool of hate and prejudice. Not only that, but the the second manager in charged show a lot of favoritism when it comes to handing out hours."
bad,"My job was in shoes. On a typical day I covered shoes, housewares, mens, intimates, kids, and ran a register. I have knee problems and regularly went home with blue, purple, and black bruises on my knees and not once did anyone thank me for running all over the store. I had customers that would not buy anything if I was not working and they regularly told the managers. When I was hired they told me I was not seasonal then after the holidays they said I was. A month later they wanted me back. I would have returned but was unable. The people are nice but unorganized."
bad,"I worked for this company for 10 years. I totally enjoyed the concept of the company when I started but unfortunately, thru it's growth, the employees were no longer consider a great asset to them. I witness the company letting great long term employees go or cutting their hours to bring in new people with less experience, less values at minimum pay. I guess company growth can do this to you."
bad,"I was only seasonal, but this job was not for me. You don’t pick your position. I would’ve liked to be on register but ended up stocking the floor and cleaning."
bad,"The location I worked at had terrible management and was severly disorganized. Also, lack of communication. No consistency. The store manager at the time ""was not a morning person"", so I was told, and was hardly ever there in the mornings (only there early for truck days). She was also quite curt and made it obvious she didnt like her job. That attitude trickled down to other employees."
bad,"The managers at Kohl's are not supportive whatsoever. Their goal is to find your flaws and make you feel guilty for them. They have a strict attendance policy and do not care what circumstances could cause an absence (death of a family member, car accident, sudden illness, etc). Kohl's is good for people who are desperate to make money regardless of the environment. Kohl's pays their employees weekly which is nice, however, the actual job is so painful and dreaded by most of the employees."
bad,"It was a temporary job for a season, so we had to work long hours, and in return we didnt get paod that much money, so if you are fresh out of highschool and need a quick part time job then this is a decent place to work."
bad,"As a former employee of Kohl's, I had a wave of relief once I quit that job. If it wasn't for my other coworkers, I would've quit sooner. Once the managers see your work ethic is strong, they will over work you. However, they are flexible with a school schedule and  a second job."
bad,Great company to work for and excellent benefits. The atmosphere & management are great! The downs falls about working there that there isn't alot of full time position.
bad,Communication could be a lot better between the upper management  and it would be great if the management team actually cared to support its associates. Other than that its not terrible but the starting pay isn't great.
bad,"Easy job with decent pay, but they take advantage of employees who take pride in their work ethic. Alot of favoritism and poor communication between management. Dont appreciate loyal employees and are insensitive to unexpected tragedies in employees personal lives."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I had a bad experience with a manager, but overall the experience of working at Kohl's was enjoyable. Customers have the opportunity to get many good deals and coupons to lower their transaction totals."
bad,The management team is very unorganized & completely discombobulated. Pay isn’t reasonable for hours employees work. Part time position but give you full time hours but NOT full time pay. (hours just cut if you ask) Also schedule hours after your availability but get upset when you have to go...
bad,I did not like the workers there . They would talk behind my back and say mean things about me and try and get me fired. I did not like working there because it brought my self esteem low and it made me sad hearing others talk about me and I couldn’t work in peace
bad,I’ve been there 3 years & worked 4 Christmas’s. They schedule outside your availability and make you responsible for finding coverage. One manager will tell you one thing and another will tell you the opposite. Favorites get to do what they want while everyone else gets crapped on. They constantly hire new people and give all the hours to them and they stop showing up after 1 shift. Training is a joke.  Employee satisfaction means nothing. You are expendable.
bad,"Poor management, unorganized, disrespectful dialogue between managers & employees. Unprofessional environment. Racist undertones from managers & customers. Apply at your own risk."
bad,"This was a modern-day sweatshop. Move with ""the herd"" or be picked off.Worse place I ever worked. The slogan ""Find Your Yes"" was geared toward customers, definitely not geared toward staff. Everyone thinks they are a manager."
bad,"I worked for Kohl's for four years under four different store managers at two different stores. I was able to transfer between two stores for college which was nice. I give this job two stars because employee morale is quite low. The job is very stressful and the workload is extremely high. You get very little support from management when it comes to difficult customers. There is an abundance of verbal abuse from customers, especially at the customer service desk, and if you do not have a tough skin it can be a very upsetting and an emotionally draining job. As an associate, you are expected to learn all workings of the store eventually, like POC (point of commerce), customer service desk, Online pickup (BOPUS), floor recovery, fitting room recovery, as well as working truck, overnights, and replenishment. Over my four years working there I received a 1% raise each year. Management can either make or break your work experience. At the Frisco, TX store expect to be overwhelmed during all shifts. Fitting room recovery will never be complete, nor will the floor be fully recovered. There are impossible expectations regarding recovery and BOPUS and there is very little positive or encouraging feedback when you complete a project, big or small. This store has high associate turnover due to the stress of the job, the immense workload, the constant verbal abuse from customers, and the relationship with management is little to none. In all honesty, the store needs an organizational development consultant to help smooth out the dysfunction and dissatisfaction but that will never happen."
bad,I didn't have much experience being a cashier so it was a lot of on the job training. Not exactly my cup of tea. I'd rather just stay busy. It was mostly learning there computer software and cash register.
bad,"Being that it’s the holidays, I thought they’d want us to be fully prepared and trained accordingly. Kohl’s hires so much during the holidays it’s like they focus on that piece and not the training piece. I have been there for 3 months and just last Sunday started register. Not because the training staff appointed me but I took initiative and watched a coworker while my department was clear. There are still things I do not know and coworkers are very open in stating “you will not know everything”. Just because I’m Seasonal, doesn’t mean I should be treated differently, we are all there to do the same job, service the customer."
bad,I had been cross trained throughout almost every department in my store except management. Advancing to manager means one is moving or retiring so you must be in it for the long haul if you’re looking to move up inside Kohls. My managers were so stressed they made the workers lives miserable. So glad I left! I loved it when I first started as temp/seasonal and then towards the end I couldn’t work for the managers
bad,"No breaks on black Fri."
bad,Khols was ok not to friendly as far as staff goes limited hours limited on getting other chances as far as learning things when you do learn they keep you doing the same thing everyday you do work
bad,"Some of the managers are very nice. My direct supervisor was very fair. My complaint would be not enough seasonal hours. You will have to do other job duties, not only the one you're hired for."
bad,"Depending on your management team. You can have a fun place to work or a stressful place to work. Unfortunately for me, my management team was one that micromanaged, expected more than what was capable, and could be very condescending. Your coworkers can make the job less horrible, but it's still not a place I'd recommend to work"
bad,Terrible management. Not any structure. It was the least favorite job I had and I wouldn't recommend it for any of my friends. I would basically work the sales floor
bad,"I was in amazon returns and somedays they would send me down at docks to load up amazon returns which was stocking up boxes and loading them into the trucks. After a year of working there, they only gave me a 6% raise which meant they did not value hard work and loyalty."
bad,"When I first started, the store was like a family. Most people had been there a while, so they knew their jobs, and everything was smooth. But after the first manager was pulled to another store, the new one came in and uprooted everything. "
bad,"Cashiering or working on floor"
bad,"The companies idea for associates is for them to push themselves the absolute hardest and if the hurt themselves, offer them LOW workers comp starting at $10 and expect you to still work at the same pace. Management on the store level are TERRIBLE at communication things. in a visual position you are to communicate everything to everyone but no one pays attention and you are repeatedly asked questions. The only benefit to kohls is now a relaxed jean and blouse wardrobe (which just began in 2019) and the 15% discount that sometimes gets raised to 35% 2x a year, and friends and family a 25% coupon. The customers tend to be entitled and no one cares about the hard work you do"
bad,"It would be ok place to work for but Brooke and Barb expect u know ur job in 15 min or ur marked. They don't have tolerance for training people as well as no tolerance for new people. They have no patience to work with u after being show n half of what job is,. They also don't train well and throw u do job and if u mess up then they threatened u with ur job. Basically if u don't meet there expeations then they will get rid of u, Wich is unfair bc u get 15 min if that training and expected know job after that or they fire u. And both have I'm better u attitude. And Barb sits in office and barks orders."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"“Don’t worry about it , on your next paycheck you’ll get the .50 cents per hour more for all the time you’ve been working for below minimum wage” I heard the same thing being explained to me every Thursday when I’d pick up my paycheck and that day never came. When we got a replacement for our store manager ,He was rude and would embarrass me in front of customers heand would scold me like mas if he were my stepdadwould scold me"
bad,"Didn’t get paid enough to deal with such customers. They just want their discount & Kohl’s cash, doesn’t matter who they’re walking over. Dealt with a lot of rude customers and then management takes care of it but makes you look dumb to customers. Loathed the ‘customer is always right’ mindset there. Also often got switched to many different departments due to low staff and busy hours. However, when they have plenty of people scheduled per week.. your hours starts decreasing fast. Went from making at least $200 a paycheck to $50 a paycheck. Wasn’t worth the trouble."
bad,"If you are a clean freak, like I am, cleaning dirty dressing rooms will be your worst nightmare. Overall, I think that someone could enjoy working there if you do not mind picking up after people, but that is not my favorite thing to do. The management also was not good with scheduling and would call last minute to see if I could fill in. Then they would be upset with me when I could not work at a time where I was not even scheduled to work."
bad,"Working at Kohl's was an fun experience at first until the original manger left and the new guy came and took over. Once she left kohl's management went downhill; for example we had on of our MANAGERS talk to another associate about an co worker  calling her stupid, and the co worker overheard so she wrote out an long letter on how it made her feel and how unprofessional it was and yet has anyone done anything about it nor did they have him to apologize to her. The store just have a lot of rude managers who should not be in the position that they are in. On the other hand the best part about going to work is the associates they make the job worth while and know how to keep each other going."
bad,"A typical day at work involves managing and leading teams to achieve goals, putting out fires like call-outs, struggling to get the equipment to work, and trying to perform well at measured tasks that are not well funded. "
bad,"I got my first job working at Kohl’s as a seasonal sales associate during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season. Working at Kohl’s was very stressful, and I noticed right away that my coworkers and managers weren’t very friendly, and there was no “teamwork.” I always dreaded asking for help because no one wanted to work together and assist each other. I would not recommend working at Kohl’s."
bad,"When working there we were 32 people under staffed, the manager wasn’t flexible with hours at all. The manager was also rude to her employees and never did her job. The environment wasn’t healthy so I left."
bad,"I was trained by the nicest, most chill guy ever my first 3 days, and of course he is being promoted and they bring this guy in who seemed to like everyone but me. I was told to not have feeling, everything I did the first three days was here after wrong. I basically was falling behind daily with no help only belittling."
bad,"On average, I'd get about 15 hours a week. Wages suck unless you cheat customers into signing up for credits. Management was the worst, never doing anything but sitting in the office. They'd give you the worst tasks. They weren't hard, they were just stupid. Flipping boxes upside down in the stockroom, for example. Store is always a mess. If you're not a cashier, you don't matter."
bad,Stressful and fast pace. Always under staffed and over worked. There's lots of favoritism. Some supervisor were rude and the pay is not worth it. Oh yeah customers can be real pain as well.
bad,"I worked with kohl’s for years it was an okay place to work, they have decent benefits if you are full time and I have met great friends working there but the management is what would normally expect in retail, very toxic and unnecessarily strict. The area supervisors fight to be the store manager’s favorite, they’re rude, they gossip, watch and question you every move like you are in prison. It’s basically  an HR violation hub. The management positions don’t pay well at all for the extreme micro managing they do. Overall, it’s a good place to be for a short amount of time, maybe no more than 1 year.. after that you will dread going into this place every day"
bad,I loved working with my team and customers. Upper Management at my location however wasn't the best. They were very disorganized which caused us to constancy be behind on our workload and projects often working overtime to catch up with no regard for our personal time. I also felt upper management were extremely unappreciative constantly talking down to and belittling associates not giving enough recognition for work well down. Defiantly not in the business of developing associated and improving the work environment
bad,I believe the staff is under valued. Management is not always there for employees. Pay is terrible. Work takes toll on body. Customers are disrespectful and company does no back up employees. Favoritism is a big factor here.
bad,Kohl’s wasn’t a bad place to work until the store manager and E1 assistant store manager backstabs you . They don’t care about you but only care if their numbers are reached . This place is a joke and try to make people felt like they are worthless even if you are one of the harder workers.
bad,"Average 5-8 hour days with very inconsistent schedules. One week you may be scheduled for 9 hours, others may be 30+. Difficult to have any type of work/life balance as you'll never know what days/hours you'll be working until a few days prior. One week can be a M-F 12-6, next week can be scheduled 6 am to 2 pm, then 2-10, etc. Coworkers are lovely and will assist you with all needs. Managers? Not so much. Extreme lack of training, and unprofessional behavior on a DAILY basis from managers. Will put you in new positions and departments with no training or communication, then proceed to get hostile when asking questions. All bring their personal problems to work and flaunt them. Will talk under their breath, roll their eyes, and berate and embarrass you in front of customers and coworkers alike. A lot of manager on manager drama, many times I'd walk into the stockroom to see one crying or arguing with another. One of them is not fond of women, has a volatile temper, and will berate employees often. Many are nervous around said individual and customers have reported this behavior before. Not many growth opportunities either. You will stay where you started. "
bad,The pay sucks and if it weren’t for the discounts I would have left by now. Most of the people are cool to work with and the discounts are good but the pay sucks and employees get less privileges than customers which isn’t fair.
bad,Management was nice at first  but they tend to have favorites and work others more than some.  Hard to move up and not very diverse. Not worth the pay
bad,Barely flexible hours. Say they’re flexible but they tell you they will fire you if you change your schedule. The work put into the store is way more than the pay. The pay is terrible and bare minimum.  Management changes constantly and leaves the store to fail. The associates are nice at least some. You will only get overtime or more hours if you’re the Managers favorites. Never have enough associates on the floor or registers. Go to target they have better starting pay. There no room for advancement at kohl’s.
bad,"Required to work more than your being paid for. Management is very poor and dump all the work onto everyone else. Communication is very lacking and everything can be unorganized. A lot of new managers have been appointed since the other ones have left, every one tends to quit real quickly."
bad,"Worked in omni / fulfillment started off good but went downhill really quick. Started off with pretty good hours but had to change my  availability as I could no longer work nights ( mind you I was the only one working omni nights, they gave me ALL the nights despite having tons of omni employees ). They got super upset and cut my hours DRASTICALLY ~ Worked 4 hr - 6 hr.  shifts for about 1-2 days after changing my availability as before I was working 3-4 days with 6-8 hour shifts. Management was poor at communication and very lazy as well. Would get on you if you didn't pick orders “fast enough” despite the fact that the blue birds were very ineffective and would shut down easily or lose charge quickly, in which they barely had enough for our department and seeing as  they saw the orders piling up they could have jumped on and helped but chose not to until corporate “yelled” at them for loosing them money.  Very petty drama and gossip between some employees and managers causing lots of toxicity and a hostile environment. And the list goes on... would not recommend working here."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Overall, I really liked the experience that I had at Kohl's! I liked all of my managers, I liked my coworkers, and I liked my benefits that I received as an employee."
bad,It is your typical retail job not much more to expect from them than that. They gave you great employee discounts and that was the only good thing there.
bad,"I liked my job at the Mentor, Ohio store, but when I moved back to Rochester and transferred to the Henrietta store, it was not fun. The shift managers ranged from spaced out to drill instructor. They were always asking me to stay late and there were never enough cashiers."
bad,"I transferred from a store in Ohio, and that store was amazing. i got friends to work there, the staff was great, and while management was fun and interactive, we still always got everything done.however, the store i transferred to in Georgia has inattentive management who nit-picks small things and loses the big picture. very biased and little to no chance to grow withing the company. As a company, i like Kohl's, but it very much depends of the management and other staff as to how much you enjoy your work, as i have seen both ends of the spectrum."
bad,"Kohl’s made work fun most days. Even with mandatory overtime. There were constant changes from shifts, to team leads, to desk switches. Turn over rate was very high"
bad,Being a senior in high school working here was great! They worked well with my sports schedule and made many accommodations for me. It wasn't until I  graduated where I   started to see the flaws in their system. The management was absolutely trash. No problems were dealt with and were always pointing fingers when something went wrong. The manager even told an employee they were replaceable. Worst management I   have ever had to work with. The coworkers are a benefit and you get some great discounts. If only management treated their employees better then I   would have stayed working there.
bad,Hard work for little money. It is rare for someone stay longer then 6 months unless you are a manager. Your schedule is changed every week. There are no set hours.
bad,i liked my coworkers but the pay wasn’t great and the shifts were inconsistant. You couldn’t clock in before or after your shifts start time or you would get written up. There is always people sitting waiting for the exact time to clock in.
bad,Kohls is a good job for younger people just entering the work force looking to gain retain experience but it does not offer a lot of advancement or benefits for anyone looking to further their career.
bad,I was hired for seasonal cashier and it was a ghost town most of the day. Poor management and Kohl's cash is pointless. No room for advancement. Managers openly talked about poor employee performance. Little training and explanation on expectations or policies.
bad,Kohls was a great place to work.  The atmosphere was enthusiastic and always fun. Most of the managers were willing to work with you and make you feel like you were part of the team.
bad,"The pay is minimum wage and you deal with many very stressful situations no matter which position you work at. Cashiers have to deal with nasty customers, if you work in a department if cashiera are backed up you have to stop your work to assist cashiers."
bad,The typical day at work resolved in clocking in and not getting a lot of things done. You either stay in a department or mvove items around the store.
bad,its not enough pay compared to the kind of work expected based on your position within the company.  The employee discount isnt much but i guess its better than some places.
bad,"Poorly managed and run, not very organized and unreliable employees led to a shift in roles for the day for other employees.  No paid lunch, but you did get a half an hour."
bad,Kohl's is a decent place to work for the short term but definitely not a good long term job. I worked there for many years and it worked for me while my kids were small as it was pretty flexible. You will work crazy hours during the holidays and the pay in my opinion is not on par with other similar retailers. If you want to work there while you're going to school it would work as they have a lot of night and weekend shifts available.
bad,Management and policies are a joke. The managers  about you and you have to suck up in order to get promoted which is rare. They don’t want to give employees the chance to move up. Only if you’re kissing their butts. They also let customers abuse you and treat you like trash because of their “ yes we can “ policy. The managers just sit in the break room all day and do nothing as well.  The management is a team of bullies. Terrible job.
bad,"Daily merchandising of product is expected, but no time given to achieve goals"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"would have liked to have more hours and better pay."
bad,"Got to work with different people, different hours, have to deal with different kinds of people, different scenery, they sell all different things besides clothes"
bad,"Sure you can SURVIVE off of this place (meaning a retail location, not corporate) if you work 40+ hours a week however they hate paying overtime so you get reprimanded when you go over 40 hours. You also get reprimanded when you don't get your assigned work done within 40 hours because you are putting customers first like their mantra says. Corporate has a ""I want my cake and eat it too"" mentality and get all upset when it doesn't happen. Even if you do work 40 hour weeks it's hard to make ends meet unless you live in some scummy landlord's overpriced apartment (like most department leads) or have a second job (like some managers/supervisors). The flexible schedule is a double edged sword. Sure you may get the hours and roles you want but that could screw someone else over, including you one day. Unless you work an 8+ hour day, the breaks don't seem to be long enough or frequent enough. Obviously experience dealing with customers will vary, but with other department stores closing all their less than desirable customers are starting to come to Kohl's. You have to call out at the time you're scheduled to be there instead of giving them prior notice. If you give them prior notice that you won't be able to make but don't call in at that time to call off it counts as a strike towards your automatic employment termination. The ""surprise"" visit from a district manager days suck. We get pushed to make it look like corporate's decisions and policies are working so we don't get reprimanded, instead of letting corporate face their consequences. Ok benefits for full time employees that"
bad,I was not impressed with the supervision at this company alot of fakes. Very rude and unmeaning conversations with the upper management as well as not listening to the employees that actually do the work
bad,no set hours are given..  never know week from week what you would be working.  I went from full time to part time.  While on part time my hours were cut a lot
bad,Working at kohls was a easy start for me. I liked working there butit was only seasonal so i didnt get many hours. Always worked in the same area didnt get to learn much more as i wanted to.
bad,"Kohls taught me a lot of retail, and customer service. But it was a very disorganized place I was located at. Management was not that great. I considered myself a great employee."
bad,they need to train the people right and not half doing their jobs. they need to let people know what they can do and what they cant do. they have new people starting and they are young and don't want to work and they are lazy.
bad,"It's retail.  It takes a special person to work there, I was not that person.  My job was to follow behind a certain Department manager and clean up their mess.  After that person left, I was sent to Jewelry where you are lucky to get a bathroom break let alone a lunch (if you are scheduled for one)."
bad,I worked here a long time ago but at the time they did not seem to be open to work with employees on schedules and needed time off. I also had health issues at the time and they were not helpful with working with me and my issues.
bad,"Only thing I can really say is unless you're planning on making your way up to a supervisor position, don't get complacent. Pay raises are poor and how well you perform has very little impact on your raise. In the end, it's a retail job, so don't expect too much out of it."
bad,"I was working for this company for five years at part time with no raise, no hours, no paid time off, no vacation time and no advancement.  Iam a single father trying to make it with two kids and I just couldnt take working there anymore."
bad,"Kohl's is a regular, slightly overpriced department store. Not only do they offer clothing, they also offer home goods, as well as, limited seasonal items and household items."
bad,"They give you 2 days of “training” and then throw you out onto the floor like it’s nothing. The training is awful and lasts maybe an hour if you’re lucky. No way to communicate with other employees in the stores and it becomes hard to help customers when you never received training! They will get mad if you ask for a break even though you’re entitled to one. They preach they’re all about working with your schedule but fail to tell you that they won’t work with your schedule for a period of time.  Kohl’s hired me because they needed ME, I sure as heck didn’t need them!!"
bad,"Straighten, straighten, straighten the whole store.  It is a lot of work trying to find clothes for everyone at their price point. "
bad,this part is really unnecessary you already ask me a tone of question ...a day at work is go in do your job and get out point blank period straight to the point
bad,"I loved working at kohl when first started working there, but overtime i started seeing the backwardness. my manager was so socially awkward she sometimes wouldn't even greet us. at one point i didn't even know she was a manager. they lost their essence. im not saying all kohls are like this but the one in green acres mall is horrible. there was never enough workers on the floor to help. it was just a disaster everyday i went in there. eventually i stop showing up and ended up working at pandora jewelry."
bad,"I applied at Kohls as a temporary seasonal worker. Got super excited when I got hired, but once I started working they didnt give me any hours. I cannot live off 4-8hours a week. That's basically gas money to go home and back to work. My managers and employees never looked happy at work either. I tried to make work seem more joyable by greeting customers and pumping up my coworker, but nobody cared. Good customer service is about engaging with customers with a positive attitude and assisting them. But not at this place."
bad,Very Basic Fortune 500 Company to work in Operation's and Los Prevention as a Corporate Employee.Worked also in Replenishment and Stock Rooms and Supply Trucks Unloading and Docking.
bad,"Management does not teach you everything you need to do your job, then gets upset when you make a mistake; expects you to already know everything. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Some employees do not take time to fully ensure training; store manager rarely has anything positive to say; one mistake and you’re removed from the schedule without any communication or regard.
bad,"I cant say much about working here, as for my co workers, I work with different ones each time I work a shift.  I have several different supervisors or managers each time I work a shift."
bad,it was a nice job to have while in high school but as an adult it doesnt quite paynthe bills. they should pay more and give more hours. cute clothes and friendly management
bad,Worked for the company for almost 15 years. had been through many Store managers. They seemed to be able to keep one in a store for long period of time.
bad,"Not family oriented, focus to much on store instead of it;s associates. Did not hold associates accountable for actions. Not a fun work place to work."
bad,"management there is really poor. After leaving that place they put it as me getting fired when i had informed them I was putting in my two weeks. Manager was really rude and unprofessional when he told me ""Karma will get back at you"" for leaving the job."
bad,"I was under age when i started working there so my pay wasn't that good, but it was fun alwaysing having something to do. I worked seasonal and it got pretty busy some days which helped make the day go by faster. Overall it was a okay first job, wouldn't go back though."
bad,"it's an okay job. the work is really for a male, they work the females like their man. you're paid decent. you get 2 paid 30 minute breaks which I think isn't enough overall its okay just a man type of job."
bad,"Working at Kohl's could be a good first job to work around student hours and gain some experience, however, the environment can be somewhat toxic and stressful, and the compensation is not as high as one would need in order to live comfortably without a second job."
bad,It's a great job if you don't have a lot of bills or need full time hours. Management sucked. I told them I had another part time job and needed certain days off because of the other job. They scheduled me anyway and pointed me because I couldn't work it or find someone to cover my shift.
bad,Honestly this was one of the first and worst jobs ever. Management will trash you if you accidently do something wrong. Pay isn't worth and you're better off treating this as a summer job. or Holiday work.
bad,"much of my time was spent folding clothes and stocking shelves. many of the managers were wonderful people, but the environment was very dreary and melancholy."
bad,"i worked mostly almost every day, looked over 2 sections. helped in the online kiosk and even helped in the back warehouse for a while."
bad,"no full time only management gets full time and hours was not to great as well, cold early morning to do freight was not fun and they didnt make it fun (some supervisor`s) as well(some time they would get pizza after begging employees to pick up early feight shifts)"
bad,Managers are not interested at all on what you have to say. Customer service is non existent and training is pretty poor. Co workers are not very helpful.
bad,seasonal was really fast paced all the long term employes would call off and then you would be understaffed at seasonal time which lead to running around the store trying to pick up the slack
bad,"Kohl's is a company lost in its identity.  They just don't know who they are and therefore as a leader you don't know which way to jump.  Goals are set, they are achievable, but management doesn't care if they are achieved the right way.  My direct supervisor encourage dishonest tactics in achieving credit goals.  My personal integrity just would not allow me to continue with this company.  Loved my store, loved my employees.  Hopefully the corporate leadership will find their way soon."
bad,I thank Kohl's for giving the opportunity  to work for them at the time I  had just started my college classes  and I  need the  income so I  admire the of them.
bad,"when  minimum wage went up my pay stayed the same.  After being a supervisor for 3 years in 3 states my manager didnt think i deserved any kind of raise. I made barely $.20 more than the wage pt employees made.  I worked 40 hours a week, was constantly apply for other positions that newer employees would get.  I was just unable to climb the ladder at this store.  My other managers were all about assisting me in getting more out of Kohls, but these managers were stale."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"My experience with Kohls was bittersweet. Some of the team members there were awesome and I am still friends with to this day and others were terrible and rude to coworkers and customers.The good Co-workers and the customers were really the only thing that could get you through any day here. Management was really weird. Really good 02 but everyone else seemed to be really confused. We were really understaffed because the environment was so bad that they couldn't keep employees. There were some days where i would have to help unload truck, then go merchandise(putting things away from the truck), while merchandising I would have to help the customers because there was no employee on the floor, and I would also have to help at register all while being payed $9.30. I have nothing against going above and beyond in your work but doing everyone's job while getting payed less than all other employees is just annoying."
bad,I started working here and it was all fine until the manager got fired and a new lady took over. She was rude to me because I was the youngest there and I worked under her for a while until I just couldn't handle it anymore and I left to find a different job that makes me happy.
bad,"The only bad thing that I did not like about  working at this place was that at the end of every night, right after closing, all employees were giving a department to zone(clean up.) I did not have a problem zoning my area, but the downfall was people would take way too long  to zone their area. We were not allowed to leave until the entire store was zoned. This caused us to leave a lot later than we should have left."
bad,"Kohls is always understaffed and busy, so every shift you're doing the work of three people, and the sales associates that do show up for the shift barely do their job, so you're left to clean up after them. You're expected to do way too much for how little you're paid. If you're an employee who actually does their job, you get walked on. This job is not worth minimum wage."
bad,"long day w/o having something to drink"
bad,"Kohl's has great company values; however, a lot of people in management do not go by these values. It's a very corporate environment so development & training is fair, but you will not feel ownership & are micromanaged."
bad,"By far the worst place I ever worked. Management was awful. Especially the store manager. He's a bully and talks down on the other workers. They has there picks on who they like & who gets the hours. Besides that, coworkers made it fun."
bad,"Always talk about work-life balance but not the case. Threats to job causing stress."
bad,The position is about what one would expect. It is retail work so it is not exactly the most enjoyable employment. The shifts can be slow or fast depending on the day.
bad,"Management was horrible, Its a good job for teens still in highschool. Its was very stressful at the time. I didnt like how competitive the job was. It was hard to sell the credit cards."
bad,It was fun working at Kohls but some of the managers took thinhs too far sometimes over abusing their authority but for the most part it was a fun learning experience
bad,Working here is fine you get a great discount. The employees were fine they just had no respect for your availability and would constantly call me in and disregarded the fact that I was in high school.
bad,"It was an ok place. Too many roosters in the hen house, and the main rooster was a pathetic excuse of a manager... but the others were awesome! Most of the people were awesome to work with, but some were less than desirable..."
bad,This job is very strenuous and completely useless past the age of 21. No career advancement along with terrible management with a bunch of pointless duties. This is a great job to have short-term but you will get stuck after a couple of months.
bad,"-a typical day at work is organizing"
bad,We never got out at 10 like we were suppose to because we had to clean the store before we all left. It was at least 11:30 or 12 before we got out of there.
bad,"I was a hired to work seasonal, I like the fast pace. I worked mostly as customer service but I also was put P.O.S., point of sale, this was the cash register also fast pace."
bad,If you can sell their credit cards you could get a better sales job elsewhere and if you can keep up with the pace of customer service position you could get a better customer service position elsewhere.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working at the warehouse. I only stayed because that was my only option at the time. It is very hard and stressful work. Very repetitive. I would not recommend this job to anyone, unless you were desperate."
bad,the workplace at Kohls is very stressful ...sometimes there wasnt enough work to keep busy to maintain their quota for the workers to keep...then its the employees fault when they dont make quota
bad,I was paid minimum wage to deal with frustrated customers 24/7.  It was very slow paced most days. The only busy days were close to Christmas and Black Friday.
bad,"i was a picker at kohl's warehouse, and sometimes i had to do replenish, which means that i had to cut boxes up and put the items to where they belong. my job and what i had to do was not that bad it was fast and easy."
bad,warehouse job that was just seasonal. Not that bad if you life hand stacking product inside of a truck. Not really that hard of work but definitely physical work
bad,"retail is bad enough as it is, this place is terrible to work at and not to mention super boring. They never accommodated my schedule for school and they pick favorites."
bad,The thing this company cares about the most is getting customers to sign up for credit cards for discounts.  Required to meet a daily quota per person and per store
bad,New management was unsuccessfull make you do too much work because small payroll management was clueless and had pets who got better hours and tons of promotions for family
bad,kohls doesn't give you enough hours ..They prefer you to work split shifts ..very hard to work and spend time with family and lives ones..They are not understanding or flexible
bad,I was able to work for this company for over 8 years and I never was able to get a full week vacation we only got a raise of a few cent's and I mean a few. The way they took people who have worked for the company for over 10 years they lose all of their vacation and personal time.The number one manager that we had was just our right rude me working for the company for so long we had become family she changed all that.Would I go back sure do I miss it yes all the time I had to let the job go due to my health.
bad,its just not a good place to work at times. has a lot of lazy supervisors It's not a lot of team work going on in there. but the work is easy and simple.
bad,"fast paced"
bad,"It was so long ago I don't really remember. I do remember that the management staff was very underwhelming, and as a customer now I think they continue to go downhill. It should be a nice department store but they are so poorly taken care of it feels like you're in goodwill."
bad,very hard workplace to attend to daily due to manger changing work schedule a day before the shift. have to constantly check for changes and new required demands.
bad,Great for those who do  not rely on this job as a primary source of income. The store needs better management and needs to care about employees more...
bad,the job was always neat and organize but they treated us not the right way.i was a shipping clerk only work for 4 hours on weekends. very poor hours. it wasnt fit for me for a 19 yr old lady
bad,they make it sound to be such a great company to work for however it is very demanding and stressful - they are all about the numbers they do not care if employees are tired and worn out an tired or if they get hurt
bad,"Pay was very poor at the time . I had the highest credit card sign ups , not enough hours or pay. At the end of day you had to clean up so good or you can't go home. They don't get enough people working."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Just don't do it to yourself. Very stressful, no training, managers suck. Too big of a store. the most enjoyable part was leaving after my shift was over."
bad,It was very basic. Just simple retail. There wasn't to much to it. I liked not having to much pressure while i was attending school. It was a basic job to appreciate while going to school.
bad,Nice work environment. Had great benefits for part time and full time employees. Work with great co workers and great attitudes shown everyday at work.
bad,"I was great at my job, I love working there, but they keep on setting up employees to fail there job. So some days we are crowded and other days we are not crowed with customers. I have learned a lot from kohl's. The hardest part of being with kohl's is getting people to get their credit card."
bad,"work was decent. "
bad,"A typical day at work at Kohls would be like any other retail stores. I would start off by going to my designated area which was the shoe department and housewares department. I would maintain the departments, re-stock and replenish the products and provide customer service. Go-backs were an everyday thing. I would also answer phone calls when customers would ask if a product would be in store and cover for cashiers when we would get more busy."
bad,"I worked as seasonal, and the managers were rude when you asked for help. They trained me on the registers for about 30 minutes and then I was on my own. I really don't recommend this place because the management sucks. They also wanted you to nag people to get the kohl's credit card, they wanted you to atleast ask 2 to 3 times even if the customer didn't want it when they were asked the first time. That is another thing that makes me not even want to go to that place. So I wouldn't recommend working here, but if you dont mind any of that stuff then it would be a decent job."
bad,"Kohl's is an okay place to work. You don't get paid enough for all the hard work that you put into it. They are very flexible with working around your schedule, as long as, you remember to request those days off."
bad,The manager only gave raises to her friends and family that worked at the store. Same went with days off and holidays. Manager did not leave her office too often
bad,Management really doesn't enforce people to work there aren't really any goals.. So you show up to work and there's either people that work or just sit in the sitting room no one really cares.
bad,I didn't enjy working there but others may. I tho management was way to serious with the employees and very strict... Training was alittle to fast and thenwhat being left alone..
bad,"Underpaid for the work asked, very stressful fast paced retail position with not a lot of direction career wise, somewhat uncontrolled environment management wise and not so diverse age and race wise. Some days I was shipping freight, some days I was setting up displays, some days I was folding towels and clothes. I did not feel credited for the work I did everyday, I felt like efforts were not worth it a lot of the time."
bad,"It was okay at first, but the hours were inconsistent. Some days were extremely busy, while others were very slow. Managers cut hours frequently, depending on sales."
bad,"Your working hours never limited , management - there is no management  . Survive yourself no one will be there to guide you. Reach to top management if you need to work.  Learning and work not  limited , if  you are recognized by someone you are lucky, there will be 20 guys to report against you ."
bad,"•	Perform fueling in safe and efficient manner to "
bad,"This was a really easy job. Consisted of unloading the trucks and sorting out the merchandise. Then once that was done, go thru the go backs and see what else needed to be done on the floor."
bad,I only worked two days in one week then I wasn't even scheduled the following week then back for two days 2 weeks later. my 1st check was $132 then it went down to $75 weekly
bad,"I loved my job here before the new manager showed up. The people are wonderful to work with and become your family. The work is tough but worth it if you feel valued. I would not recommend anyone to work at the Waco Kohls under its current management. The store manager creates a cut throat environment and all the good people end up quitting. "
bad,Management did not take enough time to train me. Where I worked it was easy but at the register it did not go well. My pin number was lost and I couldn't get there messages anymore. Their co-workers were cold and it was an uncomfortable job all around for me.
bad,Everyone that worked here was very cold toward one another. Managers were not interested in progressing me nor were my co workers. Boring atmosphere and pointless duties.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,If you like organized chaos.  Two many people provide direction.  Management is unappealing . Scheduling is inconsistent .  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians
bad,Working as a floor associate you are required to make sure signs are up to date on sales. As well as make sure the racks look neat. the dressing rooms should be clean and the clothes should not be in any of the dressing rooms. Your required to answer any questions a customer may have as well as see if you can find what the customer is looking for and if it is not at this location try to call other locations. Kohl's policy is the customer is always right and try to live up to that expectation and go above and beyond. Sometimes you may be able to take a break but most of the time not likely if there is too many people in the break room. If there are not enough people registers you will be required to ring people's purchases and make sure you tell them about kohls charge card and the upcoming sales.
bad,"Maintaining and organizing 4 separate fitting rooms, customer service, point of sale, restocking and organizing floor displays, unloading, organizing, and restocking truck shipments, store opening and closing duties, and maintaining store cleanliness and organization. Provided great experience in working in a group/team environment. Kohl's was a very difficult job in terms of store maintenance. There was a lack of order in the way store recovery and fitting rooms were managed. the workplace culture was mostly negative. Day to day people did not seem happy working there."
bad,"it's not a good place to work in my opinion. Even though the hours were good, the pay was horrible and when I went away to college I thought I'd be pointless to drive all the way from there for minimum wage."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working here because of the limited staff. There were too many tasks put on one person and it felt like nothing was ever completed. Black Friday was the worst, because of the lack of staff."
bad,Nothing nice to say about this company. I worked part-time and hardly got any hours. They only want you to work when they need you to. Management is a joke.
bad,Coworkers and working with the public was Great. Management not so great. Work schedules are done on line. They were never correct. Favoritism with upper management and employees who are late every shift. Do not do there jobs correctly. Even after associates put in a complaint to on site management and Corporate offices.
bad,They work very well with your personal life to compensate to everyones changing needs. You can change your availability as often as needed with school schedules for college.
bad,Cash office customer service backroom pricing online order processing shopping and shipping items customers order working on truck line helping customers
bad,Never gave you the feeling of self approval and pride. Never felt good enough and they were very messy with their managment. Never fet that I had a chance there at all.
bad,"I go in and recover juniors, men's or women's at night. Clean out dressing rooms all night, and I fold down the department I work that evening. might help a customer on the phone line."
bad,"As an intern look forward to this opportunity, started great with training and development and received critical information at half way and strictly adhered to that advice. Then received same exact information at end on what I needed to work on and realized second half of internship mgt. did not care and only worried about their conflict with in the DC and there own personal gains. Only true and caring managers worked in the Maintenance and Security departments."
bad,worked over night it was alright to work there. great people to work with at night. had my own team made my own schedules. but i was very tired when i left work.
bad,I semi enjoyed my time there but they do have there fauts. They have a lot of favoritism and they may not be the easiest company to work for but who is ?
bad,"A typical work day included working at the register and keeping up the maintenance of the merchandise. It also included trying to get customers to apply for a Kohls charge card which almost seems impossible at times because the majority of customers that shop there already have or have had a card. Each credit we earned would be an extra dollar on our paycheck. When it wasn't holiday season the hours were terrible. the amount of credits you earned also made a difference in the amount of hours they would schedule you to work, meaning that the more credits you got, the more hours they would give you. Something of which many of us saw as not being fair. You can not force someone to apply for a credit card and once again, the majority of customers that are regulars already have one anyways. That was probably the hardest part of the job. I also feel that the work place was not very professional. They tell you not to dress too casual such as jeans and a t shirt on a regular basis, but many people still did it and they said nothing about it. the only thing that really made it enjoyable to work here were my fellow coworkers."
bad,I wold come in and open the registers everyday. I would clean and make sure everything and all the registers are ready to go for the day. I would count the money daily.
bad,The management team is very unhelpful. The pay is very low with very low raises. They don't have enough scheduled staff to perform the daily tasks asked of their employees.
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's begins with being pushed to earn the managers credit cards and ends with being told you have to earn more. Hours can be taken away or given based on customer surveys. Often times bad surveys are received from rude customers that were in a bad mood when they came into the store, then blame employees for their expired coupon not working. It is not an enjoyable workplace."
bad,I was just a cashier. I stop working their because managers were very rude and when i needed assistance they were take forever which made customer's upset.It just wasn't a environment that i wanted to be around.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"If you are looking for a job with lots of physical activity and good pay, this is a good fit.  Peak season offers plenty of income--save it, you will need it when the season is slow."
bad,"Although the management and communication were possibly the worst I have ever been introduced to, I learned a lot about retail service and customer service at the department store."
bad,"I don't like retail.It was a short lived dream. So I end up leaving. Life wasn't worth the chaos of fighting fabric wars. Working in retail made me realize how much I actually hate shopping. It made me appreciate that I was the type of person to get in, try things, kinda put them back and be out."
bad,While I was there I thought we should be given more hours to work and more pay for our work. they did not give us a lot of hours. And we didn't get enough pay.
bad,"Typical day involves putting out the latest fire or dealing with the squeaky wheel.  Management tends to favor men for leadership positions or females that have no children.  I have put in many hours of hard work and every time I am told knock this out of the park and you'll get the next promotion.  Still waiting on that and all my hours and hard work have gotten me is more work, less appreciation."
bad,"You come in and do the job they trained you for. While I went out of my way to learn a lot they do not tend to cross train you unless desperate. "
bad,"I only worked seasonal, but you don't really know what your job title is! I didn't feel very secure in this job setting. People were flying in and out all the time!!"
bad,"Kohls is a very faced paced and sometimes stressful environment."
bad,"Help prep store for Grand Opening. Learned retail and store operation methods, and well as sales techniques. Advanced Customer Service knowledge."
bad,i learned how to do material handling which is working at a warehouse and driving forlift. also I learned how to tape boxes the right way.ive worked at fedex which was my first warehouse job.
bad,"When I worked there, your hours were based on the Kohl's card sales, if you made a lot of them, they'd give you all of the hours you could ask for."
bad,"i got paid the minimum of minimum wage to be scheduled for what i thought was decent closing shifts. 6-close etc. too bad the till close part ended at whatever time they felt fit, employees who were scheduled to close would be responsible to stay and clean up the departments in the store till sometimes 3 am or whenever they decided enough was enough for the night. i did this for many nights and it never changed."
bad,I didn't really enjoy the environment I was working in. There wasn't a lot of diversity. I'm actually open to the different types of backgrounds you can come across especially in the work world. My schedule wasn't the best and managment could've been better.
bad,The managers were horrible and extremely lazy would add extra work on top of work you haven't finished when it was supposed to be done by them ! Overall it's an okay job
bad,"It wasn't the greatest place. Not much hours, others wouldn't do their job. Would hire way too many people, so you got even less hours then before. But did work with some pretty cool people."
bad,"People can be petty and immature with behavior/attitude. "
bad,"Does not play very well."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Kohls is a great work environment, while the hours are not great you get to meet amazing people. At kohls I learn how to be a team player and work with others. It also push me to make peronal goals and believe in my self."
bad,"Poor communication within management, high turnover of employment. disorganized scheduling for employees and lacking consideration for employees needs some of the time."
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's was spending 12 hours on your feet, picking and packing orders"
bad,"I went to work did my job to the best of my ability without causing or distracting others, this is a company where you may want to just do your job and keep to yourself"
bad,"the store taught me how to work, and what it takes to maintain a job."
bad,Met a lot of great people however had a lot of management.  This caused a lot of approvals to get ideas into production.  Everyone on a personal level treated each other like family.
bad,"Unless you want rude managers, and rude co-workers, do not work here. This place is a stressful environment and i could not handle it"
bad,The store management was terrible. They were ruining actually like upper management said too. That might sound good but it meant we spent most of our time instead of helping customers we were moving large racks all over the store which meant the store was hard to keep track of and even employees couldn't find what they needed. I don't know how any one could find anything.
bad,"Busy, sometimes hard work. "
bad,"hours were ok, scheduling could have been better. never got our schedules till the day before the new week.  It was hard to schedule appt. around this.  Management could have used more training in their positions, to better run a successful store."
bad,"Great place to work for in developing yourself as a professional , there is  a slight difficult room for growth . Management needs developing as well ."
bad,"This was not the type of work I would like to do again. "
bad,"I worked as a cashier. Even though I enjoyed helping the customers,  management  was terrible. There was only one manager that I liked but the rest of them were rude and inconsiderate to their employees. They had a really bad attitude. I would consider working for Kohl's again but not at that location."
bad,Kohls Department Store has Management that actually harasses employees over the Kohls Credit Cards. Rude Employees as well.
bad,The amount of money you are paid isn't worth it.  Consistently feel under appreciated and under paid. Raises consist of cents rather then dollars.
bad,Kohls is a fun and easy going place to work but they have no structure within the work place and work tasks. They provide low pay and minimal to barely any hours.
bad,"extremely stressfull and micro managed."
bad,was lied to buy management and my suggestions for a better work place were used by someone else. everything i was promised did not happen.
bad,I learned how to stock things in their correct spot. The hardest part about the job was waking up at 12 every morning. The thing i most enjoyed was getting paid every week.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Customers can be difficult to deal with. Some days are slow, some are really busy. Low wage, low hours. Difficult to advance."
bad,"A typical day at KOHLS was i would punch in, grab a phone walk to my department and star zoning. I would walk through my department and made sure everything was in order. The hardest part of the job was probably that there was only one person per department at times and it was a little hard to help more than one customers at a time and answering calls as well. The most enjoyable was when i had some help that way no customers was disappointed."
bad,my co workers were amazing people to me but the hours and my salary wasn't cutting it for me I have 2 babies & I live by myself the amount of bills I have to pay are out of this world.
bad,"Told on hire that if you are not liked you will not receive hours"
bad,fun place to work at times...not enough pay and bad benefits.Managers are bad.To much focus on credits than on customers and neatness of store.
bad,You are constantly helping customers that need your assistances. You don't get acknowledge for the things you do. The management team was not supportive.
bad,"wasn't the worst place to work.  got sick because of unforeseen weather,  they don't supply raincoats or anything like that for maintenance, which they get the stores carts.  got sick because of that had to miss work, was fired cause I was sick too long."
bad,Stayed at 7.25 for the longest. The work environment was filled with favoritism. Managers cared more about credits then your own happiness. Lunches are to short.
bad,"I mostly cashiered, counting money, and making sure that my register had a sufficient amount of money. I also helped with the fitting rooms and keeping the sales floor looking nice."
bad,"The experience with any so-called discount retailer is often the same. Meager profit margins favor the investors and customers over actual employees, resulting in under-staffing, customers outnumber workers dozens to one, and a melee environment out on the sales floor. There are cheapskate customers who want their already-discounted merchandise for free, frequent theft, common use of counterfeit money, and abuse the customer service policy of ""yes we can"" with airy claims of having left 30% off coupons at home, etc. Not for those expecting to move up the ladder, or pay average bills. Disheartening on the best days, and other employees are catty and dramatic like it's high school again."
bad,I enjoyed my job here. I had some awesome co-workers. I ran the Home and Kids Departments and always had a busy productive day.
bad,early morning off work by a nice time learned more safety skills and how to work as a team also patience. My boss was fare. Putting up stock in stock room was the hardest the most enjoyable part of job was unloading truck
bad,I assisted customers in finding product. I cashiered when I was needed to do so. I help put product on the sales floor as well as helped maintain a clean store. it was quite challenging to keep the dressing rooms cleaned. I loved working in that kind of environment.
bad,"As far as the employees it was a nice place to work everyone was willing to help, but it lack structure severely. I need a more stability with my hours and training."
bad,The management there was very disrespectful and rude.They weren't professional and they made employees feel uncomfortable.
bad,I loved working here in the beginning but was made many promises that didn't come true! One manager will tell you one thing then you'll get reprimanded by another manager for doing what was asked of you from the previous. The communication is awful and you cant bring anything up to management without repercussion!
bad,"Retail is not for me. Use to enjoy going to work, new management started and the store started to fall apart. Great people work at kohls and mainly thats why I stuck around."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"This is a company that doesnt make any sense. It also does not promote learning or at least teaching people who need to be trained, to make it anywhere I had to teach myself."
bad,"On a typical shift I would work evenings, which are much slower than day shifts. So I would clean all the registers and tidy up the point of sale area in between waiting for customers. I got along with every one of my co-workers, the only dilemma that ruined the job for me was the management. Most of the higher management positions were filled with individuals who aren't outgoing people. I learned how to do price changes, and got pretty good at helping people sign up for Yes2You rewards cards as well as trying for a Kohl's charge. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to socialize on a professional level."
bad,Management is tough on employees to ensure great customer service. Did not enjoy the atmosphere so much and Rude costumers.
bad,"I did not work for kohls very long, it was a very organized company. Being a manager i realized there management was no where to be found most of the time, i find this very unprofessional. Did not talk much to other co-workers which was something i wasn't used to. The best part of the job was the fact you got so many breaks after a certain amount of time, and you work more at your own pace."
bad,"I have been working at Kohl's for the last 2 years. It started out okay, but after the first year, working there started to become harder and harder. Management does not communicate at all with the other associates. Management also is clique-ish. They have their own little group and if they do not like you, you will not get many hours. Those who work hard and actually do their job get overlooked."
bad,"a typical day would include retagging items, processing credit card payments."
bad,"I was hired with 6 other people, there are now 3 of those people left  after 1 month. They fired  1 lady after her 3rd day on register. Manager called her away and there were alot of people in line. Poor woman, didn't know what to do. They hired a 6 month pregnant woman, gone after 2wks.???  Why hire her????  Another lady came on letting them know up front she would be having knee surgery, dr. says only 4 hrs. per day. They scheduled her for 5 1/2 hrs. She as well should never have been hired. They work you SO HARD for minimum wage. One lady there 1 yr., said they said she only produced avg. job because she was not good at  customer service, extremely good at merch. and replenish. SHE GOT A 16 CENT RAISE!!!!!!!! Several people I have talked  to are looking. Good luck to them. My son works down the street and makes over $9.00 working fast food restaurant.Promotions- will you get POSSIBLY a $1.00 raise for ALL the responsiblity of your large dept. Always pushing. Management- like only half as they look out for their cash register people. Others get mad if you ask for your break or lunch. Once I was made to wait 40 minutes for my lunch and I was suppose to leave then 50 minutes later. Associates working there, most total sweet hearts, as only some management good as they cannot get ALL their ducks in a row on how to deal with employees or what the rules are. I have given my highest work ethic for them, but I see no future or pay for what you are worth, and I and everyone else are worth more than $8.00 per hour. I have thoroughly enjoyed customer service to people coming in the"
bad,"working at register, pressing clothes and balancing draw. What the clothes cleaning business was really like. The management was a friend of mine's sister, but really strict. co-workers were also friends so that worked out fine. The hardest part of job was working in the heat in the summer. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility."
bad,working the sales for dealing with customers question and concerns . also checking customer out also answering phones any attending to customers over the telephone
bad,"kept up on the mens department, made sure all go backs were put away and helped customers, also would help out on register when they needed back up"
bad,"worse job ive ever had!!!"
bad,"In my experience in this company a lot of new hires every month had to be brought in to replace people leaving the job. People left the posistion many time to seek full-time employment or higher wadges. The management team was flexable on the number of credit card applications that the cahiers got although even in slow selling periods the credit card goals were still set pretty high. With daily goals as high as 4-6 application goals a day for some associates. These cards were a tough sell due to the high interest rates and high overdue balance fees. In addition the only time a cashier is allowed to leave register is to go to break, lunch, clock-out, or restroom. However, to go to the restroom could mean waiting for relief and up to 30 minutes sometimes longer to be relieved to go to the restroom. Also when it was time to clockout one had to wait until the next person came and relived them even if the person was late."
bad,There was no room for advancement.  Typical day started by letting all personnel into the building for the days jobs. Did learn a little bit about inventory. The co-workers were just okay. The hardest part of the job was the truck traffic. The best part was the interaction with the other employees
bad,"I walked the floor daily to ensure a  friendly and inviting customer experience.  I made sure the truck process was completed on time and the merchandise was delivered to the sales floor sized and organized.  The associates and management team was fun to work wit,.  they all worked very hard.  The understaffing of the store was the hardest part."
bad,"This job was easy, but does not offer much career advancement.  They were very flexible with my hours"
bad,"working at shoes department, stock shoes, cleaning the shelves to put new shoes, answering clients questions"
bad,company could not keep operational equipment required to complete our jobs. Hours were always given to workers with more seniority & I needed more.
bad,A typical day at work is fast paced really enjoyable.. co-workers are good management needed help...
bad,"A typical day at kohl's beings with helping my customers, to make sure they are happy and find what they need, either in the store or online. What i learned while working at kohl's is how I can brighten up someone's day just by helping them and how to be a team leader when needed. My co-workers are the best everyone is nice and we always get the job done. The hardest part of my job is around holidays when customers  come in and have the store looking a mess and sometimes we have to stay over longer just to clean up. The most thing i enjoyed about my job is interacting with my customers, i love to make them smile and know that i am doing a good job by helping them."
bad,started working at 32 hours and with 3 months wen down to 6 hours a week
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"not a lot of available hours"
bad,"sales, fitting rooms,this company is very energrtic but im looking for more hours 40 or more."
bad,I was a cashier and sales floor associate. I got to meet customers face to face and make people smile. I learned how to submit credit applications and what it takes to have customer service skills even under the unfortunate circumstances. The hardest part was having to satisfy and unsatisfied customer. The most enjoyable was satisfying an unsatisfied customer.
bad,"2008 – Present  |  Kohl’s  |  Austell, Georgia"
bad,"•	Greet customers as they enter/ exit the store"
bad,absolutely hated this job. Cleaned up after people all day long non stop.
bad,had a good experience where is the first year and a half and the last year too is been bad since they got a new management.loved some of the people that i worked with.
bad,"There is a reason that I'm currently looking for a different job. They have a saying at work, ""Here at Kohl's..."". Well, here at Kohl's, the only way that you can really get the maximum satisfaction out of your job, is if you can sell the credit. Get people to sign up, nearly double your ""daily goal"", and you're set for life. You'll get tons of hours, the E3's, Supervisors and Managers will love you and you'll get tons of extra incentive on your paycheck for each sign up you receive."
bad,hardest part of this job is not having the hours to complete work.
bad,This was a nice place to work for that fit my school schedule. the discount helped during christmas time. lol!
bad,"Working for Kohl's itself was nice however, management had a lack of communication and was very unorganized."
bad,"A typical work day at Kohl's is to check in and go to your register. Be ready to smile and provide great customer service. Make sure you offer them the specials for the day, promote the Kohl's Charge Credit card, and encourage customers to sign up for Kohl's email.  Some days involve one working in other place of the store, like helping out in various departments whether that is putting clothes away or helping a customer find an item in the store. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help the customer. All you can do is you best, and to leave your customer highly satisfied."
bad,"I was a cashier. I had to solicit for the KOHL'S charge card. I was okay doing this until, our hours were linked with how many charge card applications we were able to get filled out. So in the previous week if you only had 10 completed applications, then the next week you only received 10 hours. There was little room growth and even lateral changes in positions.  Pay was minimum wage."
bad,"I did not like working there and was pleased when they did not offer me a position after the season was over.  One manager in particular, whom I dealt with daily, was not helpful and she always seemed angry.  However, the people I worked with were great and always a big help."
bad,As a cashier here my job was not limited to just cashiering but stock and advertising. We promote different items and bonus points and credit cards. The distance was challenging but possible for the right hours or pay. The store was over employed causing less hours for everyone. Travel took 1 hour and work took 3 hours.
bad,i worked nights preparing for the following days ad then did cashiering and also floor personnel
bad,"I work for the Kohl's in Covington, Louisiana .  I found them extremely disorganized and extremely  poor communication.  There was never enough help and the store manager lacks empathy and barked at the associates all the time.  I was constantly called in on my days off which I did not mind.  I feel if the associates were treated better by the store manager and one of the assistant store managers the problem would not have been as bad.  The store manager constantly berates people with hurry up. Basically all you do is put merchandise out on the floor and straighten up. Constantly being told to do different things by different people and no clear expectations. There was no real customer service concept.  There were many good managers and associates and I greatly appreciated working with them.  I really worked hard there, and really do not think they appreciated anything or at least some of the managers.  I really could not recommend this Kohl's for anyone seeking employment."
bad,"not a great store.terrible management"
bad,"I have fully learned how to handle customer service responsibilities and returns. Co-workers in customer service, for the most part, were friendly and fun. Most, if not all, the managers have no idea what they are doing half the time. Such a horrible lack of communication between managers and managers and employees. Hardest part of the job is being attacked by nasty customers who are mad about their return. The best part was the computer work."
bad,work with good co workers . learn how to interact better with people by working with sales . managment was a good team . very polite
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Kohls E-commerce facility while a very human resource driven company especially to associates often gave the appearance of having weak senior leadership
bad,"Typical day at work was greeting customers, and asking the Manager what was on the agenda for the day. The co-workers were okay. The hardest part of the job was doing multiple things at once without any assistance."
bad,"the job is very organizational but, I am just a cashier that works part time. Management places you in all parts of the store but you do not move up because of skill you move up based on the number of credit applications made. So you have to have good persuasive skills to get off cash register because you must convince the customer to apply for the credit card. your pay doesn't differ on what position you are in the store unless its management but it does over a long period of time."
bad,"The management was not available when I needed help.  There was a lot of favortism.  The ones who were favored were advanced and would take 45 minute breaks instead of a half an hour. "
bad,"Process payroll, data entry.  I learned about retail.  The hardest part of my job was the lack of support I received on a daily basis with projects.  Most enjoyable was interacting with co-workers and learning about retail and everything it takes to run a large department store."
bad,Had a lot to get done and not much help. Had to keep front of store by register clean. always had to pick close up ring customers out.
bad,I liked working there because of my fellow co workers but the management is unethical and is not a good atmosphere because of the managers. They cross too many lines.
bad,"Very fast paced, but also management really did not take the time to hear about worker concerns."
bad,"I got hired a few months ago for their Logistics department working freight, backroom, sales, etc. Besides two days of computer based orientation, the lack of training is dumbfounding. No one cares about job security because of hours. I got hired as part-time working a steady 20-30hrs. Then, the following week I'll get 4hrs. The management, or lack there of, is mediocre. Although employees appear helpful, if it isnt their department they say ask someone else."
bad,"This job was a fun fast paced job, I enjoyed helping customer & making sure everything was up to their satisfactory "
bad,it was ok but the management could be better otherwise a great work atmosphere and great team.
bad,I did not really enjoy this job. Which is why I looked for another job so quickly. The only thing I enjoyed about this job was the discount. I did get along with most of my co-workers.
bad,I worked there from day one. In the beginning it was great. As time it changed and increasingly got worst. 
bad,This job was a waste of time. Never had any available hours and cancelled work shifts after scheduled time.
bad,"The pay was low and the hours were minimal."
bad,"A typical day of work at Kohl's Department Store was hectic, unorganized, and unsatisfying. As a former full- time associate, I would be scheduled part- time shifts or less. Management at Kohl's was constantly changing; therefore, preventing both a strong communication and bond between associate and leader in administration. The co-workers in different departments were divided amongst each other and the effort to interact was slim to none. The only interaction that seemed interesting for my co-workers was gossip. The hardest part of my job was my supervisor's negative attitude and condescending tone. The most enjoyable part of the job was the bond between me and two other associates that made working there bearable. My experience at Kohl's enabled me to learn how to communicate with a range of people from hostile to impractical effectively and professionally. I also learned how to be efficient under stressful circumstances and manage my time properly. "
bad,"I was extremely unhappy more often than not in my 5.5 years at Kohl's. The management was typically elitist and  loyalty was not valued. Customers were often rude and when the store fell short of their expectations it was taken out on the employees. Positive occurrences, such as meeting goals, were rarely praised and associates could never meet the ever changing expectations. Training for new associates was atrocious and it fell on the veteran associates to fill in the gaps.  "
bad,A typical day at Kohl's would be running recovery and making the floor presentable. I would help customers and great customer service was a must. The most enjoyable part was helping with merchandising and learning new areas. 
bad,My typical day would be to come in start recovery and get fitting rooms tidy. Help any customers that need assistance. The job was very easy and my coworkers were wonderful. I didn't make enough here to make ends meet at home so unfortunately had to take another position. I learned a great deal about retail working here.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Working for Kohls was always hectic and exhausting. I imagine any retail job would be the same. My coworkers were more focused on each other's lives rather than getting work done. Managers made us work hard without the compensation
bad,Typical day at work is just putting up clothing and folding. Usually there are not enough people working (especially for the night shift when closing.) and over the Christmas holiday we usually didnt end up going home until 2am. Also almost never get your 15 minute breaks if you are working anything but the register.
bad,"My day consist of assisting customers in the department or over the phone, maintain a clean/well stocked department, and opening store accounts. What I've learned from this company were the basic steps to operate a retail business. I have a great relationship with my coworkers and a fair business relationship with my managers. The hardest part of my job is working to my fullest to keep both customers and managers satisfied. I feel as though it's never enough. I also feel like I put in a lot of work for minimum wage and hardly 30 hours in a week with no benefits. It's a part time job, that can't turn full time, and the hours flex to either working early morning-mid, or working real late. The best part about my job is being around my coworkers. I feel like I could have a good relationship with them outside of work."
bad,"Not well staffed, for on person you were required to maintain reshop on three fitting rooms and putting product back to racks for guests"
bad,"lack of work,this job is for high school/college students not people who have families"
bad,My job was to catch shoplifters and to catch internal theft by employees. I also was in charge of store safety and security.
bad,"clock in, unload truck, stock, and then go home. not much hours, management are simple people, your co workers are decent. the hardest part is lifting alot, the most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers find things."
bad,"Kohls is a great company to work for but there is a large discrepancy between work flow, processes, and management. Department communications across the company are lacking and communication is their largest downfall. Big brother at the company is great, benefits, lunch room, the atmosphere, but it always depends on who you work under. Who you work with is a large reason for good companies being good and the bad being bad. At some point the house of cards might fall. You can be a great member on a team here at this organization but from what I experienced it was very clicky. If you are good at what you do, are a fast learn, are independent as a worker, but can keep good relationships with any personality, this is the place for you."
bad,"nice cool, quiet area, pay was low but had good people and were very quapative"
bad,"holiday season was very hectic and the management wasnt as organized as it should have been at all. the coworkers were fun and great but the pay is HORRIBLE. you will make the bare minimum wage and that's it. it's very hard work with little to show for it. the training we got was minimal, actually none- you had to learn everything on your own."
bad,Looking for something more challenging.
bad,Customers were very rude no matter how you tried to help. I'm very patient an understanding so it was easy for me..
bad,"Working with Kohl's was a pain.I didn't mind working 3 rd shift.It was the schedule.Never the same might be 4 or 1 or no days a week.Some days when scheduled I would show up and be told they cancelled,they couldn't even call."
bad,Inconsiderate managers! Didnt work with my schedule at all
bad,"It’s not too bad if you need some extra cash on the side. But as for management ( all except for one or two supervisors ) and the customers you have to deal with, it is absolutely not worth it. Management is the worst at this location. All they care about is the store. They do not care for your feelings or your health. They often “ compensate “ us with candy and food to forget the fact that they are working us to death. Definitely would not recommend this place if you are looking for a great job."
bad,"The main thing that I did not like was we were always expected to sign people up for their credit card. Really no matter what we were expected to at least ASK if they wanted to. The reward for signing someone up? One dollar. I saw no real reason to sign people up, it took a long time and I always had problems and I do not like advertising something that I do not think that people should have. Being in debt is never a good thing, so I would rather not advertise it. "
bad,They were flexible with hours while i was in school. The staff were fun to work with and helped each other out. Down side was pay. But was good place to work while in school .
bad,"Working at Kohl's was a nerve-racking experience. The management team was unorganized and lacked communication from manager to manager. One supervisor would say one thing, and would immediately be contradicted by an instruction from another supervisor. Seasonal associates were not informed on whether they would be hired permanently, even when management was directly asked about positions."
bad,"I was often expected to keep all of the fitting rooms in multiple departments clean while helping with cashiering.  It was difficult to keep up with, especially when I was starting to suffer from pain issues in my back and hip.  Carrying so much clothes to put back all by myself definitely took a toll on my health and I had to leave the position. The atmosphere was pretty cliquey and as a new worker, I often ate my lunch alone in the staff lounge and didn't get much on-job support from my older coworkers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"You are quickly trained for a few minutes. But not well. I feel abandoned. I was told I was on my own with learning. Management is very mean when I asked how to use a piece of equipment. They don't even know I exist. I just clock in. Find something to do, then go home. usually just recovery and folding since it's all I know what I'm supposed to be doing. No clue if it is right."
bad,When I worked here all they did was complain about not having enough customers sign up for credit applications and try to make you sign up for a credit card too if you were over 18. Honestly though the worst part about this job was that you didn’t get paid very well and would only work twice a week and when you asked for more hours they would work you three weeks straight (that’s not an exaggeration I got told that I got what I asked for and to stop complaining).
bad,"Seriously terrible, awful, don't work for Kohl's. I was hired under the impression I'd be working 8-16 hrs a week as stated in the interview, but was completely mislead and work 25-30hrs as part time. I was hired under home and kids but barely ever work there, people quit by not showing up and I'm constantly the only one who works in an entire department while also managing online pickups. When you try to discuss getting a raise for doing 3 jobs and constantly sprinting around the store because it's understaffed you get told ""that's not how this company works."" Everyday you have available you will be working there, even on days your unavailable they will call you to try and get you to come in. They consistently give people 8hr shifts then give you 8hrs off then you come back and work another 6-8hrs the next day. Half the time you're bored out of your mind the other half 5 of the 10 employees working are sprinting around managing the store and the others are standing around like they're brain dead. Everyone avoids their work and thinks it's everyone else's problem, then they complain about their pay and having to be at work. The only good thing is that the managers are nice ( for the most part) and it's fairly easy to request days off or move a shift back a couple hours. If you can't lift heavy objects this isn't the job for you, or if you can't stand continuously for 6-8 hrs, probably missing your breaks and meal time, this also isn't the job for you."
bad,This place is perfect for older retired people or young kids that need a job. They cut hours based off sale projections for that month so one week you'll get 30hrs the next 4hrs. Not a job for someone that needs constant money flow.
bad,"I took care of my entire department, meaning most of the store, and only received minimum wage. I was expected to do too much for one person, especially for what I was paid. They did not let me take days off that I needed in order to keep my college scholarship. Management is terrible. Scheduling is not flexible. I also worked in ship from store and omni, but I wasn't told beforehand. They just scheduled me for it. Overall, not a good place to work unless it's your first job."
bad,"The people are great to be around, but I got 2 hours of training and then was thrown to the wolves to figure things out on my own. It was so busy and chaotic that no one has the time to properly train you. Too stressful. Stock room is a HUGE mess! Probably fire hazards too."
bad,Pay was a low $9 for the fast pased running around of order selecting. One week I'd work 25 hours and the next 8 hours. AND THAT WAS FULL TIME! . Managers and supervisors avoided helping you out and made you feel dumb for it.
bad,My experience working at the retail store vs working at the warehouse is very different.  I’m currently seasonal and they have no intention of hiring anyone full time.
bad,"hardest part is tags not on product and having to call for department to give you a number or price and the customer being agry at me.  "
bad,"At kohl’s, I was not properly trained to work as an associate. I was primarily hired for seasonal but was kept on after January 1. Afterwards, no help was given to me and I was left lost and confused."
bad,It was a retail position on the floor.  I was hired for the seasonal position with no expectations of employment after Christmas.  No position was offered even though they did hire new associates with no experience after letting the seasonal staff go.  Poor business practice not to at least consider those in seasonal employment for regular employment.
bad,I resigned because I personally had way more potential for what I was doing. My store manager was totally amazing. Same with the assistant store manager. But when it came to supervisors and co-workers; OMG they were all so crabby all the time. You would go in the break room and they all would be complaining. More than half the staff wouldn’t even say “hello” to each other or the customers. No good vibes.
bad,"Not the worst for a first job but pays minimum wage while on average only getting 8-12 hours a week. Managers change regularly and expect them to hound you to your core about getting people to apply for a credit card. You will also have managers allowing customers to walk all over you on a daily basis and letting them get away with things they shouldn't when it comes to getting deals at the register. "
bad,"The manager and assistant manager are both incredibly rude. They train you to work point of sale then put you somewhere else and expect you to be the best immediately. "
bad,"As a seasonal retail associate at Kohl's, I cannot say I had a good experience here. My training was very minimal and I was not set up for success in daily work. Also a strong lack of communication between management and associates."
bad,"Management does not care about its workers , only their customers. they will walk around gossiping/ playing on their phones as you are being overworked . They don’t give you days off you request but will constantly beg you to take on more shifts. Oh and it’s 9 an hour $ .."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Did not like working here at all. Bad management. They give very little training and just throw you out on the floor expecting you to know everything.
bad,Demanding you be pushy with credit sign up.  If they look 18 no matter what they say you need to ask them even when you feel for some reason such as ones who dont understad what they are doing.  Pay is low and benefits are high for good coverage and not to just say you insurance and avoid tax penalty costa lot and lower plans are poor coverage.  Lot of gossip and drama there.  Typical depends what you do.  Always on the go when on the floor.  Sometimes busy at registers not always busy depends on sales usually.  Only fulltime get benefits and PTO.  It is ok for a school kid but have to be 17 or 18 to work there.  Very high turn over.
bad,The job was okay at first but I soon realized the environment of kohl’s is a lot more toxic than I ever imagined. The managers were terrible and the customers could be quite nasty
bad,Everyday I went into work at Kohls and I saw my name under home and kids a piece of me died inside. I hated using the stupid bluebirds but they never worked half of the time anyway. by the end they let me go from my seasonal job and i called out of my last shift so they fired me
bad,Very poor management with poor scheduling. Managers were never around unless the head district was in town. Very lazy atmosphere and employees who ever did their job were never let go.
bad,"Minimum wage, no room for growth, poor management. Good manager got terminated. Management talked poorly about that former manager. Customers and I loved that Manager. Did not get recognized for outstanding service. Force credit on customers.  Kohls does not care about providing great customer service."
bad,Only work here as a side side job.  Some lazy h2s barely helped even while store was busy.  Employees pressured to apply for cards.   Terrible incentives to solicit kohls charges. Uncomfortable environment at times
bad,"I was told there was room for me to work my way up because I had a degree. However, I then heard I wasn't even being considered because I had a family member who worked  there.... Even though there were other families working there together. Then my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I had to call off three days to be at the doctor with her. When I called management said ""well you realize you can never come work here again if you don't come in.""Just didn't feel like I was apart of the kohl's ""family they always went on about. Other than that hours were okay the people were great but overall felt I wasted my time."
bad,"if you are not full time management you do not get benefits. The schedule is very inconsistent, too faced paced sometimes for the pay. Always short staffed."
bad,"Although Kohl's has an overall friendly culture, management at my particular location of Corona North was horrific. Even though I was the head in a department my weekly hours would literally range from 4 to 39; they not only kept me below 40, so I couldn't receive benefits, I had to live in a constant state of financial uncertainty. I loved my time at Kohl's and the friendships I made, but it was impossible to support myself on 4 hour weeks and the stress of not being able to pay my bills was too much."
bad,"Look, working in retail is difficult. Working in retail during the holidays is even more difficult. If you are able to just commit to the process and the fact that your schedule is going to be insane for several months, you can make steady income. "
bad,This job teaches you the basics of customer service and working with coworkers and communicating. It's a good atmosphere and teaches entry level employee's basic career skills.
bad,"Management is young and often inexperienced. Culture for interns is much different than when you start full time. Compensation is the same across all analysts, no matter if one role is much more challenging than another. Completely depends on the team you are on and you have no say in what team you move to. Some teams have a lot of work life balance, some have none, but all are paid the same. No paid recognition for going above and beyond. Very small bonus at the end of the year, even if the company has an amazing year. Hard work is not appreciated in your paycheck."
bad,"In a typical day as a sales associate in misses, juniors and mens, I would basically clean fitting rooms for hours on end. This was kind of terrible because some customers are very disrespectful and its a mess, especially during peak hours. I would also take phone calls to my department, which is fine. Phone calls would also come from other stores which was the worst because they want you to look for something they know you won't be able to find. I would also work the register which was the only good part about working there, and this happened for maybe an hour out of my day (if you work fitting rooms you don't get to work the register). I learned that working in retail is a terrible experience and it is not for me. Management at my particular store (on Alpine in Comstock Park) was honestly terrible because they were not understanding. The hardest part of the job was not wanting to sit in the empty fitting rooms and cry for hours on end."
bad,"Have nothing to contribute, apply and interview self explanatory, was a season position thanks."
bad,"Where do I start? I worked here part time for a few years while I was going to college. They were pretty good about giving you the days  and times that you want to work whether you're a student or not. What sucks, which is just a part of retail, is that hours vary depending on how busy the store is. After December, hours drop. Hours sucked so much during the holidays when the store closes at midnight or stayed open 24 hours a day for like a week. They're really pushy about getting people signed up for rewards and credit. It sometimes felt uncomfortable soliciting credit because of all the personal information I had to get such as customer's SSN. I got a raise every year, which was about 25 cents or less. They're REALLY customer oriented, meaning that if a customer was truly in the wrong or fussy, managers would completely forget about store policy that's taught to us sales associate and give in to what the customer wants. I understand the customer has to pleased, but some situations were just ridiculous. This would make me feel like an idiot when I'd explain policy to customers and then my managers will do the complete opposite just to make the customer happy. Sometimes the workplace felt like it was high school drama. Managers have favorites and some are really rude, condescending, and unprofessional.  Some coworkers seemed to love to stir the pot and cause drama/ make a scene over petty things and treat each other poorly. The good thing about working here is that you're trained in many areas. Sometimes you work at jewelry or customer service which is nice because you further"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The pay is low for what is being asked of you. Hours are scarce, and not enough associates are scheduled because it's all about profit. So, the store floor is TERRIBLE most nights. Management and corporate only care about sales and not associates."
bad,Was fun helping and teaching other in safety and loss prevention. Fast paced when dealing with shoplifters and police. Satisfying to protect people and assets from criminal elements.
bad,"Working at Kohl’s, yes there were some positives. It was my first real job and it’s where I learned how I should communicate with customers, how I should be able to work as a team with my coworkers, it basically taught me a few things about retail that I needed to know! I think it’s what truly helped me gain the confidence I had at Party City, because I had been slightly experienced. "
bad,"I'm not sure how it is now, my guess is its not really different, but when I worked there you were paid barely above minimum wage, even for customer service position where you had actual responsibilities, not just checking people out and folding clothes. The shifts were very inconsistent, you never knew when or what you were going to be put on even if you had never been trained on that dept before. Raises were a joke. It was always hot in there and the music was terrible."
bad,"Throughout the entirety of the time I spent at Kohl's I felt no moment of insecurity to go to management with any comments, questions or concerns. However, the wage was the minimum in my state for major corporations and the hours were insanely long and late for a minor."
bad,"Very good job if your in school,flexible hours, I worked at night normally 6pm-11pm, the job is not for everyone,  only left because I didn't care for the new management."
bad,"My job included payroll, human resources, and administrative assistant work.   I enjoyed all of the above and especially dealing the employees.  A typical day includes checking time sheets, putting welcome packages together, having applicants fill out paperwork for employment."
bad,Management was rude and lazy. Only allowed to receive 10 hours a week. Only paired 9 p/h and worked 3 days a week. Slow passed. Not allowed to move from register even to clean up around it.
bad,Management is super nice. But the hours are extremely long and fast paced. They dont pay enough for starting out as seasonal. I have to already find a new job and I just started.
bad,"Working at Kohl's was very eventful especially during the holidays. It can be stressful due to inconsistent work hours, the upside being the food incentives given to us on breaks. The work place culture was very diverse to say the least, those not in my age range could not relate to me. The hardest part of the job was that relation issue, which had the possibility to cause discrepancy and miscommunication between yourself, co-workers, and management. Helping the customers that needed help was what I felt was my only outlet away from the other stresses of work."
bad,"My first store was great except for the favoritism & lack of advancement options if you weren't a favorite. But the atmosphere & the coworkers were great. My second store was terrible, no support from management, no rapport among coworkers, etc. Its a stressful job especially during the holidays"
bad,Most of the managers at the St. Mary's Kohl's only look out for themselves and whether or not they receive a paycheck. Few of them care about the employees and take their time when responding to calls for assistance with customers. If you do not stay on their good side you will know it.
bad,Basic part time job. The hours differ from week to week so it;s not dependable work. My co workers are amazing but the upper management isn't that great. There is a high turn over.
bad,Working at Kohl's was fun to begin with but got worse as you went.  You would ask for says off and never get them. The coworkers were fun people.  But the job did have its downsides.
bad,"My experience with the company was filled with lots of stress, long random hours, and multiple skip overs for advancement. There was just too many people in positions of power who did not know what they were doing or how to talk to people in order to earn respect."
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at Kohl's, and I enjoyed the hard work involved with unloading and processing the freight. Originally my shift was an overnight one, then it switched to early mornings, then gradually more and more ""truck people"" were pushed out onto the floor to merchandise while a couple others remained in the back to finish processing. "
bad,"It pays just over minimum wage, and the work is tedious at best. There is no hope for advancement above $15/hr, and there are very few skills applicable to any non-retail job."
bad,"Employees are great to get along with but management will smile to your face and answer what you wanted to heart but do as they please. OK for urgent need for days off. Usually given less hours if something is said to them. Favoritism / hiring is given mostly to African Americans. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"i was paid good being the beauty supervisor but they cut commission to $500 a month were some months i would make over $1,000 on commision. I truly loved the beauty department but the managers at bayshore kohls were horrible the one manager would smoke in the back and would stink up the stock room"
bad,a typical day at kohls in the morning we do warm up excerise then if it not enough work they will ask who wants to VTO then they tell us how much work were going to have then we get started that's bout it unless we finish early an we go home
bad,"Always chasing numbers that are not easy too meet, due to lack of payroll and a high amount of foot traffic.  If you like picking up after people and folding stuff this is the place for you.  Pay was good, but not a good work life balance as your work week is over 50 hours, not to mention there is always a store visit coming. Its typical retail, you will never be finished and never have job satisfaction at Kohls."
bad,"Hard to advance unless you know people in company, they do not consider your previous experience. They hire people they know from the past and put them above you on the promotional list even without having more experience."
bad,I liked that job I was offered because it was something I haven't done before. However they expect you to do a perfect job and just know exactly where everything is only after 2 hours of training your first day. Each manager has their different way of doing things and that can get you in trouble. One manger would rather yell at you and talk down to you if you did something wrong rather then explain it. If it was messed up again it was always assumed it was you. I was hired on for a seasonal job and after the holidays I wasn't scheduled anything and not sure if I still work there or not because I haven't been fired or filled out any paper work.
bad,I wouldnt recommend  anyone work at Kohl's. Not enough hours are available unless it's the holidays. The discount sucks and the hours you get during the normal season are based on how many credit card applications you get.
bad,"Kohl's can be a fun place to work. You will meet a lot of great people and team building here was great. The only issue is they work you to the bone with little pay and benefits. Work here for temporary work, don't make a career out of it."
bad,"Not a very good work environment, management was horrible."
bad,"Mostly I leaned things on my own; sometimes not at a convenient time, but others helped me when I got stuck."
bad,"horrible executives literally constantly breathing down your neck while they do nothing but sit in the office on their phones 24/7"
bad,"Fast paced company to work for, there are fun days. Flexible shifts, and ok benefits. The environment during seasonal time can be very stressful, but as a team they make it fun."
bad,"The work was slow. Hostile environment. Each manager has a different approach, one will teach you something and another will scold you for following it."
bad,"Learned to be open to change and manage a variety of people. "
bad,"there was a lot of leaders who acted funny , there were workers who got a special treatment even when they didn't deserve it, hours were inconsistent."
bad,"Very fast-paced environment. Always something to do within your zone, especially because of the amount of customers that came in. Friendly and helpful veteran staff. Trained on the spot for department needs."
bad,"Working for Kohl's was an adventure with many obstacles.  There were employees having inter course in the work environment, effecting other employees on the job to lose hours.  There were many problems with the machines so we'd have to leave work occasionally,  forced to take VTO without pay..  Manager was very unprofessional and easy to get upset . Working there isn't something i pray i won't have to do again."
bad,"Kohl's offers great deals to customers, but that seems to be at the expense of its employees.They are expected to harass guest to make purchase of sign up for credit cards. All they get for the awkwardness is an occasional bonus snack and limited discounts."
bad,"Selling Kohls credit cards"
bad,"I loved the coworkers i had. Otherwise, i dont think i would had made it as long as i did. Managment were not fair or understanding. I did get alot of my experience from the company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The managers were very fake, they would talk behind your back. Constantly going out of there way to make you feel stupid and worthless. No matter if you done everything they asked, it was never good enough. would use profanity at all times not only to me but to customers. Along with the main district manger would never take the time to get to know me and was very judgmental. I loved it at first but it got out of control on how they was treating me. The most thing I loved the most was making sure when they walked out that door, they had a huge smile on there faces. I enjoyed communicating and helping them in anyway possible, and I loved when my regulars would come in just to see me. If it wasn't for management disrespecting not only me but the customers, and the other beauty advisor jealousy of me and doing everything she could to get me fired I would still be there."
bad,Khols is a nice place to work. The customers were nice I enjoyed helping the customers find things. I liked working at the register and they need extra help with the dressing room.
bad,"To me it was just a place to go get a check, not fun at all , and a place that's very hard to movie up in. The time I work there I would say that most co workers felt the same."
bad,"The work was not hard but, some customer tend to get a little aggravated and argue prices and policies and a portion of the management rather than enforcing policy will side with the customer for convenience and it makes the floor and check out staff look bad when we have to apologize for being wrong to someone who is being unruly and/or rude."
bad,"I was there a while ago and maybe things have changed? There is no plan. Trucks full of product show up without notice, scheduling system antiquated. Very poor execution."
bad,"It's all about signing people up for credit cards, nothing else really matters to them. Good customer service doesn't really matter that much to them. At my store they started slashing hours like crazy and then actually started to hire more people, primarily cashiers because those are the people that get most of the credits because that's all that matters. Plenty of time for a life outside of work because they never give you any hours."
bad,"You are not paid enough unless you are in upper management. They do train employee's well though. After training, dealing with coworkers and unhelpful managers makes the job more stressful."
bad,"At first glance, it looked like an amazing company to work for. In fact, I still think it is. The store that I worked at, however, has some serious improving to do. The associates are all apathetic and the management only cares about numbers and themselves."
bad,worked overnight. Not much else to say. I did not like working overnight. I did not like the job. Management didn't care about us. Pay was ok. Job security wasn't good. Worked one day one week and 4 the next.
bad,"It  was  a   temporary  job, after   i   desperately      needed    a job   i           enjoyed         wotking          there         to a       certain   extent"
bad,Great job for young moms . There is no room to move up with in the company. Fast fun place to work thoe . If you love cloths and fashion this is the place for you. Clean and bright . Every one works together . The hours can be rough . day to night shifts . There's no way to move up in the company thoe . They do not hire from with in . Managers are all right out of college. So all your years of experience means nothing . How ever I love working there .The holidays are a blast even thoe it's crazy busy .
bad,worked along a great manager but they didn't really have any say on anything.  lazy employees who do nothing they're supposed to do which pitted day shift against night shift. All management is way to easy going unless something goes wrong then they find someone to blame. Lack of hours is a big thing Scheduled off for 3 weeks at a time.  Had to call to see if I still worked there.
bad,"Upon working at Kohl's, I've come to notice that you arent allowed efficient hours until you meet a specific sales requirement, something that they failed to mention before hiring me."
bad,"i helped open the store that i worked at.  That was the hilight of my ""career"" at KOHLS.  After the initial set up of the store was over everyones hours got chopped in half.  the money they pay their employees is a joke basically."
bad,"Most the other associates were lazy, therefore the go backs for the clothes get so backed up and everything is very complicated. The management is very condescending and rude, and not understanding whatsoever."
bad,Working at Kohl's was a good experience but they only scheduled me once or twice a week. Sometimes they would forget to schedule me at all which was why I ended up eventually resigning.
bad,the people and the mangers at Khols  is very cool expect for the person that makes your schedule she can be a pain in the butt working on the holidays is a pain in the butt but the coworkers are very cool. but some of them is always mad . also when they ask you a question like if you can stay overtime and if you cant they will think that you are lying or they will try to force u. Also the women expect things to be down in a short period of time especially if they give u a big project to do and they want it done like in 5 minutes.
bad,"While working at Kohl's I have experienced many changes that have changed my thoughts and attitudes about this work place.  When I began working at Kohl's there was management in place.  I felt like the managers worked with me and my coworkers together, and we were able to resolve conflict smoothly if any.  As I was working at Kohl's some great managers decided to leave to better their careers.  As other managers stepped in, I feel like my desire for this place totally changed.  I currently work their now, and I do not believe the managers are working in unity with their employees. Over the past few months, I have seen many employees find other jobs which most of the time was related to the management team.  Another issue is that many employees do not receive a fair amount of hours.  There are some employees that get 25 hours,  and another worker who is just as qualified, gets 5 hours a week.  All in all, I feel like Kohl's could potentially be a decent place to work, but only if the managers and supervisors are working together with their team."
bad,"Changed pretty much all staff, changed operations in terms of receiving & stocking product, negatively impacted morale, etc."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,The corporate machine will chew you up and spit you out. Upper management has no idea the struggles of working day In and day out in the L.P. world. One mistake and you will get thrown to the wolves and find yourself in the unemployment line.
bad,"Good Job for retirees, very slow work place, not that many hours available to work. Only busy during holidays. Conflicting shifts. High turn overs."
bad,You have to reach a goal . it's a chill work place.         Some managers are cool some are mean they provide fans you will get caught if you hide in the restroom
bad,"Most of the people here are friendly, but the rest treat you like you don;t belong and that you are always in their way and slowing them done by asking them questions and that you are a bother."
bad,Focus on what you need to do. Don't focus on just one thing. If you have any questions ask associates or who ever the managers are.
bad,"The work environment was the only good thing about the job. The managers and fellow associates that I worked with were the best part about the job and the only reason that I stayed as long as I did. The job was relatively easy with simple responsibilities. The pay was atrocious, the hours a bit all over the place, and the fact that they wanted everyone to work holidays, especially Thanksgiving/Black Friday and Christmas was not enjoyable. I felt that because I was being paid so little that I was under appreciated and under valued, which no employee ever wants to feel. I was paid less than $8 an hour for a very physical and exhausting job, where I worked EARLY morning shifts, mid-day shifts, and overnight shifts, sometimes all in the same week. I had an almost non-existent sleep schedule. The ONLY reason that I worked there for as long as I did was because I made great friends there, that was it."
bad,"The yes we can policy always contradicted itself.  The amount of cards that were suppose to be sold in a day was unreasonable.  If you did not sell as many cards as management wanted you to, you had to talk to them about why, when really the customers just did not want it."
bad,"Hourly employees are not respected. Extended hours can be worked, but compensation is equivelant time off, not time 1/2, no overtime pay. Management is cliquey and discourages hourly employees from ""moving up""."
bad,"A typical day for seasonal workers is doing whatever you aren't really hired for. You get to do your job but everything changes on a daily basis so you end up doing other people's work or duties you have no idea how to do. Being on point of sale is super simple and easy, the managers there are ok but depends on the manager whether or not your day will be easy. Other co workers are pretty great."
bad,"Greeting customers and making sure they have a good shopping experience. "
bad,"I enjoyed the work environment, but when I started looking for opportunities to advance in the company, they just weren't there."
bad,"There are a lot of fun people here, but management is the WORST. There are a couple managers that are great examples of what employees should look to as leaders, but other than that, it's a joke. I saw the store manager be so rude to another associate that I actually stuck up for her. I have never seen someone be so rude to employees. "
bad,"Consistent security with tills and documentation."
bad,Company gives very little incentive for making the job a good place to work. There is not enough in the pay raise and salary for the amount of hard work expected from employees.
bad,"Not the best place to work, lousy training, below avearge wages, suporvisors are okay, hardly any place for advancement"
bad,Made great friends. Management expects too much from one person doing all 3 departments and they don't listen when u need help.
bad,"Kohl's is a nice job to work for, just lacks stability of scheduling. If you have an open schedule, Kohl's is the job for you."
bad,"I only worked for Kohls for two months and it was awful. My manager did not care about the customers at all. All he cared about was getting customers to sign up for Kohls Charge cards. He didn't care about the quality of our work, only everything we got done no matter how bad it was. We would never have enough people working, so the quality of our work was never great. We did however get free food once in a while."
bad,for the most part it was great great customers and workers except a few managers they were never on the same page and would go behind each others back to tell me what to do which was usually the opposite of what the other wanted one manager in particular was a jerk it felt like he went out of his way just to irritate the employees
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I have worked at Kohls for a while and this is not a family friendly run business, like they try to advertise!!  We are expected to work a minimum of 60 hours/week and if you do leave before 5 pm you get stares from other employees like why are you able to leave before 5 pm.  They work you to death, so unless you like spending all your personal time working do not work here!"
bad,"Seasonal position, short shifts mostly 4 hours 3 days a week, to many clique's. Co-Workers disappear, they take numerous breaks and like to ""hide"" so they don't have to work."
bad,Not room for advancement. Not enough pay. I enjoyed helping customers with their needs and answered questions in person as well as over the phone. This job did improve my customer service skills in dealing with the public.
bad,"The job is a few easy hours a day. I learned how to work Mjm and Fitting rooms."
bad,"Kohl's is a okay place to work. Management are very friendly here, but not all of my co workers are very friendly. I've only made a couple of friends at this place. the building overall seems depressing."
bad,"basically just a retail job cleaning up after messy customers. No real opportunities for advancement, management just give you more responsibilities for same pay. Most managers are very friendly and nice. Some are the opposite. Coworkers are for the most part very friendly and fun. Decent job while in school."
bad,it was not my favorite job. Everyone that worked there was pretty shady and not to nice. coworkers were nice sometime but the management was pretty mean. I would not go back to that job at all.
bad,Thankful for the opportunity to have worked at Kohls.  I enjoyed working in the warehouse.  The location was close to home.
bad,"I worked for kohl's for many years. When I start work I usually go straight to my department. I go to the fitting room and put my clothing and accessories on proper hangers and separated items into clearance, messmate's, and items I have to either retag, put a proper hanger on them, or clearance them out. I grab the necessary  items and return them to customer service drop off the items into the proper departments in the store. Then I go up front and retag, put hooks on the proper items or reseal packages mean while helping out customers on the register if they need help.  Then I take my fixed items and put them in my bin from the back and bring the bin back to my department and start separating my items again as stated above.  Once I am finished I put the items away and fix up the department  resigning, pricing, and putting items into the correct locations. Once that if finished I usually take a break. the whole time I am helping customers pick out items, look for items in the warehouse, using the palm pilot is the stores location device. That is a typical 4 hour shift."
bad,the management had horrible attitudes they talked down on the employees and had no respect the most enjoyable part was the discount and helping customers
bad,It's an ok place to work if you are not looking for many hours while working through school or part time. Not a place to work when you have to support yourself or children.
bad,Very busy E- commerce department. I learned how to deal with fast paced incoming calls and use a multi-line phone system. The company provided adequate training to prepare me for the high call volume and type of assistance I will need to give to the customers in order to have satisfactory customer service.
bad,"You punched in & picked up any items returned at the service desk/returns to bring back to the jewelry department.  These items either needed to be put back on the racks, a new price tag needed to be put back on, or you bagged separately items that were broken. "
bad,"I hate it, feel like I was being drained and over worked. Work simple but too much at once. Management was decent overall. Most enjoyable part was getting off"
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's will have you running all over the store ringing registers, helping customers, recovering departments, answering calls and not just in your assigned area, expectations from management are not always communicated clearly and are sometimes unreasonable. There was a great team environment among co-workers at the location I worked. Helping customers find what they needed was very rewarding, being treated like a slave and bullied by management was not fun and it was counterproductive."
bad,"On a typical day I worked point of sales, customer service, organization of products and work place. I learned that retail is not an easy place to work in and that not all management types are the same. A poorly run work place can effect the entire work place and success of the business. I liked working with others in a team work type"
bad,I enjoyed my time at kohls somewhat due to the nice coworkers. Management was OK but didn't seem to do any work at all. The hours constantly changed and were very low all the time. Overworked like crazy and under staffed. Get burnt out and sore from job fast. They expect too much out of one person. I wouldn't go back because all they care about is money and never treat employees right. They also would not allow me to change my schedule when I needed to and expect people to work til 1am.
bad,"Very Productive and comfortable work environment."
bad,"As a replenishment associate my workload usually consists of coming in hours before the store actually opens to prepare freight for sales floor associates. A list of duties I regularly perform would be unloading trucks, processing freight, backstocking, stocking the floor, loading trucks being sent to redistribution centers, changing ad sets/Esigns and general maintenance. Overall, my job summary is that I am responsible for maintaining the stockroom and what comes and goes through it. I've been working for Kohl's almost 2 years now and I believe I have gained a true sense as to how most retail stores operate. Unfortunately, this has all been done on my own along with the aid of fellow co-workers. The management at my store would have to be my biggest complaint. Any form of leadership or guidance is naturally absent, so that leaves replenishment associates on their own. Our department is fortunately responsible and we analyze our workload and prioritize what needs to be done. Additionally, personal relations between management and associates are taken into account when creating work schedules and has been a frustrating issue of favoritism. On top of that, our general manager being extremely stingy about payroll and this means some of us get minimal hours. I would be lucky if I even got 15 hours a week a majority of the year. Co-workers are sometimes pleasant to have, excluding half of the more mature women we have who are always pleasant to work with. The other half is the younger men who take advantage of their personal relationships with some parts of the management staff"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Minimal consideration, concentration on the bottom line, no personalization"
bad,Kohl's is ok to work for as long as you don't mind minimum wage and a variable work schedule.
bad,"Unlike most weekly schedules in retail, I always received the same schedule each week, which really made it easy to balance my life aside from work. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and most of the management.  I learned a lot about being a supervisor and delegating things that needed to get done to the right people. The compensation and favoritism has been the only downfall which makes work really hard at times."
bad,"The employees were friendly, however most of management wasnt, and most just blew you off if you had questions."
bad,"The daily task as a store manager was designed so that you could lead and inspire your team, however reality was daily stress to make credit measures or you were made to feel as failure."
bad,coming in for work wasnt the greatest feeling. khols hires more employees knowing they have no hours to give.
bad,"If you want a decent paycheck only work for them during the Christmas holiday. After that your hours fall.....SIGNIFICANTLY. They neglect to inform people about that before they hire them sad but true. If your in high school, its not a bad place to be. If otherwise pass on this job cause your going to be doing way more work & only getting paid 7.25 for it with a raise nowhere in sight."
bad,"It is a good starting job if you're a part time worker or have never worked in retail before. I became a full timer a few years ago, and it was great that I have a full time job. But it's definitely not something I want to do the rest of my life."
bad,"Typical day consisted of keeping customers happy and keeping the store neat and friendly and trying to get new credit card applications.  I learned that you can't please everyone, but if you try, they do appreciate whatever effort you have made.  Management was the best ever,  the work with your scheduling and try as much as possible to work with you, but they also had guidelines they have to support.  Most co-workers were friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was getting new credit card applications.  Although after a lot of offering, you get pretty good at it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there, and having a job to do."
bad,Its a job not a career.  The company has a shoplifting quota you are suppose to meet each year which basically determines if your successful.
bad,"Workedf or this company and it was fun at first then when management changed the people changed. They started rumors and and it just wasnt fun anymore to work at, employees were nice but management was not so nice in the end when they want you out"
bad,"Work was no less than 10 hours daily unless instructed to take Voluntary time off due to lack of production available. I learned to replenish, pick, pack, and ship customers orders. Learned how to train new co-workers fast and sufficiently. Management was not attentive to customers needs. Hours were missing on checks, breaks weren't long enough and when a question was asked to complete job assignments some managers seemed to not have the answers so questions may go unanswered. The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily quota before the shift was over and getting management to provide excellent service to their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the area of work, there were unlimited jobs to complete as long as you were cross trained."
bad,"I was Promoted 4 times here a over a span of seven years.  Learned how to deal with a discount retailer, controlling costs while maintaining  presentation standards within payroll constraints.  Learned how to red floor plans as well as plan-o-grams quite proficiently.  The hardest part was motivating subordinates to complete the job within the time given, but excelled eventually by leading by example.  My co-workers were a great team to work with, we all helped each other, which is the most satisfying part of my job as well as when customers tell you how much they love to come shopping when I was there."
bad,A great opportunity to lead a team.  Knowing and growing with the people you worked with was rewarding.
bad,"I learned how to fold perfectly, managing co-workers, customer service and keep a clean department.  management was okay and did not take employees problems seriously.  co-workers were very diverse.  The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day and running around and dealing with rude customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and working with co-workers."
bad,"Typical work day"
bad,"Employees are expected to work for 100% satisfaction, which of course good.  Unfortunately, there is no opportunity for growth and the wages remain at minimum wage or a little above regardless of how long you have worked there or how well you perform."
bad,Was a great place to work til got new management. Once got new mnagement she wouldn't work with me with my school schedule like the old manager would
bad,"A typical day at work was cleaning the store help customers. management was not great as people think at kohls. co-workers were stress out to say payroll. I worked for kohls in Rockwall, Tex. Hardest part of the job was management they never treat you like a person. Well always yell at you in front of customers."
bad,-Not friendly
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day at work would be putting cloths back on the rack and helping out at the register when needed. I have learned to work every department except shoes, house wears, and children. my co-workers are nice people. I enjoy keeping my self busy and the discount."
bad,"This is an excellent entry level retail job who will work around your schedule and teach you to be a quick learner.A typical day consists of being assigned to one department, then being informed that there is not enough payroll, so you have to watch and maintain four additional departments. Along with meeting customer needs of helping to find items, you are to clean and maintain the floor, while clearing the fitting rooms out of all departments and answer pages to registers for additional cashier. There may be a day where there is good coverage (usually weekends). For the most part, the managers give you unrealistic stressful goals aimed at obtaining the most work they can from one individual without having to spend more money on additional help. I have been with the company for almost 8 years now and have only seen Kohl's as a cooperation become more 'thrifty' at the associates expense. I have been told on more than one occasion that 'bad' workers simply will not get any hours, while 'good' workers will get them all. This is unfair due to the fact that they do not coach or approach 'bad' workers who simply do not know or were never really trained on how to handle a store 'on their own'. The full time employees (reserved only for supervisors and managers only) get an average of 32-36 hours even though they are to be guaranteed a 40 hour work week. The 'good workers' (part time sales floor and SOME register clerks) get around 13-20 hours a week. To get 13 hours you really have to shine. A majority of the team will get 8 hours within a two day week. I have approached managers"
bad,"The hardest part of working for this company is work life balance. There really isn't any. Most of the co-workers are great and most of upper management is okay. There could be some changes, but I don't really see that happening."
bad,worked in the jewelry department. counted cash register both in the morning and at night. made sure the inventory of jewelry was accurate and evaluate if anything was off.
bad,"A day at Kohl's begins with cleaning out dressing rooms. As the day progresses, I fold clothing and clean adjacent areas. When necessary, I attend a cash register, completing sales and advertising future Kohl's deals and the Kohl's card."
bad,"Long, customer service skills, co-workers were friendly, cleaning constantly feeling like nothing is being accomplished, coupons"
bad,"Kohl's has a philosophy of empowering their employees, but without any training, that empowerment is meaningless. Hiring process is cumbersome and, although they promise not to ""throw you on the floor,"" that is exactly what I experienced. Training is non-existent."
bad,Kohl's wasn't my kind of job but i had to have it for some daily income.I didn't really learn much there it being a seasonal job.If i did learn anything it would be how to courteous to customers.Not my kind of employer that i would like to move forward with.
bad,Bad upper managament. The expectations are unreal and the the core values are only preached not practiced.
bad,"The job that I performed at Kohl's (cashier) was a delight and I enjoyed selling credit and meeting new customers (and regulars) every day. However, it was gossip central and the management was an absolute nightmare! Several managers were great people and were wonderful in how they treated the staff, however others, no names mentioned, were always micro-managing and had a way bigger head than necessary. The cashiers always made numbers and conducted themselves in a professional manner, but despite this, certain managers were very unfair and mean to us. I left this job, despite the fact that I was number 3 in sales and was probably going to be asked to stay past the season, because the person who made the schedule had an unfounded beef with me and started giving me 4 hours a week. Someone higher up should have corrected this and didn't!! Just a general nightmare."
bad,"After a few long months as a Management intern with Kohl's I came to realize that although their culture, values, advancement programs, and even recycling programs sound great on paper .... NONE of it was actually put into action. I got into a lot of hot water when I pointed this out to my manager and then the regional manager. It seemed that if it didn't directly bother them it didn't matter. I don't know if it was just the store I worked in or all of them, but the company culture was mean, uncaring, and sometimes down right ugly. I do not recommend this company to anyone!"
bad,"I really enjoyed my time at kohls, but only due to my fellow employees and my customers."
bad,"This was by far my worst job. Not only was it boring, but I felt very discouraged and disrespected by my superiors who viewed me as less because of my temporary position. I worked in omni fulfillment, which I actually enjoyed when it was BUSY. They hired many of us for omni and told us our hours were guaranteed in that department, when in reality, I only worked full time for one week before they cut all of our hours and we were essentially told we were let go. They are very awful at communicating anything, especially when the schedule puts you in a department and you're actually supposed to be in another department."
bad,There is a lack of communication among the mangers so when working with more than one manager at a time make it hard to get a single task done. I say this due to each manager giving different tasks and not understanding. The managers are pretty nice and the work can keep you busy.
bad,good job if you in high school. has a good pay system. weekly pay . direct deposit is always accurate. get a 15% employee discount. great for shopping on a budget.
bad,I really don't have anything to say about the Kohl's that I worked at. The regular associates that work there are nice and friendly. Working retail isn't easy.
bad,I didn't work here long but it was very hectic. People constantly called in or didn't show up and I would be asked to fill in for departments I'd never worked in and/or had no training in. My coworkers were all very nice and easy to get along with as well as the supervisors but I just felt like things were chaotic and I'm not sure where that stems from. It wasn't a bad start and for short term I didn't mind it too much but eventually it was just a little too crazy. We were always short staffed but being under a little pressure did allow me to pick up customer service skills quickly and I felt pretty confident handling customers even after just a few months of working there with no previous experience. I would have to say the most stressful part of working here was always being pressured to sell the Kohl's Charge card to customers. I would rarely get customers to apply and when I did it would be a little stressful because I was usually the only cashier and the process takes a few minutes so a long line would form which halted everyone else's work because they would have to leave their departments and come to the registers.
bad,"I worked as a cashier .  As a cashier you get decent amount of hours during seasonal months which are only November and December . It's fairly decent but be expected to become an expert in trying to sell credit cards to customers (Kohl's Charge). Management constantly pushes employees to get credit card applications to meet a daily goal which can get pushy because they act like everyone needs and wants a Kohls card . If you stay past seasonal , hours are way more shorter since its less busy and the way they give you hours is on how many credit applications you get so the more you get the more hours you get . I enjoyed the managers most of them will help you and treat you fair and the employees as well everyone gets along . Whether you work 4 or 8 hours you will get breaks which is nice specially when its really busy . "
bad,It was honestly a revolving door and although I stayed there for six months they couldn’t care less if I was there. I tried my best to take the load of managers and supervisors but it didn’t matter. I got fired over a misunderstanding and they didn’t hesitate to terminate me. I didn’t hate the job but the fact that they couldn’t take into consideration my past working experience just left a sour taste for the company and management
bad,"Working here i was being paid below average for a employee. I have had years of retail of experience beforehand, so i found it odd as to why they would try to pay me as low as possible. For the hours i was getting about 10 hours a week, which in the long run how am i supposed to pay rent with this amount of income and hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Work was busy, high turnover, very stressful, pay not competitive, management played favorites.  Would not recommend this as a good work environment at all."
bad,"The job offers a great environment and the coworkers are all very friendly. However, management was lacking. Though I said in my interview that I needed Sunday mornings off, I was refused my Sunday mornings off to attend religious services even though it’s illegal to do so. So I submitted an availability change and was told it could not be approved by management."
bad,"It's a job. If you get into a supervisor or an assistant store manager/ store manager role it gets difficult to manage your life and work balance. Schedules are not consistant, and you are not allowed to have unavailible days of the week. Some store managers might make exceptions for college classes and whatnot but not a lot. If you aren't the one taking classes, you will probably have to pick up the slack. There is a loose guideline that every manger has eber other weekend off but that's up to the SM to give it to you. The area supervisors, who are the lowest level of managment, have most of the same responsiblities as the salaried executives, but not the pay. There are rumors that the company is being sued over this. Training is unofficial and mostly just another manager training the new one. There isn't a set mission statement that I can find, and there is not a handbook or any sort of guide that clearly defines the role any one position is supposed to perform. But that seems to be the norm for retail everywhere."
bad,"It was a fine first job, however I know my value is worth more than minimum wage and I had to leave to continue schooling. The work was somewhat mindless folding of clothes."
bad,I didn't mind working there because of the people I was working with but they didn't make an effort to be organized so that made it very stressful. The management was very good though.
bad,"I loved working in retail and loved working for the company--I had been here for over 2 years and did not want to leave. It was just the fact that no matter how wide my availability was, I always got shafted on my hours. I would have it set any time, any day, and still go weeks and sometimes months without being put on the schedule. It was also pretty disgusting to have so much experience but watch seasonal people with minimal availability get more recognition and hours. For the most part, the workplace is very cliquey and people will only work with you, if you're best friends with an area supervisor. If not, you're easily forgotten."
bad,i worked at kohl’s for only two weeks and it was terrible. i met some nice people but management sucked. i called to quit on my last day and when i called no one answered the phone so i had to call again and leave a message at customer service. later on i find out im still on their schedule which is so dumb. this job was not worth staying.
bad,Not enough structure and very overwhelming and demanding.  The critiques received are negative with an overload of work with impossible deadlines to meet. No kind of training.
bad,"The environment is kind of stressful, as they PUSH for people to get store credits even though most customers are frequent shoppers. Your job is not the most secure as well but it honestly is not the worst job you could receive."
bad,"I worked here during the holidays, so my day was a bit different than the most standard days. I would get there in the morning and try to find something to do that fell in the hugely vague description of my duties. This would include putting new items on the shelves and cleaning up the displays while helping customers. "
bad,It was a good place to start off at but they would never be responsible with shift changes and the management team is all over the place and they never know what is going on
bad,I worked there for over a year and received no benefits or pay raise. You would always be asked to work constantly do to being overstaffed. Overall would not recommend
bad,"The management is terrible, they are all incompetent and after I worked there they attempted to leave me unpaid. They claimed I wasn’t clocking in, but after I called corporate, corporate said it was their fault because I was on record as clocked in, it too corporate and the theft protection members at Kohl’s to even get me my second paycheck."
bad,"I worked their seasonal position this past Christmas, I was basically thrown on the floor with no training of any sort whatsoever. Everyday I was basically given busy work.  It was as if the managers ignored all of the seasonal employees and acted as though we didn’t exist. There was no guidance whatsoever. Even people that had gotten hired on before me said the exact same thing. I understand that it was a pretty busy season, but they could have at least put forth the effort to train us."
bad,I would still be there if I didn't have brain surgery. Liked everyone and everything about this job. Except one manager who talked me into just walking out for being 2 min late one day
bad,"Co-workers and most managers are friendly and helpful, but the store manager is friendly to customers but treats staff disrespectfully.  Employees and coworkers are very friendly and helpful.  Hours are random and never know hours until week prior.  You are able to request time off and usually very good about giving you off days requested without pay."
bad,"It’s a nice company if u can get a consistent 40 hours a week ,equipment operator is the best department in building plus one of highest paid but if work slow u will be train to work in other departments where work can be more challenging."
bad,"Money is decent lots of overtime usually available loved co workers and loved my staff , upper management  is horrible and views u like a number instead of a person"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Most of my days were 4 hour shifts but other days I worked 6-8 hours which wasn't too bad. There were certain quotas we had to reach day which can be difficult to reach because it can be slow and not busy that day to a busy and hectic day. Didn't feel appreciated working there but I met nice and fun people there.
bad,"Kohls is very diverse, but their isn’t much room for advancement unless youre friends with management and don’t have any opinions. The environment amongst peers is amazing and very family oriented."
bad,a typical day of lack of over-seeing people who work hard day in and day out through out changes in the company and weather outside. I did learn how to drive a stock picker and couple other equipment but also wasn't even given the opportunity to drive permanently for them.(sucked) Hardest part of the job was coming in with the same energy as the first of day work on a daily basis. the culture was often good until Management made changes that didn't satisfy employees
bad,"Pros: People are very friendly. Time off and company events are generous. "
bad,"As an associate that has been here for almost a year, and in the busiest season of the year, you would expect to see myself and others in the same or similar position to be receiving more hours at the job we were hired for. Instead, this corporation decides to hire on 30 extra seasonal workers and maintains our respective 6-12 hours weekly staff-wide. The discounts are cool, just dont expect to be paying rent with this job."
bad,"I've learned a lot about people and customer service, but after two years of was time for me to move on. It's a decent job for starting out in retail."
bad,I loved it there but the store manager was very unethical. Managers did gossip a lot about associates and each other. The hours cannot go past 25 hours per week except during holiday. Almost everyone was very nice but very segregated place in terms of ethnicity and race.
bad,"On a typical day one is sent to the retail floor to work registers, customer service and sales floor. Although, it can be very stressful the culture and friendliness from peer-peer is very fun. The direct relationships are very close allowing teamwork and friendship to be easy. I learned many new things, from customer service, to how back of house shipments and re stocking can be enjoyable."
bad,A typical day at work was slow paced and I learned customers can be very cold hearted.  Management was nice and understanding.  Hardest part of the job was organizing multiple departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job was discounts.
bad,"I absolutely hated this job. I only worked one day a week, I was scheduled off for 2 weeks, hen they expected me to just show up for Black Friday. Other than having a bad experience it was okay."
bad,"sales associate, helping customers want they need in the sales floor, also I did cashier at kohls, fitting room at kolhs. I learned being helpful with people I learned a lot at retail..."
bad,"I love everyone i work with. Management could be better. The environment is great, being in customer service you always have things to do and i like staying busy."
bad,"Barley making 8 hours a week. Shifts are only 4 to maybe 5 hours max. No training, you're just thrown into it all blind. "
bad,"Managers are fake"
bad,Overall enjoyed my experience at Kohl's. Learned a lot about cashier systems and how to be a better team leader. It is an excellent first job for some one coming out of high school.
bad,"If you weren't able to close enough credit card sales, the managers stopped supporting you. Customers were usually decent, but the bad ones were horrific. I never knew if I was going to have 30 hours a week or 3. It was a very stressful place. Thankfully, my coworkers made it nicer."
bad,"Assist customers on a daily basis, delegate and complete time sensitive projects correctly and efficiently. Management displayed extreme favoritism and lacked professionalism. Not much opportunity to advance."
bad,Co workers were great managment wasnt the best. I would typically be up front at the register but they would put me everywhere. There particular schedule didn't work with my other schedules and so I had to leave.
bad,"This place is super stressful, they do not incentivate you for your work, they do not pay what each employee deserves."
bad,Kohl's was very boring and was not interesting at all. There was no enthusiasm and there was no room to grow or advance. I had no relationship with the co workers and I just wouldn't recommend working here to anyone.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Being a seasonal associate, you pretty much get the grunt work.  Once I started excelling at cleaning out the fitting rooms, keeping my areas in prime shape, and busting my butt to answer calls and help customers, it felt like I was working alone. I rarely saw my coworkers in the same department and I sure never saw them really work.  But they sure have management fooled into thinking they work hard or management would be letting them go instead of the hard working seasonal help that never called in sick or showed up late, as opposed to the regulars who called out constantly and all they had to do was show their faces to get paid.  Definite favoritism. Felt so unappreciated, especially when I was scheduled for my last day and no one even bothered to say thanks."
bad,"no advancement opportunity and no support from leadership or guidance to better myself.  "
bad,"· Greeted Customers when they entered the store."
bad,Unloading trucks is a hazardous job for your wallet seeing all the great items coming off the truck.  Discounts are great.  Company gives back to the community.
bad,"I was one of the youngest employees there and I was a point of sale associate. I worked during the summer when school was not in sessions. Kohls was definitely the WORST job I ever had. I was not respected because I was younger, and although they gave me hours I worked a 9-5 and barely made any money. They pay $9 an hour and I was doing work that was not even my job. Counting registers, staying past my shift, helping managers with scheduling which is most definitely not my job, restocking and etc. "
bad,"Some days you'll have fun with employees and customers and everything is great.  The next day another manager may be transferred, change every rule you've ever known and it will be miserable for a month until another manager comes in to change something else."
bad,This store in particular had very poor management and a lack of communication. Management didn't take it upon their selves to make sure they were correctly staffed. there is little room for growth in the company if you have dependents.
bad,"Working at Kohls was one of the most stressful things I have ever done. Lets start with the management. In both of the stores I worked they were all awful. They only ever cared about getting everyone to sign up for kohls card and god forbid if you didn't get enough people to sign up, they would cut your hours. It honestly is all that they ever cared about. Also, they very much were about ""the customer is always right"" despite how ridiculous some of the requests were. They were not afraid to embarrass you and make you look like the bad guy just to make the customer happy. The store was always expected to be neat and tidy, but rarely ever was because of the fact that they always under staff the place. With that said, if the store didn't look good at the end of the day, you were held accountable no matter how busy you were throughout the day. I can honestly say the only good part about the place is that you can work it around your school schedule, but unless you are at school, they expect you to be at work."
bad,"Days would go fast"
bad,"I personally did not have a problem with the job at first. But when you get in to a job and see what it is like for about a couple of months, you really get to know everyone and sometimes its not what you hoped. I personally think its an OK job, nothing fancy, it is just a job. I did learn in my time being there and am still there that you got to give in sometimes, it may not be what you have planned for that day/ night, and they are looking to compensate, which means someone has to sacrifice time. Life is nothing but time, and I personally would rather spend my time doing an outside job, something where I am typically not ""wasting away"" my time."
bad,"Was fine at first, but didn't stay that way. My availability was not tended to and it's only really a good place to work if you only want 8 hours a week. management is laughable, pay is low."
bad,"This is a great job to begin with, but there is hardly any room for advancement.  I started out at 7.25 and ended at 7.43 after 2 years. I worked hard for 2 years and only received an 18 cent raise. The work environment is very, very poor. Management is horrible. They overwork you for little pay and want you to do the work that they don't want to complete, but are supposed to. They talk about the workers poorly and cause a lot of stress at work. The weekends are the busiest days, but the scheduling is always thin. It's too much work for such little pay. I would not work here again."
bad,"I loved who I worked with, but the amount of work given to me, the lack of people staffed, and the extreme micromanagement from the Store Manager and Operations Manager made most days extremely difficult.  As a supervisor, you would expect to be making a lot of decisions about your department to increase profitability.....WRONG.  I had very little say in anything and I saw myself as an overpaid sales associate rather than a supervisor hoping to make it a little higher up within the company.  I was on registers more than in my own department.  I loved the people I worked with and I loved the other two ASM's, but overall, it was a very stressful, difficult place to work for."
bad,I believe that the managers need to be trained more in hospitality. I feel like I did learn allot there but only because I'd throw myself at every chance I got. No one asked me to advance.
bad,"Good place to work, friendly coworkers and management. Meet lots of interesting customers."
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers, however, the positive atmosphere was to the point of blindness to any issue within the departments. Not a place to work if you have years of various retail experience. Great first job or a place to pick up a couple of hours."
bad,"I worked with employees to organize the shoes and help customers find shoes.  I would also help on the register..  I would clean up, stock shoes and help customers to find their shoes on the shoe kiosk."
bad,Job did not offer much in the way of moral or motivation. no real room for advancement. management seemed un-interested in leading and left myself and co-workers with very little to do
bad,"To many management individuals involved in the process; no trust for those managing the process to get the job done.  Too many changing opinions from too many people, slows the process down.  No understanding/regard as to how changes will affect many other departments and people."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,A bit stressful with a lot of line moving overall the atmosphere is great and managers are nice. But a bit too strict on a lot of stuff and understaffed all the time.
bad,"company is a behind the times bank, they need to update their systems and be a more state of the art bank to compete with the big banks"
bad,Volume is larger than anticipated.  Growth should have been anticipated by corporate.  Should have better cleanup processes in place as well.
bad,"The best thing about Kohls is the opportunity to advance quickly. People come and go often, so there are many higher up positions available. The work environment was hostile as people are very rude towards new people. The store was unorganized and a stressful place to work."
bad,"A typical day would consist of greeting customers, offering assistance, maintaining cleanliness of departments, merchandising, ringing customers up at registers, and pushing out freight on occasion. I was able to work every department within store. I received outstanding customer service awards."
bad,The hours were too early or ran too late for me and not have a constant schedule or at least a similar schedule every week was very hard for me and my family to keep up with. I was suppose to be a supervisor but was not exactly treated as such. There was much exciting things to do everyday and the other co-workers were not exactly the best or very professional. Constantly having to walk from one side of the store to the other really took a toll on my body and I could not take that anymore. I am now looking for something with a little less exercise during the day.
bad,"Being a lead at kohls was so much fun, and fast pace, but the management was poor, and there was a lot of lack of communication. I enjoyed merchandising, and helping my customers place together outfits, but the fitting rooms would get out of control and it would become overwhelming to keep up with."
bad,Not enough hours to go around.There is no full time inless u decide to become a supervisor but their full time hours dont exceed over 35 hours if your lucky.
bad,"While working at Kohl's, although the employees are very nice and accepting, the system is terrible. They let everything ""slide"" to the point where customers question and argue every decision you make because they know if they complain, the management will let just about any and everything ""slide"" while the employee gets scolded, ridiculed, and just looks outright stupid. The store was constantly a chaotic mess. And at the particular location I worked at, they hired soooo many of us, but we barely were scheduled. You were lucky to get a day a week. There's almost no advancement. People had worked there for years and years and years, dealing with the same problems as someone just starting and hardly making much more, and not even getting more hours. And no matter how much experience you are, or how amazing you do in the interview... you are started at $7.95. I made $8.00 at my very first job! And at my 3rd job, somehow I downgraded."
bad,"Work here is slow, very slow paced. Co-workers are nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting through the day."
bad,"My typical day at Kohl's is helping customers find what they need to satisfy their needs and wants, also handle money transaction on the register. I have learned a lot working at Kohl's, especially when dealing with different people and personalities. The management at Kohl's could be better as well as some of my co-workers. The hardest part of working at Kohl's is doing everybody job including your assign job! I don't have a problem helping my co-workers because I do believe in team work, but they take team work to another level of you doing the work by yourself. The most enjoyable part about working at Kohl's is being around clothes and decorative items as well as helping someone find what they need and asking for your opinion."
bad,"Keeping the departments looking their best and answering any and all questions I might receive from customers. I've learned how to manage my time better and pay close attention to details. Coworkers are often helpful and kind, the hardest part of my job would have to be answering the phone and helping people who call in the store because i'm not accustomed to the information required to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting and helping customers while creating a personal connection to ensure satisfaction."
bad,"Working overnights remodeling. "
bad,It was a job that had no future for me. I was only there to have an income while I went to school.
bad,"A lot of hard work. Sometimes one person to cover four department responsibilities like cleaning fitting rooms, processing stock back to floor, as well as helping customers on floor, filling in as cashier and helping out at customer service counter.  I learned that everyday is a learning experience. The management team although nice needed to learn to work as a team and communicate because we would get different orders and directions of how things were to be done often having to do the same thing two or three times. Leads have much more responsibility than floor associates, handling all the filling and trucks and daily responsibilities with absolutely no help. There is just no way of making managers happy. There was a time when the manager and assistants used to pitch in and  help fill and clean department. Now they give you your job and theirs and take credit for it when it is done.  The co-workers maintained a friendly report. We had a great support system among the team. The hardest part of the job was simply trying to keep up with the daily functions. The most enjoyable was working with the customers and the feeling of satisfaction of what you accomplished at the end of the day."
bad,My coworkers and bosses are really pleasant they are the only reason I enjoy coming into work. However I am grateful for this job.
bad,"The Employees Are Amazing But The Only Wrong Thing Is The Management System. The Working Environment With The Employees And The Customers Have Always Been Incredible. But When It Comes Down To The Management Team And Even The Store Manager Its Unbelievably Dis-functional, They Stress Themselves Out And Push It Upon The Employees Because They Cannot Meet Their Status Quota. They Stress The Employees Out And With Those Results Its Hard To Finish Their Task At Hand."
bad,I loved working with the Customers and the Employees but a new Manager came in and changed so much that it no lger was a great place to work
bad,"I was able to refine and excel my skills as a Clinic Medical Assistant, with gaining experience drawing blood, administering immunizations and medications. I enjoyed working alongside a Physician in order to provide the best patient care. I was given numerous tasks on top of my MA duties, which I enjoyed. Management changed half way through the time of me being there, neither for the good or bad. I had a few excellent co-workers that had as much drive and work ethic as I did and we got along great. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work was working as a team with the Physician I worked for to provide the best patient care possible and help others through their time of need."
bad,I totally hated this job. I received good experience from here but thats it. The onl;y good thing about this job were the co-workers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Organizing the children's and home department, cleaning fitting room, folding clothes, restocking"
bad,"Constant pressure to meet credit application goals, driving force of this business, can be a daily stress. Every task in the store is geared to work load planning from corporate and funded accordingly with no consideration for individual store needs. Goals are tight as is payroll to accomplish this."
bad,Kohl's was an okay place to work overall. They were helpful with my college schedule by letting me work around my class schedule and scheduling me accordingly.
bad,"kohls was a a somewhat nice place to work"
bad,"I loved working because it gave me purpose, I love to work, im always a hard worker at whatever i do, and it puts a food on the table and a roof over my kids heads, so whatever job i get im satisfied with because its hard getting jobs right now, and im just greatful to get anything."
bad,Management was never on the same page and the pay was not very good. They want you to do a lot of work for so little pay and not very good benefits.
bad,Kohl's will tell you how much they care about their employees and then not stand up for you when the time is needed.
bad,"This was a college job, not a career."
bad,In my opinion it could be a great job if the pay was better and the management new what they were doing. it feels as though you can never finish anything that you start. the main managers have a tendency of starting you on multiple job or either you will start one thing and are told to do another before you are done with the first. the store has a great environmental and the people are great but they need a new manager. the store at the moment is a mess since most of the employees are not allowed to finish anything.
bad,"I work with customers, tidy the store and work at the cash registers. I learned how to work with many different people in a fast paced environment. I learned how to multi task and budget my time effectively."
bad,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of this retail business. I would've liked to advance and continue working there. They offer insurance benefits to part-time employees, which I like. But they hired too many people and gave each person too few hours, unless you were good at soliciting credit card applications. The people who were worked the most hours. I was disappointed in the management style of two out of three locations where I worked. This is a good store, some locations were fairer to work for than others. This store has great merchandise, but I was never able to work enough hours to buy it."
bad,"When I first started working at Kohl's, it was an awesome place to work boasting a fun and friendly environment. Then a whole management shift happened, and things have been downhill from there. There are plenty of opportunities to learn new postions, but not a lot of promise for advancement."
bad,Fun for the most part. Management was a bit over powering depending on the person. One of the managers specifically liked to get into personal space.
bad,professional atmosphere employees are nice and helpful customers appreciate the employees
bad,"If you like working endless hours and being expected to be available 24/7, then Kohl's is the place for you. At Kohl's, it's more than a job, it's a life style."
bad,most coworkers are cool. managers are very unorganized. you work hard and fast for little to no pay. its very sexist and mostly women who work and run the store.
bad,"I will admit, they do hire very quickly but they do not train well. I worked as a retail sales floor associate and I was only told to ""make the store pretty"". I wasn't properly trained and sometimes co-workers / managers would get upset at me for not knowing something they never trained me on. It can get stressful sometimes and you're always on your feet but if you're in need of cash, you can apply here. Please know that there are better options out there."
bad,"The actual work is not very difficult. The pay is above the minimum but not very competitive with other places. The crew has a literal handful of good workers (but they do have a lot of “nice people” that call-out often without repercussions). The scheduling is all over the place. Your best chance of getting a job there is by having open availability (just so they can schedule you a whole 10-17 hours a week and have you on-call). If you’re male, good luck, you’ll be part of a 5% minority and treated like a dumb ox. You’re only there for heavy lifting."
bad,If you are planning to be sub-contractor would recommend you to keep Kohls as a secondary option as Kohls won't give client letter or manager reference.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with different areas at once. That is tied with the lunch catered by the best caterer in town daily. They have bright and cheery corporate internal communications but it is a filmsy mask to employees that mirrors the theater seen in the hallways of beaming positivity of management and staff who, as it turned out, mostly only watch their own backs. It is gossipy like a high school and the egos are enough that forced me to look elsewhere. It's Menominee Falls, not Manhattan -- some employees don't comprehend that and IT SHOWS."
bad,"Company states that it cares for its associates but that’s the last of their worries, their top priority is their company, they don’t care for its associates, they don’t bother asking how they feel or our feedback doesn’t not matter and is never asked for. Working in retail you expect your company to have your back if your following company policies and procedures and you aren’t being disrespectful. Couldn’t be any farther from reality. They will make your look like an idiot in front of the customer"
bad,"The managers at kohl’s choose favorites and they expect to much out of departments when you are by yourself. "
bad,Because of the volume of the store the new manager is not used to the shoppers in this store. Too much work load for supervisors. Not enough support on sales floor .
bad,"This company is brainwashing."
bad,Job does not pay enough to do what you do other jobs pay better for the same thing in the area. The better you work the more they put on you. Training during seasonal is very basic if that you really dont train fully you just have bodies to use for the meaningless things that no one else has time to do
bad,Kohls is a great place to work and it is a great place to interact with other co workers and customers. The management and i wasn’t on the same page but it is still a great place to work at.
bad,"For a part time job, $10.50/hr is pretty decent, and is also weekly pay.  The training process was absolutely awful, you get provided with minimum to no training at all and are expected to know everything then.  Management also needs to work with their people skills, while they’re quite knowledgeable about the store, their people skills lack.  The other workers were also quite rude."
bad,"shifts weren't a set schedule ,staff wasn't willing to help you understand what you job was and helping with tasks wasn't offered. they weren't cooperative with work schedules and when time off was asked."
bad,"It was a very calm place and calm workers, the back rooms are very bland and demoralizing. Slow paced job overall. Lots of customers with coupons and such."
bad,I enjoyed working for kohls but sometimes they single people out as in if they need people in different department the new employees get worked like dogs especially if your part time i had good weeks and bad weeks asjo management i had a good manager for a yr and i was employed there for almost 4 yrs  oother
bad,"If you’re looking for a part time job and have no bills to pay Kohl’s is what your looking for but they inly pay $9 an hour and very little amount of hours , they trained you for 3 days than throw you by yourself on the floor and ask you to do what an senior employee does!!! Will not recommend this job for a person who needs to pay bills !!"
bad,Like any retail job you check out customers and organize the store the annoying part is you have to pressure customers to sign up for credit cards and you get in trouble if you fail to do so.
bad,It was a part-time retail job that would not adequately reward hard work.  Part timers are expendable and learning new skills or positions is not compensated.
bad,The hardest part of the job is meeting sales targets and time management during the rush hours at the register. I have improved on my communication skills at this job.
bad,"A typical day at work was just putting clothes back where they belong and occasionally working the register, pretty standard right? I didn't love or hate this job but there it had its issues that I was not okay with. They left me to close or left me alone in the department multiple times in my first and second week there. Oh and they also switched me from departments in my first week. I didn't know where things had to go when closing or what to do. Was constantly pressured by co-workers to finish everything on the rack at night when the other employees that came in in the morning worked slow leaving majority of the clothing for the the ones that came in at night. I Typically worked in the men's department but it got busy so I hopped on the register. I needed assistance from someone in my department but I couldn't call anyone because no one was there. I called for my manager and he never came either. Also, I was supposed to be part-time only which had a limit of 26 hours. I was told I would never be scheduled past that. I didn't take more than 3 weeks for them to schedule me 30 hours. The job is fine but they expect a lot to be done, which works when there are multiple employees in a department, but instead they leave one person for the department the entire night."
bad,They were pretty laid back.. Except for employees who were on cash registers we had to pressure people to get kohls credit cards.. We have to do the same at Jcpenneys too. The managers got $75.00 per credit card on their shift we only get $2.00. I don't like forcing people to get credit cards.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend to anyone to work here, solely based on their pay. The $9 an hour for the amount of work you do is just like a slap in the face. It was fine for a temporary job, or even for a high school student who doesn't need much money, but it is not for someone who has bills to pay."
bad,"Worked a short period of time.  Wasn't notified at my interview that I was temporary holiday help. Matter of fact, I was asked if I had applied for the two Associate positions and I said yes. They don't tell you to your face that you are part of the cut after the holiday. Instead of just laying you off you get an email that you're terminated. When you're helping them through the holiday and you're working very hard,  It would be very appreciative for them to at least acknowledge our help and thank us to our face and let you know we were going to be laid off or even tell us from the beginning.  Poorly ran when it comes to properly treating their employees with respect."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The store is usually vastly understaffed for how messy and rude the customers are. Most of the days, there are not enough cashiers so people will be called from the floor for backups, but sometimes you are up there for so long you don't get your own duties done and it just cascades onto the next person until it's a huge mess."
bad,"Management is horrible . They spread rumors in the work place , are highly unprofessional and very unfair............................................."
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's would be assisting customers and putting items on the sales floor. Pretty easy right? Well not really. Customers are very rude and think they know everything. Multiple customers asked me if I spoke Spanish. Another one said I was not telling her the truth. Management at this particular Kohl's is not the greatest. Everyone in every department is on different pages. The store manager here lacked giving me hours. When I asked one of the store mangers if I could work the next week since I did not have hours; he told me ""that is not my problem to take care of"". The people who you work with can also come out as being rude. I would recommend this place to work as a high school or college student. If you do not like retail or any other sales job, do not apply."
bad,The management actually cares about how their store is ran and how everyone handles situations. Their are certain managers that are rude and will yell at you for no reason other than their upset with their life.
bad,"At Kohl's, I would sometimes be in different departments, which made it a little difficult to memorize where everything was. Sometimes I would be in the Women's/Young Women's section (since they're combined), other times I would be in the Youth girls section, etc."
bad,"Some managers had bad attitudes. "
bad,"Customer Service is not my cup of tea, it is the absolute worst. I so dislike being alone and working without a partner or team. And being launched into customer service on the busiest nights of the week(end) is not the way to learn how to be good and effiecent at your job. I felt rushed and undertrained. I also wish I could move out of customer service."
bad,"Management will constantly go back and forth on what is most important. Credit is above all, however. If we miss credit we're given ridiculous stretch goals for the next few days to come (like 12 on a Monday). We're expected to compete with stores in our district who make thousands more when we do... If a customer puts N/A or 0 on any part of the survey we get a 0 and our service score in constantly fluctuating. We are expected to help the customer, but have our line item discounts printed off and questioned every day because Kohl's own policy is losing them money. We constantly have customers complain that another store did nothing to help them, which is also frustrating because we have to pick up their slack time and time again. We are all about talking about the app, but most people who shop at Kohl's are too old to know how to use it, let alone own a smart phone. No limit on how much you can bring into the fitting room makes recovery in most departments unbearable. You will be scheduled full time hours with no vacation, paid time off, or any bonus except the extra money. Only days the store is closed is Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. Overall, go somewhere else!!"
bad,"It was a typical day of work, clock in for your shift, and clock out. As a Sales Associate, you are required to handle your register, clean enviorment, restocked shelves, etc."
bad,"The management for getting credit is extremely stressful. The pay is great, and keeps you a float but the pressure between getting good customer service or credit cards is horrible"
bad,They care not about the hard work you do; you are just a number to move things about and clean.Only part-time need apply as they don't hire full-time.
bad,"I interacted with a lot of people and learned new ways to merchandise clothes. The work shifts go by fast when cashiering."
bad,"Not enough pay for the work that is expected to be done. Before getting promoted, only received annual raises in increments of about 11 cents... Once you accept the promotion you give your life away for an extra dollar or two"
bad,"They never schedule enough people so if you close be prepared to stay till 1 am. If you're a cashier and don't get enough people to open a kohls charge, you'll get fired."
bad,Tried to have work life balance. The benefits were great. They usually hired upper level positions from within the store. Management usually is supportive.
bad,"Very low pay and very demanding workplace. Must know many things and do large amounts if work in short 5 hour shift. Management is out of touch with what can be accomplished and no information is relayed from the top down to us employees. Must learn not just one department but the entire store, and no training must figure everything out for yourself or ask someone. Seems as though employees have to 'pry' information out of managers. Management always making changes to processes and most don't make sense. Other retailers in the area substantially more. Stay away if possible!"
bad,"Retail is generally tough. Kohl's used to offer great career paths but don't anymore. The culture is fast paces and high stress. Every year they ask you to do a little more with a little less. The company teaches you different facets of management and business operations. Everyday is different and high stress. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance. Long days, working on weekends and holidays, and the store is only closed 2 days a year. Best part of the job is the people and the store teams."
bad,"A very average place to work overall. Management gives workers leeway, but sometimes absent when truly needed. Never enough employees in store, internal systems could use some updating."
bad,"The job itself was great. You got to spend a lot of time with the customers and get to know a lot of people. The managers and other employees there, however were terrible and rude."
bad,"I was lucky to get to 20 hours a week and when I was hired I was told I would get at least 20. They hired in every single seasonal worker after the holidays and cut back every cashier to 1 maybe 2 days a week if you were lucky with only 4-6 hours per shift. (Even cashiers who had been there since the store opened.) They expected that all of their employees were students who only needed money for recreation. When minimum wage went up they dropped my raise and just put me to the new minimum wage. They credit requirements are ridiculous as you are expected to get the same amount of credit appliations in a small town as store located in a big city in your district. The management was nice but, not helpful. They provided food for employees working holidays which was nice."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"We worked on delinquent accounts that ranged from 90 days past due to almost charge off. We also tried to reach customers through our skip tracing efforts for the accounts that were unreachable. We had very limited supervision since we had a strategy that was sent to us for the day. We made sure that as a team we were always helping each other and making sure that every team member was on the same page. Working with my team was the most enjoyable time especially when we were there 10 hours a day. We also received bonuses for excelling on our scorecards for Balances Moved, Quality and Overall Scorecard."
bad,A typical work day is very rewarding in the sense that helping customers is very fulfilling and I've always enjoyed the company of staff and co-workers.
bad,It’s all about credit and how many you can open. All day long people talk in your ear pushing you to get credit cards opened. The hours are very limited. The people are all nice and friendly
bad,"I have worked at Kohl's for over a year. I was hired just before Black Friday in 2016 as an Online Pickup Associate, trained as a cashier in August of 2017, and trained in customer service in December, after Christmas. I use the word ""trained"" VERY loosely - at the Kohl's I work at, you are shown the basics and told to figure the rest out as you go. You are also not told about many of the policies and rules of the company, including offenses that can get you fired."
bad,"The Kohls Corporation's moto is that it is a great place to work. This is not entirely untrue. The company does reward their employees with several benefits such as company lunches and games where they can earn recognition points that can be redeemed for items or paid time off; They also provide an entertainment area where you can  watch T.V. or play foosball or ping pong during your breaks. However the benefits do not out weigh the company's shortcomings. As a full-time employee it is assumed that they will be scheduled for a 40 hour work week however during the winter and summer when sales drop so do their hours. When employees are relying on work to pay their bills they are forced to use their vacation time to make up for 24 or 32 hour scheduled weeks. Also when the company raises the starting pay they do not or just barely increase the employees with seniority's pay, so someone who just started will be making almost the same amount as someone who has been with the company for 5 years. Lastly when the company does the annual raise it is a flat raise across the board, so someone that excels, works hard, and shows initiative is rewarded with the same raise as someone who is constantly late, and is always be spoken to about their work performance."
bad,The work culture I did apprciate a lot and I learned a lot about myself while working here in college. The staff was ok and the management was mediocre  .
bad,"Kohl's is a terrific brand with much room for growth. However, there exists a great rift between top management and first-line management. Communication is strictly top-down with no communication across lines. Organizational problems go unresolved and the company fails to retain talented workers."
bad,"Every day I came in, I would straighten the product while picking up trash. Also I would restock what product was low on. Some days could be slow while other days would be packed with constant customers who needed assistance. The other coworkers were great to get along with and would make a long slow day go by quick with laughter. Nothing could beat helping a customer with what they need while making a connection with them."
bad,I loved the work and moved into different management positions but the new store manager would not put anyone in the ASM program no matter how good and hard they worked.
bad,"Poor pay I spend more money on gas to get there than they pay me. I can cover maybe one of my bills after I pay for gas. Typical corporation strategies, Employees do all the work and don't properly get compensated for it. The rich get richer!"
bad,"I started off getting okay hours. Then, out of nowhere I was lucky if I got 12 hours. They would never schedule me hours but if I requested off they would call and ask if I could come in... Even though they knew that I had approved time off.. unpaid"
bad,Very slow-paced.  The store was too small for the amount of employees it had so it was difficult to get more hours. Some weeks you're lucky if you get 10 hours.
bad,I was a seasonal employee wasn't really liking the hours which is why I rate it low and security well I was seasonal so there you go. It was an ok job very busy
bad,"I loved working for kohl's. The only thing that bothered me was you work very hard for a little pay, and there are no intensives, which I felt that there needed to be.."
bad,"My review is only relative to the single store I worked for, as a poor store manager affects everything. The company itself was fine and policies were average."
bad,"No onboarding. Did not use typical PM tools. Shop was into google applications with no direction on where to save artifacts. "
bad,"kohl's was a great place to work, it is a high paced job when it came to the up keep of the sales floor and dressing rooms. The management staff and other associates were always so helpful."
bad,"I did as much as I could for them. I love having something to do and hate standing still, I can stand still at home, but not at work. So when orders began to get light I asked to learn to drive their equipment trucks so I can be of service to the company. Overall, it's fun for a seasonal job but all year, not so much."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I loved my job and my co-workers. The management was the only problem, myself and a few other employees noticed that the managers like to pick favorites."
bad,I learned how to manage my team & do scheduling. Loved teaching new employees & training them. Was givin planograms & had to reset all the cases according to company standards
bad,Every one is super nice but management was very aloof. This specific location was very hard to maintain. I learned how hard retail is because nothing stays organized.
bad,required a lot of physical work. the money was not good comparing to the amount of work and responsibilities. good experience but would never go back.
bad,"i worked for the season holiday so i don't have much to say. i liked organizing, and helping customers find an outfit or dressing room. the people were nice tahat i worked with."
bad,"Not enjoyable, my management left for vacation when i got hired and other managers yelled at me for doing my job.  Stuck in the back working freight instead of assisting customers when that was supposed to be a part of my job."
bad,"Kohl's was an easy and straightforward job, and you can learn a lot about fashion lines and clothing brands there. Other than that though, there isn't much else to gain from working there. The whole year I worked there a new position to advance never opened up and I received almost no raise the entire time, and I was running shifts for the managers half the time."
bad,I  really enjoyed my job want I was doing. And helping customers want they need. It was a very relaxed job... And also the associates where very kind with me...
bad,Overall a satisfactory company to work for. Employees weren't that great and store management lacked skill.  Benefits aren't that great either. It is a good place to work at. Just not a good place to make a career out of.
bad,"The workplace was an okay environment but the management was not flexible with my school schedule, as I am a full time student. Upon hiring I informed my management team I could not work any more than 15 hours a week and as the weeks progressed I was given 22, 28, and 32 hour work weeks to which I had to eventually quit working there."
bad,Generic Department store that doesn't have competitive pay and you have to be management level to crack 30+ hours. Atmosphere isn't bad and most people are friendly. Advancement is based on the number of Kohls credit card applications you can shove through each day.
bad,"Decent beginner job, lack of hours provided to workers. Friendly staff and managers. A nice relaxed pace job that serves as supplemental income."
bad,"Kohl's is a fun place to work at, however your career advancement is very unlikely due to poor management. Management choose associates to advance, poorly."
bad,they kept you very busy no down time and that is what I like about it. the coworkers was fun to b around with management  I give them an A plus for there support an helping when I couldn't finish the job
bad,You will be overworked and belittled often. Not a good place to be a manager. Hardest part of the job is lack of hours for help maintaining the store. Holiday hours have become rediculous.
bad,"a typical day at Kohl's as a sales associate was very hectic. We were often short staffed while the store had consistent heavy traffic. The company promised a yes we can policy to their customer that we had to uphold, so here is where i got my skills for customer service. We were expected to, if needed, check every store in the district or our stock room for which ever particular item that customer was looking for. The store did great about rewarding us at least once a month with small parties and activities in our break room, giving us food and other goodies. Decent rapport amongst the staff although many disagreement were had in reference to management. Over all it was a positive experience."
bad,Kohl's could be a great company but they under pay the associates considering the workload. The work schedule and needed availability is pure insanity for any full-timer...it is not worth the pay. The associates are the best part of the job because most of them are super friendly and very hard working. But there is no daily acknowledgement for their hard work. You are treated as a dime a dozen. Even if you have been there for over 5 years to even 15 years! Loyalty means nothing to this company.
bad,Learned about supply chain and business management. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor. I learned how to operate doing business to business and from business to store.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Temporary employment through a temporary employment agency as part of a contracted work program, that was only offered for a limited amount of time and for a specified period."
bad,ehh benefits and hours were not great and employees were not treated very well. It was great working with others but the management was not good.
bad,"Works independently and in a team as assigned and moves between job functions as needed. Job functions may include but are not limited to: Order Consolidation, Picking, Packing, Replenishment, Shipping, Receiving, Inventorying, and Re-warehousing. Processing must be completed in a timely manner to maintain established department and location standards/goals."
bad,"a typical day at work starts with partnering up with managment to discuss my waving for the night to make sure we are on the same page as far as production."
bad,"As a seasonal employee, I was lucky enough to get some form of training. Many of my co-workers hadn't even had that, and I'd spend time trying to help them before clocking out."
bad,The management isn't really nice and they give you a hard time about everything and get mad over little things. They wont even let you cross train in other departments when you have qualifications.
bad,They didn't seem to care about there employees stealing from other employee's. I had to call the HR at the corporate office to get the managers and security to check the tapes.
bad,"Worked there for almost 2 years. The job was amazing with my old DLPM. The pay was great and the job you couldn't ask for anything better. But once a new DLPM came into the position everything changed for the worse. I have no problem with things changing but when you have people who go to work to work (which is rare these days) you may want to appreciate that. I've won multiple awards and took my LP career seriously with Kohls. All i can say is if your coming into the company maybe taking a step back actually getting to know who you're working with, maybe even getting to know their background and how they work, before puffing out your chest and trying to prove yourself by force. The reason i left this company is because of the lack of respect i saw given from the DLPM. I wont stand by and see a place i loved turned into a hostile work environment lead by fear from the DLPM. Being fake will always show. I hated to leave the company but its for the best. The company changed but i hope if you're looking into this company you have a better experience then i had in D71"
bad,Apparently your hours are based on how many credits u can solicit and approve within the day..and was told before hire if we ever decided we wanted to try different positions we could just let them know ..for almost 2 yrs I kept applying for other opportunities and positions and vocally expressed to every single manager and person how I wanted to work a different area and was then told I would always be on p.o.s. because im so good at getting credits ..so then I stopped getting as many credits and my hours were dropped to 4 hrs a week!...other than that bit of discouragement and negativity from my managrs I in fact loved being there working there but it was my coworkers and the customers that kept me there this long.
bad,"Very flexible with scheduling, customers make the job more rewarding. No two working days are the same you could be doing a different job function each day. Job never gets boring, its a good workout for the mind and body."
bad,"Low level floor associate, help people with shopping and bring new freight to the floor for sale."
bad,"Working at Kohl's was not good or bad, it just was a job. Its very slow paced environment where the typical employee stands around refolding towels and rugs and clothing most of their day. The appeal of management was to get off of the sales floor. Working in the shoe department was the worst. It was a job, nothing to be passionate about."
bad,"In Loss Prevention Kohls is a good place to start off and get some good experience in what the loss prevention field offers. The tools offered to complete your job are adequate but not stellar. A lot of the experience depends on your direct supervisor. If you have an active District Manager who takes an interest in your development then you may enjoy it even more. However, the pay is typically low, even for people with experience. The benefits package is ok. The potential for promotion after the position of supervisor is almost nonexistent as the DLPM is the direct supervisor of the supervisor, so there are are very few manager positions. The best chance for advancement exist outside the LP chain."
bad,"The internship was a good experiece right out of college.  Howvever, I found the tranisiton difficult, not coming from a retail background, based upon the amount of time I spent cleaning and putting away clothes and just ""doing.""  I would have enjoyed to see more of the management side of the business instead of being treated like a regular associate."
bad,"A typical day at work involved making sure associated scheduled for work showed up for their shift. If not, finding replacements or making the decision on who could be switched to a different department to best fit the shift needing filled. If any floor sets need to be set, having a good team scheduled to complete the set was important. Keeping lines moving at the register and customers happy was the biggest priority."
bad,Kohls customer service is an underpaid job for workers who really bust their butts. They are not flexible with scheduling and the management is not all that great
bad,"Ive worked for kohls for three years now, never before have I been treated as badly by Civilian managment as at kohls. The manager constantly belittles the employes makes snide remarks, and has even threatend to slap me for saying good morning to her. She denys people help, and training. At one point in time when I had pointed out to her that I was never trained for the position she was asking me to fill, her response to me was, oh your smart youll figure it out. The position in question was cashier, now if that doesnt tell you somthing then perhaps lets examin my latest position. I was the Visual supervisor, I asked three times to be trained for this position and was denyed each time. I asked another manager a question and she told me, its not her job to answer my questions. I was left in the dark floating by myself with no support for the entirety of my career at kohls. This company gave me one days worth of training when I first started, yes my very first day I got one day computer based training. If this wasnt enough to tell you how this company fails, then perhaps the way they treat customers should. Go in there one day walk around ask for some help, see how much help you actualy get."
bad,"Expect Long hours, and little recognition for the long hours you put in."
bad,"i was hired on for seasonal help, and they were impressed with my performance so much they kept me, on however my hours were dramatically reduced and I was forced to find other employment"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Job is simple restocking or ticketing. The people are great. I've learned how to set things for new products. Very difficult to get full time, especially after holidays, so its not reliable. It was fine for when in school but have a BA and looking for a better opportunity."
bad,A typical day at work was helping customers & performing my job duties. I've learned to have a lot of Patience with customers even if they give you a hard time. The management & My Co-Workers were GREAT! . The hardest part of the job was cleaning the back storage room after a long day of work. The most enjoyable part was actually getting up & going to work everyday.
bad,Helping customers and other associates with whatever they need help with. Do some paper work in C/S and deal with phone calls and computer look UPS if necessary.
bad,Atypical day at work is sitting on cameras for 8 hours spending your time stressed out trying to catch a shoplifter due to the pressures your district manager places on you to catch a case.
bad,"Worked both Home and Kids Departments, mostly putting merchandise out on the sales floor. A lot of customers at this particular store shop like animals, allowing their children to misbehave and run around like screaming banshees. It makes it difficult to put new merchandise onto the sales floor within the company's desired time frame when you've got to clean up a huge mess created by customers prior to doing so."
bad,"Kohls is okay for a VERY part time job. The store manager is awesome, but only expect 16 hrs a week. The other managers at 1st seem to be on a power trip. Nice, but not very helpful. The training you will get is kinda done halfa**. But it is easy enough to catch on. NO ONE wants to help out the P.O.S (point of sale) employees. However everyone is polite. When you do work P.O.S you HAVE to push the credit card HARD onto customers. A manager literally stands over you or is talking in your ear (walkies head set) pushing to get everyone to sign up for a card. I do completely understand the asking for credit cards, but it does become rude when they say I have one, then you are suppose to ask whom ever else is with them (husband, 18 year old kid, etc). The employees are mainly older and very nice.  Over all its not a bad place to work."
bad,"When I got hired I got no training. I was getting trained by 16 year old cashiers and they were throwing me from person to person because nobody knew how to train. They told me “I just got out of  training yesterday so idk how to train you”. When I first got hired, they put me in the back room to do online training. One of the managers come in the office to talk to another manager and was loudly making rude  comments about me, and I feel like it was definitely on purpose. The discounts are cool, the job itself really is easy, but I was promised full time and I only got maybe 9 hours a week. My schedule was WEIRD. They also hired too many people and didn’t know how to handle it."
bad,Bias groups within management I however enjoyed working with my employees. Was not assisted much with co-managers but managed. I can see some toxic interactions with them that i tended to stay away from.
bad,"If you are a cashier your main job is to get people to sign up for credit cards. However, a lot of people that go there already have their Kohl's credit card or really do not want one. There was a lot of pressure from management to sell credit cards."
bad,The pay is the absolute worst thing about this job. They start out at $9 unless it has went up. So sad.  Then the raise I got was .23 cents an hour. Woo hoo.
bad,It’s slow all the time they are very unorganized. The managers always had attitudes. Cousmters can be really rude at times. They’ll say some smart comments.
bad,Kohl's is a great company to work for.  They have great benefits.  My delima was the growth opportunities and the environment.  The company culture wasn't the best.
bad,"Kohl's is probably a nice place to shop at, and possibly work for in other locations. I worked as a seasonal sales associate and did not enjoy my time. I think it was the coworkers and how much managers expected of me. In less than 3 months, they had me work in 6 different departments, and half of the time I was alone. It's very hard to learn when nobody is there to help. For example, on my first day I was assigned in a department but I was unsure what the initials on the paper meant, so I had no idea where to even go. I had to find someone just to explain to me what department I was working in. They also had me working in the biggest departments of the store, by myself so there wasn't much I could do to keep it completely clean. Overall, my experience would have been slightly more enjoyable if my coworkers were a little nicer and closer to my age. I also would have enjoyed it more if there was more direction. They kind of just throw you out there. I would go back for another season, but not to work permanently."
bad,"It a really nice place to work with friendly people around you."
bad,"Management is not nice, was never trained properly and they have an attitude when you were never trained. Never enough cashiers or enough staff working the freight team. Not enough hours to live off of always less than 20 hours a week & 4-6 hour shifts. Although I worked with some nice teammates. Also such a high turnover rate in my few months. Discount was most enjoyable"
bad,I was a jewelry associate at Kohl's. I felt isolated in the department because other associate couldn't offer much help because they are not trained on how to test diamonds and how to read the jewelry codes. When I asked for assistance and had several customers waiting management either ignored my request or shower up after the customer left an dun happy because of the wait. The culture was negative and showed favoritism. I did however enjoyed black Friday because I had other jewelry associates to help and actually had a fun time and the 12 hour shift flew by.
bad,"the hardest part was trying to help the customer remain clam talk to them nicely, tend to their needs and concerns."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Very fast paced; emphasis on speed.  If you are quick and enjoy working alone this might be a good fit for you.  Reminder:  you are working in a warehouse, therefore hot in the summer time."
bad,"The job was nice, but I was only needed for the busy months. I from what I expirence, it was a good job. They were able to work with my school schedule as well."
bad,There's nothing really all that great about working in retail in general and Kohl's is not an exception.  Too many responsibilities for the pay rate of associates.
bad,"I worked at kohl's Tukwila there was very nice co-workers and help each other, the manager was so good and kind, the only thing that makes you feel stress in this job is open credit they make me so stressful when they obligate the associate to open new credit whatever it takes, you have to open new credit at least one credit per day .but guys to be honest all the supervisors and co-worker are so helpful and kind ."
bad,The best thing I could say about this job were the people. Everyone on staff was very kind and there were plenty of days where management would bring in sandwiches or something.
bad,"Very fickle scheduling, you may work 40 hours a week during the holidays and 10 hours a week during the summer. Couple this with poor pay and benefits. Not recommended."
bad,"Kohl's started out as a great place to work, but when management changed, the workplace took a negative turn.  New store manager was always in his office and cared more about how the employee's perceived him then he did on the business itself.  Corporate had high expectations but did not provide the tools needed to accomplish the tasks.  Worked 50-60 hours a week to try to accomplish half of what needed to be done."
bad,"It was an alright workplace. Definintly more horror stories than fairy tales. But I met some fun people. The job was repetitive, and people were rude (I'm talking about management)"
bad,"There is a big difference with this review, I worked for a district not the store but my base store was in Asheville . My boss over the district was the most amazing person to work for now on the other hand the store manager was the most disrespectful person... He treated people like they were dirt. He was the most uncaring person"
bad,"Worked for Kohl's for two years, loved working here. Great people to work with. after two years was still unable to move up and may employees received on average 4 hours a week only."
bad,Kohls was a little easy going. I worked a lot of hours their because they knew I was a reliable worker. the only thing I had a problem with was you were competing to get credits.
bad,"This place is same as any other retail store. the turn over rate is high because they pay so little and run you into the ground , the managers mostly suck while the employees are great and make the job fun."
bad,Kohls is a chill laid back place to work. It's slow until holiday time and management has no communication among one another.
bad,"All though i started at the peek of christmas season, it was a cool place to work. all the merchandise i got to see first and the discount was great."
bad,I like the work but totally disagree with the management style and the treatment of the associated. I feel that good management/supervision can be done and still get the job done when you treat your personnel right.
bad,was an easy job lots of hours. Job training was easy staff was friendly and helpful. coworkers were friendly and easy toget along with I would work there again
bad,"fun place to work but not alot of hours.family friendly environment, good place to shop.seasonal job.bright lights and wide range of employee.i didnt learn anything new my time was short. my co-workers were respectable .the hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Not being allowed to manage and maintain my department like necessary, never staffing my department when I wasn't there, which overloaded my job when I was there. Co workers were fun and helping people was too."
bad,"Customer service oriented, great place to work, upper management ill-prepared to fully complete all tasks in the store on a timely manner."
bad,I got along well with my co-workers and managers. Everyone was very nice. I didn't enjoy the job itself too much though. It was a very boring job.
bad,"the job isn't hard to do and you can quickly catch onto it. Basic skills are needed such as counting money, talking to people, and knowing how to scan and bag items. There is a lot of customer interactions and it gets busy around the holidys."
bad,"I enjoyed working 2nd shift at Kohls, but management did a poor job of helping employees. No longer employed there. Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I work here at kohl's at Bayshore Mall from 10pm to 6am for 8.25 an hour. Now I knew what I was getting paid when I first signed up to do this and they told me I make a dollar more than the the employees who work the day shifts but that little money they pay you isn't worth working overnight, especially with the work we put in. We process the merchandise off U-Boat carts which can take an hour or two to do depending which department you get assigned to work in. I work in kids majority of the times and that usually takes two hours to finish my first u-boat. The job is simple. Just cut open the box, take out the merchandise then place it in the correct area of the department. But oh my goodness that can become real tedious if come across a package of merchandise that needs to be taking out of the plastic. But what makes that tedious is the fact that I can't wear my headphones to listen to my music. We don't talk much on the job cause we be in separate departments getting work done so that makes the job really dull. Most of us walk around like zombies throughout the night. I don't see why were not allowed to at least have one ear bud in. I know work isn't about having fun but its not a back aching job, I shouldn't be dreading to come to work. They expect a lot to get done because the store is closed and we don't get interrupted by customers so my manager can get pushy at times. Like talking to me as if I'm her child. But for the most part she's friendly. But the pay...ohhh the pay. Loading u-boats,dragging them from the stockroom to sales floor then back, back stocking whatever"
bad,At first working for Kohls was great. But once i was promoted things took a turn for the worst. They forced me to quit due to the harassment i suffered at the hands from my superiors.
bad,"good teamwork,just overall not happy with rankings, Some of the management team would lash out at you depending on your job, and weren't always accessible."
bad,unloading trucks and putting merchandise on shelf talking to customers
bad,"Not a hard job, but the only way to obtain more hours were to convince people to get their credit card. It felt shady doing so and tough convincing people to get it. In the end before I quit, I was given a mere 4-6 hours a week of work. On the plus side, co-workers were fun and great people."
bad,"Generally there is very limited people out on the sales floor, you as the manager are responsible for ensuring the merchandise sets get changed. Sales floor presentation is up to par."
bad,A typical day at kohl's consist of being ready to work in any dept. asked of you on a moments notice regardless of job title. I've learned from kohl management and co-workers is to keep your head down and work you'll get faster results.The hardest part of working at kohl's has to be dealing with each customers personal problem dealing with the store and being open to hearing each complaint.The most enjoyable has to be the employee culture.
bad,"Fast paced as most retail positions are, but that was great for me. Very stressful position in which I felt overwhelmed and undertrained. Management is just as stressed. I learned to hold everyone accountable."
bad,Most of the time my co workers would not show up at work and they got a way with it all the time. But it was a huge set back for us at work because we had to work even harder for them.
bad,"I like the people, but I hate feeling like I have to harass people to open up a Kohl's Charge Card or give out their emails for sales alerts."
bad,"Typically I just go around assisting customers find what they need, organizing and putting returns back onto the floor for sale. I sometimes assist on POS or customer service. I have learned that I am a hard worker, but it doesnt get me far with this company. I am not appreciated for the work I do at all and feel very worthless to the management. Coworkers are nice, but in my own words, snobby. The hardest part of the job, is dealing with management. Most enjoyable, would be getting to work with people instead of by myself as I usually am."
bad,"Excellent work hours , deversified co workers , talking to corp. On a daily basis"
bad,when i worked there it was a reall good experance for my first retail job. the only problem was the hours arent steady and the management at the time was not very considerate to others
bad,"Work was decent for first year, but steadily dwindled down to next to no hours."
bad,"The job was not worth the effort I put into it. I'm the type to want to put in a lot of hard work into a job. Csutomers would scream at you and demand management if anything went other than exactly how they wanted it to go, even if they were trying to use expired coupons or misreading sale signs. Seasonal manager made me super uncomfortable. No one seemed to like him though."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Its like a high school you get paid to attend. Managers are childish and love to play and gossip. Work you like a slave just to let you go once all work is completed.
bad,"•	Seasonal Position "
bad,"I was only trained for 2 days on cashier and not trained for any other positions I worked, I was told to lie to customers about the Kohl's credit card and management only cares about Kohl's cards even though I only made 1$ per card I opened and would get mad if I didn't meet the quota. I was constantly yelled at by many customer about things I had no control over."
bad,Some of the management where easy to work with others were not. At times it felt like you were being told 10 different things by 3 different people. management didn't seem to work well together.
bad,"At the Cottage Grove Kohls location, there only exists stress, and a terribly rude management. You are berated for making mistakes, and management treats you like trash. I definitely do NOT recommend working here."
bad,"Working at Kohls you are expected and scolded by management to do an abundance of things at once (online orders, ring as additional for cashier, cleaning out fitting rooms, helping customers and keeping the sales floor clean) without any actual priority at all. The mission is to put customers first, however if you are stopped by customers and help them find what they are looking for, you are yelled at for not having everything else in perfect shape. The store is always a mess because they dont staff each department enough to keep things cleanly and only will schedule extra people to fold down tables when they know there will be a visit from the district manager. There  are days you are expected to go with out breaks, in order to make up for THEIR understaffing. Im tired of leaving work  feeling bad about my job EVERY single day. You definitely do NOT get paid enough for everything you are put through with this company."
bad,"I liked working for kohls, i just did not like working for the specific store that i was in. Management did not respect their employees and that is not what Kohls is about. I love Kohls Cares events."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. If youre young and still in high school, it could be a great part time job. But, if you are an adult...no. They pay poorly. They do not care about their employee's. "
bad,"Was an Intern, fell in love with the company. Training was a 8 week program. I was placed in a store after 4.5 weeks. Placed basically with a sink or swim mentality. The company expects you to spend 70% of your time leading others and 30% doing non management tasks. The ratio is actually 90% non management tasks. Most of my time is spend doing non exempt task. My store manager is incompetent and upper management does not seem to care. Brought to upper management about his behavior and it is shrugged off. It all ends up depending on the store your placed and the team given. My team is only paid minimum wage so we get the worst of employees. When a good one comes around we generally loose them to a higher paying job. We have to start off interviews telling applicants that we pay $9 and hour to avoid wasting their and our time. The company seems to be heading in a downward spiral just adding workload and not really adding staff or hours. They expect you to turn a 20K unit truck in 4 hours and after realizing that I could NOT be done in 4 hours changed it to 3 hours! Kohl's will kill itself, just a matter of time."
bad,"i didn’t like working here. not a little bit. i worked there maybe a month, worse experience of my life. save your mental health, don’t go. get a job at walmart or something, probably better off."
bad,Working in a warehouse is for someone who is fit and likes working in a fast paced environment. Very time to use restroom because the time away impacts your production level.
bad,"Working at this distribution center was overall a learning experience. I learned that I will not work at a place where the management is poor and you cant go to supervisors about anything. We pretty much had to figure things out on our own, which lead to multiple mistakes and unnecessary attitudes from our superiors. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"I worked for Kohls for 4 years and hated this job, never looked back when I left. It’s management at its finest; 1)constantly pushing you to get credits and in some cases dishonestly 2) Always adding more to your work duties and no appreciation for what you do and little help, 3) raises were a joke for the work that’s is exexpected"
bad,When working at Kohl's I was only seasonal. I was working two jobs at the time and only the night shift at Kohl's. I mostly worked in the fitting rooms so you're on your feet for a long period of time.
bad,This a place that takes shortcuts to ensure that you don't go over 40 hours   and get any benefits. They take advantage of the hard-working employees   and don't have enough employees working on sales floor.
bad,"Not the worst place in the world to work, but people here do make work unpleasant sometimes. Lots of drama, picking favorites, and management could be a little better."
bad,Management is very poor they want you to do work you were not hired for but will not pay you more for that work. Slackers get let off the hook easily while hard workers are given too much work. Management likes to gossip and does not lead by example. Pay is very poor as well they need to increase it. Would not recommend unless desperate.
bad,"The managers were good the other employees were great.  The pay and benefits at Kohl's are some of the worst in retail.  Hourly pay is extremely low, no company matching 401k,  and a lot of in store rules.  You could work almost anywhere else and make more per hour."
bad,I enjoyed interacting with the customers. But I didn't like working there with a store manager accusing me of things and belittling me when I was attempting to learn. Management definitely had its favorites and it was quite obvious.
bad,"Management is quite horrible, I have had a hard time getting them to accommodate me while I have a broken foot, I am constantly belittled and treated like I am nothing. I have sacrificed my mental and physical health (continued working while I was ill and was struggling mentally) and have only been treated like a child and that I do not know how to do my job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"The ppl who actually work there full time hate it, simply because of how the place is ran, PTO for the place is shady seeing how when the system says they have PTO they are denied it."
bad,"While the employee discounts on merchandise are a definite perk to working here, the company appears to be overall too invested in pushing store credit cards onto customers. Training for these card solicitations focused on repeatedly asking the customer to open a charge account. While asking once at the beginning of a transaction and once at the end is sufficient enough, management stressed employees should ask multiple times during the transaction as well. In my experience, asking customers more than 2 times was overboard, and customers were more likely to express frustration, and even sometimes, anger. It seemed to me the company cared more about pushing credit than building an excellent customer experience."
bad,"work is highly fast paced and demanding, not flexible with hours even though you are told they are, lazy management, not paid enough for the amount of work you do, will give students less than 15 hours a week."
bad,"There was a very low morale throughout all of the non-managerial employees. A very negative vibe, lots of poor work ethic and people did not want to work together or have each other's backs"
bad,"You get to meet a variety of people, from a multitude of backgrounds. That said, when it came to my position, it was indeed retail... I would say the flexible hours were great for when I was going to college, after I graduated I did feel that I had outgrown this particular job."
bad,"Khols is a good place to work , their pay is great and the hours are good but the environment isn’t a good work environment and the employees are rude"
bad,"The work itself was not bad to deal with. The other people working in the store however were awful. If you didn't fit in with the ""cool"" people you got the worst tasks assigned to you. People talked behind each others backs constantly and they ignore a persons work ethic over what they look like or what department they work in."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Kohls.  They always put unrealistic pressure on cashiers to open new Kohls charges, and didn't do a very good job training and preparing me for the position."
bad,"I do not want to answer these questions they have nothing to do with me wanting a different job, what I think of a past employer as nothing to do with this"
bad,"Save your time and find a job somewhere else.  Always understaffed, staff is always overworked. The customers don't care about keeping it clean so you're endlessly folding and hanging clothes until the end of your shift.  Managers keep you past your scheduled time until they let you leave. Its also extremely hot in the building all the time."
bad,If you have a family i would not recommend you you to work here if you need to survive but ir a fun job for a student or a summer job if anyone is looking for one the discounts are ok
bad,store manager created an environment that most associates disagreed with. he was condescending and rude to employees and had unrealistic standards on a daily basis.
bad,mangers ask multiple times in your shift is you made credit sales and how many and based on this you can have your hours cut or get fired. overall sales are more important than customer service. kohls is big on integrity and says do not give out freebies so you have to be careful on what is alright to accommodate because you could get fired for that.
bad,"good overall place to work hardest part of job is standing on your feet for long periods of time. i leaned a great deal about other people and their work ethic and attitudes toward a common goal. we had a district manager that was involved enough to care about our lives after khols, which was great it actually felt like family."
bad,"As a minor, I was given multiple sources of information on when I was allowed to work, take my breaks, etc. Each manager had their own rules and I would be talked to for doing something another manager insisted was what I had to do (like clocking out on time). On top of that, the people that I worked with were not the most friendly as I was the youngest on staff and worked few hours (high school student), so I did not look forward to going into work every day."
bad,It would be a good job for new workers with little experience in the job market to have. It paid just barely over minimum wage but not enough to excel and to make it a long lasting job to keep.
bad,"My above Rating of this company will speak volumes.  The 4 stars on Management is due ONLY to my immediate District Manager.  The workplace culture is 'stressed' both in the LP and OP areas, with both having to make due with the policies set forth that are inadequate, to say the least."
bad,"Job responsibilities include customer care, cash handling, balancing drawer at end of shift, re-stocking of merchandise and helping with online orders."
bad,"not the best job if your an adult looking to live of the pay."
bad,kohls is the worst company to possibly work for. its is not a company that anyone should work for. the customers nor the company have any regard for the fact that you are also a human being.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,I would work alone in shoes and always asked to go to other departments when I had my own jobs to take care of first. I learned to stock and back stock faster than before because I would work with more inventory. hardest part of my job was working alone and not having anyone to ask for help.
bad,The environment was terrible. I hated working there because I got headaches and it was understaffed. The music got annoying but the only nice thing was the staff was friendly.
bad,"I loved my managers and I was there for over two years, the pay was not well at all. Every time I had a review, there was nothing negative in it as I was top is rewards, credit, and surveys."
bad,"They expect way too much of their people, and come down hard when those expectations aren't met. As a whole, the company creates a very stressful environment."
bad,you work the same day over and over everything is the same you sale and work with customers as you would with most retail stores. got to know many great coworkers.
bad,Everything is extremely competitive. Managers are mediocre at best. Will constantly rush you but will have you doing 8 different things at once. They are poor at teaching but expect you to do everything right. Coworkers are rude and unfriendly. Worked in two different locations with the same experience.
bad,At my particular store they promoted someone who was not ready for a managerial role and I left due to their lack of professionalism. Overall the job was easy and paid decently
bad,Not an enjoyable place. Saw many able bodied employees be passed on a promotion because someone was brought in externally. Many other employees were rude to each other and had drama.
bad,"A typical day at work included cleaning out fitting rooms and operating the register if point of sale needed help. The job isn't very challenging and I didn't learn anything while I was there. Management is strict but values their employees. The company is pretty lenient and accommodating. They have values. The store does not have a nice atmosphere and it plays super annoying songs over and over again (obviously that's not a big deal but I thought I'd mention it). The employees are kind of off-putting and don't make new people feel welcome. You have to work there for awhile to feel like you fit in. The dress code is just wearing dress clothes. Nothing about the job is really challenging, but as a warning, expect your shift to go by very slowly. The job isn't very enjoyable."
bad,The job wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It was alot more fast paced and stressful and at the time I was working for them I was pregnant with my son. I wasn't able to do as much as the other employees. I worked there for the job and needed the money till I had found another job.
bad,"Not an excellent workplace. Good money. Managers are unprofessional, I would not recommend anyone to work here. This was the worst job experience of my life"
bad,"I work here for about a year, and most of the job i didn't have a problem with. I would ring up customers and work on the floor putting out merchandise and displays. But I didn't like how at the end of the day, if we hadn't met the quota for signing up credit cards, the manager would have the employees sign up for them. I was asked multiple times to sign up, even if i would say no, they would pressure me to."
bad,An ok place to start learning retail. Teaches computer skills and  working with the public.  Not a lot of room for advancement . Low pay. Lack of team work ethic.
bad,"Kohl's had a very flexible scheduling department which can be of great benefit for students or other people looking for part time positions. A typical day involves keeping the store in good order, interacting with all types of personalities both in form of customers and employees. While, many of the hourly employees are great to work with, management puts unrealistic expectations on certain departments when it comes to meeting credit card quota. Sometimes they perform questionable practices that make one wonder how far they will truly go to satisfy a customer while bending store policies. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly is subjective. Everyday is different and every customer is different."
bad,"not good place to work for, personally I do not like working at Kohls"
bad,"Would advise management for more hours"
bad,"You enter at a minimum wage of $8.25. The good thing about this company though is that they accommodate to you if you are a student. It really is fast paced at times, so you would have to enjoy busy times in order to get through them."
bad,"At first when I started I thought it was a wonderful company to work for. That was only because the location I was a part of was the number one store in the company for that year and the next year. When the success faded, everything fell apart."
bad,Managers were not very organized. Would schedule me for an overnight and then schedule for opening the next same day. Managers would call asking for me to come into work during time I told them I was not available. Coworkers were great.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Overall this job was very wasteful, i felt like my talent was wasted here, although my customer service improved. During the day i basically cleaned up after customers and restocked merchandise."
bad,"Like working in receiving department, interesting truck process; don't have choice of job tasks, not able to interact with customers on regular basis."
bad,It was nice working there... It just gets cold sometimes. I enjoyed it... Im sad that my assignment ended. I scanned boxes. I had a team wit two men that moved my freight for me.
bad,A typical day at kohl's consisted of merchandising freight/replenishing the store floor and working the cash register selling credit to the customer aswell as answering any questions a customer may have.
bad,They where not the best place to work. It was an ok first job but unloading a truck and putting things away at 6 am is not ideal for anyone.
bad,I enjoy working with people and making sure they leave Khols happy. I get along very well with my co-workers. During the holiday season it becomes very difficult to get hours due to the new hires for seasonal.
bad,Stocked clothing and helped customers when they wanted an opinion on an outfit that they were looking at. Ran a cash register and signed people up for Kohl's cards.
bad,Expect long hours and little quality of life. Payroll is not sufficient to assist customers and do the work to be done.  Would not recommend working there.
bad,i worked very hard and did a great job but i was constantly told by a manager that my job was done better by another associate. i got my hours cut constantly because i addressed my issue with the manager.
bad,usual stresses during shift but management lied too much. although i did learn how to properly execute a well organized plan to keep a department presentable.
bad,I like the work that I do at kohls its just not enough hours a typical working day at kohls unload truck and bring the items out to the floor
bad,"Hours are terrible."
bad,The corporation is very much business and no fun. My coworkers have may not followed the rules exactly but they did not need to be fired. They didnt commit a crime or steal but gave an extra discount to a customer. They didnt need to be fired.
bad,I didn't like working there because I felt that the management could have been more professional but overall it was okay in terms of a part time retail position.
bad,Most of what I learned here was what not to do.  Many of the managers were not engaged with the staff and I didn't feel the team atmosphere that I have enjoyed in other employment.
bad,"Company is solid, great benefits and vacation for management. need more floor staff for busy days and recovery. need to have more of a team environment between staff and management."
bad,"performed customer service for the holiday, with duties such as the  cash register, inventory control shipmwnt processor mostly in the jewlery department"
bad,"when they are having a sale its busy and you get a lot of hours "
bad,I feel the position was misrepresented as I have worked mainly as an executive/administrative assistant and certain aspects of my current job as a part time employee is putting together a weekly schedule and this sometimes interferes greatly with my other duties.
bad,"Management was nice but they would always look down on you and get rude if you didn't get any credits, you only get really short breaks,"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,This was a very stressful place to work if you can't solicit credit cards well. The managers were okay. They seemed to care more about making sure we hit our credit card goal for the day than anything else
bad,"I was told I was going to be hired as a supervisor, then they fired me two days later saying I was not following company procedure. I was improperly trained. I was in the top as far as numbers went for the store. I drove their numbers higher, and they set me up."
bad,"A typical day is getting there and either knowing where to go or a manger will tell you what they would prefer you to do that day. I've learned since only doing the register, how to run customer service and take phone calls, clean fitting rooms, and work in the departments. Management does need to work on communication. My co-workers are pretty fun, but there are some that you would have to worry about. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with some customers. Most enjoyable part would be the people that make you laugh."
bad,"It's usually busy. I didn't learn much. Management sucked sometimes depending who was there. Co workers were cool, very friendly. I hated not being properly trained and enjoyed a few things there."
bad,"My day consisted of stocking the sales floor and interacting with customers."
bad,Am too old to be told when I can go to the bathroom.  I do not like having to repeat the same sales pitch to every person. Most co-workers did not care about the company.
bad,Unloading shipment and distribution to proper departments. Provided excellent customer service. Stocking merchandise and working with others. Helping customers with their shopping experience.
bad,"A typical day at work would be maintaiang the sales floor and helping customers. The management at kohls was okay but not great, they all arent trustworhy and talk behind your back."
bad,Low wages and hours dont encourage workers. Needs more opportunity for growth in company.
bad,This job will only last about one month you will only get two weeks of full time work which is around black Friday. Don't sign up for the night shift because that is the shift that will get messed over.
bad,Retail work is boring and redundant but it's a job that needs to be done basically cleaning up after shoppers and helping them with anything they maybe looking for.
bad,"Performed cash transactions for customer purchases and assisted with final purchases."
bad,My review with Khols warehouse is that you get good pay but you don't get your hours to work because of low volume (not enough work)
bad,I was not happy working for kohls they were way to pushie on you getting customers to sign up for a credit card.
bad,"Difficult organization to remain loyal to, as it proved in so many ways that it had no concern for associates."
bad,"work was pleasant ,did not learn much management was poor .putting away go backs , dressing rooms ,helping customers"
bad,The managers were very nice about my schedules; they worked around my school schedule and understood my school schedule.
bad,"Management is a favoritism department that doesn't fulfill its promises to their employees. Job security is a worry with all Seasonal and Temp employees, as well as Part-Time employees, although their main concern is acquiring hours. A great job for transitioning into a healthy and productive job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"I worked the register every time I worked, dealt with friendly people and a lot of unfriendly people"
bad,"My co-workers were great, but the store was not always efficient in staffing or expectations. They expected one person to be able to help customers, stock, and keep the department clean and they expected this one person to cover three departments at a time. It was a temp job, so no one really wanted to get attahced to the new workers, so not everyone was nice or welcoming or helpful and sometimes that meant management."
bad,Work during the holiday shopping time and things were crazy busy  and you really didnt get much help.
bad,kohls was very well organized good job for a student looking for something part time
bad,"Retail job"
bad,"No area for promotion, management fine, just no room for lp development"
bad,Kohls is a nice company to work for. I have gained great relations with people at this company.
bad,no review. was not happy with working condition or management
bad,you get paid minimum wage and very low hours. They don't schedule you and then call you on your day off to come in.
bad,"It was a ok place to work, but their wasn't much to do most of the time."
bad,"Kohl's is a great retailer. They provide exceptional customer service. They go to great lengths to ensure customer satisfaction. Their TOTAL focus is on the customers from a PR perspective. Because of that, there is no time or resources left to put toward their associates on the front line. If they fix that, they could be a wonderful company to work for."
bad,"I thought that this company was a difficult one to work for. There was a constant stress from the managers to get an unreasonable amount of work done by the end of the night. This isn't just an opinion. At the end of each shift there would be a meeting and the managers would tell you how much everyone didn't accomplish, and it never made the job fun or enjoyable to work at. There was always a lot of work for little pay."
bad,"Seemingly good job. I am interested in relocating anf trying different store positions. Great training, lack of company communication"
bad,"On a normal day at work, I am in charge of a department where I answer customer requests, solve problems and make sure the department as well as the store as a whole looks neat for customers to shop comfortably. Being there for 3 years, I have the training to work at the customer service desk as well as the jewelry counter."
bad,i worked at pos and in different departments including customer service co workers were friendly the hardest part was dealing with un ruley customers
bad,"This job has no challenge, low pay and have to work weekend and holidays."
bad,I love the job and the people I worked with. The management team was unorganized . You ask one boss a question and get  told by another that it's wrong. They would agree with you and then change their minds. Just unorganized as to how the store should be run.
bad,"My typical day at work is the extremely messy dressing rooms and putting up recovery, sometimes backing up on the registers as well as working other departments such as Mens, Juniors, & Intimates. I think my managers are very unorganized which is why I want to leave. I like my co workers most of them are very nice and fun to talk to. The most enjoyable party..I don't think I have one. I learned how to  deal with customers in a professional way."
bad,I worked in the back unloading the trucks and once in a wile I would run the cash register
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Kohls has hard working people that work there but the only thing is wrong upper management don't care and don't respect the people they do have. That is why there is such a tuner round and people leaving in with a two week of them being hired.
bad,"A typical work day we would put clothing back, communicate and help out customers, clean up the store. I've learned how to work fast and how stores work to help make it a better experience to be at that store. The hardest part of the job was having to constantly hang and put away clothing."
bad,"Working in fine jewelry, I had to worry about safety and security.  I was somewhat stressful after the first robbery"
bad,"Judgmental associates, not nice to new-comers. Very unfriendly and make you feel like you're out of place if you don't have the best/newest style clothes or shoes. Worse than high school!"
bad,"It was an ok job. I didnt get that many hours. "
bad,I barely am tolerated. I had my orientation and was supposed to receive a call with a schedule. Never did. Week goes by I call and get a very nasty manager. I need a job badly with this market so I didn't yell or get angry. I came in for training was supposed to get my next shift...was told I'd get a call...never did. I called again as another week has passed by...again the manager chews me out and calls me by the wrong name. No schedule. I get a phone call now after another week asking what has happened to me and now all of a sudden I'm on the schedule. Are you serious? Just bad business. I have no clue what is expected of me and the pay is extremely low. Employees badmouth and swear at each other. I've only had two shifts. Its unbearable.
bad,"In this position I enjoyed the customer service aspect; I like talking to customers and helping them when they had questions. This position for me, however, was never meant to be long term, rather just short term supplemental income as I completed graduate school and searched for another job. "
bad,Fast
bad,"Store was always short on staff, and the departments were always messy. There were never enough POS Associates at the front of the store to provide customer service."
bad,Most of the managers were rude and demanding. They almost immediately put you right to work expecting you to be a pro at every task.
bad,"Kohl's department store hires a lot of people all of the time, and it seems as though people come and go so fast."
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's was basically the same as Kimco. Except the management was better, they had themselves organized more and they knew what would happen next or what was going on with their products. The co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job would probably be the receiving and shipping. We would have to make sure all merchandise went to the right companies. Actually everything about this job was enjoyable."
bad,I have been with the company for 2 year and have learned that at least in my dept that time with the company along with productivity and work ethic will not advance you let alone give you an adequate raise for the things that you do.
bad,I loved a few of my managers but the store manager got out of hand about a few things. We stayed late every night due to under staff for the day. Would never go back.
bad,Was at the returns desk the whole time of my employment. It seemed that their were a lot of returns.
bad,I couldn't give an example of a typical day at work because i was there for seasonal help. I handled merchandise and got to learn customer service.
bad,"The management didn't really know how to manage the store. Friendly co-workers, and excellent benefits of working at Kohls."
bad,Putting clothes where they have to be. I learne to fold clothes and some sale techniques. Management was great but co-workers acted like children. Pay was not good either for the ammount of work we had to do.
bad,"I never got what I needed done a lot of the time. The store was always understaffed, and the managers had their workers go in other departments and clean, then to another department and clean, and so on. The hardest part of the job was running around the store doing other things. The most enjoyable part was the customers. A lot of them were really nice to me."
bad,"Good place to work great employee discounts, good team work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,"Lexington is one of the busier stores in our district so it expected that things are fast paced and kinda crazy on weekends. However, the percentage of the time that the store isn’t busy/normal, the managers/supervisors treat you like you are worthless. You can tell that when they are stressed, they put it all solely on you if you are in their way. They aren’t reasonable with your responsibilities and are harsh if things go not perfect."
bad,"I knew the 2nd day on my job I hated it, four months later I can’t stand it. You almost never clock out on time (I clocked out 3 hours past my original time!), the expect way to much for $9/hr, the managers harass you about getting credit cards, and the day is overall stressful. The store does get busy often, and you have long lines, but that’s reasonable, the problem is doing the job itself. I hate even thinking of going back to work because i always have to worst experience, the only thing that keeps me going were a some nice co-workers, but most of them quit, and soon I’ll be next. If you love fast-paced high stressful jobs, be my guest."
bad,It was seasonal  I love work with  The coworkers and customers . I wish it wasn’t seasonal.  The managermet was great . The work place was quite . Not being trained on some of the  equipment
bad,Very difficult place to work at and I don't think it's healthy company for the things you endure with the customer and upper management.  My store manager was outstanding and I'm very grateful for him.
bad,They need to focus on employees needs before their own management needs more training than what is given. They need a family day to interact with employees.
bad,"The actual work of loading the trucks seems easy. But at the pace they want you to move and the number of boxes they want loaded in the truck will quickly wear you out, Even for a young person. You work by yourself for the most part. By the end of the shift I definitely felt the pain in my feet and legs."
bad,"Kohls is a great place ro work, but the amnagament had not schedualed me the hours that i wanted to work. They also started scheduling me when i couldn't work"
bad,"You need to push credit card applications on people to keep your job. If you don't get many credits, they cut your hours and only give the hours to people who get tons of credits. The store is quite slow but gets busy at times."
bad,I first started out on  register and I was able to fenture out and work other departments of the store so that was good. The management is good as well
bad,"Working at Kohl's was a great way to gain experience in retail and get the experience necessary to then search fro a better job. In terms of raises you'll be looking at .05 cents to .50 and that was considered a ""good"" raise once a year. The pros of the company is that they do work around school and are very flexible with that. However looking back they over work their employees especially management and supervisors for a horrible pay. Some mangers are great and others will talk down on you just like any other retail job. I worked as a cashier, customer service, jewelry department, beauty and even worked in the fitting rooms. By far the easiest was being a cashier plus you get a little bonus to .50-1.50 for each credit application you do and they really push for credit. The most difficult position for me was working in the fitting rooms. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the people I worked with."
bad,"Love what I did the customers were great "
bad,Typically i would work in the mens section and I would fold clothes and clean the dressing room. I learned how to fold clothes and work with a team
bad,"Typical day as a P.O.S. is just clock in find out what side of the store you're working at and remain there for the day. Work as cashier, if it is empty you'll be put to keep the store organized and clean. Managers constantly bark at you to get someone a credit card by the end of the day. You have to promote the Kohl's Charge Card persistently which can be difficult since majority of shoppers already have one. Kohl's employee discount is a joke of 15% off. Harassed by another employee and a manager together to sign up for the Kohl's Card Card while I working as a cashier when there was a long line. Majority of co workers were adults who worked there for years, or high schools students. The only thing I enjoyed is the free food they sometimes offer in the break rooms."
bad,"Over all the environment and the fellow coworkers are pleasant. The management team shows favoritism to certain employees. If you become a favorite, hours will become a plenty and work will be filled with joy because you'll be able to play and work along you pals unlike the rest of the staff which whom get in trouble for getting caught speaking to another employee. The workload that is expected of one employee is down right crazy unreasonable. They would rather demand one employee to do the work of three than schedule three employees. The company is very credit based if you're hired for cashiering I hope that you are a good sales person, if not you will not get any hours."
bad,"A typical day at Kohl's had its waves of busy times. The weekends were the worst, they always had sales. Everybody would come in, myself worked in the juniors section and it was the messiest part of the store. It was really hard to keep clean. But i learned that you have to do a section at a time and try to make it look at presentable for the customers. Make sure the dressing rooms were clean and clothes were off the floor. The managers were pretty cool, and they paid attention to how hard you work and recognize it. The co workers were nice and helped out a lot, trying to put the right clothes in the right places. They really helped me, by showing me the ropes. The hardest part was really keeping the juniors section clean and the dressing rooms. The dressing rooms has nobody there to watch you, like in other stores. I like other stores systems better cause you have somebody there constantly putting clothes away. By the end of the night sometimes id be the only one there trying to empty the rack, and it will be pilled with clothes and objects id have to take back and it would be all over the store. The most enjoyable part of that job was being a cashier. "
bad,"I am a very active person so working at Kohl's was ok because of the constant zoning to keep store tidy for shoppers. Overall though, its repetitive and boring. "
bad,"I worked there as a seasonal cashier. Holidays and Weekends were the busiest and most stressful days out of the week. Managers were rude and not as helpful. Pay was nice, not a lot of hours. Customers were rude and impatient as well. Very Stressful environment with some Pros. I do NOT recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety/depression. IT WILL make it worse."
bad,Very good working environment. Very good management. The hours needed from me didn't work very well so I was unable to obtain many hours. Also could be very slow at times with not much to do unless near Christmas time.
bad,"◾"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
bad,Co-workers had great work ethic and great teamwork. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the store mess. Management was helpful and encouraging for the most part.
bad,This job hired me and started my training the same day. Management was wonderful. Very nice and flexible with the hours. I was hired on to work 20 hours a week. They helped me by working with me and allowing me to work 30+ hours a week. The only down fall was that I worked at this job for 2 months and never received a paycheck. I had to quit this job due to financial status and then received my paychecks 3+ weeks afterwards. Management was very apologetic and tried helping as soon as the problem occurred. This job was pleasurable because I had the chance to meet all kinds of new people and even see old faces as well.
bad,Really didnt like this job because it was to much managers were real rude.
bad,Find workplace love working there great customer service I love communicating with people I love Kohl's deals I love the clothes they had and I will be going back
bad,"It is a great place to acquire experiment in retail. Coworkers are great. The manager is great as well. The only thing I dislike was that, I was a partime associate and I would only work one day out of the week. Sometimes I would work only 4 hours. It is great if you work full time but other than that I do not recommend this jobs for people who want to work part time."
bad,"Nice place to work, very fair people. Always a friendly environment. Manager were very helpful. Co workers were fun to be around and helpful, nice hours to work."
bad,"Everyday was different at Kohl's, you'll either start your day off fine or very bad but normally at the end of the shift everything turns out better I've noticed. I have learned how to manage exchanges and returns The management was not so nice, it seemed like on an 8 hour day with standing on my aching feet all day I had to beg just for a 15 minute break. I'm sure it would not have been like that if I chose a different location but the management at this store was not good at all to me. The co-workers however, treated me very well as I did the same for them, they were very friendly, every time I needed help with something specific they would be on top of everything. I did also learn how to key in discounts in the proper and professional way. The hardest part of the job was trying to multi-task in a very fast pace in between taking care of each customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around people/customers making sure that they all left with a smile on their face or at least they felt satisfied/welcome."
bad,Training program was very intense and also very informative. The manager in training program is great opportunity for college students.
bad,"Super fun place to work everyone makes you feel like your parts of the family.  "
bad,"I worked at the e-fulfillment center in Edgewood, Maryland as a seasonal worker. I recently got out of federal prison and was putting my life back together and Kohls gave me that chance. I started in Sept and was a equipment operator. I quickly rose as the top performer in the entire building and through Kohls rewards I racked up thousands of points through being top performer of the month and being recognized from management and other employees. During Sept to January I worked many hours and was able to buy a car, rent my own townhome and even get me a cat. I was told with my performance being the best in my position and even topping others in other positions there when at times I was directed to perform other tasks, my job was never in question. All the sudden when seasonal was over in the middle of January they just stopped scheduling me. I contacted HR and pleaded my numbers and my need to work to pay bills and I have gotten nothing. No return calls, no replied messages. Its now been three weeks with no schedule and I'm scrambling to find a new job to make ends meet. I just applied for unemployment and will be getting a small check which will barely get me by. I am about to lose my house and everything I worked hard for. Kohls is a great place to work but this is the one flaw. Proceed with caution."
bad,"It was okay but never transfer,cause you won't have your job waiting on you. It's not enough help,the communication is okay&they feed you all the time..."
bad,"The hours just were not cutting it for me , and some of the employees are mean which you’ll get that anywhere but most post i need more hours than what i am currently getting."
good,"Great job , great staff, nice scheduling but just wasn’t my type of job. Really active store and really busy but time flies. Would really recommend someone who likes retail to apply"
good,No hours given to part timers management was always butting head everyday . Dont take the time to recognize hard work that you have done and the understaffed their register so when your trying to get your work done you cant then you get yelled at for not being fast or not getting it done .
good,"I worked at Kohl's during my years in high school. A typical work evening for me was really busy between massive clothes to put back on the racks, folding numerous pants and shirts, working the register, along with customer service. management usually stayed in the office. I've learned how important organization is, with working in an department store in which I did carry that into my own life going into college. The hardest part about working at Kohl's is trying to stay on track with fitting rooms, making sure the store is organized and clean, as well as meeting my personal quota of emails and sales."
good,Not a bad place to work for if it's your first job. But since it's retail hours you get to work may vary but if you work hard and show them you're a team player they will give more hours.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,this was a fun job but was temporay.  I would hang up cloths and sort close
good,"for as many hours that you work, you barely get a pay check; your cheap work."
good,Very poor place to work at or at least the store that I was at.I would not recommend this place to other people for work. They dont help you with your struggles.
good,"The job itself was okay except not being able to go the restroom if you are on the register and I always worked there.  Minimum wage pay, high expectations for opening credit apps. Holidays you worked close to 40 hours; summer approx 15 so the pay varies greatly.  The all night Thanksgiving Eve is required and other holidays as well.  Corporate mentality with management looking down on employees.  Impossible to excel all spots in management are filled by other managers who are transferred routinely after 3 years"
good,"Productive day to day task, working with customers and inquiries they have with the company. Learned a lot working with the company such as, cash handling retail aspect of the industry. Management works well with associates."
good,"It was an ok place to work. I used to unload the truck, managers would be on our backs though, but it was fun."
good,This company wants the most work for minimum pay. And the raise you get every year is only around .15 cent. Also instead of promoting within sometime they transfer from another store.
good,They preach work life balance. It is not true.  Management doesn’t care about the employees.  After returning for a medical leave I was forced to take a new position. They reduced my pay.  Even the merit raises I earned.
good,it helps pay some bills but not all. the work was I think a 12hour shift rude people I just work and go home. not looking to hang out and things like others do
good,It would be great for someone still in school and just starting out in the work field. You might get 2 or 3 days a week if your lucky.  But if you are good at getting credits then you'll  get the hrs. The only thing that's good is the discount.
good,Seasonal work was a nightmare. Long hours with poor management and way too many coworkers. I never worked with the same person twice and never met a manager. No one knew each other except the workers who had been there for years. Mundane and repetitive work with no guidance or training. Management never worked with schedules and wouldn't provide more work if that assigned was finished. Good holiday pay and store discount on most items.
good,While gaining many skills I found myself locked down in a very underpaid position with continually dwindling hours. There were managers who did everything and those who could not be bothered.
good,"Kohls was overall a good company to work for. They have flexible hours, a great team environment, and the management is well. Although there is a lot of unprofessionalism"
good,People are sometimes childish at work. People slack off at times The hardest part was working long hours and we were often short staffed. I suppose the most enjoyable part was the employee appreciation discount.
good,"They pay very little for the amount of work you do. The managers and supervisors don't know what they are doing. The Brandon, FL store is very disorganized. Supervisors and managers yell at other employees in front of customers with no real reason. The discounts are great, you could use your associate with any excluded and regular items; they can also be combined with your regular Kohl's credit card discounts."
good,After you finish your training you are thrown out onto the floor and left to figure out how it all works. You are left to help customers without quite knowing how to.
good,it was a job that I did and it was kind of plain and the hours were bad they either gave you too many hours or none at all the people in charge were always asking me to cover shifts on my days off they expected to be covered by me. the training was not helpful to do the job at all. but the people I worked with were nice
good,I was depressed working here and never felt worse about a company than i did for them. I worked there for a little less than a year and tried my hardest for them and never got a promotion or had a manager look my way. They would favor other people who dont deserve promotions and give it to them instead and realize half way in they made a mistake
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Get as many credit apps as you can, clean, cash out customers, great customers, train new cashiers.  bag items hang clothes, fold items dailey meetings"
good,"It was hard to make a living given the limited hours we were allowed, and it seemed like they half trained you so you got yelled at when asking for help. You had to learn everything yourself."
good,the job was seasonal /temporary. would have like to possibly be hired into the company itself. At that moment. They just needed the extra help within.
good,The sups again not very good. The store needs to get there stuff together. Very unorganized store. I can say this place ruined retail work for me. i would never go back ever
good,I enjoyed working with a friendly staff and co-workers. The setting was comfortable and relaxed. This job had opportunities to work dependently and in groups.
good,"Management seemed only to care about employees to constantly cajole customers to either open a Kohl's card, give up their email addresses, or ask them to go online to do a review. Most customers were not pleased by this. If an employee did get a few of these things done, they were given a tiny paper gold star, as if they were in Kindergarten. Overall a very poor place for satisfactory employment."
good,There management in horrible managers are not professional. The other associates are rude to customers and don't do their job right the floors in the dressing rooms are unsafe here are pins everywhere in all the dressing rooms
good,"Loved my job, but did not get along with the new manager that they put at our store.  Cried every day in the last year on my way to work.  I loved the associates I worked with."
good,"Lack of staffing"
good,"Non-stop pace environment, mutli-tasking a must, detail oriented, team player, on the go atmosphere, customer service, q/a with knowledge of customers needs and wants."
good,A typical day at work would be people not doing their job. The management team wasn't very friendly. My co-workers were ok to be around.
good,"The main manager is difficult to work with. The rest of the crew is great. It's a busy, fast paced retail store, but rewarding in many ways."
good,"I've been apart of Kohls since 2009, its been an amazing experience, up until recently with the opening of the new location in Clovis. Management is unstable, and there are no hours to give to employees. Dress code is a big issue and too much drama. As a store it would run better with a healthier enviornment and professional structure."
good,"Employment is part-time, and the benefits and compensation were dismal. The work environment was oppressive and the company's main goal is to sign people of for Kohl's charge cards."
good,"A great company if you are a PT "
good,The staff is very fun and easy to get along and work with. But management is very lazy and rude. It was favoritism going on in the work place. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many different people and getting to know them
good,Work was long and non stop. Couldn't sit down for even a moment. Management was rude and couldn't care less if you were sick or in pain. They treated seasonal employees like garbage.
good,"Profit driven, not work balance.Management okay but do not do a good job training,developing  or supporting staff. The company focuses more on terminations verses retention or retaining good employees"
good,"Given that I worked there many years ago it'll be unfair to write about it now. But during my time there the management team was always at odds, even people higher up were always giving different directions to everyone. The company tried to gobble up too much at once."
good,"The structure of the company does not allow for a good environment, always demanding more from its workers while not offering proper compensation. Management did not communicate well and were prone to sitting around the office instead of helping assist on sales floor or with customer. Enjoyed unloading truck and merchandising new freight, but was not worth the headache of dealing with the company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Retail is very physically demanding and the absence of a set schedule was difficult as I was caring for my ailing mother at the time as well.  I enjoyed the absolute team spirit with my co-workers in my department as throughout the entire store.
good,"The management was not to the standard that a Kohls should have been. The management in particular wasn't there all the time, so it was left to the part time managers. They really didn't know what to do or didn't want to do it and there wasn't an enough people scheduled around the same time, so it would be understaffed a lot of the time. Also they were not very flexible with there scheduling."
good,"It was a fun place to work because of the people. Other than that, when I asked for more hours (was only getting 10 hours maybe) I was told “no, we can’t let any part-time workers past 15. And giving you another shift a week will put you over.” I was forced to find something else. Now I should mention, 80% of that store was part-time."
good,"Too much emphasis on new charge accounts and not enough on good shopping experience. Mostly enjoyed the customers and co-workers.  Even on black Friday, customers could be nice and joking as long as you are kind to them."
good,"It's not a bad place to work if you're young and need something part time. Just don't let them suck you into to taking a full time job. You will barely get a raise and full time to them is 36-37 hours a week, after that they send you home. Lunch is only 30 minutes, your schedule is always different, the store is always under staffed and they expect you to do the job of 3 people everyday."
good,Kohls was a good job to have a first to make money while going to school. They were some what flexible with hours. They however didn't appreciate how hard you worked. It was a lot of hard work and the hours were very crazy during the holidays. The management didn't support you and didn't let you be creative.
good,"Far too often, promotions from within are played as the favorites game, regardless of work experience or qualifications. In my short time at Kohl's, many of my peers watched as unqualified persons were promoted up despite other better qualified candidates, only to fail, and the rest of the team have to carry their burden on top of their already full plates."
good,When i first started working at Kohl’s I loved my job but now it’s too overwhelming.Some work hard and a lot just puts more work on others. Customers are very rude and the management just does whatever the customer wants.Managment doesn’t not care about employees!!!!!!
good,"Management does not get along, You will be expected to do a lot and the money is not worth the aggravation............................................................"
good,decent place to work if you are not a contract worker. The management will say anything to pit people against each other to yield results from contractors. The contractors are annexed from the actual employees so you are not working as a team.
good,"Nothing super exciting to say here. Good starter job for younger adults but wouldn't recommend staying long. Management were always there to tell you you're doing a great job, but never asked if you were happy or what they could do to help you advance in the workplace."
good,I worked there for 2 months and had to fight with them to get paid.  Then when I finally got paid they took out over 300 dollars .  When called they won't answer(corporate) or email u back.
good,"All the company cares about is associates convincing customers to sign up for their credit card, if you don't get enough people to sign up you get yelled at, your job is threatened and its an unpleasant workplace."
good,"It is as all retail is, working with unruly customers who make messes and a lack of appreciation for all of the work you do. Managment began to fall after our new 02(JOHN) began working there."
good,"Loved working this job for retail. A lot of the manager were fun and knew how to keep the environment happy. I really enjoyed this job because if helped feed my OCD and having to re-organize everything, size everything and just trying to keep everything in order."
good,The job is OK they just need to have more openings for people and more than just part time jobs there they have the work sometimes we just don't want to pay the people
good,"Greeted customers, answered customer's questions on phone. set up register, counted money, and balanced cash drawer. enrolled customers for Kohl's credit cards."
good,They are fairly polite when you are working here. They don't really make you feel important as a part of the staff. They criticize employee work a lot but are not constructively doing so.
good,"The coworkers are great, but the benefits and management are mediocre at best. "
good,"best part of the job is your co-workers, the worst is the hours!!! this job does require patience and your ability to work in fast pace environment. if it wasn't for horrible hours would continue to work here."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Company does not pay equal to what their competitors pay. When I worked there, there was also a lot of issues with management."
good,"Management did not have procedure for switching shifts appropriately, Co-Workers and Assistant managers were very helpful and nice. The hardest part was late hours and no customers."
good,"I work from 6:00 to2:00.  I also  do stripping,I would in RTV area which I  sort material, unload trailer, scan materials,  wrap and weigh  material,"
good,A typical day I would walk into a fitting room and there was clothes all over it. I would also cashier when we got too busy. I learned a lot about how there is no advancing in a company such as this one. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone with no recognition.
good,"Honestly the people you work with are probably the best people I have ever known, its the company and its managers that suck. They work you butt off for a promotion you will never get."
good,"Co workers great , management needs Improvements,I loved stocking and unloading the trucks and helping the customers"
good,Over all the place is okay you just go and do the job but I believe if they had better management or if the management changed a little and not have favoritism it would be a better place.
good,"typical day was pretty boring/uneventful with unrealistic goals of emails and or credit applications. It was the first job ever in my life that I had to deal with brown nosing to be treated decently. there was no communication at all between managers and employees everyone was on many different pages of what was what and who was to do what.   I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing our regulars come in and I loved many of my co workers , a few are great friends now.  the hardest part  the store became a rotating door of unhappy employees  due to an individual in management at the time. not long after I was gone so was basically every long termer that was there before me."
good,"The review for Kohls is basically the same as the one I put for JCPenney."
good,"I was hired to stock, organize and help open the Kohl's in Grove City. When the store opened I was a cashier. Learning the different clothing brands, fashion and working with the public was different for me. I was only part  time and not getting but 15-20 hours a week.I was open to any hours so my schedule varied a lot. I had always had a full time job so it was nice working part time for awhile. Management was all young and sometimes seemed unorganized. Seeing what all goes into opening a new store was interesting."
good,"Working here felt like i was in high school  again, its alot of fun but theres also alot of downsides, like working a closing shift and getting home about 1230 at night then waking up by 5 to get there by 6."
good,"While working at Kohl's, I learned a lot of useful things. However, the overall experience was nothing to brag about. I stayed with the company three short months. The staffing was always terrible, with only one associate to work the entire sales floor, one person working a single open register, and one person at customer service. I was constantly bounced around in departments and expected to do a workload that was nearly impossible for one person to do alone. The management changed three times in my duration here, which resulted in a tense work environment and unfriendly employees. The store was always a disaster because of the lack of associates to work on floor recovery and fitting rooms. I was actually ecstatic to leave."
good,a typical work day at kohls is very boring it could be super slow then the next hour be very busy the times i worked with maintenance helped the day go by faster. The co workers made this job better than it was even tho kohls is up and down i see people come and go so fast.
good,"Being the hard worker that I am I was considered the lead associate in the department that I worked.  There were a few associates that cared about the talent they bring to the company and there were associates that was just there for check.  I believe if the management team lead their associates, it would have been a better place to work.  The hardest part working at Kohl's was doing my best to make progress while others just did not want to be productive.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having a good group of associates that worked hard to make progress in our work load."
good,This was one of my first jobs it was good it learned a lot fom this place.
good,the days there where mainly short. never get a lot of hrs. management really don't tell you that they appreciate you at all. if there was to be better management then it would be a better place to work at
good,"Generally a pretty good place to work aside from its lack of keeping personal information about employees to only those needed.  Lack and/or respect on personal information on employees.  Trainers/Supervisor etc.  They need to take some type of workshop in confidentially between themselves and not other workers.  Many times some workers in other departments would go to other departments giving out information that they shouldn't because they heard it from Supervisor in that department.  Not a good thing to do.  Lack of respect of employees.  They also need workshops that deal with different cultural differences, Sexual Orientation and so on.  Favortism showed alot. Pre-judgements on employees, Mostly because of how they appeared or dressed some were judged yet, were hard workers and  felt as they were constantly being watched while others were left alone.   Just didn't make sense."
good,Kohls was a good place for me to gain knowledge of retail and how it works. This is where i developed my customer service skills. I worked in the shoe department and i would make sure the tags were up to date while providing customer service. I got along with the co-workers and they were always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was towards the end of the day where you would have to clean up the department and make sure everything was reorganized.
good,This is one place where I done alot of work in a short period of time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"this job was okay. the management was great , and you hardly recieve any support from staff."
good,"When I interviewed there, everything seemed what they said it to be. Over time you can tell when they really comfortable with you because they will call you if they are short staffed and after that they will always keep calling you. If they liked you, they put you on the schedule more and more, if you give them grief they will put you less and less on the schedule."
good,I worked at Kohls for many years and the only raises I got was when the state minimum wage was increased. I over achieved customer service scores and credit applications. They denied me for a supervisor roll multiple times because I didn’t have a bachelor’s degree... or so they said
good,"The job was very unprofessional and disorganized. There was a family-like team when there was no store manager present. The managers worked well together to get the store in order. Kohl's received a new store manager and not long after a new assistant store manager and both of which changed everything that was good about the store. Everything that we seemed to get great reviews on they changed other things that focused on less important factors. Managers that took great care of the store, the customers, and the associates were bullied out of the store and some were racially discriminated. Both of these caused many employees, not just managers, but associates to leave."
good,"Many of my coworkers at Kohl's were fun to work with, but the management sucked. They will not work with you on scheduling and just schedule you whenever they want, even if you requested that day off."
good,Worked at the in west chase location. There was no training and yet they expected you to know how to deal with certain situations. Management was not supportive at all and to be honest it felt like you had to suck up to management to get more hours or benefits.
good,2 out of 3 of my managers were terrible and didn't care about anyone there. I was scheduled on my graduation day and then yelled at for saying that I would not be there.
good,"told company when I started I would need 3 days off for surgery later, which was okay. But then was yelled at and refused time off when the time came. Not paid first few checks until fired. Rude coworkers and managers, nobody know what they’re doing/told nothing."
good,"This place is very hard to work at if your not ready for it. They are constantly telling you to hurry up, or they will fire you. It was very degrading to work there at khols."
good,"There was very poor communication between the management and the general workers. Often times, people's jobs were miscommunicated and there was a massive Gap in progress."
good,it was a paycheck I was able to get by. but I did not like working the late shifts because you never knew when you where going to get out. It was hard to handle.
good,A typical day at work consisted of standing at the register waiting for customers. Also consisted of putting clothes on hangers and making sure the clothing was in the right spots around the store. Pretty laid back place to work.
good,"I personally am tired of this place the managers dont know how to communicate. They tell you stuff last minute. They expect the people who work on the floor to do everything. I mean EVERYTHING. I work on the floor and my job is to help customers, clean out the fitting rooms when customers leave clothes, and keep the floor straightened. BUT if customer service, the registers, and jewelry need help I'm supposed to stop my job to help them. And depending on how many customers they have, how busy we are, and the different problems that come up you could be up there from 10 minutes to several hours. I also have to stop my job and go help out in those same places when they need to take their breaks. So alot of the time my work doesn't get done because I spent time doing everyone else's job. But the managers will expect for the fitting rooms to look a certain way. And the pay is $9. Other than all that I actually have a nice time up there some times I just get fed up alot. You can always make friends with the co workers because we are all friendly."
good,"Never enough help, asked to stay over every single day! Very stressful! No help from management. Worked by myself in customer service when they said I'd always have someone else with me. Very stressful when shorthanded."
good,"I love the job I have, the responsibilities, the daily routine.  I have learned many new skills that I plan to carry into a new position. Retail is fast paced, multitasking."
good,"This is a store that has grown for the better from what i here but when i worked there it was not ."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,My manager really pushed meeting the credit goal for the day. Cleanliness of the store was highly important. Customer satisfaction was the number one priority.
good,"Not great unless you are a young college student needing a menial job"
good,"I have been working at Kohls for two years now and it feels as though i was there too long. Managers are biased towards employees. For instance, only daytime, cashiers earn employee of the month. You also get short breaks for the amount of time you are  on your feet. Most of the managers appear to hate their job and take their anger out on employees. I have had managers shout at their employees in front of customers and degrade their ability to their job. They also do a poor job at scheduling and apparently budgeting. This job has been exhausting beyond belief."
good,I think Kohl's is a good place for people who like retail to work if they're just beginning. The training was pretty basic and easy to get the hang of. Most of the fellow employees were friendly.
good,If you're considering management make sure you walk in with already completing your bachelor's degree in according field or start as an intern.  Your growth is dependent on who wants to teach you.
good,Poor management. The management team only cares about meeting credit quota and does not take into consideration people's personal life.  There was also too much drama among the managements and they take it out on their associates.
good,"Not enough,pay,people,training,recognition, not flexible hours,not willing to hear employee ideas, running it's associates in the ground............glenview"
good,"fairly easy job, it only gets crazy on holidays"
good,"Although they allow you to work almost as many hours as you want when I was working there in 2015 I was only being paid 8.75 an hour and went up to 8.84. I asked for a pay raise and was denied. I practically lived there. I would work from 8am-10pm but wouldn't leave until 12am (because we had to clean up after closing ) and had to come back in for 8am the next morning. When I stayed extra hours (due to people calling out) they use to give us rewards (like a casino chip for kohl's) you could use for an extra 15 minute break. Which was nice and all but they would work you like a dog and when you really couldn't make it in they didn't want to hear it. When I was really ill from overworking and lack of rest and ended in the hospital (I had to speak to 3 supervisor's by the way) they told me that ''I don't know what to tell you we need people here today, everyone is calling out"". I brought in a doctor's note to and still  after it was like they were upset with me. Aisha had it out for me.  Till this day I don't know why. "
good,It was fun working there but they drive hard geting credit cards. and if you do not meet your goal they hate it. So if you have friends have then have them come and aply of a credit card or you will not meet your quota.
good,"Good co-workers, some willing to help you learn others not so much. Some co-workers smile and say hello as they passed you during the day and others even in management would look the other way or look down at their paperwork as they passed you. Not a comfortable feeling for the latter example."
good,I learned a lot from this job. But it's not good for long term plan. Not  enough salary for living. Sometimes it's hard to communicate with people. Nice Manger.
good,"Never having worked in retail before I began as a floor associate. "
good,While employed at Kohls i was part of the freight team. the team i worked with were fantastic. Management was not the greatest. I got promoted twice but never got a pay raise.
good,"If you can't work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday don't bother applying. this company only wants people who can work on all three of these days no exceptions, will not continue with interview if you are not available on all three of these days."
good,"Kohl’s is a good part time job to have if your fresh out of high school , or just bored and need some extra cash. It’s definitely not a job that you can rely on to pay all your bills. Your schedule is always different, one week you can have 32-40 hours and get about $300 on your check and the very next week get as little as 12 hours for the week ."
good,"Some of the upper staff couldn't care less if they were there. Training is barely given to begin with, so definitely a 'figure it out yourself' kind of job."
good,"I worked the cash register and floor. Kinda boring, plus the managers were not the greatest/most attentive. Working holidays was the worst, mostly because of the customers."
good,The management gossips way to much and don't care if you hear. Don't teach you anything they just expect you to know how to do everything. Hours were bad (worked only 4 hrs a couple of times a whole week)
good,Very understaffed during the busy holiday season. i ended up ringing and not being able too do my own work because i knew how. It got to  the point that i regretted that i taught myself how.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"trained for one position. it was enjoyable. changed to another department for health reasons, i was not trained but basically thrown into the position. was asked to return for short periods throughout the day to previous position and told them due to health reasons i could not. but no supervisor was aware of it so i had to go. ended up getting injured on the job and had to leave because the managers/supervisors would not communicate that i was unable to do requested task."
good,"Clean floor"
good,You get a lot of middle aged or older ladies who shop here typically. Many discounts are offered each month. You will not be considered full-time unless you are a supervisor or manager.
good,"could be a great place to work if the management was better as soon as they get better control of there manager the working environment will be more enjoyable,"
good,Management team does not work together.  Hardest part of my job is finding out what exactly needs to be done when all managers give out different directions.
good,"Store never properly staffed, and pulled other workers from their jobs to do register work. Multiple managers all with different ideas and no communication."
good,I met alot of nice people there. The work was intense and the managers were very rude. They expect so much in so little time. I would ask for help but no one was willing to help me in the slightest.
good,The management at the store plays favorites and if you aren't one of theirs you don't get hours. They preach no tolerance for talking about and maligning each other but they don't enforce it and have been know to do it themselves. They do not promote a healthy or fun work environment. It is made very clear that the only importance is the bottom line and every thing you do there is to promote that.
good,"The corporation does not pay it's employees well; you could get paid better at any other job, like McDonald's, for example. If you need fast cash and have no bills to pay, it's an okay place to work if you can handle nonsense from working with a majority of females."
good,The Kholes I worked at was located in North Las Vegas Nevada on north 5th were the management team was horrible and worked together only as clique with no regards to there inline employees.
good,"The company is just like any other retail job. Must have open availability or you won't get hours. It was hit or miss with the management. Some managers were really nice to their associates and worked well with everyone. Others, not so much. The pay is as expected, low. We were required to get so many credits in a day, if you did not meet your credit sales you were likely to be scrutinized for it."
good,Executive level management ideals and ideas are not passed to store level. Store managers have only their own benefits in mind not the associates or the good of the customer
good,the working environment is ok..you'd have to find better eventually. it's not a career move. Too many kids working there. I have nothing else to say!!
good,"No excitement"
good,It is almost always understaffed. I gained a lot of new people skills and learned some interesting things about retail. Management expects you to be able to be in 10 places at once.
good,"Expect 4 Hr work schedules hours. The management is horrible, the pay is minimum wage, and still never any hours.Worked over 7 yrs for this company, they over work their employees, give them little pay and little hours. No way to live a normal quality of life by working here alone."
good,"Kohls was flexible with the extra curricular activities that I had. I can't complain about that. However, the people that I worked with were very distant and almost never wanting to help one another when the store was busy."
good,"Worked on Register taking care of the customers. Opening credit accounts and taking in payments."
good,Only good thing about working here is the discounts. Hours and pay aren't even worth the drive in. I'm making less than $50 a week. The people are mostly good but there are a lot of trash talkers here. Don't tell anyone your personal business. Especially if you don't want a lot of people knowing. Easy jobs all common sense.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The hardest part of the job would have to be truck days. We don't get breaks until the truck is done, which takes 5-6 hours of nonstop rushing around. On a normal day they understaff us so we get no work done. The associates get along great together but management has been unprofessional lately. And no one is reprimanding them. I've learned so much from working at kohls.  What to do and what definitely not to do."
good,They were not very flexible with your school schedule. They also scheduled you on times that you were not available and made you find someone to cover you and if that was not possible you take the blame and points for not coming in.
good,Lost my job for being in rehab. Was kicked out of the systems. Went to another location and was told I had the job. Was given a bad review from a store manager who never worked with me as an employee.
good,"Only get hours during big holidays such as halloween thanksgiving and christmas! Great employee discounts,short breaks,weekly pay. No set work sch* hours be all over the place"
good,"The companies management was very vies, not fair with no paid vacations unless you've worked over 5+ yrs. No one is full time but management and I truly believed there was no opportunity to succeed. Co workers are friendly, everyone understands each other and helps each other to learn. I learned a lot of stuff in my time being."
good,"Working at Kohls while attending college helped me become more responsible and help me manage my time. I was in charge of keeping the children's department clean as well as helping out the customers. The hardest part of the job was being able to multi-task from the children's department to the home department, however I managed to keep up with the work."
good,"everyday coming into work, everyone gives a nice greeting. i learned how giving kohl's can be. the management was an Okay experience. they were mostly young people and not very good role models. the hardest part of it all was that the store managers are very pushy. the most enjoyable part of it all was making such amazing friends there."
good,"My co-workers were very friendly and helpful, working together to finish tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help and chat with customers for their own enjoyable experience. The head manager at the store would bully workers and give ridiculous tasks which we had to finish or we could not leave, sometimes working well past closing time. They did not take into consideration I was a student, and did not work with my schedule. The training was, you were thrown into it and you succeed or failed, to my advantage my co-works would teach me while it was my break time. I would repeated ask for training from the manager, but I was not heard. Eventually through being thrown into jobs, I required the knowledge."
good,"Okay environment for first jobs but because of little opportunity for advancement at a store level and one of the lowest starting wages in the industry it is not someplace to stay long term. I have been there a year and a half, was promoted to sales specialist but after two raises I make the same as the person just hired with no experience. It is very frustrating. "
good,Kohl's has a great work lay out. If only if it was but into play all the time it might not have such a high tune over. I learned a great dill of customer service skills from Kohl's
good,Atypical day at kohl's starts with what coupons we have going on that day what our sales goals and credit/rewards goals are for the day. management depending on who is on staff can be great or really bad. the team that I worked with was great! We helped eachother out with anything we could. the hardest part of the job is not having enough backup or when certain members of management do not bother to heklp out when asked. Soliciting credit can be difficult at times as well.
good,"I didn't work here for long. But, my experience wasn't the greatest, When I started I was promised 40 hours a week. After the Christmas rush, I would work 20 hours one week, then be off for a week or more. The management played favoritism towards the people who sold the most credit cards. Those people got the most hours."
good,"Managers were unprofessional and employees lacked team work."
good,this was an okay job.  Expected to sell credit cards to customers.  Most customers already had credit cards or were rejected.
good,"I love the people that i work with. For the most part.  working for kohls was nice when i stared, as time has passed and with all the new laws, has not been a fun job."
good,"During the holidays was a free fall, people didn't seem to care but more so wanted to get thru it like an inevitable storm. Didn't feel like much was going on in the actual store aside from the people checking out at the registers."
good,"very busy place to work, many customers all the time."
good,Part time job seasonal. They are very disorganized and their price checking system needed major help. I felt as if they were understaffed all the time. Just not a very good environment to be in at all.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"overall the company was a solid corporation to work for,  There were good and were bad just as there is in each company.  Kohls as a brand was positioned well in the market especially during the financial slowdow."
good,"I love all the people I work with, I enjoy working with them. The job doesnt 't have enough hours. It is not reliable for me. Job hours went from 32 hours a week to 10 hours a week."
good,I'd clock in and start my day off working at either a register or cleaning out the dressing rooms of the store. I'd fold or hang the left items in each dressing room and put each item back in it's respective spot.
good,ok if you are a teenager or just need some extra weekend money
good,Hardest part is when management leaves you by yourself on the floor and have to complete duties on your own.
good,"The CoMO store bases everything from advancement to the schedule on who gets the most credit applications and emails through their shifts.  They lie about the training opportunities ""available"" to everyone.  Training isn't taken seriously, which explains the lack of knowledge among associates."
good,Fixed only around women. Will work around what is going on in your life.
good,"As a manager for this company it was hard after we opened the store with the upper management. They were not completely trained on every procedure so as managers we were not able to do our jobs in the correct manner in my opinion. But the people took everything in strides and we made a great experience out of everyday. We all had fun regardless of every incidence or experience that wasn't the best one. As managers we motivated the team by rewarding them for great work, giving positive acknowledgements of jobs well done, and great customer service. I had a great learning experience training others on the processes that were in place that were working properly. Unfortunately the hardest part of my job was when the higher management became fired, and we were notified of new management on it's way. That's when I found Target."
good,"Working at Kohl's the management at the time was rude and disrespectful to many of the employees. The prospect of promotions was alluded to however when hiring came about, the job was given to someone of the managers personal choice with no professional bearing. Many of the customers would often complain about rude and non-cooperative managers and in result they lost that business."
good,"This is a great job for people who like to be in many different departments you get many given opportunities to work in different areas. There are many employees so you'll always meet someone new. Schedules are always posted in advanced so you can plan out your time accordingly. The management is small and hard to find when need be. The hardest part of this job is getting to know the product, but once you have that down it's smooth sailing from there."
good,"Enjoy working with people an customers, and love the party's"
good,i loved working here but just wish there management had more training
good,"Inconsistant, negative, and definately NOT customer service focused as advertised or supportive of employee needs."
good,"I can’t really say much, I didn’t work there for long because I was seasonal but for the time that I was there it wasn’t a bad job. I had 12 hour shifts 6 days a week so the money was good but barely any free time."
good,"The managers are great! but the supervisors are a bit too overbearing."
good,A few managers are disrespectful. And they dont teach you anything. You basically teach yourself. My best advice is dont let the managers get to you. They think your just a worker so you can deal with it. And their pretty unfair there.
good,"It's alright. Former associates at the round lake beach location say there is rather poor management and many people quit while I was there. Managment, in my experience, was actually quite good. They handled customers well but the actual associates... not so well."
good,"A good place to work. It has a great energy to move along the days. "
good,"Management is a joke, it’s all a popularities game. They don’t value associates who have been there the longest, they also do not take care for product merchandise being stolen and blame associates when there is a yearly shortage."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Worked as cashier."
good,"Kohl’s is probably the least favorite job I’ve had. You do get discounts on store purchases, but that was the only plus. Schedule was not flexible and pay was not good."
good,"Over the 12 years I worked for kohls I went through 8 store managers. And the difficulty doing that is feeling like you have to start over and ""impress"" someone again and again. But overall we made it work."
good,"I provide customers with information concerning all available discounts and show them how to obtain them I promote and assist with obtaining a Koh'ls Charge Card, Distribute Kohl's cash when earned. Take Bill payments Process even exchanges The most difficult part of the job is obtaining assistance when we are consistently under staffed. I really enjoy interacting with customers and proving an enjoyable experience. Management is  not consistent"
good,"Management is awful and unorganized"
good,"If you are looking for your first job or you were working while in college, this is the job for you. This is not a job that you won’t necessarily grow in. There isn’t much room for advancement. It’s just like every other retail job. It’s very fast-paced and you do get a paycheck. Those are pretty much my only pros. Cons… I had many minute managers in the years I worked there. Doesn’t seem like the managers wanted to stay."
good,The management team wouldn’t care if you had a family emergency they want you there. Everybody calls off. Especially working in shoes. They will train you for one day then have you on your own unloading a truck.
good,"I started with Kohl's in 2009. As a part time associate I was given benefits, (Medical, Dental, etc.). We had additional benefits as well like paying $1.00 for water, as the company paid the rest. There were a lot of these types of benefits that Kohl's offered. We also had a lot of staff. It made it a great company to work for. In the 9 years I worked for them I saw all the benefits get stripped away. No more benefits at all. In addition the labor became less and less. During a conversation with my District Manager I was told that Kohl's runs a 6% labor cost. Ive been in management and corporate business for a long time and had never heard of a labor cost that low. Shortly before I left Kohl's actually reformed their labor structure to reduce what was already a very low labor percentage. As the Assistant Manager of the MJM department is was my duty to oversee all operations of the clothing side of the store plus inventory. When we opened the store we had at least 1 person per department sometimes 2 or more. When I left I had 1 am person and 1 pm person most of the time. My department was over 45,000 square feet of a 68,000 square foot store. Granted that also included Jewelry, Make Up, Intimates and Accessories. Daily I had 1 associate in Jewelry a day. 10 am to 6 pm. Depending on the day I might have 1 in the Make up department. So in all that was 2-3 people for an estimated 45,000 square feet. Because of this Recovery never got done, Jewelry got stolen, fitting rooms filled up and did not get cleaned, trucks remained unprocessed, etc. The managers were the main workforce in"
good,The GM Didi would constantly promise pay raises and promotions that you would never get and if you ever brought it up she would get mad and cut your hours to 8 a week until you stopped asking but yet would keep throwing side comments about how she's going to give you raise or promotion.
good,I had some great experiences there and had some amazing managers. I was pushed to do my best. I had a lot to do and take care of. At my time there I was responsible for more then what my job was. I enjoyed many things the people were awesome and I loved being able to volunteer.
good,Could be worse. Working environment not bad but not worth it for the pay and so-so management. Constantly understaffed and the emphasis on getting credit takes precedence over everything else to the point of being detrimental.
good,Hours per week ranged between 10-15. Some weeks you may not get hours. Not a happy place to work. Your normal gossip/backstabbing. Pay was $9 per hour.
good,"At kohl's Department stores their is a great line between the management and the employees. The typical workday depends on what you do. But your shift can change because it is retail. I believe Kohl's is a great place to work for a little bit, but not as a career."
good,"Short staffed, there were times I was the only employee on the entire sales floor and had to answer multiple calls for multiple departments. Short hours. No chance for advancement. You will make more money working at McDonald's."
good,The pay is terrible. Chump change no joke. Not nearly enough hours and no room for advancement. Upper management is a cranky old man and short breaks.
good,"At the particular location that I was employed at, the management tended to be rude and acted like they couldn't be bothered with employees. Expectations were unclear and disorganized. Coworkers were great and friendly and usually more helpful than management."
good,Unless your a favorite of a manager you'll never move up in this store there is no equal opportunity for all. Hours are ridiculous you dont even get full 8 hour shifts for being fulltime.
good,After Christmas season they take you down to 4 hours per week. You work hard and no compensation is due. Good job for people just starting out. No advancement in site.
good,I worked here while in college. I learned how to interact with the community and learning how to work with money on the cash registers. Filling in clothing when needed.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's an okay customer service job. No way to advance without a degree. Not very many pay raises, and manager basically ignored all sales associates, unless she likes you. I learned how to work the cash register(point of sale) and customer service skills."
good,Not bad for a temp or second fun job but not good for lively hood. Do not use this job as a job to support your kids or family. This should only be used for a little extra cash on the side
good,"Management focuses on selling the kohls charge more than ensuring customers satisfaction. Unrealistic goals are given daily. "
good,Khols has mandatory volunteer hours they always make sure you get your break they're fine with vacation they always usually approve it except around the holidays
good,The other employees are nice and fun to work with. Can be frustrating in terms of hours given every week. Sometimes I only had 4 hours a week. It is an okay job for someone looking to make a little extra money.
good,working there was okay my firs job when i move to VA. The hourly payment was not enough for my expenses . Good job for people who need a part time job .
good,Do not expect to work here and cover any living costs pay wages and hours are so bad you will fall behind on everything. Then when bills are too far behind you'd expect Kohl's Maplewood mall to understand and be your job of choice instead they fire you or lay you off
good,"The hardest part of the job was the call goals in regards to AHT, AHT, and call volume. There was a lot of pressure to provide the best customer service, but you were not given enough time to do so. I felt micromanaged on every level. I think the ""customer service"" aspect of things was really on the bottom of list at Kohls, and all they cared about was numbers. I tried to advance my career with the company, but it was not about how well of an employee you were,it was about who you knew."
good,"Management ONLY cares about pushing the Kohl's credit card.  Both myself and a friend had very personal emergencies where we needed time off, but we were told no because we had to push their credit cards to customers instead."
good,"Be prepared to work work work.  Kohls does have good benefits but in PD there is a high burnout rate. Teams will be pushed to meet high demands of leadership and depending on your manager will you get Worklife balance.  Perception is everything and that is your reality.  Merchants constrain the creative side of PD and ultimately has final say in all that is done. Encourage thinking outside the box, but as far as implementation, it depends on leadership."
good,"employees discount, free snacks and lunch sometimes, friendly cooworkers , greeting customers, merchandise sales floor, help customers on sales floor and how to use store app."
good,"I did not receive many hours, and I was not placed on the schedule.  I called in each week to find out my schedule.  I was asked repeatedly  on my second day of employment to fill out an application for a credit card."
good,I worked for Kohl's for 3 3/4 years and was earning only $.30 over minimum wage.  Much pressure put on cashiers and those filling in for cashiers to solicit credit from each customer.  The number of hours we were scheduled was contingent upon how many credits we successfully accrued the previous week.
good,"A stressful work environment with employees with strong personalities. As a new worker, I found it hard to ask questions or ask for help. They weren't that flexible with my schedule either, as they scheduled me for days I wasn't available and it was difficult to find coverage. Not great, but not awful either."
good,"Working at Kohls can be very fast paced. There's very little room for job advancement, with very little pay. The company is great for working around scheldule."
good,"Worked as a seasonal person, management was not really there (I meet nobody that was in charge). Workplace culture no real directions for what needed to done."
good,"Managers would talk about other employees and be rude for no reason and make personal problems work problems. They would act nice, but talk about you to others."
good,Kohl's is perfect for students and first job experience. I do not recommend this place unless applying for management positions. Like any other retail jobs be prepared for extended store hours. I usually got home between 12 midnight to 2 a.m. during holidays.
good,"It was a seasonal job, so I didn't expect any benefits.  I was an Associate in the children's department, and when I was done picking up there, I started cleaning up the toy department"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great first retail job for high school students not an adult though. They cut hours with no notice and everything is about credits even if you willing to work hard to prove yourself. The management definitely  plays favors with associates.
good,I worked in the warehouse and the other employees and my Supervisor harassed and embarrassed me.  I am disabled and I have Autism and I can not think or move as quickly as the other employees. My Supervisor would yell at me in front of the other employees about the amount of work I completed and when I did something wrong.  It was a hostile work environment in the warehouse and I could not take the stress.  I resigned from my position and wrote a letter to the store manager explaining why.
good,It is a fast paced environment and you need to be able to finish tasks quickly. Most of the management is nice but they can be harsh at times. You definitely have to ask to move up or they won't train you on anything other than Point of Sale.
good,"This is a good job for people looking to gain experience in retail. It is fast pace, hard-working, and competitive company. This job will help you become more sociable with costumes as well."
good,The manager at the time was not in the best interest of the store. But I have been told that they have new management and anyone that quit under the old management was rehirable.
good,"I think if the pay was better and the hours we're better more employees would stay and could advance . Also, I believe better   benefits are great incentive for all who work for any company ."
good,I did not like working for Kohl's. The mangers were very pushy when it comes to soliciting credit. It was like the work you did was never good enough.
good,"we have 3 -4 managers that are all fighting to have power, they put down associate.  They do not work as a team and when you ask for help  it usually takes about 15 minutes to actually receive the help asked for. I find the work ethic to be very poor."
good,I enjoyed most of the people I worked with but some woman in there arebjust rude I learned to not speak about anything go to work do my job and sale my products and keep my make and skin products dusted and put on the shelf I love helping people and I'm really good with customers.
good,"I worked there for a few years and I don't really miss it. A lot of snobby people who do nothing more than hold up counters and run their mouths while at the same time, not letting YOU forget that YOU have a job to do. Once someone lands in management, they can pretty much do whatever they want... period. Ridiculous. If you report them.. papers are lost. If you call them to a meeting.. you're being crazy or racist or being a liar. I guess it's true, the higher you get, the better you're paid, the less you actually DO. I could go on about other stuff but.. have places to be.."
good,"Working on floor my main responsibility was to walk around the department, fold clothes that were messed up, pick up merchandise off the floor and put it back where it belongs, and keep the fitting rooms clear. It's very slow and boring. There's not much to do and it makes the day drag on. During holiday seasons you get OK work but on a regular basis you're lucky to get 4-8 hours a week. I would end my week getting a 30$ paycheck and at that point it was just a joke so i quit."
good,Very stressful. No work/life balance. Good pay/benefits but no overtime and you end up working a lot of hours during the holiday season and get like 1 day off a week.
good,So understaffed. I kept having to get on register when I had a whole different task to do. Discount is nice on top of the other discounts though. A lot of conflicts with the managers.
good,"It was a seasonal job, however in the few months I worked there I can say it was a very competitive job, fast paced, and the work environment was not one I had enjoyed."
good,Job has it's pros and con's but this company has more cons then you can count. a change in store managers ruined my location and turned the store upside down. A part from me people have (and still are) leaving under the direction of new management and the feeling of being under appreciated as a worker. The hours are barely survivable and it is a typical environment of where who kisses up the most and is considered a managers pet is who gets treated better then others. terrible policies especially if working in the customer service department where
good,"They put emphasis on who can ""talk the talk"" instead of who can ""walk the walk""--it's all about who can bullsh*t the best, rather than who is actually driving sales/business. Too much focus on perception, rather than people who work hard, want their business to thrive, and want to be their own person. Trying to force your employees into a cookie cutter way will only make you lose"
good,I work on the sales floor and have been there 2 years. They say i one of their best floor people and trainers but yet will never give me a raise. I get paid what the new employees make which is not fair to me. I have 4-5 hour closing shifts when new employees get day shifts. Im sick of the way ive been treated .
good,Poor pay and benefits.  Pay is minimum wage. Management plays favorites. Leaves out the rest of the staff. Not a stressful environment except on holidays.
good,My day at work is very busy.  I have learned many valuable aspects regarding the retail industry.  The management staff is very helpful.  The best part of the job is working with wonderful coworkers
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When I on boarded with Kohl's I was very excited to be working in a warehouse because I would be on my feet and stay busy. Unfortunately the  job was at the mercy of the business so you weren't able to get a set schedule. It was very tough to manage your bills when you work 40 hrs one week and 10 hours the next week. I learned how to efficiently package items that were bought online to be shipped. Learned how to efficiently package items within a very short time limit, and how to fulfill orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to be at a station, listen to music and pack packages. Management was poorly handled, they were always having managers contradict each other on what their goals and objectives were for the day."
good,"I would like to  say, I am a people person, so on a good day  for me  is when  my customers  leave and they are  happy,  because I have given  my  best."
good,"I was scheduled to work many times outside of my availability, which made it very hard to keep to prior engagement outside of work. Worked under high-intensity situations and would often times wait for minutes for a supervisor to even call me back! The breaks were short and were sometimes forgotten and not regulated at all. It was a hard job but I learned a lot."
good,"They are slave drivers. They hire more employees so you never make more than 20 hours unless you are management or working holiday hours, which you cannot have a request at all. No accountability of cut hours, to large tasks that cannot be completed."
good,"Working clothes & fitting room,sooo much walking"
good,"Loved interacting with customers and my co-workers are amazing (some will be lifelong friends), but the management drove me to leave. They only want you to sign people up for credit cards and rewards cards, not genuinely enjoy your job. They make you resent it."
good,Honestly it depends on what store you get.There are rukes for some and no rules for others. iF you have been there for longer than 15 years you are in the club. if you have not been you get thrown under the bus.
good,"a typical day at kohl s is very stressful. i have been with the company for about a year and nothing has really changed but management. They work you to death then show little to appreciation for the work you have done. Everyday its about driving the kohl's credit line in which they are never satisfied with how many you get its always can you get ""one more."" the store I work in shows favoritism and does not make the schedule in an available time where you can plan any other life task such as finding baby sitters for the kids or even attending events for your kids. they preach about  being a family company but they never schedule you during your availability even for the school students. people are not held accountable for their actions."
good,"Great starter job with simple tasks and easy work. Great people and it is a great temporary job.  Unfortunately the job is stressful and can impede on personal life, as closers often have to stay late."
good,"It's an easy place to work at and everything you are required to do is easy to learn and if you ask for training, management is happy to help. However you will need to ask for that training a lot because many times you will be asked to do a job where you haven't really had any training doing before. The direction given is sometimes contradicting from different members of the management depending on who you happen to ask at the moment. Workload is sometimes more than what you can accomplish with the time or resources given."
good,communication is a mess within the store. but overall its an okay place to work many different people you work with.  6 hour shifts and you only get a 15 min break.
good,"The work day goes by very quickly, you are never bored, there are always projects that need to be done. I've learned how to jump right in without guidance it was kind of a swim or sink situation, management really does not have time to help you with anything. The workplace culture is a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job would be the days where we are short handed and one associate does the job of several associates. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people you meet while working there, associates and customers."
good,"The job kept me very busy when I had worked their.  I was limited to certain job's due to my sister also worked their.  If management didn't like you, you got really bad hours but if management liked you, you got 30 plus hours."
good,"Will teach you the basic skills to move forward in your retail career.  If you are looking to advance not a poor place to start, but you may find it a bit stagnate after a short time."
good,"I started out as a shopper then eventually applied to work during one of the biggest seasonal times thinking I could get more spending money in my pocket.  It really wasn't worth it."
good,"Welcomed every customer upon entry of store, checked out customers with a sociable attitude, signed up new accounts with a Kohl’s credit card and reward accounts, sold fine jewelry in a professional manner, kept work area cleaned and organized. Counted money at the end of closing from registers"
good,If you are looking for advancement in any way look further and away from this company. There is little room for you to climb the ladder and appraisal and promotions for good work are no where to be seen.
good,"Loved working there up until they brought a new manager, who really changed the tune of the environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and customers"
good,"Low paying job with no benefits and not a lot of advancement opportunities, enjoy working with co-workers, management gives time off when needed, plenty of break times afforded"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Loved my team but, was definitely over relied on and horrible communication. Was expected to do things, rather than communicating with me they would get upset and either blow up on me or keep everything in and ignore me."
good,The people I had on my team were Awesome. It just seemed like management wasn't all there. Sometimes they would completely over look our opinions or thoughts.

good,I Work For Kohl's Now...But I Am Looking For Another Job...They Will Hired You Then Keep Cutting Your Days Away...But They Keep Hiring New People Every Day...
good,had to solicit their kohls card for people to sing up even if i was working in the back to make sure operations were met! supervising the front and the back at the same time was not easy. the stuff they required was not possible to complete!
good,Consistently on your feet. Learned how to fold and organized clothes. Learned how to work cash registers.  Built good customer skills.  Learned how to work in the jewelry dept.
good,fold clothes on shelves ring up customers clean aisles stock merchandise no one talked to each other management was rude but tolerable left because I joined the army and they were very upset about it
good,"Very slow. no chances of advancement unless you play favorites. Customers are really nice not many problems, and their loss prevention department is amazing."
good,I loved working with the public.  I used this job as a part-time income but learned alot about retail.  Also worked in the freight department which was very hard work and very fast paced.
good,My experience with Kohl's was moderately pleasant. Worked well with my school schedule but the hours were low. Hardest part of the job was being able to stay motivated after receiving fifty dollar checks per week.
good,"Worked Holiday season of 2015-2016 only."
good,It isn't the worst place to work for but something you do not want to spend the rest of your life doing.  The managers look down on you like your nothing.  They base your amount of hours a week on how many credit cards you open up.  They're always switching what you're assigned to do the day you walk in.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers and engaging with the customers. It was a good balance of busy and slow. I was hired for the Christmas season, so I do not have a lot to judge the business on."
good,"You go and punch in after putting your stuff in a locker. Check in with the E3 and get your returns from customer service. Immediately it's stressful. Most of the time the store is understaffed. The high volume of customers mixed with the lack of employees means the entire store is typically trashed. Its impossible to stay organized because people drop things everywhere. They expect you to do a lot of work for little pay, and no recognition for anything you do. Sometimes you're left alone to handle three different departments. They call you up to register constantly, even if there are only 5 customers in line and you can be stuck up there for hours. Then chastised for your department being a mess because you weren't there to clean it. Management was alright,  like any work place some were great and some were not so great. Same with coworkers, I loved some and others were barely tolerable. The hardest part of the job was how busy and disorganized it could become. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with coworkers and meeting some great people."
good,It seemed very positive at first but the management was unkind and thought of their employees more as numbers. The co-workers that I had were amazing and made the job worth going to.
good,"Started out great until the changes came in effect, you compete for a job from start, somtimes there is hardly any work and you work less then 8 hrs a week and barley see a 40 hr check."
good,"This was such a fun place because the people, most all employees and management, kept things above stress and negativity. This was a fun combination of people. People come and go because the pay LOW LOW LOW. They do expect you to put out for the team by way of extra time and effort- step in if someone calls out, stay beyond you shift to cover etc.. The management brings in food and has dinners for the employees now and then; I personally, would rather have that money in my paycheck. The ""greatness"" they deliver and expect is out of perspective with the basic needs of the employees who are there for the money.You have to work there for 1 year for a minimal health insurance benefits ( basically none except optional $$ dental or vision), the hourly wage is well below what one might expect. Raises are between $.11 cents ( my 6 month increase) and $.16 cents ( my expected annual increase- if you want to call it that, - insulting in my opinion).  They do not offer military discounts (which seems really odd). After a year now, I am looking for another job that pays more. It won't be as fun but fun and nice won't pay my bills. A fellow worker with 3 years of experience there just now makes $8.00 per hour, and stays because it's nice, clean and fun to work there. ( Also looking for a full time job elsewhere for a better wage)."
good,"The Kohl's I worked at in Chicago was run terribly compared to the one I worked with in Connecticut before I moved. The management was poor and from my point of view, did not know what they were doing and were too young for the positions."
good,"A typical day at work was providing excellent customer service."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and being able to calm them down. A typical day consisted of helping customers with any questions they may have and putting away returned merchandise. I also would help people order things online.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls allowed me to fold a lot of cloths and organize a lot of shoes, then the seasonal work came around and just increased the work load. keeping the store intact and helping customers look for items in the mess."
good,"Part of first shift (4am-1:30pm)"
good,"Kohl's, was a  great to work with, but  lack of  leadership, left me  clueless at points of the  day and not knowing what to do next, no  training at which I think they  should have.. When it came to management help or  some  leadership on what to do next, they  pretty much  throw under the bus, and you had to guess on the  go."
good,"It's retail so it's never an easy job, but the employees are really nice and easy to get along with. The pay is not that great and there's not a lot of advancement to make more money. Some of the customers may be mean, but there are those that are really sweet and make being there much more fun."
good,"There is always a ""buddy system,"" and if you are not a managers friend then you pick up the slack of all the people who are. They work you so hard that you are drenched in sweat and nearly fainting, then you still get taken aside and asked why you are taking so long. They provide praise and promises of job advancement, yet when the rubber hits the road, they don't come through. Also, during the training video there are certain corporate protocols that are NOT enforced and are actually discouraged during store operation. Most make the company more money, but is making the company look very bad in the long run by negating on all promises and true protocol."
good,"The managers was very unorganized, unsecure, vulgar language used from managers and employees had to make sure no one stole their lunch out of refrigerator or lockers!"
good,"Supervisor the children's  Appt, worked on recovering, putting new freight out, worked on new plan-a-grams. "
good,"A typical day at Kohl's didn't really require very much advanced skill, but it was my first job as an adult. You'd get your typical fair share of difficult customers along with very pleasant ones as well. I was hired for a seasonal cashier position for the holiday season of 2012."
good,"I only worked here for a seasonal positions, I was still in high school so I could only work certain days & for a certain amount of hours. Management never wanted to work with me around my school schedule. I actually had to miss my homecoming dance because they scheduled me on the day of the dance after I took off a month in advance. Staff always had drama"
good,I learned a lot about the public. It gave me empathy for retail workers. I do not think Kohl's is any better or worse than other retail stores.
good,"busy, fast pace, working as a cash associate was great to learn, the customer was nice and polite.Management was great,"
good,Management is very poor. did not give proper orientation. Not to mention the 11 hours every two weeks.
good,"I worked at kohl's for two years. Never had a great day. Always felt thirsty when i worked there it was weird. Management sucked always tried to fire me. They hired people when they didnt have hours to give. Worked me literally one day a month. One time i worked once in 4 months, it was crazy...."
good,"Wonderful work environment. Great co-workers some good management, good breaks, they would work with you on hours and needed days off."
good,"The hours are flexible and it is a good starting job for a high school graduate that continues as a full time college student. Must ask questions regarding many of the promotions the company has or you will be lost. The hardest part of a starting position is staying updated with the store. The easiest part is that the starting positions are simple, but menial."
good,"I filled out a general application.  I didnt recive an interview, was called for orentation. Once in orentation i was made aware that i was only being hired for one day."
good,Kohl's is very flexible with your work schedule and company cares about customers and as well as their employees. A great place to start off a job.
good,- Loved my co-workers
good,Some of the staff was okay and understanding. But the management staff was not quit understanding. They held a vendetta against you if you called out on a busy day. They will deduct hrs from you if you called out. Unappreciative management.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's was one of my first retail jobs...co-workers were delightful, management a bit on different pages, and I worked in many, many, many different parts of the store."
good,a typical day at work
good,"Nothing great. Pay is good with bonus but funny how it is put together. No room for growth, company is downsizing."
good,Management was horrible. I was hired there to bring better customer service but who they really needed to fire was there management. I had so many customers come to my register to compain about management
good,A very busy place to work. I enjoyed the people that worked there and my bosses were very laid back
good,Helping Customers
good,you go in and work and leave and go home and do it all over again
good,I belive more team work with employees that are commited to the store would be able to keep the store more organized and shopable.
good,- there isnt a lot of promotions at this store
good,Transfer process takes too long. Being dumped for weeks
good,Transfer process takes too long. Being dumped for weeks
good,"Great work envirnoment, just not enough hours. Very fast paced job. Defenitly a good job for a college student or someone in high school."
good,"A typical work day included but not limited to: Assisting customers with returns, answering phones, re-tag products, go backs, routing calls, cash register."
good,Always something to do during busy season working for them was enjoyable
good,I worked at Kohl's for 8 years as a permanet part time employee.
good,Steady work place
good,"Managers were really not going through their policy, they would do what they would want."
good,"Poor Training (seasonal ppl) and they don’t ask questions so we are having to clean up after and duplicate efforts.  Job duties change every day without informing us."
good,"Terrible hours you're either there at 4am or staying until midnight. Pay isn't worth it, McDonald's pays more. Strict but easy dress code. Management was incredibly friendly and understanding tho"
good,"Dont expect hours or good pay, but the customers are the best part of the job. Only the managers are guaranteed hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Supervisors act like they’re better than you and you’re an inconvenience when you ask for help. Coworkers micromanage because supervisor is rarely around. There is rarely any direction. My first day i waited a half an hour in the break room waiting for a manager to direct me where to go because they had forgotten or i don’t even know what. The discount and the customers are the only reason I stuck around.
good,"Kohls pays minimum wage with minimum hours, expect 15 hours a week until the holidays. The work load is massive, you have your own department and its all you, good luck asking for help. Don't expect to be going home on time either."
good,The work environment is very unhealthy and management is terrible and not very good. The work environment is very toxic and unprofessional. Staffing is not good and the work the employees do does not match the pay.
good,they always say theyre hiring but you get 4 hours a week. they only care about the kohls charge and not about their people. was so glad to leave his place.
good,Deal with racism on a daily (in my store) & they aren’t organized when it comes the there employees. You’ll be scheduled one day in customer service & the next is jewelry.
good,The company has it's ups and downs the overtime was good enough but when the manager says you're going to get hired and you don't that gets you upset  you know what I mean
good,"Unloaded trucks, stock, scan, and customer service.  The people are nice but with poor management. A lot of company gossip that made me sick. No advancement and one of the lowest wages i have ever had. Job security for retirement was a plus and dental insurance part-time."
good,"I just worked here because I needed a job, I did not like retail at all but I did it anyway. It was okay in the beginning, my coworkers were great but some of the managers were bossy, one was lazy, he didn't want to do any floor work, just stay in his office. I would never work there again, but if you need a job they will take anybody."
good,"When I’m at a week where I don’t get many hours, it’s pretty easy to pick a shift that somebody wants to give up or take somebody’s shift that called out and such. Kohl’s has been willing to ask for extra help when it is needed, which helps bring extra cash to my wallet."
good,"They decided to stop putting me on the schedule in January, I was technically an employee there through May. I'm raising a 15 year old I can't be without money for that long. Other Kohl's may take their employees into consideration but this one certainly didn't."
good,Loved the people I worked with.  I didn't like having to clean up after other employees who did not always do their job.  I did not get paid very well in the first year I was there.  I eventually got a supervisor position and starting earning a little more than previously.  I did not get a lot of hours so I was only part time.  Good job for students as they are very flexible for their schedules.  Probably not for someone who is trying to support themselves alone.
good,"I was happy with my job at first but,my team started caring less and less as I worked there. I am sure not all locations are this way but, I ended up working a lot for little pay and people who had been there a long time barely made any more than me."
good,"I worked there as a cashier about 10 months. My coworkers and supervisors were the best people to work with. The assistant manager was nice but business like, the general manager was very fake. He puts on a big show of smiles and happy for customers but out of earshot would make veiled ultimatums to his employees, too much pressure is put on employees to open new credit accounts with customers it was to the point that people, including supervisors were threatened with termination if they didn’t light a fire under their employees butts to make credit sales"
good,"I enjoyed working there for awhile. pay was awful, mgmt change and went down hill, too stressful working there for me. I needed a better paying job and I got one and still at that particular job"
good,Management is a little hard to deal with sometimes. They can be rude and uptight. The people that I worked with overnight were all really nice and as long as you showed up for work and hustled then you had lots of opportunities for overtime.
good,"job wasnt too bad."
good,While they pay you weekly which is great starting off new hires with little traning with 8 hour shifts is alittle much and if you are a student like myself they were reluctant to adjust my schedule with prior notice. It's not a bad company but perhaps not for everyone.
good,Really have nothing to say. Enjoyed the time I spent with Kohl's loved the discounts my hours where set environment was fast paced fun and if management had been better I'd still be with them
good,"Too much focus on selling credit cards, not enough focus on actual employee performance."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This job wasn't entirely bad, but it was surely not for me. This was my first time working retail in over 3 years and I had to get used to being on my feet all day. I lost about 15 pounds in a month here. That's how much work you do! To their defense, this was a seasonal position and the holiday season is always extremely busy. The store is always SO hot in the winter to wear I've had customers complain and ask to turn the heat down. So prepare for that."
good,"I loved my coworkers, however, the management on the other hand was terrible. So much miscommunication amongst all managers to where nobody knew what was going on hardly at all. Especially after the renovation, things just went down hill fast. Cashier and Customer Service is pretty easy, that’s what I was hired on for. Only thing that is stressful is the credit card applications, this is the main thing the company values. A little side note too, if you don’t get credit applications, your hours could be cut or even fired."
good,"The cashier job was fun and most customers were friendly.  Closing shift was awful, your tired and have to put away all the merchandise  before they let you escape home.  Low pay and expect to work thanksgiving and black Friday.  Managers only like you if you get 8 customers to apply for a kohls credit card.   If not, they will cut your  hours."
good,"I worked as a freight associate unloading merchandise coming off the semi truck on a line you would hang the clothes into categories on rolling carts. This shift started at 6 am and was pretty easy and lasted from one to three hours depending on how many people are on hand helping. You would typically take a break when this was done and then bring the merchandise onto the floor into the areas that needed replenishing or new products. The pay was $9.00 which was too little for all the work you were doing heavy lifting, hot environment, etc"
good,The job pace started out busy with it being the holiday season but then once the new year started and things slowed down the job became worse and worse. I started getting less and less hours and it wasn't worth my time to drive over 20 minutes there to work for just about enough money to cover gas costs. Overall one of the worst jobs I have had.
good,I worked a lot of hours and was standing the whole time with the exception of breaks. It probably wouldn't have been too bad if I didn't work such long hours. 7 hours can be very draining. Not to mention boring
good,Pay is ok the management is terrible. You can not have vacations or get time off because of black out days. So if you have a trip and it is during the black out days you can’t call off. The environment is ok people there will hold  grudges and will not be nice to you if you do something wrong or taking longer then usually.
good,No praise for your job except co-workers & a few nice managers.  Top manager boost about her achievements & hardly ever smiles or has a kind word. A lot of people that are in her click are just like her. Customer service is very lacking also. Training is lacking & you either learn on your own or get help from the managers you know will help you or one of your co-workers.
good,"It's retail, so you should not expect too much from it. You get paid $9 an hour and will work anywhere from 12 to 40 hours a week, allow you to work overtime in November-December. "
good,It is not bad. Co-workers are ok. The schedule changes every week and we have no control over it. We can ask for days off but can't choose our schedule.
good,I feel that this location would thrive if it would consider reevaluating it’s management. There is a large disconnect between management and employees. While working there a person will feel a “Highschool mentality” of the “popular crowd” versus the rest of the employees/management.
good,"The management is just terrible all around, they play favorites and only give hours to the people that they are buddy-buddy with. Instead of giving the part time people more hours they prefer to just keep hiring more part time employees and then throwing them in without proper training. You cannot live off this wage, $9 an hour but you might only be scheduled one or two 4 hour shifts a week, or depending on your availability you could go weeks without being scheduled at all. Friendly coworkers, and the job itself isn't that bad depending on your department. Just isnt worth it if you need a real job."
good,"This job is very social, and competitive. You need to know how to talk to people, and how to please them. There are high expectations for behavior and conduct."
good,"I'm sure for most people working at Kohl's is just fine, but my experience was pretty rough. I started as a cashier, which was totally fine. They never asked anything of me that was out of the ordinary or outside of my job description and I did actually enjoy cashiering (as much as someone could). But then they asked me to work the jewelry counter and beauty department. I was incredibly excited about getting to move up a little in the company, it felt good that they trusted me and wanted to promote me. So I worked two jobs in which I was supposed to be promoted (you know, with a raise and training and all), without actually being promoted. I did all of the required training, and did the jobs well, especially selling products in the beauty department (which I was supposed to get partial commission for). But I did not receive the pay increase or the commission that I was supposed to be getting. And when I brought this up to management; they immediately put me back on a register and cut my hours to about 6 hours a week... I was forced to find a new job."
good,"It's an ok temp job if you want extra Christmas money or something like that but it is definitely not somewhere I could see myself trying to make a career out of, management is changing daily and a lot of management have no idea how to do the job themselves."
good,"I didn't have the greatest experience at Kohl's. The management was awful, there would be employers fooling around not doing anything taking more than two breaks and no one would care. Items would be unorganized and most employers were lazy with no definite leadership in the store. During Black Friday weekend, employers were treated like slaves working extensive hours and the manager could have cared less. Not the greatest working environment, would not recommend."
good,"Its retail. It's very slow and over caters to public. This causes huge issues when it come to cleanness and organization of the store.  Its a sink or swim mentality and no where to turn for help or suggestions. It was a bridge job for me. If you are looking for long term or permeant, I would not recommend it. If your wanting a year or so to get education etc. completed, then it is good."
good,Very drama filled and honestly the management sucks they don’t listen to a word you have to say specifically sheena is a terrible manager & person....
good,A typical day at Kohl's would be to clock in and go to my assigned area and check the dressing rooms. Next would be to fold tables and put merchandise in the right place. If my shift would be early morning I would go to the stock room and unload merchandise and put out merchandise.
good,"Kohls worked great with my school schedule and I was doing so well picking up skills they gave me more responsibility. However, this didn't come with a raise; I got fed up with the management and not being paid what I was worth. I was being paid less than those I was training."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's was my first job that I got and loved working there.Is not a hard job you just need to do your responsibilities. I left because there was rarely any transportation late at night.
good,They were very inattentive to me being a mother and needing LESS hours. They would write me up for not coming on my days off if called in. It was a very crazy place to work very unorganized
good,Fue un lugar bueno para trabajar y aprender mucho sobre compras en linea
good,"The Ottawa, IL DC was much better than the Edgewood, MD facility.  I took a pay cut to be a secretary and I am not ok with that.  I have more skills that could be put to use else where"
good,"Constant walking, short breaks, not much social interaction, employees were okay, manager sucked. If you don't need the job, don't get it. I'd find something better."
good,"I didn't enjoy working there, i just think some stores have a dynamic. The days went very slow and I kinda felt like we were the ""poor"" kohls and become under new management when I was hired."
good,"What you typically expect from working retail, but the store I worked for would be flexible with your hours. The downside was you couldn't get consistent hours. Some weeks I would get 40 hours, and other times I would get 20. You worked for EVERY cent you made."
good,I worked here in hours that would still allow me to work for myself. They seemed to work in 2 different ways. Ether  they would load you up with hours to work or wouldn't give many out then ask for more from you when they needed more.
good,The job asked more from you than what they would typically pay. There was no real way of moving up unless someone either left the company or transferred to another store. The pay raise itself wasn't the best considering they would have one person for two departments.
good,"management really has no respect for the employees, the hours were never great , and if you're looking for a place to work around your changing school schedule ... kohls is not the place for you."
good,Some days were nice but it got to point where working involved just standing for hours on end with nothing to do. People sometimes were book during hours they had initially requested to not be worked during.
good,Kohls's is a great place to work if you are seeking a business degree and want to run your own store one day . Although my specific location had poor management at the time it could've been a great opportunity for growth. Unfortunately that was not the case
good,"Typical day can be stressful depending on managers demands. Job was to oversee customer service and point of sale to make sure everyone  was offered a Kohls Card to save money, and to make sure the customers walked out the door with a great experience."
good,"When we were hired we were told we would be working 20-25 hours a week. We got 10 hours a week. I loved associating with the customers, in the customer service department. The challenges of making everything work together was fun for me."
good,Was being groomed for a supervisor position and they turned it over to someone else (younger and more malleable) without giving me a proper chance. I worked there for 2 and a half years and I felt like I deserved to move up.
good,I only worked here for a seasonal job. I didn't get to know the job culture very well. I was still in high school and they worked with my school and after school activity schedule to get me some hours
good,"I am having issues with the head manger at my store, she is always looking down on me for having health issues that mean sometimes i have to leave early or call in sick. other than that i love my job,"
good,"The hours you work are very inconsistent and often times based on who you are. The management is quick to cut your hours if they do not feel as you are working to their standards (i.e. getting enough people to sign up for credit cards). Other than that the job is okay. They pay you relatively well for how much work you do and the job itself is easy to learn and do. However, if you have consistent bills to pay and are needing part time, I would not recommend working here. The hours are flexible though."
good,Khols Distribution Center is a good place to work for those who has a steady income. Due to volume shortages there has been a lack of hours for those who are looking for stability and that is the only flaw i see for the khols warehouse. outside of that it is a very positive environment and a fun and good pace to work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a very stressful and uptight environment that offered no training or very little training. The people where so bad I almost left the first day.
good,"The work was steadily consistent. Trailers of product would be delivered, then we unloaded the merchandise to the assigned department or store on pallets and shelving."
good,"replenished products, cashier and cleaned, liked working with the public. holiday parties, discounts. Liked working in the background of the store, great co workers"
good,"I enjoy my job here, but I know it's going to be temporary. We are very overstaffed currently. It's my first time working retail, so far so good. No complaints"
good,Helping open the store was definitely a job in itself. With so many tasks to complete it can easily become overwhelming. Truck day was especially hard but nice to see new products.
good,Don't enjoy the minimum wage and no real prospect for raises. The management definitely had favorites and everyone else didn't get any appreciation. Just did not like job
good,"I worked at Kohls for 6 months. At first, i really liked the job. The associates were really nice on helping you.  I didn't like the hours much the most hours you would get on daily bases would be like 5 or less. You had to work Saturdays so for a part time job I didn't like cause I already worked Monday through Friday 8 hours a day. Couldn't call out much unless you had someone to cover for you because it would count against you. Management also wasn't fair sometimes rude."
good,Hours fluctuate. No benefits for part time workers. Holidays are hectic and after the big push they cut your hours to make up for any overtime. If your lucky you can pick up hours by working in other departments.
good,"I liked it because i showed there a lot. The people were nice and they worked around your schedule. The hardest part was learning the floor, after that it was easy peasy."
good,"only one rule here. manager is king. if you get caught even suggesting that you do not like him, (even if it has nothing to do with him he may assume your conversation has something to do with him) you'll find yourself suddenly with drastically less hours. and don't bother complaining you could end up without hours for weeks for complaining. but hey free lunches every now and then should make up for it, right?"
good,"If your part time flex your hours could vary. Sometimes I may not even be on the schedule. Also, some of the supervisors show favoritism to certain employees"
good,"The reason I left was because it was seasonal. But I would've stayed there longer if I hadn't been let go at the end of the season. It wasn't a bad job, but I didn't like being on the floor. I preferred the stock room, where I could do my job with no interruptions."
good,"Hours are flexable, the discounts are nice, overall it's a good job for a student or someone looking for a small part time job for a little extra spending money, but rather difficult to make a living off of. There is a rather high turn over rate due to the general demographic of the associates employed. The hardest part working with the company is the lack of routine schedules."
good,"Co-workers were most very helpful and fun to work with, managers were a pain always reminding us about pushing Kohl's credit cards to customers and having a big board in the break room showing how many cards each employee got monthly. "
good,"Working here I experienced prejudice acts, not known for diversity, favoritism was shown between managers and other employees, and so  much more. Employees would argue with customers or just not properly assist them. Employees lack the enthusiasm to even work. Management would rarely come out of their office unless there is a major issue at customer service. Staff members normally gossip and isn't a child friendly atmosphere around Christmas. Former coworker in this department arrived to work drunk on numerous occasions and had an incident with a child under the age of four."
good,I was very happy at kohls i wished to learn many things. But certain management would stop u from advancing. There were things that happened and management would turn their head.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work if you need a second job. They are very flexible when it comes to availability and scheduling. I planned to work there a couple of months but ended up working there two years.
good,"Only work here if you like old women who gossip like they're in high school. Management sucks and there's just a lot of nonsense in that company, from all levels."
good,"When I started at Kohl's I was so excited! it was my favorite place to shop, and to be able to work and get the discounts made me excited. The whole team of associates were very kind and team oriented. After some of the best mangers left or got let go for personal reasons the store became very cold, and disorganized. No more team work and the mangers all lost focus of that making the store score go down with customer satisfactory and store presentation also. I loved all my fellow associates even though, many came and gone and I always had an outstanding time helping customers shop."
good,I started working for Kohl's at the Denton TX location and loved it. I now work at the location in Wichita Falls TX and it is horrible. It all depends on whos running the place and if they care about employees or not.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"you will mostly work a 6 hour shift or less, only full time people work 8 hour shifts, sometimes you may have a 3 hour shift, to be honest that is not worth the gas. the benefits though of working there like the employee discount is really good you can stack coupons and stuff. :"
good,They place emphasis on getting new credit applications and expect you to be aggressive in asking. Most mangers are very good. This was my first time working in retail sales. I love working with the public and interacting.
good,Kohls was a fun place to work I didnt stay there too long it was just for the christmas season but overall everyone was great and managemnet was very nice.
good,"N/A "
good,"work you like cattle, always handing out bad hours, and will threaten with unemployment if you need days off for any reason. try not to work here if your looking for an inviting environment."
good,"The work environment is hectic, and when you close don't expect to get out on time, sometimes we're there a hour after our scheduled end time. Pay is okay, and management isn't the best. They care about making credit more then their workers well being and being able to let us leave on time. Sometimes they'll have one person closing three departments to save money. The only enjoyable part of the job is all of my coworkers."
good,Just like most companies they don't care about their employees or their safety. The clothes and discounts are the best part of the job. The hours are terrible and if u close you have to pick up after the entire days shift.
good,I liked it but there wasn't a lot of cashiers on my side. it was pretty busy on the weekends and weekdays but I managed. it was hard to take my break cause I had to wait for someone to come in and take my spot and then when my break was over I had to hop on another register to help them out.
good,Very unorganized and could not get job done as they always did not have enough associates working. Store was extremely busy and got and so had to multitask to get job done.
good,"My typical day involved helping customers constantly, cleaning a third of the store usually, and then lack of hours after season when I had given much to work and do what I could for customers as they needed."
good,"Typical work day: Clear out fitting rooms, soliciting Kohl's credit card, helping out in customer service"
good,I would cash out the customer's products and answer any questions they had. Made sure they received the best deals. Sold credit. Every transaction I was basically forced to sell credit. I learned how to run Kohl's Computer system. Never really talked to any manager's. It was hard to get a hold of anyone. Didn't get to know anyone. It was very cliquey. The hardest part of the job was selling credit because a lot of people immediately are rude to you after that and no one wanted it. I would constantly get in trouble for not selling enough credit. The most enjoyable part was how fast time went by.
good,A typical day at work consisted of checking customers out and folding clothes making everything look neat. I have learned to always keep a smile on your face and remain calm even if a customer is being difficult.
good,If you don't get credit applications they look down on you and pull you into an office where they try to find out why you aren't  getting applications.
good,good place to work if your in school or retired.or if you just want some extra cash.Its a very flexible job. Everyone who work there is a great group of people from all walks of life.
good,Kohl's was a great introduction to retail. I was able to hone my communicative skills with customers in a relaxed environment. The workday was very simple and not at all stressful.
good,If you are a Cashier you are confined to a small area. Management is not very willing to help you when you need. Not a fun place to work over all.
good,Kohls was very unorganized.. they were hiring alot of people and its like they would just forget about the people they just hired a week ago. HR didnt ever seem to have any answers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Retail is stressful specially during the holiday season. Expect to work on holidays and overnight shifts before Christmas as it is a store that is open 24 hours before the holiday.
good,"Working at Kohl's is like working for any other retail store. It's a fast paced job that at times can be very stressful. I learned how to be able to manage and control my stress along with plan a head of what I am going to have to do before the store closes. Working along side co-workers is always fun, it makes your time go faster and it makes the job more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is probably how you have to juggle a lot of things all at the same time. The customers to me are probably the best part if working retail. Being able to talk and communicate with different people and helping them find what they want is always something that I have enjoyed."
good,I enjoyed working for Sutter Gould.  I loved working in Pediatrics.  The only disadvantage was the management and they lack of raises.  I would work there again but not under the same manager.
good,Life at kohl's distribution was very interesting. I was taught many skills along the way. Though we worked long 10hr shift some fun some dry. it was a interesting journey
good,"I Didn't Like It Had A Hard Time Standing For Long Periods Of Time, MANAGERS WERE RUDE! Most Enjoyable Pat About The Job Was The Co-Workers. No Free Lunches."
good,I would take care of all of home and kids department i would make sure that everything was cleaned and put away and nicely folded. on some day i would be a cashier ya ring up everything and people where buying and i would also be a door greater. i also restocked on nightshift and unloaded the truck in the warehouse.
good,"Kohl's is all about credit numbers. Employees with bad customer relations and work ethic will continue to work as long as they can get credit cards. If you don't like to harrass people for credit cards, you get hounded as to why you don't have any on your shift. Managers are desperate to fulfill corporates daily quotas and some have been fired for unethical ways to get them. If you get low credit when you're on the clock, your whole day is tense and the managers all hover around to watch what you do. Very uncomfortable work environment. You feel pressured all day. They create schedule based on number of credits. Vacation last weeks? Shows zero credits so 4 hours the next scheduled week. Only income during college, but low credits? Maybe 8 or 12 hours."
good,"-Not as organized a work environment as I am used to, or was especting"
good,Kohls has a great strategy and excellence in customer service. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time.
good,This job would be perfect for students and grown ups that don't have any bills... they only give you up to 26 hours in a pay period and they trick you into thinking you have the ability to pick up hours or gain more when in reality you can not. Working here is like working for gas money.
good,Management could have been a LOT better! We were understaffed and therefore worked to death and given ridiculous impossible deadlines for the amount of people we had. I was worked so hard to the point of an ER visit due to dehydration. I could never find the time to stop for two seconds to get a drink of water because if we stopped for the slightest second we were yelled at! Therefore I became dehydrated!
good,"Keeping the building's conveyor system up and running for production"
good,"I've worked at this store in Frederick. I recently left. The only good thing about working there is the discounts that you are able to use along with your associate. They didn't pay well enough although I have over 10 years of retail experience. ($8) As well as them saying their a company that makes lots of money. Some weeks you may have 20 hours, next week 0, another week 4. This went for the people who have been at this store or with this company for YEARS!! If you get this job it is best to have a second one as well. I've also noticed this store doesn't care as much about customer service as they do about getting customers to sign up for credit. Not to say they completely don't care. Im sure they do. I know this is a company but credit was the main thing talked about vs anything else."
good,"At Kohl's you are expected to do a lot of work during your shift for your area and for others. The coworkers are wonderful people and it's wonderful to make friends but the company doesn't do right by them. The company will not allow associates to work more than 26 hours a week, so as not to receive any benefits, and only pays $7.25 an hour. It is not worth it."
good,Store Manager was rude and Floor/Retail Managers where not very nice they would argue with employees or customers in front of employees or customers. Horribly training. Great Company but not great Managers I felt unwelcomed and disrespected as a person.
good,not enough work life balance. management team lacks proper communication with each other and the team supporting them. do work with associates when it comes to availability they are able to work. enjoy working with some of my fellow coworkers.
good,This was a seasonal job that I was hired for black Friday. It was a good experience just not the job for me. Management and staff was very disorganized. Thank you Kohls for the experience though
good,"I participated in several job positions such as, cashier, organizing clothes, putting up clothes, and mainly getting customers to sign up for credit and rewards cards."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I was a sales associate at Kohl's. A typical work day included working at the cash register. The hardest part of the job was not being able to leave the register to help customers with questions. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy a customer would get when they had a good coupon.
good,"I was responsible for restocking product, cleaning departments, providing stellar customer service to store patrons; greet customers entering the establishment; tabulating bills using calculators, cash registers, and optical price scanners; informing customers of store promotions and sales; soliciting Kohl's credits and e-mail offers; price adjustments during purchases; redeeming and issuing coupons; receiving payment by cash, check, credit cards, or automatic debits; issue receipts; answer customers' questions, and provide information on procedures or policies; making sure that customers leave with a positive experience; cleaning departments around registers; replenishing merchandise at the end of the night; and assisting co-workers."
good,"I was assigned a lot of work right off the bat.  Not asked what department I would like to work in.  I asked for one evening off, for being home with my daughter, and they objected.  Bad management. Makes one do a lot of work for little money.  In customer service dept. an employee has a lot of responsibilities."
good,"Kohl's is an exciting place to work.  Things are never the same from day to day.  One day I might be on the register for my entire shift.  The next day, I might be on the floor changing out the layout of the clothes on the plannogram.  The next day, I might be unloading merchandise off of a truck and getting it ready to go out on the floor.  For this reason, I like working at Kohl's.  What I don't like is the fact that one manager will give me a task to complete and before I can complete it, another manager has come and told me to do something completely different.  It always felt like nothing was accomplished because management didn't give me enough time to get anything done.  Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that if I closed on a Monday night at 10pm, my schedule said that I needed to be back on Tuesday morning at 8am.  There wasn't a specific set of hours that I worked.  Because of that, I was never able to catch up on my sleep and my work suffered because of it."
good,"working there all in all was a great experience for the most part, your on your feet all day which is no problem unless your not big on that but it was fine for me."
good,"A typical day as a Sales Associate at Kohl's, consists of putting all clothes back on racks from all dressing rooms. Walk the department floors, and make sure table clothing and racks are all neat, while making sure the floor is clean and all departments are presentable. Help customers find clothing or any home décor items if asking for help. Make it easier for shoppers to find what they are looking for, along with keeping a positive attitude while guests are shopping."
good,"They would not balance my work schedule with my school schedule, even though the managers said they would."
good,"Zero possibility of advancement."
good,"Open and or close store, oversee associate transactions on the floor and at point of sale"
good,"Although this job was seasonal, I started working there with intentions of working hard so I could be hired full time. We were told if we didn't met a certain quota of emails and credit cards that we would be let go."
good,Sorted incoming merchandise appropriately at the beginning of the night and stocked said merchandise at the end of the night.
good,"best part is your co-workers, they become another family. most of the employees are willing to help each other out with anything they can."
good,"This company had allot to improve on since I worked their from October 2010, to January 2011. I worked hard hoping I would have a permanent Job while I went to college. They discreetly handed me a letter saying that my work was terminated as of January 1, 2011, but I was welcome to return come the next holiday season. I haven't worked their since."
good,"not enough time in the day to get your work done on a daily or weekly bases. to much other stuff going on and they don't care how you do it , and what needs to be done in a short space of time."
good,I learned how to deal with fussy customers. Management was horrible and barely gave hours. Co-workers were great and i made friends with a lot of people i worked with and still keep in touch.
good,"I work at the lakeside store in Michigan. You have employees who have been there over 20 years, to say the least they get to do what they want. Such as hour long lunches to taking four to five breaks per shift. It's no way you can move up in this store because of the employees who been there 14-28 yrs. it's no need to talk to management there they don't address and problems you may have they just hope it goes away. I'm a white female and notice that there is no black people in any positions at this store and I been here for five years which is really sad. The only thing I can say is if you need time off its no problem."
good,A typical day at work is just the basic work given nothing more or less. I did however learn how to interact with customers a lot more and assist them better with a team effort as well as individually. My managers were overall good to me and my coworkers. Never really had a hard time while working there. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the joyous smiles on the customers face with my excellent servicing skills.
good,"I have worked for Kohl's for over 5 years. Although they promote strong core values and expect great things, they absolutely do not compensate their associates. I expect more out of a multi-billion dollar corporation."
good,Fun place to work as a teenager. Flexible hours. Working in a retail store you are required to work every holiday and weekends. A very fast paced enviroment.
good,A typical day at Kohl's is spent making sure the customer has a pleasant shopping experience. This entails working around expired coupons and difficult return situations. The customer needs to leave the store feeling highly satisfied with their Kohl's experience.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Typical Day:  Arrive at work, put personal belongings away, clock in, start work.  I would go to the loading dock to see if I had any freight that needed to be unpacked, put out, or both. As it got closer to the May 2014 date when I quit, I was doing a lot more processing than putting out and simple requests to management (like, ""Can we try to keep this area clear so that I can reach my back stock?"") fell on deaf ears."
good,A typical day work would include moving merchandise to the correct department and location.  Verification of product and location using the and RF gun was required.  We had to ensure the proper use of equipment.  We were also cross trained in other areas to be able to help out other departments.
good,"The main supervisor was a straight up b****. and the co-workers were mean. They placed way to much emphasis on trying to force people into getting a kohls card, and if you didnt reach a certain amount you would get punished. I was laid off afte the holiday season because I did not reach my goals. If people do not want a credit card why should you force them? And another thing you got yelled at for saying merry Christmas. I would not recommend working for them."
good,"merchendising departments, unloading truck, planograms, markdowns, ring on register, manager on duty, count deposit. provide customer service."
good,Typical retail job - processed customers at Point of Sale - good experience with customer service and dealing with people.
good,"Typical day of work at Kohl's literally consisted of having someone on your case about anything or everything. Rude customers, rude management. There was never really a time where a manager wasn't upset about something. They told you to stand up at the registers and help the customers that need the help or ask for it, and only move around to clean when it isn't busy in the store. Well once you go out to do your duties there's a manager there that tells you to go back to your register because ""you aren't supposed to leave."" "
good,"Great team to work with. I enjoyed helping customers acquire the products they were looking for. Management and my co-workers were always helpful. I however did not enjoy working different hours every day, the scheduling was a big issue for me."
good,"Kohls was a great place to start. I loved getting alone with all the new coworkers but I disliked how often they changed. The hardest part was some customers were very rude and disrespectful, making it hard to shake off at times. I enjoyed helping people find outfits for occasions and the joy they felt finding exactly what they wanted. I learned a lot about stepping up and taking charge in my time being there. I, however, found the supervisors and managers to be very rude. Its extremely hard to advance or get noticed there. I felt they cared more about the numbers than they did the customers and associates."
good,"Wages are minimum wage. Customers can be quite rude. Coworkers were great, but underpaid. Hours during the holidays were unreasonable."
good,"Got hired at a job fair for seasonal and it was super easy but once they keep you past seasonal they expect you to step it up. A typical day at work in the mjm department would be cleaning out fitting rooms, recovering the sales floor, and helping out on cash registers as needed. I learned about their inventory, and working on early morning trucks. Management picks favorites in the company and co-workers are fake and like to gossip. The hardest part is dealing with the different managers and their different expectations. The most enjoyable part was the occasional 35% discount."
good,"This job is the same indeed couldnt tell the diffference"
good,"there were fixable with there hours, they don't give hours. costumers were good, you stand all day on you feet."
good,"I was quickly immersed into the retail world, but didn't have interaction with customers for years because I was an overnight shift worker. When o/n shift was eliminated, I was taught almost every floor position and advanced at the store, but sort of hit a wall re promotions. Very dedicated employees and the store bends over backwards for customers."
good,"Working at Kohl's isn't generally stressful, but when it is, it's because of our horrible managers. Very unprofessional, all they care about is their job position. They've been rude to customers as well as employees..."
good,"When you first start at Kohl's you will get hours and the majority of the employees will treat you like terrible, becauses you're stealing their hours.  Then when they hire a bunch of new employees (several times a year) then you understand why the employees were jerks.  When I left most of us got 4 to 8 hours a week. Doesn't even pay for your gas."
good,"The Kohls in Florence SC is awful. Mostly because of management. They could care less about their employees, bad communication and just overall not a good place to work if you want any respect. The store manager thats there now (sweatbass) treats her employees like they are dogs telling thwm to do something NOW and just speaking to them with no respect. I have heard her say that the difference between her and her employees is that the employees have to work she on the otherhand doesn't. She is also one who doesn't follow kohls policies as she should be treating customers awful and yelling at them along with yelling at the associates on the floor, shutting down the mens side register and locking the doors sometimes more than an hour before the store closes, closing jewelry to early, being in the store by herself when she is supposed to have one other person in their with her. Also not letting her associates take breaks when they are supposed to get them, talking about anyone she worka with to other employees negatively, giving her associates ultamatims, etc. Do not work at this store if you want to be treated like a real employee. The pay is not good and not much leverage for advancement."
good,They hire you and tell you they don't hire holiday worker but they don't really keep on anyone and don't give you any notice when you get laid off. Most of the managers are not friendly and you have to call then up to the front several times before anyone shows up to help which can make the costumers unhappy. Sometimes don't get your break because no one is there to cover you.
good,"A typical day would either be opening or closing the jewelery department. I was responsible for counting diamonds, customer service, counting cash register."
good,"Was very nice, Helping people find things that they were looking for. On that day I had to keep my work area neat and clean and help with line control."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Call center. it was always busy and when you did right you were never rewarded
good,Kohls was a great place to work. The employees were friendly and I enjoyed helping the customers
good,I like my job duty form helping customer and keep the sale floor clean and organized.
good,It was a good experience. Long shifts and too many people. I learned how to use an RF scanner and wrist rocket.
good,"Management has a huge lack of communication which leaves many associates left in the dark and are later blamed for not succeeding in areas where they didn't know they needed to work on."
good,"They work to be flexible with your schedule but don't set realistic expectations in regards to the Kohls charge requirement. Management also handles conflict poorly. However, there is room to advance if one so chooses"
good,"Highly stressful, under staffed, no communication between management/ employees, disorganized hostile environment,not team players, not company oriented, no associate feed back from management, and no room for advancement."
good,Productive but very unorganized and terrible leadership skills among management 
good,"Company was a good fit other than the late travel to public  transportation to my home. Was off by 12am, but travel took 2.5-3hrs to travel home. Very enjoyable atmosphere, associate and management was very friendly and knowledgeable. customers were polite. Enjoyed most was the weekly pay periods, hardest was part time hours. Not many hours were available."
good,"It was great working for Kohl's but when I came down, there was a difference between the northern stores and the southern stores.  Company functions are different. In New York you have to be an ANIMAL as a manager but the managers in Florida were to laid-back.  In business you must learn how to deal with your staff and in Florida the mangers  though that I was to aggressive. I decided to move on.  The company is doing well but as a client & and investor you are now beginning to see that Kohl's is not the same as a few years back. Prices are going higher and you must think of your customers. I believe you can get the same products for much cheaper if you just walk right next door. Be a smart consumer."
good,a typical day was very busy almost everyday. I learned to work a whole department by myself and help customers over the phone with product that were asking for. Management was okay. i have great co-workers! the hardest part of the job was rude customers & having very late shifts. helping people and making there day thats what i enjoyed most about this job. 
good,Store managers need to be evaluated on leadership skills and not just the number of sales they produce. Just because they can make sales and have high numbers on a survey does not mean that they can be a leader.
good,A typical day at work is to be there for 5 am to unload truck. After we unload the truck we merchandise is it and then set it up out on the floor. I learned that this job is very productive and fast paced. There's a great management crew. we have daily meetings about the numbers of the store to improve ourselves and the company. The hardest part about this job is that being on the freight team we do 5 jobs in one i feel and the most enjoyable part of the job is the communication you have with your manager and co workers.
good,Typical day at work was punching in checking where I was for the day and staying there until my shift was over. Managment didn't really know how to speak to people. Nothing about this job was enjoyable.
good,Sole responsibility of Transportation Office and Dispatch duties during the night shift. Assisted in problem solving issues for the building. The job required the ability to excel in constant multi-tasking.
good,- meet many different walks of life.
good,"clock in, go to dressing room, clean out clothes and put them away, than scan floor and racks for clothes to be put correctly."
good,· Part-time evening cashier responsible for all levels of customer service.
good,Typical day would be clocking in and working my register
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I learned a lot of visual merchandising for a big box company. Working soft lines and hard lines was a well rounded experience. The store was very short staffed and I was on the sales floor as a cashier 3 out of the 5 days in a work week toward the end of my employment.
good,Walking around in the shoe area helping customers with the kiosk for online shopping getting shoes for customers taking calls and making sure the area is clean. i didnt learn much i was temporary. The co-workers were alot older.
good,"I would arrive at work and help people try on clothes, find clothes and look for fragrances. After about 8 pm I would start going from one part of the store to the other organizing clothing and making it look more presentable."
good,I would change the advertisement signs overnight when the store was closed. As a cashier I would help the customers purchase their products and sell the Kohls products. I would also assist with any questions that arose. As a truck assistant I would take the clothing or merchandise off the truck belt and put it with the group it belonged to.
good,Good part-time job while in college
good,"cashiers are expected to sell the company credit card and push certain information to customers. then you are expected to keep a department clean and put away any clothes the customers leave behind in the dressing rooms, but the supervisors there arent as fabulous as they say they are. its a good part time job"
good,A basic day was to come in and change any display signs or price tags before store opens. Stocking the merchandise if we missed or got anything new with the shipment.
good,"- very low raise, 10% raise per level you move up."
good,I love my managers and co-workers. I loved my customers and my work.
good,it was a nice place to work but if you dont want to have a life then this would be the place for you to work at they could careless if you had a life outside of work or not.
good,This is not a terrible place to work if you love the same calls and repairs everyday. Management changes very often which makes it hard to gain relationships. I am just ready for a change and new challenge.
good,Kohl's is a good place to work if you are not looking for many hours and have no problem soliciting credit and email. Co-worker are friendly as is the management team. The hardest part of the job is soliciting credit the enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and providing excellent customer service.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's is getting as many Credit Card sells as possible. You get $1.50 per application even if the person doesn't get accepted. The bad side to this is management has a quota and if you don't meet it, you could lose your job. The hardest part of the job, is having to ask multiple times if the customer is sure they don't want to get a credit card and making them mad to no end. Then at the very end, telling them to take a survey online about their experience."
good,"Good started job, but nothing to start a family with. Schedule is unpredictable and the company will not work with emergencies."
good,This job was only seasonal and third shift. It was tough on my body.
good,". I help with the grand opening of Khols and I started on the sales floor in the wormens department . I did not get many hours in that department, but I would often help in other departments and learn how it was ran. One department that I like the most was th shoe department I wuld come in some times to help when there was a new shipment of shoes. It was there I learned how to process the shoes."
good,my daily task recover go backs assisting customers. assisting coworks with projects and point of service
good,Good part time job but not very good pay but the people were great to work with
good,Kohl's is a good company to work for employees are helpful to both other employese and very good with customer service.
good,Not bad. But the management just sits in the back the whole time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The company overall isn’t bad, it’s poor management that drives such a high turnover rate. There’s a lack of communication and consistency between managers and the amount of work that is expected does not equate to the rate of pay."
good,"I wouldn't recommend working there except as a seasonal cashier. Store manager was awesome, but other lower level managers were generally not happy. Most of the cashiers were very helpful to work with and helped me a lot."
good,Kohl’s could be an amazing company if it respected and valued its employees and management as much as it claims to respect and value its customers. You cannot have one without the other.
good,"Meet some nice people. "
good,"When you get hired you think this store is great. Managers all nice. Until you actually start working. They just throw you on the floor. I was put on the floor. Didn't know where anything was. Didn't even know where the break room was. And I had to figure out kronos by myself. Great co workers "
good,"Kohl’s was a learning experience for me in the retail department. People I worked with were great. Unfortunately it was very late hours of work, and they were not willing to work a schedule easy enough for me to maintain college."
good,This job helped me in those times i financially needed it. I learned a lot in sales too. Although it was seasonal i was atleast happy to serve customers get gifts for theit love ones before the holiday season. My coworkers were happy and fair with me.
good,I've suffered a spinal injury going into the seasonal position at Kohl's. Little to no compensation has been offered or given. My depression has spiked and now being diagnosed with CFS has caused another hurtle to my life.
good,"I wasn't there very long. It was a seasonal position. I got hurt, my manager was incompetent so it took a week for him to file the right paperwork for my injury. I still haven't been able to get ahold of work comp and ended up with a second injury with Vertigo on top of everything. HR was no help with anything and seemed uncaring. My time wasn't covered and when I had to leave because of my health and it not being safe to be at work i went negative in my time which meant I voluntarily resigned . Still haven't been able to get ahold of work comp so my first case is on hold because I needed approval to see a specialist. Everyone keeps telling me to ask HR for assistance but they never know anything and blame it on me and make excuses that work comp has been trying to contact me and i've given the wrong contact info so they gave up on my case which isn't true they never contacted me I've been the one reaching out with no luck. The manager I had in shipping for my accomodation was very helpful and nice and gave me VTO when he felt I needed it and was very attentive due to my injuries ."
good,The workplace was always clean and maintained. My co workers we very respectful with each onother and human resources would work with my schedule when I had important matters.
good,"Overall the experience was ok. "
good,"I used to  worked there for many years and honestly the people who work there are great but the management needs serious help. Unfortunately the high you move in position the more of a work load you receive and if it’s too much for you don’t let them know, they will make sure that you know that you are replaceable. Corporate positions don’t care how much you have on your plate they just add more and more until you break down."
good,"Management Team needs sensitivity training."
good,"The managers are all gossip and are extremely rude to employees. They do not care about their employees, all they care about is getting “credit”. They have threatened to cut employee hours. They pick favorites. They talk about employees to other employees."
good,"A quick way to supplement my income."
good,"I’ve worked in two different locations. I can tell you that the management really makes the difference. With the right one, everyone has room to grow and thrive."
good,"It’s a job. They do try at the work life balance . I’m just not sure how well this concept works in retail."
good,"The main requirements when working at Kohl's is to be professional, polite, and always prioritize customer satisfaction. You will need to have a competitive and driven personality because building loyal customers and opening up credit cards is a main concern for the company."
good,"I worked at Kohl's for about 10 months during my freshman year of college. I had no prior work experience due to my school schedule and AP classes in high school. Relatively easy interview, and friendly coworkers. However, it was easy to forget to take your breaks due to how understaffed the store was at times. Overall, it wasn't the worst job out there and the employee discounts rocked."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,it was my first job and I started around the holidays so it was very hectic and stressful considering I was also still in high school trying to balance both.
good,"As a student with an ever-changing schedule, it was difficult to constantly update my superior on my new schedule and getting shifts that worked with me at times."
good,"Fulfilling online orders"
good,Most manager were seen on there phones and not providing additional support to their employees. The higher up managers were always walking around not really doing anything. If you messed up they wouldn’t give feedback on how to improve in that area.
good,They will not accommodate schedules. They pay less then what you do. Managers are not on point. Store is way under staffed. Need to hire more people!.
good,I worked there when I was in Highschool. They were pretty easy to work with for a schedule but the culture of the workers themselves are very catty and if you’re not in your out.
good,"Started off good then seasonal workers were hired where they don’t do the work they’re suppose to. Management wasn’t good, supervisors didn’t care about their associates."
good,"Stressful work environment "
good,"During my time at Kohls, I was able to put my strong communication skills to work as well as learn a good deal regarding customer service. I enjoyed the relationships I formed through the Kohls community and the opportunities the company provided for giving back."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with other than management. I often felt like the management was belittling towards myself and coworkers instead of being a leader figure. On multiple occasions a manager had yelled inappropriately at myself or a coworker rather than calmly voicing their feelings which made me very uncomfortable to work around that manager.
good,"The Kohls company is a wonderful company that has great medical dental and vision plans, and creative hands on training that gets you ready to be self sustaining within 1 shift."
good,"Super busy returns desk. Stressful following the holidays. Kohls accepts returns of absolutely everything thing, no questions asked so the customers are demanding so you should have a thick skin and be able to smile through everything if you are going to do this job. Management will back the customer not you, keep that in mind."
good,They expect you to do a job designed for 3 or more people as 1 person and when you fail to exceed expectations they jump on you.  Most managers spend most of their time eating lunch while the rest of the associates spend their time trying to figure out what is required of them.  I hope this is enough of an explanation for this site.  Some places do not deserve to be in business and Kohl's is one of them.
good,"The atmosphere is friendly and clean. Cashiers and customer service associates get constantly reminded to convince customers to open charge cards with Kohl's and will get called into the office if they do not perform well enough every single month. If you need to call out for any reason, even if an emergency, points will be deducted."
good,"I was very enthusiastic about being hired to work as a cashier for Kohls department store in San Gabriel California. I consider myself a thoughtful and hard worker with my employers interest at the forefront of my mind.  I was a part of the very first working crew at the San Gabriel location.  All of the employees worked hard and got that store location up and running very quickly.   Once the store was set up company managers asked all of the employees sign a giant poster commemorating the launch of that location.  "
good,"There are always interesting events going on every few days to keep people motivated. It's not really helpful, in my opinion, but I still appreciate it."
good,Would have been better place to work if they didn't base your hours on how many credit card applications you could collect in a day from customers. It was fun around the Holidays. Fellow co-workers were nice. Leads were a little to expecting of the cashier's to get credit card applications causing some to lie and create fake credit card application to keep there hours.
good,Never ending cleaning. Did learn a lot about sales and customer service. Management is OK just depends on the person. employees are nice and you end up making good workplace relationships.
good,"good with scheduling and allowing time off if needed. a lot of managers so it does become overwhelming at times. they do offer incentives if you are a sales associate as in a ringer for the registers but otherwise, you don't get anything."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I think the management at the time I worked there was very inconsistent, sloppy and poor. I also think at the time 2 male manager were bias as to working with women and not men. This was truly not my best working experience and probably one of the worst ."
good,"you are a part time worker who gets full time hours so they dont have to give you any benefits, made to work holidays and worked in customer service desk without proper training, poor management, overwork staff, but i learned about counting registers at the end of the night, didnt have to fold clothing as a cashier which was a plus, you have to be tech savy and problem solve yourself because managers and coworkers dont help or know the answer to your questions"
good,Its a good job to have as a high school student/ college student. Easy hours and shifts. Just annoying. Pay wasn't too shabby either. If I can remember its above 9.
good,"Hated that they waited until the last minute to give you your schedule.  Co-worker had previously cautioned me that the ""flexible schedule"" wasn't really that flexible"
good,"Management is not on the same page across the board.  It makes for a frustrating day when you have a lot of customers and not enough time to keep changing the schedule based on the manager of the shift. I like working with customers, but a lot of the employees are very cliquish and their jealousy makes for a lonely work place environment."
good,"I wasn't hired on full-time, but I really enjoyed working here. Great benefits, excellent hours and pay. It was fun to see the holidays through retails eyes."
good,It’s about getting customers deals and selling as many credit credits as you can. The hardest part is rude customers and finding exactly what the customer wants the best way you can. I enjoyed the little friends I made there and miss them.
good,"Coming in meeting new people, making sure my inventory was put back before the end of my shift and my area was cleaned. I loved the ship from store, it aloud me to learn the store by walking around finding the products to ship out."
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for if you are ok with moderacy. Often times any success that I would make throughout my workday would be ruined by associates that worked before or after me. Management continuously failed to enforce accountability and when they did, there was no consequence for performing poorly. Numbers and quotas are supposedly very important to this company, but they always failed to set themselves up for success. Hourly work allowances also hindered any progress in the store."
good,"I do enjoy working at Kohls, but they don’t give enough hours I am a high school student it is my senior year and I also live on my own so that means that I pay bills and I can’t afford to pay bills if I’m only getting 4 to 12 hours a week and I’m only getting paid nine dollars an hour it’s just not Possible to live off of. I need more hours, And that is why I am currently looking for a new job."
good,"They want you to do a half million things at any given time and work where you assigned to. The management is okay, some of the employees are fun to work with others are rude and out for themselves. They expect a lot from employees BUT don't pay enough for an employee to do it all in one shift."
good,"I was taught that, if I didn;t have anything good to say, don't say anything at all. I feel the store I worked at was not typical of how the leadership should run the store."
good,"This job was my first corporate experience after college. I was on a team with 75% contacted designers (website and email). Some of the leadership was lacking in formal, design education, but others were motivational and had their ""chops""."
good,The managers always put pressure on you to open up new accounts.  The pay is lower than other retail businesses.  Some of the managers are really difficult to work with.
good,"Hardest part of the job was getting new hires to show up. "
good,Not a bad place to work seasonally for the holidays. The management and staff were over all friendly and considerate. No complaints worth mentioning for the few months I worked there as a seasonal employee.
good,I love working at kohls I hate that I can’t get anymore then a few hours a week.  I am always busy doing tasks like folding and cashing customers out. Cleaning and putting products where they belong.
good,"The management was horrible sometimes. Based on who you know, rather then what you know. Full-time employees are very stressful and seem unhappy. Part-time employees seem to be happier working at Kohl's."
good,"part time job, great discounts and benefits, breaks  were not long enough, no chance to advance in the company, no vacation day health benefits were great"
good,Not a great management team. Needs some improvement in some areas of the store. Is a good first job but wouldn't recommend staying there forever. That's it
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I liked work at Kohl's but the only problem was that slowly but surely my days and hours were cut shorter and shorter due to the slow business environment.
good,"Very fun and enjoyable job that requires you to be fast paced, and able to move with an urgency. But some of the current supervisors lack an understanding for general labor."
good,I love my job here. I was top Credit Associate last year and at 260 credits on  trend to be the top again this year. The closest associate to me has 100 and this is in 8 months. I also love working with the customers. I enjoy helping them solve the issues that might arise with trying to find the products they are looking for. A happy face is a satisfied customer. I also enjoy the associates that I work with. Some have become really good friends.
good,"It was a ok job but, found out retail jobs are really not for me.  I enjoyed working in the jewlrey department but did not like the hours that I worked."
good,"Kohl's is a wonderful first job.  If you want to get your foot in the door to retail it is a wonderful place to go.  Certain parts of the year can be more busy and fast paced but generally learning is on your own time.  If you are willing to learn and help teach yourself, Kohl's is the place for you.  Co-workers were always fun but management likes to micro manage unfortunately."
good,One consistent man could only do so much without help. The company I worked for that was hired by Kohl’s was not professional at all. The communication was poor and the lack of aid literally caused health issues.
good,Not a company for advancement.  They tend to keep you at part time so benefits are not eligible but with the expectation of a full time employee. Never enough time or support to get the job done.
good,"Work as seasonal associate. No training, just expected to follow current associates and learn jobs assigned on each day. Newer associates are training next round of new associates. Management seems to feel this is fine.  Management quick to criticize seemingly everyone, which makes no sense when you gave new employees no training. "
good,"Working at Kohl's during holidays was stressful and demanding."
good,It was an okay experience but very nice coworkers I do not think I would ever go back to work there because it is not enough hour to make a living out here.
good,"Part of the job was to maintain the look of the store, put away returned and unwanted purchases. Sometimes over inventory and restocking was required."
good,"cleaning out dressing rooms of clothing thrown on floors and left in around carelessly by both customers and persons from prior shift, clothing was to be neatly hung and placed on racks by department and size accordingly then we were to put away in perspective departments where we would straighten out racks as where we saw any disarray, all the while helping customers find whatever they may need and answering questions and being as friendly and helpful as possible. I would also be called to the front to cashier whenever I was needed, and did so happily, as that was the job that I enjoyed the most - dealing face to face with the customers was the best part of my job at Kohl's."
good,"OK place for a young person, but crazy hours and no set schedule, ever!  I worked at 3 different stores because I moved, and had 2 nice store managers that would actually back you up, when customers got nasty or you needed a personal day off.  The crazy part of the job were the different kinds of COUPONS, they give out.  Every manager wanted you to accept them differently (each store has 4 managers) enough after 12 years to drive you nuts."
good,They pay you minimum wage to do your assigned job and everyone else. The hours are not consistent and they cut and raise hours when they feel like it. They will schedule you full time hours without giving full time benefits. The customers can really be a hand full at times and the managers allow them to run the store. They tell us to reinforce certain policies and then turn around and go against the policies in front of the customer. I love the fact that you get paid every week but even after working so hard my pay check wasn't enough to provide for myself. They always pressure you to get customers to sign up for store credit cards and if you don't get a certain amount a week they will cut your hours. Stay away from this place unless you really need a job. I guess its okay for students and elders but even they don't deserve the stress.
good,"The company and corporate culture is friendly, but job security is low and I was let go with no warning whatsoever. Should you be unnecessary or superfluous they will not hesitate to release you of your duties."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's except for not having enough hours on a weekly basis and pay rate was to low. the other employees and manager was super great to work with.
good,"Kohl's is my first job. From the beginning, things have been a little sloppy, but maybe it's just how management is at my particular Kohl's. I got hired for the 2016 Thanksgiving/Christmas Holiday season and barely received any training. I mostly had to figure out things for myself, which isn't really my complaint as much as how sloppy and how poorly managed Kohl's seemed to be."
good,Kohls is a good company to work for  however the company does not always make sure they hire managers that will work sufficiently with the employees and when the employees cry out for help nothing is really done for the employees to make the job more successful and work a place you want to come to and feel good about being there
good,"There were very few days I enjoyed working at Kohls. You were forced to ask every customer if they had or wanted a Kohls charge. And if you didn’t get enough people to sign up for Kohl charge cards, you couldn’t keep your job. No matter how good of a cashier you were or how great your customer service was. No charge cards, no job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I liked working overnight there while there were no customers in the building. Working part time at night made it possible for me to be at home with my kids during the day.
good,I've worked in worse places. The hours and pay are alright if your working part time while in school. Not much personality in this company. Working for them is the cereal equivalent of Bran Flakes.
good,"There were no health benefits, low pay.  I enjoyed the employee discount and the employees.  The schedule would change almost daily so it was hard to plan around work..."
good,The pay is $9 per hr. The only people that they cared about were the checkers and customer service. If you worked in the back stocking it was like you were not part of a team.The cashiers got bonuses for opening credit accounts and the back stockers got nothing.
good,Kohl's is a great job for full time students who want to make some money on the side. If you are available 24/7 chances are you are looking at receiving 10-25 hours a week.
good,"Management was awful; they were frustrated with me that I didn’t know how to work the cash register when I was hired as a bagger for the holiday season and I needed training to do that. They would put me in random spots in the store and tell me what to do they never walked me to the area and showed me exactly what I should be doing. They asked if I wanted to stay past the holiday season and I gave them my hours, apparently they weren’t good enough cause next thing I knew I was taken off the schedule all together and when I called to find out why she said I couldn’t work there cause I wasn’t giving enough hours, which is fine but she never reached out to me to let me know."
good,"Kohl's is a good job to start with, but a lot of things can start to wear you out. The customers are very spoiled there so they expected anything and everything. I had one women literally take off the sweater she was wearing in front of me and hand it to me so she could return it, and we have to take it back. You can't say no. The management does not really care about their employees. They only care about surveys and how many credits the store is getting. They do not stand up for their employees when confronted with difficult customer. They will usually give the customer what they want (even if it is a ridiculous request or something we were told not to do), in order to avoid confrontation. Like stated before, it's a good first job for the experience, and will really help with customer service and communication skills, but as far as a long term job, not a great choice. Also, your raises are tiny and don't follow you when minimum goes up, so when it went up this last time, I was back to making minimum, after three years of working."
good,"They never really place my interest in their heart because I was really good at credit solicitation. They stationed at one place and it got boring. Would recommend as a high school job, but if you're looking to advance don't expect it from here."
good,"Not the best job, but it was a job. They changed the management after I left except for one person. The other employees are not bad. It can be hard to get a break a times and you get stuck doing jobs you were not signed up for."
good,"Managers are obnoxious and degrading. The store is boring, the target audience is 34-89 years old. Customers are horrible. everything is always a mess. the procedures for things are stupid."
good,I was a seasonal employee. I was only a body for Christmas. They terminated my employment by impersonal letter which I did not receive until after they removed my name from the schedule. I have not entered the store since.
good,"Overall, it was a very typical retail position. I worked register and would fold clothes in my downtime. The management I was under at the time only cared about selling our credit cards, and would make that the priority over our shift requests and job advancement. If you sold a lot of credits, you weren't scheduled shifts working on the floor. I wasn't ever trained to work the floor solely because I was one of the top sellers of credit. That didn't stop them from making me work on the floor as if I were actually trained, though. I would get the low hours and pay of a regular cashier, but they expected me to help cover certain sales floor job duties anyways. It was a very toxic and money hungry environment."
good,"I loved my coworkers at Kohl's, but the hours were not consistent. Some weeks I would work 8 hours, and other weeks I would have 20! I had multiple managers and some were rule following, good managers to work with, and others would bend the rules for customers or to get away with something they were not supposed to do. I felt overworked and stressed out most of the time, especially working the jewelry counter on my own with multiple customers in need of assistance. The yearly raise was based off of an employee review, and was usually less than a dollar."
good,"On registers, you were either busy or not.  No consistency.   Was supposed to work 15-17 hours a week. Was scheduled 29 hours a week.  Would have you work until 11 p.m. and then come back in at 7 or 8 am."
good,"a typical day that isn't part of the holiday season, work is very slow and Kohl's is very likely to send you home. Sometimes they have sent me home after 2 hours of working my 4-hour closing shift if little customers were shopping."
good,"They were okay to work for, and tried to work with a busy mom schedule. The pay is just terrible and doesn't cover the cost of living. The other employees were mostly friendly."
good,not a bad place to work .they need better people in charge weak minded always wanted to be your friend couldn't control the plant how things played out.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,As a cashier you clock in and then hop on a register. You then wait for customer wanting to check out then you scan all their items and price check if they need it. You also ask them if they want a kohl charge and tell them the benefits of having it. Then you take tender the payment. You must also make sure your drawer is accurate.
good,Pay was not good at all especially for someone raising a family making it difficult to get ahead. constantly cutting hours and adding more responsibility. Management was poor and a rotating door never knew if you were coming or going from no direction to micro managing.
good,Flexibility is the key to working in the retail environment as the employee encounters many changes within the daily environment.  Changes are not only product related.
good,"This is a great to place to work if you have no outside commitments. "
good,"I was hired for Christmas/part-time help and asked to stay after this period. After reading through store policies and familiarizing myself with different departments (about 1hour) I was sent to work on cash registers-- I didn't receive ANY training on this job; another person on cash registers had to help me. After the store closed all departments were to be straightened--- all employees were there until 2:00-3:00A.M. This was never discussed when interviewing for the job. A couple times I got home in time to get ready to go to my day job. This continued after The Christmas season. "
good,"not a difficult job, but a physical job. Freight team moved quickly and all team members were expected to keep up the pace. High turnover due to interviewer not explaining pace of the workday."
good,"I was hired here as a part time associate shortly before the holidays with the intention of being a permanent employee. Management never expressed that the employees with the least amount of credit applications under their belt would be treated as seasonal and laid off after the holidays. I was let go in a single day without notice by the time January rolled around. "
good,"I mostly ran fitting rooms everyday for hours on end, I learned that kohl's will give anything to any customer is they complained for long enough. The managers at my store didn't really like one another so we were all told different things. The hardest part other then the customers were dealing with the managers and the best part was my coworkers."
good,"The lack of payroll impacted the quality of my job. I would sometimes be left working only 4 hours a week and when I did work, I was expected to do the work of 3 people because we were constantly understaffed when it wasn't the holiday season."
good,"Kohl's Corporate is very large and can make an intern feel like a very small fish surrounded by millions of other fish. As a design intern my group didn't know what to do with me. I had two leads that I saw regularly and my manger I rarely saw. Most of the time I was given these challenges/ projects that where from other departments and then given additional work by my team. Most of the work didn't seem to help out much or went towards garment production. The majority  of the time was in meetings not just for the department but also for Interns, and special speaker series which made it very hard to keep up with the work load at times. And caused conflict with other meetings."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, with one exception, they give short notice on when you'll work for the next week. Co-workers are wonderful, and always willing to help."
good,"Not a bad place to work at all, however, there are hardly any hours to go around after the holidays are over which really makes some associates struggle to pay bills. Definitely should be used as a second job/ extra money and not an all the time job."
good,I enjoyed my position at Kohls as a morning merchandiser. Management was very nice and scheduled you according to your availability. My supervisors were very respectful and upbeat and acknowledged you when you were doing good. I always felt I could talk to them with any problem. I worked xmas season but it slowed down and was getting 5 hours a week so I had to get another job.I highly recomend working a Kohls.
good,Very fast paced and productive work. Long hours 10 hour shifts sometimes 7 days a week. Great people with good attitudes. I was often moved around to other areas to help when needed.
good,didn't care to advance employee in career change. didn't appreciate staff for hard work and efforts. cut hours for fulltime employees. poor pay to 5 or more year worked employees
good,"Clean areas, help customers, worked as a cashier, presentation team and freight team. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Never know what your hrs will be one wk or the next. No matter how many yrs with company there is not seniority. New people get more hrs while mine get cut. Raises are a joke. Longer I'm there less money I've made for the past few yrs. You have to work holidays and almost every weekend. Don't  feel appreciated for the great job and reliable person I have been.
good,"I was on the register and they push you to get credit and if you don't the manager at that time gets a little annoyed with you. And training was okay. It starts on the computer then they put you on the actual register with someone overseeing you so you don't mess up. The hours at first were very little which was fine since I'm in school but ended up getting more than I expected which was hard to balance. If you're someone who loves sales I'd recommend working here otherwise, don't."
good,Managers were forced to work overtime without being compensated and he store manager took undocumented days with no repercussion.  He also made the assistant managers schedule so he could have all holidays off.
good,customers are great but management could do a better job interacting with employees. Not enough work hours and employees not very well compensated for all their hard work.
good,"Not the greatest pay, they don't follow your availability very well. I've learned a lot about customer service and being a cashier. Co-workers are sometime unhelpful"
good,"A typical day for me would be helping customers find product, checking them out at the registers. I would also do is count the registers to see if there was a shortage or overage for the count."
good,"The working environment in the beginning was awsome. Everyone helped one another. But with time, the  relationship of workers and management became tense."
good,"Schedule is never set, a few rude managers who treat you like you're dumb. Always expected to come in on your days off, but never forced to. A fun yet much too stressful environment where a load of associates don't do their job and it gets blamed on others."
good,"Management treats you fairly most of the time. Big on new credit apps. One good thing is they are customer focused. If the customer says it is one price and it is another price, we can change it. No questions asked by mgt. Just let them know."
good,"A typical day at work was stressful. Upper management expected more than what could be done in the time given.  Credit is pushed very hard, stressing the floor supervisors and the floor staff, especially the cashiers. Daily goals were sometimes outrageous and if a large goal day was missed it was very difficult to catch back up.  "
good,Was only getting 8 hours a week but this 7 years ago so things could have changed. I did enjoy working there overal during Christmas time my hours would go up a lot. The environment was friendly and only stressful when it was a busy weekend and lots of clothes and products to stock.
good,"When working the midday shift they many times will only have one person for a whole department and it's difficult to keep everything organized especially when a large influx of people decide to all try on clothes at the same time. A rotating schedule is hard to put up with. It's okay, it's a job and isn't intellectually demanding at all."
good,"I understand that seasonal positions are there and gone within a few months but I didn't receive adequate training, policy coverage, or equipment use."
good,"A typical day at work begins with a touch-base with the management team to discuss goals and responsibilities for the day. After employees are released to perform their duties, the day continues with assisting customers, maintaining the floor of each department, and assisting in the fulfillment of online orders throughout the store."
good,I do not want to write a review.  This was a seasonal job only would not work there again - too disorganized and poor management choices. Return room messy
good,"decent place to work, good friendly people whom everyone gets along, fun and relaxed atmosphere without the cutthroat pressure to deal with various sales goals."
good,"I liked the job because it gave my money to fool around with in high school. I had occasional fun with coworkers and made some friends but most shifts were stressful. The work balance between coworkers was terrible, as some coworkers were willing to help and others were complete slackers, and it would mostly go unnoticed by management."
good,I only worked at Kohls for three months because it was so low staffed I would have to do a whole groups work by myself. The management was very strict about taking breaks but they were friendly nonetheless. Not flexible with my schedule.
good,There is not much opportunity to work your way up in the company and the pay is less then optimal. The job it's self isn't too bad if you don't mind crazy hours and cleaning up after customers.
good,"Although I worked there for a small amount of time, I enjoyed working with everyone I got work with and loved working in the kids department. The store's size was challenging to me because I was not prepared to walk around the store a lot but still managed to get through the day in just flats."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's not terrible. It really depends on which store you work at and who your managers and coworkers are. I normally work 8 hours a night, anywhere from 2-4 days a week. I started as seasonal, but they've kept me as part time for almost a year now, because I work my butt off more than some of be people who have been there for years, and especially when I was first hired I'd come in and work when they asked, even if I wasn't scheduled to. It's demanding. Management is ok unless it's a truck night, then they expect our small team of 6, sometimes less, to empty an entire truck in 4 hours. Because we never meet that time they've stopped giving us a break before we finish the truck, and because of that, after a while we move slower, which leads to us getting yelled at even more and treated like children. When there isn't a truck you do a lot of pulls but you're mainly expected to finish what dayshift doesn't do, like backstocking for them and cleaning up after them. Oh and even though you signed up for freight unload you'll probably have to do price changes and Omni, walking around the store picking and packing online orders. The pay really isn't enough to compensate how much you're expected to do."
good,Working at Kohl's was my first job and even though it was a good job to get money the management was not great and the pay was not that great either as well.
good,"it was good when the hours were available but after holidays the hours are just poor. Management was also a struggle, no organization, poor manners and poor team leader skills"
good,"Nice store and people, but not enough pay for all the work you do. It's a great part time job and I love working here just wish we got paid more. The managers are very nice too."
good,"A typical day at work all depended on who was there working at the time of your shift. This was my first job so any knowledge I have in the work field came from this company. And I would say the hardest part of this job is the ""Yes We Can"" attitude associates must have. Then again it can be the best part, depending on the customer."
good,"Its not that bad but I urge you if you do get a job here look for a better opportunity at another company asap.The management here is cut throat so it will be best for you to make allies with your managers, since the sales staff is mostly young they overall could care less about the companies objectives.Expect your fellow associates to be absent a bunch of times and you picking up for their slack."
good,The first 2 months of employment there was no schedule...It was just a 3 month job but I didn't get scheduled till middle of November. How can you give someone a job without the job?
good,"Fast paced, pressured to sell credit cards to customers, a lot of responsibility for min wage. Good work for College student. Management ok for retail."
good,"Never enough payroll to adequately staff the store. 20-25 hrs unless someone called out or didn't show up. Not giving the reliable long time employees hours and giving new hires more hours. On customer service score card, only highly satisfied matters so if someone says satisfied,  that is actually counted as negative. Management at store level was great but corporate level is clueless"
good,I worked at this store will attending college at MATC for Administration for Medical Secretary. I worked in the customer service dept for this company.
good,"Kohls was a decent job to have for awhile. The job itself was tolerable but the staff was not the greatest. I did not feel welcomed when i arrived at work. Other than the team the job was not tough, busy days helped keep me energized."
good,Kohl's would be a good seasonal job but the pay is not worth it especially if your on the floor doing the fitting rooms. Its non-stop cleaning and Unorganized. Only time you can get extra money if you sign a customer up for a credit card which is hard to do.
good,"Nothing really great about the job, it was easy but had alot of cleaning up to do. Management wasn't the brightest but the people I worked with carried the slack"
good,"The employees are nice.  We all worked together..Management is hard to work with.  They chastise employees unfairly.  The new people receive very little training.  They are talked to when something is done wrong, even though they were not trained, in a harsh manner."
good,"Will only give good amount of hours during holiday season. Good discounts but not much to learn from this job. If not during holiday season, company will only give minimal hours."
good,Customers love to take advantage of the yes we can policies and often get upset when you do not allow them to take 50% off an item because they switched the stickers. Customers also love to complain about not taking expired coupons. Managers only care about how many credit cards you sign up each shift.
good,Working at Kohl's gave me a great experience of cashiering. My job is to make sure I gave great customer service. At this job I learned how to sell credit which was the hardest part of my job. For the most part I enjoyed being the associate that the customer prefer to go to.
good,"Management was great but I hated having to push Kohl's cards on customers and I do not think customers appreciated it either. The environment was fun however, and I liked the work."
good,"I liked the rewards that we used to get for getting customers to apply for the Kohls card, but I believe it was decreased or taken away."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This isn't my ideal job experience or my desired profession, however it was a good experience.  I learned a lot about customer service, being professional when under stressful situations, and finishing strong even near the end of long shifts."
good,Work was challenging and rewarding.  Several leaders were more involved with their own advancement than leading the teams under their direction.  Left the position after it became clear telling the truth about project health was not acceptable and collaboration with teams was not welcome.
good,"Welcoming, kind and caring family at Kohl's. The hardest part was struggling to do a lot of work on my own with no help. We would be told to work on one project then directed to do another by a different manager. The communication is poor. The most enjoyable part was being able to feel the satisfaction of the work that you've accomplished. And the culture was very welcoming. Everyone is willing to help customers as well as other employees."
good,Management does not listen to the concerns of the associates. Management does not back up an associate while arguing with a customer. Management care more about money than their workers
good,It was great being able to not sit at a desk and move around all day putting things away. Some days they expected more than one person could do when it came to re-organizing the store.
good,"Store. is very understaffed.   So the workload was more than one person can do.  The assisted manager.  only gave negative feedback,"
good,It's typical warehouse work and a pretty straight forward job. Audits are conducted on in-bound freight and merchandise is expedited to it's proper warehouse location. The pay is horrible and benefits don't exist for part-time flex associates.
good,During my stay there it was hard to learn what I was supposed to do and not do in the fine jewelry department because every person had their own way to do things so I was always trying to please the new person I was working with. I felt like the management was incompetent and too young to understand how their actions could be taken. I have worked all my life so I know how to be business oriented.
good,This was a part time job for me through college.  I worked there while doing my student teaching.  Its a fast paced work environment that has made many changes since I worked there.
good,"The stress is not worth minimum wage. They only ever had one person at my station and it was incredibly busy all the time. I also was given tasks of a higher pay level, but never given a promotion."
good,A typical day a work is checking out customers. Some of things I have learned is how check customers out hard tag clothes and fold clothes. The culture of the job is steady or busy paced. The hardest part of the job is when we have line of customers and need to check them out fast or a customer is in a rush. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a great customer or friend or family.
good,"I was there within the first couple of years of this EFC opening. There was a pretty laid back culture, and I enjoyed my time there for the most part. I've heard about many changes in management over the years since I've left so I'm not sure what things are like now."
good,"before management changed, it was actually worth working there. its an easy job, keep to your own business & dont get involved in coworker drama, everyone there is pretty nice but the turnover rate is insane. they fire people right and left, so if u stop seeing somene in the break room, they were most likely fired. on the upside, some of the managers are actually pretty nice."
good,The hardest part of the job in my opinion were the overall hours and schedule. The hours were never consistent. On an average an employee would receive anywhere from 6-20 hours per week.
good,"working there is great, its fun and upbeat. the only downfall is that management does not care about their employees and only about making goals instead of encouraging behavior they demand it."
good,"Management tends to be very cold and not approachable and tends to pick favorites, associates are friendly though, and the atmosphere is very upbeat.."
good,Very nice people to work with and for just need something better with benefits and more hours management is very nice they take care of there employee.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kohl's. The managers were friendly to a point but would constantly force the cashiers to sell credit cards or they would lose their job. People were friendly, but it was difficult to enjoy the job fully for always getting pressured by managers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"the amount of hours given aren't very good and is lacking heavily in any ""team-like"" connection between the employees."
good,I liked having steady work but not enough pay for the bad customers that sometimes has to be delt with at the registers. The managers were not always doing what they should be but hiding out doing things that other departments are in charge of.
good,"Work environment was good. I enjoyed helping customers with their shopping selections, work hours were great. I wanted to be hired full time but I was told I couldn't."
good,"Fun job, fast paced when busy. Not very good leadership. The hardest part is dealing with dissatisfied customers. I had good Managers when I worked there but its always changing. Not so good managers now."
good,Fun group of folks to spend time with.  Most crew are helpful. Enjoyed the variety of tasks to accomplish.  Loved having an employee discount.
good,"I had absolutely no problems with the manager. She was professional and considerate. A woman who really knows her job and can do it frontwards and backwards. Corporate left a lot to be desired. Always changing and coming up with new programs, The websites and online programs rarely worked. Over all it was an excellent opportunity and I enjoyed it very much!"
good,My only problem (other than the seasonal position I was working) was I only worked 2 hours a week for 4 hours a day. Barely enough to pay for my gas
good,"A typical day was exhausting, high speed, high intensity, and physically draining. Considering the amount of multitasking, prioritization, coordination, and customer assistance a typical busy day entailed, it was an... unethically low wage with no benefits considering the amount of stress and work that was piled on myself and other employees, but that's to be expected of any entry level retail job at a large store location. Still, I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle people professionally, and I value that experience greatly."
good,A typical day is started in the evening about six. I learned that no matter what policy says customers has the last word. Management doesn't back you up when the customer is wrong. Coworkers are great but most have second jobs to survive. The hardest part of the job is the pay and few hours each week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,"associates are not paid what they should be, lots of work for little pay. I do enjoy the kohls discount, one of the best discounts out there. Benefits weren't the greatest for part time employees, getting a full time position was nearly impossible."
good,"You rarely ever move up in positions unless you've been there for years (10-15). Promotions and hours are based upon credit sign-ups, but if you try to take medical leave, or a vacation, say buy-bye to any hope of a salary increase. I attempted to take a medical leave for a work-comp related issue and had to jump through loops and hoops just to get a claim opened up. I'm going to quit this job after Christmas so I don't leave them in a jam. but has been by far one of the worst jobs I've had."
good,"Could be fun but lack management especially in beauty. We are not taken very seriously. Not enough hours for beauty associate, they are very stingy with hours unless you are a supervisor"
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was extremely challenging and customers wanted merchandise at discount prices. Managing to get through the day without disgruntled customers was a challenge. Co-workers were great to work with because we found time to laugh and share our experiences. Hardest part of the day was on weekends the lines were long. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving the elderly their senior discounts, they always had a big smile on their faces. It gave them a thrill to feel so special! Getting customers to sign up for Kohl's credit was stressed."
good,I loved working here when I first started. The management was great and my co workers are even better. That all changed when they brought in new management everything went downhill. They played favorites and didn't give promotions to who they belonged to. They don't work well with time off.
good,"I feel they wanted to make me work to break my back, but hardly pay me. I have a lot of pride in what I do. But I felt I was being taken advantage of."
good,"The two years I have been at this company my co-workers are great. The pay is not enough, the discounts are great!  Management could be a little bit more creative."
good,Kohls is a good place to work if you want to pick up some extra cash. The wages are below what one would expect from a retail chain this big. You can't support a family working here. Unless you are Upper level management
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,They do not allow you to make steady hours. The store is very unorganized. And the managers show favoritism. There is some good things though. The jobs are fairly easy. If you do your job and don't get into the drama you should be fine.
good,"Not a great company to work for. Shady management, favoritism, severely understaffed on a daily basis, customers get away with everything...I could go on and on."
good,"Management was not good... Members of the team only cared about the numbers and not the employees. Would get hours cut if you couldn't meet standards (aka. credits) but not everyone wants a credit card, cant get one, or already has one.. Can't force. Very happy that I do not work there anymore."
good,"Awesome place to work at, although lacks in proper communication among managers and workers."
good,"I didn't really enjoy working for Kohl's. My work day would consist of having to sell credits to customers and having my supervisor (E3) hound me every 15 minutes about selling credits! I would say that it's a good place to work if you're a high school student or in college, but not really for an adult with children since pay is minimum wage and hours are only part-time. Oh and you only get a 3% raise every year!"
good,The company asks a lot out of it employees. We had to sell their credit cards and attend to customer needs. You had to be standing the whole time. The best part of the job is that they are really flexible on when you work. It is great as a second job.
good,I left for a management position with a company closer to home and better pay and better hours I had hoped to move up in the new company
good,"Kohl's was a very different atmosphere and place to work all together. Your hours are kind of all over the place and you have to really push for more hours if you need them. I think Kohl's is a good place for younger people who are just out of school, or looking for part-time work. I do not believe Kohl's is a place you want to build a career unless you want to eventually move into a management position. I believe Kohl's did give me good experience and it did allow me to learn my strengths and weaknesses. Kohl's allowed me to experience all different areas of working in retail. I started out working the register but I was also able to work the floor as well as customer service and the dock; which gave me plenty of experience to see what I liked the most about retail and disliked the most. There are a lot of younger people who work at Kohl's and this causes for a lot of drama. I enjoyed the experience but this was more of a stepping stone for me and gave me some experience to grow and eventually move forward in my career. This would be a good starting-out job, unless you are going into management."
good,great employes vveryy fun place to work it wass new store so they went over budget so hours were cut but ffor time i was there it was fun
good,"Company was very nice to give me an opportunity to advance my career. Made lots of promises for advancement but upper management routinely proved that they did not remember who I was, so I felt like there was very little room for growth. Expected to constantly do more with less."
good,"Typical day at work-"
good,It was utterly chaos. On a typical day sales associates had no direction or no understanding of the business. You were simply tasked out and put into a section.
good,It was fun until they kept hiring new and younger people and cut the hours of people who had been there longer and had proved we were good and reliable workers....managers did not last very long and the true time employees were not appreciated!
good,The management does not pay enough attention to their employees. But the district is great to work for.I am not a fan of working 8 hour shifts on my feet.
good,"I learned how to do inventory, stock the floors when new merchandise arrived, helped to organize customer service as well as the floor supervisors for different areas."
good,"Very challenging culture. Company is stuck in 1990 when it hit it's peak. Unwilling to change, unwilling to innovate, unwilling to commit to completing the changes necessary to stay competitive"
good,Really nice to work. Atmosphere is nice co workers are pleasant and everyone helps to get out in 30 minutes. GREAT TEAM WORK environment..
good,they were always busy and never had enough people on to help with the rushes of customers. the associates were all friendly and nice but sometimes the managers were too pushy and watching everything you did and picked at everything. they only noticed the bad never the good
good,It was a nice atmosphere. Nice coworkers. Easy job. I learned a lot about inventory and customer service. A good starting job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was not a bad place to work. I worked in a location where it was ran by either young adults or elders. The elders I had no problem with it was the younger ones that had attitudes with their employers. "
good,"Enjoyed working with the public.  Learned alot about retail goals, requirements and set-up.  Good work enviroment, made many friends, co-workers ect."
good,Great products with good prices.  Good place for gaining sales experience.  Training enhanced knowledge of the products and services provided to and for the public.
good,"Was hired on seasonally. Lots of training videos, not a whole lot of on hand training. Customers are all middle aged women (typically), can get very angry. Credit cards are overly emphasized. It's okay for seasonal, but I wouldn't really recommend for long term."
good,"Very customer service oriented. Not enough associates to keep up with demands of company tho. Used to be able to move up thru hard work. Now, corporate brings in interns/MITs who have never worked retail one day in their life. You are stuck training them, with no hope of moving up the chain of command yourself. Hard to manage work/life balance with ever-changing schedule. The area supervisors work the hardest in the store and get the least amount of credit/recognition. Usually love helping the customers, but not enough time to help everyone with the amount of work and cleaning that needs to be done. Corporates expectations are unrealistic of their employees in comparison to what the customers want/need. They need to really listen to their employees more. Have more issues with corporate than with the store and its management team. Good working relationship with them."
good,"The job itself isn't bad, but at the time the store was going through some big changes. They replaced all the old store managers and the new ones over hired for positions. For our job we only needed about 5 to 6 people and they hired 15. I was not on the sheet to work for over a month and then they sent me a card saying they were sad that I quit. I was not too happy about this considering I tried to do as much as I could to keep the job, sometimes even working double shifts and passing on sleep for over 24 hours to make sure I was at work. To be fair, before this happened it was a nice place to work. The people were friendly and I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,"This is another company that only cares about who you know in order to advance in your career.  No matter the work ethic, you can be pigeon hold forever if you want to move up because there is always a friend or family member that knows how to work the system."
good,"A typical work day could be very busy or slow depending on the weather and what kind of sale the store is having. "
good,"Extensive hours, barely any breaks, long periods when you are not scheduled to work. Shifts are taken easily and are sometimes overlapped so people are sent home. Managers are ok but rotate every six months."
good,Put Jewelry in cases. Count down register. Help customers and fellow associates with the Juniors fitting room (putting clothes away that customers have tried on).
good,Work atmosphere is nice and so are the workers. Perks are nice because of employee discounts and employee appreciation for different things.
good,"The warehouse is so big. You meet a lot of people, some you will dislike, most will be cool. Sometimes the work can get boring."
good,A typical day is cleaning the shoe department and normally cover another department also. I learned how to handle multiple things at once without an problem. Managment was good just a severe lack of communication. Co-workers were ok. alot of trash talk about others and complain alot. hardest part of the job was dealing with cranky supervisor. because everything i did it either did not make her happy and my boss happy or vise versa. the part i enjoyed the most was helping people and organizing the department.
good,"It can be hectic day at work or slow depends.  Learned different things, experience almost all departments of the store. Working with customers face to face is always a best experience in any field."
good,"There was a lot demanded for a part-time employee and it was very hard to move up the corporate ladder. Somewhat adequate training was available, but at the end of the data the saying of ""the customer is always right"" was taken too literal."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but the management team couldn't get along with one another at all, no one knew what was going on, there was a new manager every few weeks.  And the communication between managers and associates was unprofessional and the managers had their favorite employees and no one was treated equally."
good,Management did their best to help out employees. Employees working there are useless. Hardest part of the job is to receive hours because they have to have a specific number of employees on payroll always. Expect to receive 20 hours or less per week if you are an associate.
good,"Having worked there for 6 years, I can alert you not to stay for so long. Unless you are part of the supervisor echelon, everyone else is a part timer and have little say on the amount of hours they are guaranteed. It can go from 35 to 3 in a matter of weeks. You are asked to push for credit, regardless of the position you are given. Obtaining credit is correlated to the hours given. Good environment, bad job."
good,"The management is best at the upper level, the mid level management mostly appeared stressed and un cooperative.  The do at times, provide food to employees working and though nice, it is an inducement for productivity.  There is a favoritism atmosphere in that location that was felt deeply as I was a new hire"
good,"fun monthly meetings, food on site. games, sitting all day can be hard. management says they care but rarely shows it. vending machines and ice machines. lots of parking in parking lot. air hockey, ping pong and table soccer"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,alright place to work very nice people but store manager will cut  you down if they don't like you..
good,POS is only parttime and if its busy then you will stand in the same place up to 8 hours with short breaks between.
good,"In the short time I worked at Khol's warehouse, the pay was good the hours to me wasn't. Although as my first job I had, it was pretty good."
good,im not a big retail person but it was defiantly a learning experience
good,"The people I worked with were great for the most part! However the hours were terrible (closing at 11 pm and opening the following morning at 8 am), and getting days off that I actually requested were nearly impossible. All of the hard work for minimum wage was barely worth it. I either worked 30+ hours a week or barely 10 hours a week. On a good week I'd know my upcoming schedule 2 weeks out, however most of the time it was a week if I was lucky. I DO NOT recommend working for this company."
good,"No room to work up in the company, very demanding hours."
good,a lot of work for little pay. co worker were very nice. over worked at x-mas time. cut hours over if the store sales were down.
good,"I love working for Kohl's because everyone wants you to do well. While working with many personalities is difficult, I find it easy to ask co-workers for help."
good,"would be a great place if not so in to seasonal / Temp. labor"
good,Required to work varying shifts including overnights with little time in between shifts.  Pay does not compensate for expected workload and loss of holiday time.  If not available for all shifts hours get cut to as little as 4hrs/week.
good,"Its a good place to work part time, nice people, good managers, not enough hours are allotted to you so you need two jobs"
good,was employee of the month but quit because of low pay and not having full time and benifits.
good,I worked in children's clothing department. It was very fast paced. I also worked on the registers as necessary.
good,Basically went in later in the day and changed signage (pricing) on all racks in the store. It was a new experience. I enjoyed because I had my department to work in and was allowed to do it without any outside intervention. The manager was great as well as the co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the hours-sometimes you didn't get off till after midnight.
good,"Loss Prevention Manager: Loss prevention is responsible for minimizing the financial losses of a retail operation related to theft, vandalism, accident and injury. This position requires the ability to develop ways to detect safety issues and security violations, and to put programs in place to prevent repeat occurrences. Expected to communicate effectively and work cooperatively with store and law enforcement personnel. Loss prevention managers must work with discretion and professionalism and maintain confidentiality at all times. Internal focus includes cash handling theft, inventory control, facilities and equipment damage, security access violations, fraud, and a variety of audits of employee activities. Shoplifting, vandalism, counterfeiting, robbery, burglary, and store safety are the primary areas of external focus. Retail sales or operations experience. Attention to detail, acute observation, and analytical skills are essential. A loss prevention manager should have demonstrated success in a position of authority. Experience conducting legal or ethical investigations. Computer and word processing proficiency."
good,most of the time you're re-stocking and cleaning up after messy customers. Management was hard to find most of the time. Co-workers were decent. The hardest part was unloading truck or overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part was the quite time you got to spend in the stockrooms.
good,Management is Horrible! When you first start there is no real explanation of what they expect us to do until we get in trouble.
good,"Store is a busy, fast moving and plenty to do.  ""Yes we can"" to all"
good,"I learned valuable sale's skill working at kohl's. I learned to open/close a clothing store, how to operate a cash register and to lead a department. My Management was decent, they were a little unorganized, but got the job done accordently. My co-workers were great i got along with the majority and could rely on them to pick up my shifts if i needed them to. The hardest part about working at Kohl's was keeping the sale's floor organized on Black Friday. The Most Enjoyable part was that it was 10 minutes away from my home so the commute was easy everyday, and i could go home for breaks."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Unless you were a Manager your hours were shaky. They sometimes will give you 30+hours or even 3 on some weeks. Unless you are a student looking for general extra income or a HS student I do not recommend a part-time job here.
good,the company cared more about organizations (charitable) than its employees. 
good,"meet new people work with clothes and fashion, get to take advantage of sales and discount."
good,This was just and ok job to me. The management wasn't really great. I didn't feel as though the management cared very much about its employees. I expressed concerns while I was a freshman in college getting scheduled to close when I had to catch a late train home in an area where people were getting attacked and abducted from the train stop. The management did not seem to care about my fears. My co-workers there were ok to work with but there was too much gossip. There were some good things from this job. I learned customer service skills and they gave me my first real job. 
good,"A typical day at work included checking out customers, soliciting Kohl's credit cards and surveys, and cleaning the store around the registers. This job taught me how to be a sales representative. My co-workers were friendly, but there were definite cliques that were hard to enter, if you could.The hardest part of the job is keeping customers happy and explaining certain aspects for the system to them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with people bonding with customers through their purchased."
good,Kohls would be a nice place to work if it wasnt for all the drama between the coworkers.
good,"Just that workers were mostly treated as pawns: Necessary, but dispensable. Pay is ridiculously low and benefits almost unreachable to the 80% of workers who are considered ""part-time."""
good,The store is poorly run and needs a management restructuring.
good,Overall kohl's was a great place to work besides low pay and not many benefits.
good,I worked for Kohl's for 17 years. I started as a Helpdesk Agent and worked my way up to Helpdesk Supervisor with in three years. I enjoyed the management team and was happy to be apart of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the TEAM atmosphere every worked well together.
good,"I enjoy working at kohl's, I run a cash register, fold, clean and anything that I am asked to do."
good,"Another new start-up company, and a great company to work for. I worked for this company some years and enjoyed it every day until I gave my notice to make a career change because I relocated."
good,I love my job. And kohl's has a very good enviroment to work in.
good,You deal with customers alot and your all about making them happy
good,I worked at Kohl's for 7 years and enjoyed it at the beginning. The thing I never liked about my job was constant management changes. Some managers were better than others but retail is like that. Honestly i did enjoy working for them but would not go back to them.
good,"I work at POS. I have learned how to solicit credit, manage money better, and improved my customer service skills. Management isn't the best but they preform well enough for there time there, my coworkers, don't enjoy their jobs, and the ones that do, are exceptional in their work performance. The hardest part of my job would have to be that i transferred to cedar falls from Alaska with promises of keeping my 9.25/hr and they cut it down without notice to 7.45 witch didn't seem fair to me. the most enjoyable part is being able to aid customers and do my duties to my best ability."
good,I obtained knowledge in many areas through working for Kohls Distribution Center.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Most days were average, most of the time is was spent cleaning out dressing rooms, re-stocking the floor, and being a cashier."
good,I had some good supervisors and some bad supervisors.
good,"It is a very easy going, fun job, I did just about everything you could possibly do, from customer service to unloading trucks, co-workers are very friendly and helpful but the managment had their ""favorites"" and weren't very fair"
good,"I worked in shoes. This meant I made sure the department was clean, helped out customers seeking shoes, restocked the floor when needed, and dealt with returns. The job was very straightforward. The hardest part of the job was doing all those duties while you were the only one working in the department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts you received because of your employment."
good,-Typical Day consisted of stacking cargo onto trailers to be shipped to various stores all over the Northeastern US.
good,"It was an excellent experience personally, I learned a lot in a short period, I was in all different departments and I have a met a great people there; the only bad part of this job was the very low pay, so I decided to quit and go back to school."
good,Pretty easy job.
good,The days spent at Kohl's were fast and pleasant. The shifts were short the hours per work almost as short. The time spent was made enjoyable by the people i worked with and the customers i assisted. Unexpectedly my time spent there taught me a bit more patience than most things.
good,A typical day involves doing alot of manual labor. I learned that it is hard to run a store. My co-workers were not relatiable to young age group. I enjoyed leaving..
good,"on truck days be there at 6am to unload truck,then put freight out on the floor in its proper place help customers when needed I learned how to set floors,do recovery and assist customers at the same time .I enjoyed all my co-workers we definatley all became friends.We had a lot of laughter when we did truck unload which made the day fun the hardest part was when you did recovery short handed and had to help customers because it was busy and keep recovery up with the store looking good but when you finished you was proud you kept up.The management that I had when I was there was wonderful to work for but they leave and you have to learn new ways"
good,"From my very first Day at Kohl's to my last week, I noticed that management was very negative towards their employees. Often times management would treat employees like pawns, rather than people. I did not enjoy being scolded for not knowing how to properly finish a task without being shown how to do so prior."
good,It was fun to work there. I had a good time it was busy at times everyone was friendly for the most part good work environment good hours got breaks when you needed them
good,"Employees are very unfriendly. Management doesn't tell you a lot of the rules and expectations, they just yell at you when you do something wrong or don't know something..Management talks gossip about employees with other employees. It's very unprofessional"
good,"The job was nice. Organizing clothes on the racks and tables was very enjoyable to me. The management had some issues, I wasn't told in person that my seasonal position was over. I was waiting to be scheduled."
good,"Just a very ""eh"" job. The people weren't very friendly or welcoming. Every time I had to ask for something to be explained again or to be told was snubbed. They would show you in a way that insinuated that they thought you were dumb."
good,"Worked in customer service handling returns, customer complaints, payments, etc.. Customers are very rude and racist. Everyday felt like walking away while on the job. I liked the employees they were nice and helped eachother out, but I got tired of getting treated with disrespect from customers and for what I was getting paid ...wasn't worth it!"
good,Very physical job. Lots of heavy lifting and working with equipment. pay is suitable as well as benefits and coupons off make it very enjoyable to shop as well as work. At startup we go over practicing safety in every department from blade safety to load stools to make sure everyone works safe and helps others to be safe as well. Lots of computer work as well as rf scanners.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"went in to be a seasonal employee for over night, ended up getting hired for a day time position because of my prior experience, i only did damages at this job scanning out send to the dc and markdowns"
good,It was an okay place to work. Not many hours and the company didn't really care about you. the manager was all numbers and only cared about meeting sales
good,Not a bad place to work at the only down fall is how other co corkers dress for work and not willing to go out of their way to help customers. They are not willing to approach customers to ask if they need any help. The customers has to seek out an employee for assistance.
good,It was a fun place to work. Didnt get enough hours and was promised advancement and never got it even after following up with the managers multiple times
good,"The store is always a mess it's embarrassing, hot and sweaty every shift, can't take pride in any work cuz you can't ever get anything done, the Kiosks in the store are so NOT customer service friendly"
good,I didn't love this job simply because they were not flexible with hours. This job also consisted of you by yourself on the floor. It was long and dreadful days I spent working here.
good,I’ve worked at Kohl’s for almost 2 years at 2 different locations. My current locations store manager was a shock to me compared to my last one. He actually acts like a store manager. Many of the employees have been working here for 10+ years so growth at this store seems to be very minimal compared to my last store where area leads were constantly leaving. I like my job but at times I feel like I am doing way more work that what I am getting paid for.
good,I was an MJM sales associate and the only thing that made the job enjoyable was my co workers. The managers are also well with scheduling you with school. The job was a little stressful at times especially weekends and holidays I felt underpaid for all the work I was doing compared to other positions within the store because the people in other departments weren’t running around all over the place.
good,I worked nights @ Kohl's so it became somewhat difficult to close & clean up on time especially when we had a busy day or night. The most enjoyable time was meeting co-workers and meeting customers and having fun as we were doing our jobs made it easier As well as having many team players on your side!
good,Kohl's IT is transitioning to a Cloud based platform and reorganizing to send more local infrastructure positions offshore.  More and more support positions are being filled by contractors instead of full time employees.
good,"It was a decent job thought the pay for little. There were at least 6 managers and each one was oblivious to the lazy workers that they had. They had favorite workers and made it obvious. Besides this, the work was alright, nothing too hard."
good,They're so understaffed that you're guaranteed the job for a good long while and you're guaranteed hours. Its coinciding downside would be that due to understaffing the hours are sometimes unmanageable and there's too much work for too few people. They'll guilt you into staying later and make you feel bad for missing work for family emergencies or funerals. The store manager is absolutely amazing person. Unfortunately corporate dictates too much in this workplace. They had me working at $9/hr but recently bumped everyone up to $10/hr.
good,Great people good working environment great rewards working at kohl’s I would recommend younger college or high school people or people close to retirement to work there
good,"If you like retail, Kohls is a great place to work. They are fair to their employees, try to encourage their employees to participate in functions to increase moral on the job. You are crossed train in all areas of work making your job more interesting. Pay is poor."
good,it was a wonderfull work experience i just wish there was more diversity and more works for me to work. they were many events planned by kohls and many volunteering opportunities
good,It’s a nice job for those who need a flexible work schedule and those who are in school or working a full time job and are just looking for a second job to earn a bit of extra money. However there’s not much room to grow and raises are non existent if you’re not a supervisor or manager
good,"The job was nice, the management, for the most part, was nice. The pay was very low, and promotions were a facade. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"I mean it the job had its ups and downs but mostly down, the type of culture at kohls seemed like more drama than actual work. Even the managers couldn't help but get themselves into drama."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my work experience however, much was expected of me. Being only part time, it was difficult to manage three departments. Wages could be better for amount of work you are given to do. I loved my coworkers but management could at times be uncooperative."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Way too much drama for a warehouse with all adults. Communication overall is pretty bad. Very very hard to be promoted. Not rewarded or noticed enough for being a hard worker going above and beyond. Way too many people get away with being lazy and doing half the work but getting laid the same. 5 year anniversary no extra vacation time given, they moved it to 7"
good,"This story at first seems like a great place to work, but after a while you will realize some employees are putting more into their work than others. Some managers will favorite others, and some managers never help out with store tasks ."
good,"Though i worked there for a short while, it was a decent enough place. however, the chain of command and leadership were never on the same page and the day to day was often chaotic."
good,Overall I loved working there but the pay sucks and part time works less than 17 hours and managers also have their favorites . But discounts are great sometimes
good,"Worked at Kohl's for about a year.  I liked most of the people. Overall it was not a bad job. I left because the pay is too low and the store manager was a bit difficult, always focusing on negatives rather than your hard work.  I could not get enough hours or be moved to any other departments."
good,This was just a holiday position for me during the holiday seasons I always work Healthcare never worked retail since I was a teenager so when I was told that start at $9 an hour that was a huge decline in pay and I was kind of shocked but I went ahead and did it for the holidays it was different back hurt being on my feet all day during the holidays very very busy after the holidays I got laid off said I would not do it again not for me but it's for some
good,"Relaxed place to work they send you home if pay roll is low but always want to keep you late if they need it, Managers are good they help you if you need it."
good,"This is a great place to work for a little bit. There really is no room for growth or opportunity. As a designer you become glued to your desk constantly making updates/changes to styles over and over again. Management claims to be focusing on growth and development, however it becomes low on the priority list. I know many people here who are deserving of a higher title but are just stuck."
good,"Management depends on location, as everywhere.  This is a retail job, so many menial tasks and busy work are to be expected.  Management expects too much of employees if you are a 'good' worker, and will come to rely on you without proper compensation."
good,"A decent enough place for a starting job. Pay is low with very small incremental pay raises over time. Hours are VERY flexible though. Management really depends on the manager, some are very productive and useful to have around while others seem completley oblivious to everything."
good,"Not really interested in coming back to Kohls.  Low pay, high stress, great amount of turn around, doesn't feel like they have your back and training is poor."
good,"Great people to work with. If i didn't have my team behind me everyday, the work would have felt like work. Establishing healthy relationships with co-workers made the job easy."
good,This is a great part time job with employee discounts. My only complaint was that I wish I was paid more. It was a fun environment with a few stressful times. I would recommend this job to someone who would just like some extra money.
good,"Overall, Khol's isn't a bad place to work, however the hours aren't always the best and minimum wage lead me to finding better opportunities. The work environment was busy, but I enjoyed my coworkers and it was a great seasonal job for extra cash!"
good,The discounts were the best part of working at Kohl's. I received many and saved a lot of money on clothes and merchandise. I was able to share my discounts with friends as well.
good,It's a great place to start out. A lot of nice people and management was alright. Tons of thing's to learn and a very fast paced environment. They make you feel like a family.
good,"I worked here for seasonal help.  The BIGGEST thing I feel was RIDICULOUS is you were hardly asked if you had your break.  To me this is managements responsibility to make sure their staff is taken care of.  Most of the time, I had to ask for a break in order to get one.  I was never ""trained"" thoroughly in the customer service desk and was placed there several times not knowing how to do things.  This causes frustration between employees and with customers.  Overall, they did try and work with the hours I needed and they give you an employee discount so those things are a plus."
good,"Friendly co workers. Terrible management. Took many Chiefs and not enough workers. Okay pay. Fast Paced. Terrible point system. No medical leave. Very noisy, but its a warehouse so that's to be expected."
good,i was at kohl's for a seasonal position.  I liked doing my job.  I would take merchandise off the truck and place on the floor. I learned that this wasn't a job for me
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It wasn’t the best place for me to work, maybe for others but I am speaking for myself. I would recommend somebody to work here just because it is a job. I worked here to help me out a little bit with school."
good,"Company was a good way to get my foot in the door. No room for advancement. Management was poor at the time of my employment. Retail politics is definitely a thing, proven true by this company."
good,"I never got the hours that I needed to Pay the bills, and I didn't receive proper training. The Managers were very rude and I never felt like a valued associate while working there."
good,"This place is great if you need to get back into the workforce, they seem very open to hiring people who need that introduction, like me. Although my employment was temporary, they made me feel like a regular part of the team. The coworkers are friendly and helpful. The employee atmosphere is genuinely uplifting, and it makes for a nice place to work."
good,It was okay to work there. Not a place I wanted to stay with but I also didn't want a career in Retail. Worked around my school and FT job requirements.
good,"a typical day at work starts off with a short 2-5 minute meet up with the manager so they can tell us the credit goal, where we are suppose to be on the floor. Then you go to customer service to retrieve all go backs for the department you're in. Then you go to your department and run the go backs, while recovering and helping any customers in need of assistance. Then you run some pulls to restock the floor. All the while the managers are constantly announcing that they want to hear more dings indicating they want more IC's, credit applications. All shift long you hear something along those lines every ten or so minutes."
good,"Little if no training "
good,You basically work from October thru December with out any time off basically 1 day a week and you work 12 hours the other six days.   You are compensated 5 days for that time period.
good,It can be slow one minute and busy the next one. Everyone get along with each others. Not enough employee to cover all the shifts that are open. You can get hours if you show yourself as a person who can come to work on time.
good,Management is inconsistent! Two different store managers on 1 year. One manager that is very shady and does care about the employees AT ALL. New rules that aren't communicated with everyone.
good,Work was fine. We unloaded and processed freight to be shipped to stores all over the area. I didn't mind the job to much. some pf the people were difficult to get a long with. Got downsized.
good,just your normal retail job. hard to advance up to management but not other typical floor and cashier positions. they hours and pay are less than a lot of other retail places. i really liked the people i worked with.
good,Kohl's was very stressful because it is not team based. Management made it difficult for me to finish my tasks because they wanted me to do more without any help.
good,"I worked for Kohl's for almost a year. The work environment was very friendly and uplifting. They really work with their employee's on work times however the down side to that is if the store is not doing well they will cut hours by a lot. I remember my schedule constantly going from 35 hours to 10 hours and I as an adult who pays bills could not rely on them for a consistent schedule. I also felt like their was a lot of favoritism and they would choose people with little to no customer services ability to become managers. It was sometimes difficult to apologize to customers for how my manager was treating said customer. Also did not have a strong leader to go to if I needed to report or ask questions to. Sometimes they did seem a little more on the racist side when we would have African American customers, of course I did happen to grow up in a more diverse town than Independence."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's would be to direct the few associates on sale floor. Salesfloor was consistently lean, not enough associated to complete daily workload. The culture Kohl's tries to cultivate was a positive team environment. Hourly associates did not buy into the process they felt overwhelmed, overworked, and underpaid. The surrounding companies starting pay was$2 an hour more. We were not receiving qualified applicants for the expected level of customer service, and heavy workload.  Yes they are staying relevant with technology. They need to stay relevant , and be able to compete with the local markets. Which they are not. That in turn makes managers over worked, stressful. They are having to do what the hourly associated should be doing. They are working with associates that are not open minded to change or learning."
good,Upper management think they know it all and put so much stress on all employees. Lack of respect for everyone and sometimes even racism will. After I left I filed a complaint and no one even cared
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Overall you can grind your way up to the top. But then again working and catching up on projects can always be annoying. Like any other job it can be painful and painless at times.
good,"Staff aren’t friendly. The hours are minimal to none. While working on the floor, there was a lack of teamwork, especially if you were new/seasonal. It was fun at times."
good,I had been working there for over a year and was in the same spot I was when I got there. I Hadn’t moved up anymore in my job just continued to learn and enchance my skills
good,"Working at Kohl's was a fun, learning experience. Helped me grow as a sales associate. However, the management was very cliquey and they had their favorites. Some associates relied on other people to complete their work."
good,"Kohl's was a fun job to have during my college years. It helped to keep me busy, learn time management and gave me a little extra cash for gas a food. The pay was terrible, they often asked me to skip lunches, and worked you way harder than minimum wage employers should. The hours were inconsistent, one week I had 8 hours and the next I had 30. They were sometimes understanding if you had to miss a shift, but mostly made you feel bad for it. I think this is the same at any retail job."
good,"The management was very dedicated  and easy to work with . It was a pleasant place to work, and a very clean environment. It was sometime a very fast paced , but still enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at khols would consist of unloading trucks, checking in merchandise and making sure everything was in its correct place. The workplace culture was pretty quick paced.The only thing i didn't like about the job was that it was a temp job. other than that it was a pretty okay place to work."
good,"Management promises promotions and never delivers. Upper management has no compassion for their employees. Little training, and heavy workload. Have to work 6 days to get in 25 hrs."
good,"When I first started working it was fun we really only had to worry about customer care and keeping the areas clean. Now it has turned into numbers and getting them to sign on to a credit card instead of helping the customers. I did learn how to interact with people but they push that credit card so much it hurts us customer service wise, because the customers usually don't want to sign on to another card and hate being asked, plus if you don't enough cards they can fire you."
good,There are a few very passive aggressive managers. Hours are very random never a set schedule. Suddenly may get switched to a different department with no training. Breaks are short.
good,"It's a good place to start when looking for a job, especially for teens. It will teach them patience or at least bring the lack thereof to their attention. It really isn't a place to work if you're looking to get paid what you think what you deserve, and advancement is difficult without some serious brown nosing."
good,I left to get a higher paying job and it was only a seasonal job for me. It was alright while I was there but was upset when my hours got cut due to funds of the company and they had to cut hours. Still frustrating.
good,General sales associates are easy to get along with. Managers however take interest to those who are good at helping customers open up a new credit card with the store. Managers like to stress upon doing your job as well as adding multiple other jobs that are impossible to finish.
good,Kohl’s is a great company if you are looking for a job to start out on. My first time working for Kohl’s I got hired on for seasonal and got to stay a few months after the new year before I left because I needed full time hours. I came back for seasonal again and was released at the end of December. The pay is lacking compared to the neighboring retail stores next door which makes it hard to live off working at Kohl’s alone. The hours you get per week are very inconsistent. But it is good if your looking for some extra cash.
good,Currently looking for a job want out of Kohl's for many various reasons... not happy with my current situation with my employer  looking to get out & further my career & future
good,"Kohl's has become such a large company that a lot of employees seem to slip through the cracks. Their main focus is selling their charge card, with little to no training on sales skills. They get upset when you don't meet sales goals and cut your hours but don't offer you any chance to improve or learn. Overall I felt very lonely working at Kohl's."
good,It use to be so much fun working here then they started making so many changes.Some changes are not always good. I felt it should also be about keeping the employees happy.
good,"Most days were very busy with more than enough work usually to the point of being stressful. My hours were always fluctuating and they did not keep me at a minimum of 20 hours per week for very long like I requested and had agreed to work for them if getting said minimum. I felt like there were favorites among my coworkers. I was only given the opportunity to work the truck a few times and loved it, but when I requested to keep working the truck and asked if I could do more fulfillment than what I was doing they stopped scheduling me for anything other than the sales floor. I asked for more hours doing absolutely anything to make up for the supposed lack of hours in my department they wouldn't give them to me and thus I wasn't getting the income I needed to pay the bills. While I did enjoy some parts of working there and loved the discounts, I would not go back there unless they got a better management team."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The workflow would dramatically increase as certain holidays arose. I did learn best about time management and priority upon deadlines working there. Sometimes the stress level can be a bit hectic, but with the right team members, things were able to be accomplished within time frames."
good,"Like most retail jobs, be prepared to do 2 to 3 different jobs but only get paid for only 1. Though the pay was low, I developed a strong work ethic and great communication skills. Its a nice 1st job/ post retirement job/ seasonal part -time job. You just have to know when its time to move on, and not be complacent."
good,"I loved working at Kohl's for the first few months, but I noticed I was doing most of the work while other employees were on their phone in the fitting room or chatting with each other. I felt like there was too much expected of us for the compensation we received."
good,working at kohls is okay sometimes the managers don't listen to what we have to say . the managers can be very demanding . the customers can be rude or difficult
good,"Working at Kohl's is just like working at any other retail job. You get a 15% employee discount on most merchandise, most people working there are either in school or its their second job."
good,"I was a cashier and it was an easy job, however I feel as though my compensation was way too low. I did many things outside of being a cashier including helping and training other associates when there was often never a manager on the floor. I also felt as if the managers treated us like children and like we needed to be micromanaged every second that they were on the floor. It is very stressful to work in an environment like that."
good,This is a good job for high school students of young adults as a temporary job. Must have dog customer service skills as well as be able to stand on your feet all day.
good,good company but no hours for part time flex. must be able to stand for long periods of time and work hard.  good pay and good people to work with. not a mental job more physical
good,"Typical day at kohls is keeping up with store operations and making sure your department was cleanly and assisting clients. I learned how to be fully responsible for an entire dept. by maintaining every aspect of it including freight,pricing,graphics,products, knowledge and cleanliness. The management in my opinion needed a lot of work, most managers (6 total) were not able to assist me when i needed help in my department because non had any knowledge of how my department is ran, it was very difficult for me to adjust when i was new because only one or two managers had knowledge of my department.  The hardest part would be doing updates and moving fixtures completely around, but it is also most enjoyable when you know what you are doing and how the product needs to be displayed. the most enjoyable part would be helping make clients days with assisting them find products."
good,"The store I worked at was decently managed by the hire ups, but it seems like they hire anyone, you work with a lot of lazy people so if you are hard working you are left doing most of the load of the work often discouraging."
good,"Kohl's is a decent place to work and provides good opportunities if you end up on the right team, however, it is possible to get stuck.  Raises aren't good and only managers are eligible for bonuses.  Management expectations and culture are inconsistent across the company; particularly when it comes to what counts as PTO and ability to regularly work remotely."
good,I don’t know about other locations but the one I was employed at would literally give me 8 hours a week. I would constantly ask for more and they wouldn’t budge. It could’ve  been good money if they gave me more hours.
good,"I am responsible for greeting customers with a smile when entering the store.  With no supervision, I help customers check out merchandise offering sales pitch for opening a Kohl’s charge and Yes2You reward cards.  I assist customers with making payments on their charge cards and saving money."
good,"While the discounts with Koh's were phenomenal, the hours that I was able to work were anywhere from 20-25 per week. I consistently asked to be trained in other areas to become well rounded in the store, but was never trained as requested. The business was very fast paced, I learned how to merchandise (by teaching myself), management always had its hands tied, the culture was okay, the hardest part was constantly being torn away from what you were doing, and the most enjoyable part was seeing new merchandise."
good,"There were ways to move up in management but the managers would not work with my schedule with my other job. Had to be off by 3:30 on weekends. NEVER HAPPENED! I work as a manger at a Sports Bar so busy nights I had to be there. I told the Manager over and over at Kohl's I had to be off by 3:30-4:00 on Thursday through Saturday. And to please schedule me for mornings/midday so i could still work my other job at night to make ends meet. Most of the time, it worked out but it cost me my job at the Sports Bar because Kohl's wouldn't work with my schedule. I was always saying to the manager, I can work 2 nights a week at Kohls but all other shift I need to be off by 4 to be able to work the second job. I now don't shop at Kohl's and will not work there again."
good,Was not a good job. Didn’t like the management. Other co workers were great. Very annoying with the credit. Overall attendance policy was horrible as well.
good,"Unloading a truck working as much as five hours without a break.  Merchandising product, back stocking merchandise that will not fit on the floor.  Learned to use a hand held computer.  I would rather not go into the management and workplace culture."
good,"unqualified managers who only promote butt kissers. one manager I had used to talk baby to us, it was really weird. they constantly fired the best workers."
good,Working at Kohl's warehouse should only be temporary for someone unless you are part of the management team and/or office staff. There isn't a whole lot of room for advancements.
good,A typical day at work involved given a task to complete by the end of your shift. Management was not organized. Hardest part of the job was to stay motivated with the lack of motivation from everyone else working there.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The co-workers was nice to meet just the hours they had us on when i used to work there was low to the point I was only working 3 to 2 hours a week wasnt good
good,"Flexible with scheduling is nice, especially if you're also a student. I'd say it's a good place for a first job or to earn money on the side while you focus on something else like schooling. My advice to anyone who decides to work here is to keep your head down and never do more than what is expected. I can hold down multiple departments, registers, and other services. Some days I would be expected to do all of that which can really spread me thin. Meanwhile, there's people who have been here far longer than me but ""less skilled"" with no where near as many responsibilities. All with a pay difference of pennies. If someone calls out, which is frequent since its mostly young people working here, why get someone else to come in when we can have a few people run the whole store at no additional cost to the store? Doesn't matter if its the weekend of a holiday."
good,"You are required to sell their credit card and they don't care how its done as long as you do it. This is not a fun task and makes the job less enjoyable. At first it seems great until you continuously get hounded on for not selling. I was a cashier, but anyone in the building is require to know hoe to use the cash register because if we get backed up, you have to push the button for help and someone must come to get lines down. Sometimes no one is on the floor to help customers because everyone is on register."
good,Overall Kohl's is a pretty good place to work.  Management tries to work with your availability but at the end of the day is a retail job that is demanding on weekends and holidays.
good,Kohls is a stress place. The customers are horrid and every day was a messy day. You can clean one thing and the next thing you know its a mess again. Great place to learn to have a high sense of urgency though.
good,My immediate team members were great but upper management was awful. Extremely toxic and negative environment where everyone is trying to get ahead at the expense of others.
good,"A good place to work if you're student because of the relaxed scheduling, ability to cross train and work in other departments. I enjoyed strengthening my problem solving skills by working in Customer Service. The raises however are pretty nonexistent, employees used to be able to earn vacation pay, but that was also taken away."
good,"While Kohl's has provided valuable educational experience in E Commerce, both good and bad, it seem still to be a rather fledgling organization. While most aspects of working there are satisfactory, they do have a couple of areas that need to be improved.  One is the way supervisors are treated.  The other is applying fairness to everything, even when not appropriate.  If those things are not important to you, or if their approach matches yours, you will do very well at Kohl's."
good,The overall work was easy but stressful. You could work before the store opened and work overnight unloading merchandise the same week. Interactive with customers was nice.
good,"Go to your designated area. Would maintain the departments,restock and replenish the products.Also answered phone calls,did cashiering."
good,Kohl's training leaves something to be desired.  You are placed on a training register for less than 1 hour and more than half of the scenarios do not work. Then you are put onto a register to deal with customers directly and expected to know what to do. Kohl's is more concerned with you soliciting credit application than they are with customer service.  You will be required to obtain a minimum number of cr apps for each and every shift.  Your scheduled work hours will reflect this... not enough applications?... less hours.
good,"Fast paced and stressful workplace, on your feet the whole shift. Not good for people with back problems or can't stand long. Good thing is they are flexible with what hours you can work."
good,"This company was fun to work for, but when they started putting unqualified managers into place it was difficult to do your job.  I know that somethings have changed at kohls and they may have even got a grip on  The nepotism that was going on too many friends and family members working in the same stores.  Customer service was non existent when I worked at Kohls. Kohls had an awesome community program in place, it was called Kohl’s for kids.  I admired this program   It was a very good out reach in the surrounding communities."
good,"Pretty routine and mundane. As a cahier you clock in and ring up customers, and expected to push credit like a cult. If you get a credit, it's .50 to your paycheck, and sometime $1 at the right time. There's no room for advancement, plenty of drama (it's predominantly a female staff), a lot of the associates that were seasonal (and even those recently hired) weren't trained correctly. Management has favorites and don't really do their job. The hardest of the job was that we were constantly understaffed, and there was nepotism in the store i worked at. Some of the people were nice, and some managers were nice as well. Pretty basic."
good,"For the amount of work i do, all the stress and always having to stay late, i do not get paid nearly enough. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with, theres a lot of good people"
good,"This position was a seasonal during the Christmas holidays. Being new to retail, I was in for a shock. First the pay is really low and they work you to death for the amount of money per hour. The culture was pretty diverse. At times, management could not be located if you had a question regarding clothing You could walk and look for someone and still be unable to locate. To them, this is considered wandering and wasting time. It felt like being a minion for more experienced personnel. More respect is what I say!!"
good,"Great job for younger person that is tired of working in fast food. Or college job, or temporary seasonal. Not a job for an experienced person that is looking for a normal life."
good,"Working at Kohl's had its ups and downs. Typically, as a Cashier you're mostly at the register and interacting with the customers. It's very competitive regarding your how many credits you each work day. Normally, if you had more credit applications, you get more hours. Definitely, not a position to grow, there's lack of advancement. I would recommend to part-time workers who are looking for a temporary job and not a career. Job culture was decent, but not the best. Management not as professional and did not give clear directions. Customers are definitely more important than workers. Management will not back you up. The Kohl's motto is customers are always right. So, you are constantly battling with customers and management. Black Friday and Christmas are good times to work."
good,"Fast workplace, never made and friends. Didn’t feel welcomed. The management was very upbeat and was there when you had a question they helped you but the other employees didn’t show any care."
good,"This position was interesting because I got to do alot of different positions through out the company. I ran the CS department, helped with displays and changing sales signs, stock inventory, checked in inventory, and worked in the juior, misses, kids, and shoe department cleaning dressing rooms and organizing racks."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a big department store. Often, we'd be assigned a whole department, along with one or two fitting rooms, to ourselves to clean and maintain before the end of the shift. This amount of maintenance required me to work with a sense of urgency to maintain my specified area while also answering any questions that any customers had."
good,Slow days management team was good black Friday was busy around the holiday hours picked up. Unloading truck was the best part of the job relaxed environment
good,the manager was always been rude and was so demanding more than my capabilities. I was always under pressure of work and so do other employees as well.
good,i worked at kohls 10 years ago. i can't remember much about it. Too many mangers hands were in the same pot without communication between them. metric goals were high
good,Managers work too many hours.  Need more payroll dollars to help achieve workload.  Depending of the District Director and the demand they put on the managers of the stores.
good,"For my first job I was with the company for a few months short of 5 years. In the beginning I was working full time, was being recognized and in an immediate leadership role (unofficially of course). Its a simple retail job, you come in do your job and help customers. After a year I noticed my hours were cut but others were not. I was getting scheduled the shifts NOBODY wanted which were the usual Friday nights and Saturday mornings. I was a 18 year old so this upset me that I was being punished, thats how I felt. I never moved up even though I asked multiple times. I also got one lousy 25 cent raise and like I said, I worked there for almost 5 years. The company has favorites and you can tell who they care about and who they dont."
good,"Great company to work for, but the management at the store level do not communicate well with associates. There is very little room for growth within the company and not a lot of resources are provided to anyone looking to advance."
good,"typical day ,analyzing business, ensure floor is set for days work , coach and train leaders , ensure all merchandise is processed for floor. communicate with dm regarding needs of business , ie merchandise"
good,It was a nice place to work the pay wasn't high enough and I didn't receive enough hours. The workplace culture was very good. The managers were also very nice.
good,The management is very opinionated and always involved in drama. Makes work life very hard and sometimes unbearable. would not recommend to anyone....
good,"Managers don't really talk to each other and can be very unprofessional at times. Hours are never consistent, nothing is guaranteed. As a cashier if you can't sell credit, your hours are cut. If you're out on the floor we're usually short staffed. Little to no-room for advancement in the company. "
good,"I'll be honest, Kohl's is a bad retail job that no one should stick in for very long. That being said, running the cash office, I still got paid minimum wage for 39 hours a week, and was the only customer service associate. Kohl's policies are awful, which makes customers unhappy. When I'm unable to help a customer because my hands are tied (by threatening my job), we lose customers, I get called names, all in all not a great place to work."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work compared to alot of other jobs. some managers were great others not so much but all in all i do enjoy working there. I just wasn't okay with the low amount of hours i received some weeks id get almost 30 and others id only get 5. Retail sucks in that aspect because you never know how the sales will do and that affects hours big time.
good,its an honest job. If you like to talk to new people then this is your job. Average hours okay co-workers. great for college students with flexible hours
good,"It's an okay place if you're between jobs. You have a flexible work schedule and managers that are out on the floor, not hiding in the office. You got to do different things every day."
good,"Flexible hours,nice managers and great co-workers they offer really good discounts especially during the holiday season.The only downside is the pay, mostly everyone makes minimum wage unless you are a higher up manager."
good,"Every day felt like disaster recovery. "
good,I personally started working at Kohls as part of their seasonal team and stayed on after to continued working through the remaining high school years I had left.
good,"Over the last nine years I have seen a lot of customers come through these doors.  Some of them regulars some not and for the most part they were polite. As a cashier I had to learn how to deal with the rude/angry customers and not let the issue affect me. For me the hardest part about is when your register is low on cash and you call the manager over and over before they answer your call and the customer is waiting,or when the customer brings you an expired coupon and you told them they could not use it and then the customer ask you to call the manager and they turn around and tell the customer yes and now you are standing there feeling dumb. I did enjoy working with my coworkers new and old. We were family.We helped one another through our good days and bad."
good,The managemnt was always poor. The people were fun to work with. And the tasks were easy to complete. The store was a mess and employees were never given a chance to clean up so that's where management failed. They hired all these people to come work. They hired way too many people and so my hours would diminish. I went from working nearly 40 hours a week to working only 4.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Managers simply don’t take in to part that employees have a life outside of this job and that external issues can happen. A kid can get sick, a car accident, a cold. Literally never got the hours I asked for. Was terrible"
good,It's a great job right out of high school or college. It can be stressful at time's especially around the holidays. The people are great and always helpful.
good,My schedule was so crazy all the time from working 6am-2:30pm to 2pm-10:30pm to 10pm-6am.  It was terrible for my health and for work/life balance.  Also working holidays and weekends were hard.
good,"As a worker in the back, it was quite boring doing the same thing over and over again. No one to talk to and I'm better with people. I asked to learn Cashier, but nothing came of it. I rather work in fast food and deal with people, then working in the back and being alone with little human interaction."
good,It was alright until it started coming in between my school work. Idk what else to say. People were alright. Customers were sometimes difficult. Busy.
good,"Working at kohls was very fast paced, good job for a student or a young person. hours vary week to week. I would recommend it only as a second, part time job."
good,"Over the past several years, in store expectations have remained the same while payroll has been severely cut. As a result, stores are attempting to run with a skeleton crew. Full time positions are rapidly disappearing and unambitious pay makes hiring for stores very difficult."
good,Often/day had to stay after my time to leave to get a project done or wait for a late person to show up. When I had to stay later I was not paid for it.
good,"It was ok at Kohl's. The people I work with we're great people. The environment sometimes could be a little slower than normal. The holidays can be really fast and productive. You have to be on your toes . It's a good way to meet different people,if you're a people person."
good,"I started out as seasonal and was lucky enough to be asked to stay full-time, within 6 months i was promoted to Area Supervisor. I was in charge of the truck process, loved my crew."
good,After clocking in to work you are to go to grab a walkie-talkie and go to your department. If you have any questions or need help as over the walkie. Everyone is responsible for keeping their area clean and helping out when asked.
good,"If you're an average student trying to work at khols it kinda becomes a big part of your life. Management likes to leave the stores progress on to the workers hands, instead of taking charge."
good,My supervisor and I are close and we have good communication at work in knowing what to do in order to get the job down and make sure we provide the best customer service.
good,Had to work every weekend and when I asked for Sunday’s off they refused and kept scheduling me and your always on your feet and have to be comfortable asking about credit.
good,I've worked at Kohls for more than 10 years and the time that I enjoyed working there most was when I started over 10 years ago. There was a different store manager and different department managers.  I have seen 2 store managers during my employement there and it is very different. I don't feel that the management staff really cares for the associates. They are partial to certain associates. There is no regard to how you are talked to . There is also a lot of turn over.
good,"When I was working here I was also in college. I eventually left from my part time hours because they kept increasing my weekly hours, despite me specifically requesting to only work 20 hours per week because of my schooling. I could handle it for a while, until I was threatened with losing my job because I was unable to work the shifts they were scheduling me during my school hours. I got to change it around for a bit, but I eventually left because they kept trying to make me sacrifice college to work retail."
good,The company has issues with how it does things.  But at store level you meet awesome people who do try to help each other out.  But lack of hours and hands make it very hard.  Always so much more work to do then hours in the work day.  you do get great discounts and can use their coupons too.  So for the holidays it great.
good,"It's retail so hours are always different, very busy, fast paced. If you like working with the public and staying busy then it's a good place to be! The people there are good!"
good,This job has you on your feet your entire shift (except for your break time) and bending over and back up over and over again to fold and put clothes in their proper areas. You really have to know your way around the store and the departments because you will be asked about random items through out your shifts.
good,"Hours are as needed. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Honestly this job wasnt that bad at all they just didn't pay well. While working this job I had to pick up another part time job just to make it through each pay period.
good,I do not feel comfortable talking about my current workplace views on the internet. All I am willing to say is that I have mixed emotions about the company I currently work for.
good,"Not a very technologically advanced infrastructure. While Kohls is a large company, their supply chain is very small. Very little room for advancement and with that certain roles cap out at salary level level growth and development stagnant."
good,"Branch manager was awesome."
good,This particular store had very bad management and as a result schedules were often not ideal and the people in charge would not be very helpful or understanding.
good,The management here was not great but a lot of them have moved on. The hours were not great and the benefits were minimal and only if you worked full time. It was very hard to get full time hours.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was very fast paced, I was always busy with one thing or another. I learned about the responsibilities that come with a retail position such as assisting customers and keeping my department clean. Management was very helpful and encouraging. Everyone was very helpful and friendly in the workplace. The hardest part of the job was working on Black Friday, it was extremely busy. The best part of the job was being able to help customers find exactly what they were looking for."
good,I loved being at work and helping customers. The managers were cool and were easy to talk to. We were almost equivalent to a work family before the wave of new store managers.
good,"somewhat disorganized.....rely on same individuals to do everything while others slack. Managers over zealous at times...need better scheduling and staff coverage...employees constantly calling out, not enough coverage for a vast store"
good,"The hours were sparse, however this was helpful as I was going to school.  The managers were nice and understanding.  The job wasn't that hard but I found things to keep me busy in the down time (folding clothes, cleaning station etc)."
good,"slow paced for the most part, management wasn't very helpful at my store, but its different for each store. good place to gain better communication skills"
good,"Physically demanding at times and not much responsibility which in turn lead to a small pay scale. However, I can't say I hated working there as I just needed to provide more for my family."
good,The store is extremely unorganized and nobody really knows what they are doing. Some employees do a lot and others do little to none. Sometimes you will be told to do one thing by one person and another right after before you complete the first task.
good,"It wasnt a bad place for a first job. Many of the other co workers were nice and friendly, but some were uptight and slightly rude if you were younger. The customers can get rude and impatient"
good,Not a a bad place to work except for the fact you are not guaranteed hours except for in the winter time when people are shopping for Christmas. They are really big on getting credit.
good,This company hires non stop so it is really only a part time job except around the holidays. The people are great to work with but if you need more than 20 hours a week this isn't the job for you.
good,"Kohls's is an okay place to work, it's your typical retail job. If you work in a department with fitting rooms, the majority of your shift will be cleaning up after people, which isn't horrible, however customers can take in as many clothes as they like which creates very large messes usually. You will also have to help out on the registers a lot and if your there for an extended period of time the fitting rooms will get very backed up and can be overwhelming. You do learn a lot there, however it is very difficult to move up. The best part of the job is helping customers and interacting with fellow employees, who for the most part are very great people."
good,"Kohls is great when it comes to making friends in the workplace. The coworkers I've come to know are wonderful. However, the pay... not so much. I was expected to know everything. I had SO much put on me even though I was getting paid minimum wage (even after a year of working there.) I would basically be the one training people instead of the managers because frankly, they didn't care enough. I felt replaceable. The best thing was the coworkers. Great people, not so great upper management."
good,"A typical day at work can be busy or slow, can be very boring, i prefer an always busy job. I have learned how to give the best customer service. Management is very well, they overall care for their staff. The culture of the work place is well, all types of employees. The hardest part of the job i would say is trying to get credits. the most enjoyable is being ale to interact with all types of customers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,there is always something to do and never nothing to do. always need to be on your feet. not a fast pace environment but can be a long slow day. fun people to work with
good,"I work here now and don't get enough hours and get paid very little.  Because paychecks are weekly, some checks are very small because of the little hours they give you."
good,"From the day I got there, shoes were all on the floor where the customers shopped and even in the back where the shoes were stored. I was trained as a backup cashier while also being the only one providing customer service to the customers in the shoe department. The best part of the job was having free snacks in the break room and casual dressing."
good,"A nice place to work and gain retail experience. Not many hours provided, definitely would be good for a part time position seeker. Teaches patience and responsibility"
good,Good people. No scheduling. Not a neat store. I worked in departments that I had no knowledge about whatsoever. I was trained for about 30 minutes before putting me on cashier alone.
good,"Kohl's has very few chances to rise within the company. Generally, they rely on outside hires. Their discount system is unparalleled, but leaves much to be desired. They monitor their employees heavily, very 1984-esque. The security is pitiful, regularly losing thousands in shrinkage. Frankly, it wasn't a great job. My coworkers were friendly, though."
good,Great for part time work . flexiable hours . all ways some thing to do . friendly co workers . fun to see all the new clothes . busy busy at the holidays .
good,"I loved working there, the only downfall..I was working 50 hours a week opening the store then they changed all their hours and I went down to part time because they had hired to many people to work"
good,This company wasnt bad to work for. There aren't any complaints. Very competitive to meet the goal we had everyday. This job taught me that I am fit to be In customer service or just to work with people in general
good,"The pay is not adequate for the workload. Management frequently changed. Not very much work/life balance. However, there was a good work atmosphere and the people were nice."
good,Well while I was at Kohl's I had to bag items at the register an that was the extant of my seasonal duties.  I enjoyed the coworkers and the customers as I did my job just wish it lasted longer.
good,"Kohl's is a nice place to work if you're seeking full time employment."
good,A typical day involves a group huddle to begin each shift with clear instructions and clear time management for the rest of each associates shift. The managers are really friendly and caring towards each associate and with customers. The hardest part about this job is the hours that i received because i am also a student attending college
good,You barely get any training. During the holidays you have to be there extremely early (unless you are a cashier or a closer). I was there at 5 in the morning most mornings sometimes at 4 in the morning and sometimes I even closed the night before. There's a lot of stuff to do in so little time and they get mad if you don't finish. The management was okay but i loved most of the people i worked with. You also get many breaks(depending on how many hours a day you've worked).
good,"At Khol's there are many different jobs that need to be taken care of. As a Backstock leader making sure everything was done properly and accordingly was a difficult yet amazing task. Scanning and Putting away clothing items was an intriguing part of the job, finding where all the items belonged was a highlight. As a cashier having good customer service is a big deal, having the right attitude and always working hard in pleasing the customers. Dealing with money is very important to always count the money you receive & hand out is always correct."
good,"I rang up transactions. Could clock in early, if wanted to. Stocked if not busy. Managers are great and very understanding. Flexible hours. Customers are great, when you make them happy."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. The benefits were good. I worked late nights and was asked to stay even later every night. The store was always busy.
good,It's nice to get paid weekly in to Learn new things every day navere did I call off it something to Look forward to Every day the hard part was it Cold in the summer hot in the winter that the bad part
good,"They never scheduled enough people to work during the holiday season and we would often be very busy. I would try to ask for more help but every time I called for someone to help me, they never responded. It wasn't the best work experience I had."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Like the pay, but dont have a life outside of work. Hard to take off at the last minute. Calls are back to back. Insurance isn't the best"
good,"Typical day of work involved cleaning of fitting rooms and putting away returns.  Customer interactions mostly included assisting men with the fitting of suits and matching suit pieces. Also moving items to clearance racks, and assisting at the registers when needed.  Additionally signed up customers with credit accounts and assisted with displays and closing procedures."
good,"very unorganized"
good,"I really worked hard during my time here, and was laid off after the season, with the hopes that I'd at least still be on schedule maybe one or two days a week."
good,I went from seasonal employment at 41 hours/week to regular employee at 8 hours/ week. I do not consider this job worth keeping due to the loss of hours.
good,"They were understanding when working with your school hours. It is a great place to work at if you are a college student. However, the stressful part of the job is getting more hours."
good,"A typical day at work is checking the amount of Ship From Store orders and making sure there are people assigned to them. Keeping up with the Buy Online Pick Up In Store orders so that they won't be overdue. Looking everywhere in the store for order items such as in the stock room, outside trucks, and the floor. I also help customers to find a certain department or item that they need. I have learned a lot about customer service and how to fulfill and package online and pick up orders. The hardest part of the job is receiving an order with items that I cannot locate anywhere in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling the orders fast, finding every item in the orders and packing them."
good,"Wonderful place to be pushed and learn from. Fast-paced environment, days go by fast. Company policies are good but don't execute well for a work/life balance"
good,"Some management could use a lesson in how to treat ALL employees. Do not say in front of everyone that we are all one happy family, then turn around and treat a new employee like a plague. Not a welcoming atmosphere to new employees."
good,"You know the saying bad management will drive away all good employees? That's exactly what happened here. Our admin who did scheduling was spiteful and if you upset her, your hours were cut. Management held grudges after you couldn't do their job for them and overall was just a very toxic work environment. My coworkers were super hit or miss depending on the day. Some days we'd have a good, solid team. Other days I'd be in every department because no one knew what they were doing. A lot of people are very under appreciated at that job and management doesn't try and praise, only scold. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was for the customers."
good,"A typical day was that of monotone and predictable.."
good,"I worked weekend late shift which means I worked fri,sat,sun, and a few times during the week from 8pm to 6am. Thursday was 8pm to 8am. I would sit at bagger island and put things into a machine and they were bagged up and ready to be shipped. Breaks were two 30min breaks which were nice during the 10hr shifts. During the 12hr shifts you'd get 1 30min break and 1 40min break, which was okay but i just preferred to have a third break instead of a 10min longer break."
good,"Nice department store, most coworkers were pleasant to work with, learned things on stocking and replenishing, did a bit of customer service as far as assisting a customer when they had questions or needed help with something. So in all it was ok, didn't care to much for some of the management. This was just a seasonal job for two years."
good,"I was a lead cashier here, it was challenging some days, you meet all walks of life while cashiering. I then was moved into customer service, handling returns and other customer related issues, it was fun helping people.  I liked knowing that I could resolve their issues. I liked this job and all the responsibilities that went with it, but the pay was disgraceful."
good,A typical work day is Ten to twelve hour on your feet. I learned how to use a RT reader device. Management is professional. Co-worker there are many.
good,It was a good work environment with friendly and hospitable people. I had fun working at this company. It was good for a seasonal job.
good,"Kohl's was a very productive work place, very clean, and very willing to help customer's right away with anything they needed help with."
good,Fun place to work nice clothes. Working at kohls is like having a second family. I can say the whole 4 hrs a day really sucked but I had more than enough time to do things in my personal life.
good,"Typical sales job consists of maintaining your department, assisting customers, various projects, and offering great customer service."
good,I'd say for college students this is a good place to earn some money as you get paid weekly however the pay isn't consistent because of high frequency of VTO
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This job was your typical warehouse environment. Many employees, varying shifts available. Environment was fast paced and hot in the summer and cool during winter months."
good,"Working at khols was a fun experience.  However, there was not much room to grow and the schedules were always all over the place."
good,"i was always working alone, never had help, it sucks, did freight all by myself, the managers were dishonest. they never gave good hrs"
good,in the beginning i did not get a lot of training but with the elp of my co workers i got where i needed to be and learned very quickly.
good,"- slow and a stressful"
good,A day at Kohl's started out very fun we work as team but when it came to hit our goals on unloading the truck there was no accountability crew would go slow just because they didn't like the manager and the used profaned to the manager and the other manager that was in power didn't even back up the other manager on sending him home so he got to stay witch was very unfair to the manager that tired to do the right thing to keep the store free of conflict.
good,"Kohl's hiring philosophy is to hire many part-timers to cover the high turn-overs.  As a result, they do not schedule any employee with very many hours.  As a part-time employee, the minimum number of hours per week they can be scheduled is 4.  Many weeks I was only scheduled 4 hours.  The starting pay is only slightly over minimum wage.  After one year, I was given a 13 cent raise.  The highest for part-time employees in my group at that time (2014) was 19 cents.  My pay after one year was $7.89.  Many part-time employees were truly the working poor.  It isn't even subsistence pay.  Corporate problems included not being able to solve problems for customers or employees including not being able to send Kohl's mail to new customer addresses.  That being said, I thought it was a fun environment to work.  There are so many sales and coupons, the majority of customers were happy when they left.  I left to take a job with a set number of work hours per week and higher pay."
good,I enjoyed my time here being able to help customers and getting to know my fellow co workers is always fun and restocking or re-facing items help me release my mild case of OCD.
good,The job was fairly easy and basic retail experience. There aren't any real benefits to the job and not a lot of room to move up.
good,"Working in retail is a great way to learn about what you do or do not like in a job. It gives you valuable insight into how people behave and what they expect from their shopping experience. Learning how to work with difficult customers can translate into effective communication skills in other areas of life. "
good,"I liked the job but working in retail isn't the easist career field to work in. I really don't like working in retail simply because of the many people that comes in to your place of work and can be so rude and disrepectful, and they pay very little in hourly wages and compensation."
good,"I love working with my associates, and training new hires. I do not care for working on weekends, I transferred with Kohl's Corp May 2014 it was to be expected that weekend hours would  be for the first year. Seeing as how I was helping to get our new Dallas site started I agreed to these terms. However after expressing concern regarding this matter now going on two years with no estimated time frame I have decided to explore my options."
good,It's a very simple job if you are just starting to work retail. A person can learn to do everything within a couple days very easily.
good,"A typical day at work would be me standing in one spot for 9 hours while my managers would constantly badger me into getting credits for the Kohl's charge cards. It was overwhelming on days where we held great sales because not a lot of people are wanting another credit card but the managers would still badger us,"
good,"The head manager seems to get stepped on by the E3s often. You never know who to follow orders from, and it is very stressful. People who come from other retail jobs say Kohls is the worst company they have ever worked for."
good,"I think the managers valued the customers way more than their employees. The employees are like slaves there. My manager told me ""If you don't know which side the Misses registers are on, maybe you shouldn't be working here!"" I thought she was out of order and the training there is very poor."
good,An ok place to work. Fast paced environment so you're always busy. Most employees are part time and you don't get very many hours. Part time time employees are eligible for little to no benefits.
good,"I so wish I could walk into Kohls for my shift and see the store looking nice, even if it's little things like picking a shirt off the floor or dust mopping the dressing rooms.  I'm shocked every single time.  I work mostly evenings and when I get there it looks like a bomb went off despite all the employees that worked the day shift.  If you get stuck with closing you have to take all the merchandise from customer service (500's) and painstakingly put everything like it should be ""so the morning shift won't have to"".  Hello???  Did anyone think of perhaps telling the day workers to do that for the night shift?  Soooooo many employees I see hiding in the cloths talking and giggling and NOT working at all.  Kohls, management, the solution is simple.  Hire people who want to work!  Hire people who can be trusted and are dedicated.  Hire pleasant people instead of some of the coworkers I've run into that snarl if you look at them.  Everyone I work with says ""if they would just hire more people""  That is NOT the solution.  Please read above.  Lastly the managers on constantly on us about opening credit accounts.  Ok, so let's do the math.  Every Kohls has a demographic area around them of people who frequent the store.  I bet ya at least 90% of them already have Kohls cards.  So in the dead of January winter when no one is out shopping you can't expect to get 20 credits a day! AND....really, if you were to walk into a store that was literally trashed would YOU want to open a credit account.  The stores are so bad I'm sure people are thinking the merchandise is the same.   That's"
good,"Duties:  Returns and exchanges of any merchandise.  Responsible for main cash drawer for the store, making change for the registers at Point of Sale and Customer Service Department.  countdown of drawers in the Customer Service Department each night.  Collection of all cash drawers from the front and media to be put in the vault for banking the following morning.  Answering of all phones and directing to point of contact.  Addressing all concerns by customers and bringing a satisfactory resolution to the issue.

Maintaining the sign out of any equipment and keys for associate use and document the return of all equipment and keys by end of day.  Balancing the main cash drawer each evening and returning to the vault."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They have tons of students working throughout the schedule. But unless your a senior employee, there is minimal room to advance in a position. They have a lot of people who stand around, but not enough people to turn around and tell them that isn't okay."
good,"While the company is stable, the work-life balance for managers is limited.  Very often expected to work 14+ hours a day and on days off."
good,"Kohls is a decent department store and I enjoy working there for the most part, but they do not hire full time employees and therefore do not have to offer benefits to their workers.  I would like a more stable employment and consistent hours. That has not been the case with Kohls."
good,"I met a great deal of wonderful people while working for this company. However, for the amount of work that was required the pay just never cut the many expenses that I had. Climbing up the corporate ladder was fairly easy to do."
good,"Very few chances for advancing. Very hard to get a permanent position."
good,"Greeted customers with a smile; handled returns and adjustments; looked up merchandise in system at other store locations for customers; processed damaged goods for credit; set up layaways for customers; reorganized store after closing"
good,once hired into ad set they had no room as they said for me to move else where. when inr elaity no one wanted my job and I did it perfectly.
good,"It was a good first job an look into what retail is like, but it was a little messy at times and some of the fellow emloyees were rough around the edges."
good,"A typical day at work is different everyday, I learned most of my customer service skills here. The employees were amazing,"
good,"A typical day at work was handling money, greeting customers and making sure you sold credit. That seemed to be it. Although I did learn how to sell and help customers better, the management should have been happier about excellent customer service rather than selling the credit card. The co-workers were great, all kind and friendly. The hardest part of the job was selling the credit, and the most enjoyable part was being able to have conversations and help people in the community."
good,"Little hours scheduled, over worked you for little pay, sometimes you couldn't even finish your full break. I did enjoy the discounts though. Just wish management would be more professional."
good,The people you work with are mostly great.Just the leadership is very lacking in organization.Somethings that is wrong one day is fine another and vice versa.
good,I did not enjoy the work environment. There were some rude coworkers and the way they worked was not something I would want to do over again. Management needs to have a professional team and setting.
good,"A typical day at work is finding out what exactly I need to be doing other than what I was scheduled to do. Especially with the job being retail, there will be many call ins from employees who take advantage of management, many customers who abuse the ""Yes We Can"" policy of the company, and the shortage of employees due to lack of scheduling and lack of motivation within the company. I have learned every detail about the job from customer service to working the truck, from showcasing diamonds to helping loss prevention catch those who are stealing, and from merchandising to being a makeshift supervisor whenever the need arises. The hardest part is dealing with the incredible workload that always gets left behind, especially if its when you are already shorthanded."
good,"worked in a warehouse at Christmas time "
good,"Great place at first, Then you realize the pay sucks for all the work your doing each day and what they expect from you over all kohls is cheap to its workers."
good,"Because I was seasonal a typical day was fairly busy."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty basic, you worked the cash register and bagged what people bought. Any downtime you were either cleaning your station or folding clothes. The co-workers were friendly, nice, and very helpful. Some of the management was the same, but a few were pretty rude. The hardest part about working at Kohl's was meeting the quota for getting people to sign up for the Kohl's credit card. Especially on slow days. No matter how many time you ask somebody if they want a credit card, if they don't want one, they don't want one. And they most likely won't change their mind. I did not like badgering people into signing up for the credit card. I didn't really enjoy anything about this job, to me it was just a job."
good,Loading and unloading trucks.I learned to track logistics.I didn't really didn't have too much contact with the management. my co-workers were very helpful.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Co-workers are great, the majority of the day would be keeping dressing rooms clean and putting clothes or items back on the floor and helping out with the cashiers when needed."
good,"A typical day at work is long and very busy with sales and customers non stop. I learned great customer service skills. Some co workers were nice some were snobs the time I worked there, things might have changed by now. Hardest part of the day is opening up a certain amount of credit cards and reward cards that day. Most enjoyable part of the job were the customers for me, they kept me busy and entertained."
good,"It's a good place to work if you don't want vacation, hours, promotions.  I have seen people who have been there for years get passed up for a promotion that they rightly deserved."
good,"I loved this part-time position, but pay is very low and if you are hired as an associate, you can't advance into management."
good,"The typical retail job, I've definitely have had great experience since I've started working. This job wasn't as challenging as I had hoped but I wouldn't have changed a thing at that time. The only thing that made this a short time of working there was because my family relocated at the time to Manhattan Beach and I had no choice but to leave."
good,"I loved working at Kohls for the customers, I loved making customers smile. Also I loved selling the Kohls products, and taking care of the store. "
good,"Promote only from within, but hard to go from part-time to full-time. The managers are mostly competent and the HR department actually tries very hard to help every associate."
good,"From the time I started there, where my training was handled by a computer program, to the management having no clue who I was until nearly a month in, it felt extremely impersonal. Working at register of course every day I'd meet and talk to all kinds of different people, and many of the other associates with whom I worked on register were great people. But the way the management only recognized you for pestering and trying to solicit credit from everyone and something so simple as calling in or taking a lunch became so overcomplicated really drove me mad. The hardest part of my job was when you'd have to ask a customer if they'd like to apply for a charge card and there'd be some who'd be very rude and curt about it. The most enjoyable part for me would have to be my coworkers, as we were all quite close."
good,There was always something that needed to be done so the time flew. The customers were very nice. Customer-wise it was one of my   better retail expeiences.
good,"You basically got no training.  I was put in customer service because of my accounting background.  I love dealing with the customer. The problem with Kohls is the amount of work you do for $7.40 an hour. You were not allowed anything to drink as you worked your butt off for 8 hours. They needed at least 3 people on in customer service many times I was the only one. There would be returns all over you never had the chance to damage them or check prices then put in this tiny room they called recovery.  Many times it was so full you could not walk thru there."
good,"typical day at work - when u first get to work,u dont wanna be there,when ya have to pick up the slack of the people in the last shift everyday and bust your butt at the start,witch is almost nearly impossible to catch back up,and struggle half the work day,etc."
good,"A typical day as a cashier was to check out the customers quickly and efficiently, and to keep the registers and their surrounding areas safe and clean. I learned the ins and outs of a cash register and how to provide the great customer service that Kohl's customers expect. The management was extremely unsteady, there were too many managers with no top manager so the rules changed as far as which manager was in the building at the time. The co-workers were the best part about the job, so many people from all different walks of life from cancer survivors trying to make extra money to pay doctor bills, to parents trying to support their families, to students trying to earn a few extra dollars or pay off student loans while also attending school. The hardest part of the job was definitely the Yes We Can policy and that the customers knew that this policy meant that you had do do virtually anything they asked and accept virtually any coupons they had without regards to expiration dates or requirements. The customers took advantage of this policy and there was nothing us associates could do about it."
good,"Work for kohl's for about eleven years. I learn great customer service skill and to appreciate innovation in the working place. down side too many managers turn over so hard to get promoted, also heavy work load for the supervisors."
good,Ring up multiple customers a day while soliciting credit and rewards cards
good,This job was initially a part time job for me for the holidays but due to my work ethic I was promoted to full time. It was very busy during the holidays. Hours were great especially since I had nothing else to do so I worked every chance I could. It was a very relaxed environment as long as you got the job done and took care of the customers first.
good,"Unorganized "
good,I did not mind working for Kohls at all. I enjoyed being able to work with the merchandise and the cash register.  They did expect a lot as far as their credit program.
good,"co-workers were great, management was okay, love my job, pay is not the best and not enough hours"
good,"the management was horrible, there was bulling within the employees and boundaries were constantly pushed."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This is a good place to start. I think its great for some one who doesnt want many hours.
good,"everyday was different whether it was busy or really slow. I learned many skill things like, how to use a cash register, how to hadle many situations, I learned great customer service skills that i still use each and everyday. i loved my coworkers they were alot of fun and i got along with everyone including management. i worked hard and tried my best. the hardest part of the job was working long hours and not having a day off. working holidays and weekends was hard as well. the most enjoyable part of my job was have many customers walk up to my managers and tell them how fantastic i was and how helpful i was. it made me feel good to know that i could help people and make an impact on their lives."
good,"I learned a lot of new things, something interesting and exciting every shift! I really enjoyed add-set and Merchandising. "
good,"This job was a regular basic cashier job, but there were quite a few of my co-workers who were rude and did not treat me well when i first started. I liked working the cashier. It was fun and easy. I love dealing and working with customers."
good,Good Place To Work I Definitely Learned A Lot There Management Was Alright. There Was Nothing Hard About The Job Very Easy To Learn And A Grasp New Thing Just Figuring Out Where To Put Merchandise Was Sometimes A Struggle Great Co- Workers We All Worked Together On The Dock.
good,"cool people lots of fun, management is ok, theres no hard part about the job, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new faces."
good,"Interacted with and provided customer service to our customers. "
good,"It's a good part time job if you're not needing more than 4 hours a week and you don't have a family to support. The store needs better management. Too much favoritism from the employees that have been there since the store opened. They tell you not to play on your phone during work but the management does and lets their ""favorites"" take pictures when they're supposed to be working. Some of us worked our *** off and don't get any recognition. The superstars of the month is a bunch of bull because they only pick their favorites. The favorites who don't do s**t all day."
good,"This position was fun at times, working with some hardworking people made this position pleasant."
good,"An ""okay"" place to work. Typical day would be very busy with or without customers. Management not so good, lack communication  and disconnected for the most part; take their stress out on employees for not meeting credit goals or store being messy. Personal information was not protected at all and givin out to ANYONE over the phone. I learned and developed a lot! I got trained to work Customer Service, Jewelry, Department, and as a Credit Greeter. These areas strengthened my Communication Skills, as well as my ability to work under pressure."
good,The people were generally good to you but only if you have been there years.  Most of the customers were nice except for the older ones.
good,The management and co workers are amazing. The schedule and expectations are horrible.
good,"I love helping customers.My co workers are friendly and fun to work with, The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet."
good,"Decent place to work if you dont mind standing all day confined to a register bay. "
good,A typical day at work would be cleaning up a certain area while provided customers with there needs.
good,this job was just a seasonal job. there wasn't much to talk about except except just being a holiday employee.
good,"Cashier,put new clothing items on racks, organized clothing on shelves and in dressing rooms."
good,i would ring customers items up after they were finish shopping. i learned how to work the cash register. the management was good. there was no hard part of the job.i enjoyed the job because you got paid every week
good,"assisting customers with orders/statements"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great customer benefits, not enough hours for me,fum group of co workers"
good,"Cleaning, smiling, cleaning, smiling "
good,"Kohl's warehouse was an excellent place to work great benefits and pay, friendly supervisors and awesome co workers. this job will help you build team work skills and help you work at a pace to preform your absolute best to get the job done."
good,apprehending shoplifters how to manage associates and deal with customer issues.  Mgt.  was ok not very good leadership in the building.  Co-workers were great always trying to do the best job.  The hours of operation open late open early no work life balance.  Working as team to accomplish big tasks.
good,There was room for growth. I learned that with hard work you will get acknowledged.
good,"This job is good for someone who can work full time. If trying to work and go to school, Kohls doesnt like to work with you."
good,"Good opportunity to learn and make mistakes, Had great mentors to help me along"
good,fun place to work if you have the right managers giving you time and feedback!
good,"I worked in shoe department as a lead supervising 4 associate my day consisted to open boxes,put out new shoes check sales and wait on customers."
good,Always busy especially during holiday season but the hours and the pay was pretty bad.
good,Management willing to work with your availability. You can work from 4 hours to 8 hours on a typical day. Most employees are trained in more than one area. All should know how to use the registers. Mix of ages regarding co-workers. Lots on customer service skills fine-tuned. Moving of fixtures and product on a daily basis. No healthcare benefits are being given to part time employees any longer.
good,Working a regular shift at kohls is usually unpredictable. Having many managers that never communicated causing confusion and disorganization.
good,"typical work day consist of greeting customers, checking out customers, being friendly, keeping areas clean and folding clothes in departments"
good,"i normally work on the truck, where i help unload and merchandise. i normally do the mens department and use the book to put things where they belong. then i also work on the floor where i answer back up calls for the register, i clean the floor and the fitting rooms and i help in customer service. i help customers find what they need. i also do price changes during the morning. also i work inventory."
good,"Working at Kohl's is a great job I like my customers and getting to know new people. The managers are friendly and easy to talk to, people I work with are great hardworking individuals. The hardest part about my job is actually the funnest part, its when its the holidays, fast paced lots of customers and makes your day feel quick even if its long."
good,Kohl's empowers their employees with the ability to assist customers.  They have clearly defined work ethics.  I enjoy working in the shoe department and my ability to assist customers with their footwear needs.
good,"It sucked. It was just work. people are rude, managers are rude. not a fun place to work unless you liike drama."
good,the people there are fun to work with people work very hard there
good,"100% customer focused"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,My favorite part of my job was being on my own going at my own pace.
good,Ok place for a part time job. Nice co-workers. Great customers.
good,"Kohl's was overall an OK company to work for. There was a lot of ""high school"" situations with coworkers because of the immaturity level of some of them. Management had clear favorites and it was hard to get ahead unless you fit into that category. Hours were cut drastically, the drive was not worth the pay after a while. "
good,"I was working there and when they gave me my pay card that was supposed to have my first check on it was expired so they gave me my check in cash, but then request I pay that back but I never got my new card."
good,typical days at work came with a few basic problems supervisors that would b no where to be found for hours or a lot of people in any department doing little or no real work. There was a lot it took to get recognized for good work mostly by kissing up to management. It wasn't all bad the hours were good and the work was a good mix of being hard at times yet simple enough to do and the people were friendly and helpful most of the time. Rules were met with harsh punishments for breaking.
good,I enjoyed beingthe beauty specialist. At the time I wasn't licensed as a cosmetologist so by law I couldn't apply make up to the customer's face. While employed here I decided to go to cosmetology school. The store wasn't willing to accommedate my education so I left to go back to school.
good,"a good starter job, when going back into the workforce. Good in giving what the customer wants. employee discounts and discounts for having there credit card"
good,"Great , fun place to work but was laid off due to seasonal position"
good,I didnt like working for kohl's. I will not go back. Coworks didnt not help you out
good,"I am a customer oriented person, so I loved the daily interaction with the customers, I enjoyed helping customers.The hardest part of the job was constantly understaffed, always calling to get people to come in due to no shows."
good,Was fun to work at and kept busy with things that made the time go faster.  Everyone worked together and communicated well.
good,"When opening, duties were to get the store ready for customers, stocking etc."
good,"Easy work, usually works with your schedule, not alot of communication between the crew, benefits could be better."
good,"It was easy to ring up customers, you have to be fats and know the deals going on that day. Its very easy because of their care for the customer deal. Management was bad. The supervisor purposefully made other employees get in trouble and fired. The managers were okay but did nothing about the supervisor so I left. Hardest part is keeping up with other cashiers. Its basically a tag team between breaks and working. The most enjoyable part is helping out customers and giving good deals."
good,"enjoyable place to meet new/friendly face working with people that care and are very helpful, good benefits, good opportunities to excel, not good hours/pay. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure every customer I come in contact with is happy and pleased with my service, and seeing my new found friends.  "
good,I know how to do almost everything thing at Kohl's so its kinda fustrating because they need me all over.
good,"Unorganized "
good,"No stable hours and hard to get people to cover you when on register weather it is for back up help, needing to go to the restroom or simply waiting to go home. Hardest part is they was all about credit,credit, credit and if you didn't get credit it was a problem. "
good,"Managers are understanding "
good,"I would only be scheduled four to ten hours per week, when I was constantly asking for more hours. They kept hiring more employees when there weren't enough hours to go around. The management team were mostly friendly and helpful, but they have a serious lack of communication problem. They don't want to have full time employees and provide benefits, I think. If you work here, you have to have a second job to pay the bills. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Its always go go go which is nice your always busy and have stuff to do. I have learned a lot about the company that I had no idea about before. Management is alright I would have to say this is my least favorite thing about this company. Co-workers are awesome very helpful! Hardest part of the job is some of the rude customers and trying to keep the store clean all the time.
good,"I have been for the company Kohls for 5 years now. I must say, the time has flown by. The management since I have been there, I've seen people come and go pretty often. The benefits I take with me would be my great credit solicitor skills, which I didn't walk in there thinking I would be top in credit for my district, but I am. I would say the hardest part of my job, I can't really think of anything that would be considered hard. Having great customer service skills comes easy to me, and working with customers nonstop, its my job to provide the service that I do to each and every customer, I am good at what I do and I do it well. The co- workers that I worked with, like I said, people come and go but I say all in all, its an ok environment. Definitely not somewhere I would picture myself being in the future. It's a retail environment, you get what you get pretty much!"
good,As new stock came into the store it was important to keep product moving. Customer service was pivotal to keeping sales up. Providing a clean and open store was one of my many goals at Kohl's.
good,"Enjoyed using my customer service experience from the restaurant industry to the retail industry. Not much is different, knowing the product and seeing that the customer feels his money is well spent. People work hard for their paycheck. They want to know that you care they spent it at your store. Supervising was similar, keep staff on task and focusing on customers."
good,it is very friendly meeting new people manament is very friendly co works are team players
good,"Very uncommunicative, long hours, management very back and forth, rude customers"
good,"a day at work was pretty much un organized,they did not let you learn much other than what you were assigned to."
good,"The people that work there are amazing...the pay sucks. The management sucks, employeesshould get paid more cause they do so much"
good,"Not a very good place for advancement, best part of the job is meeting all the other employees and interacting with them, worst part is dealing with the bad customers who don't care how much of a mess they make because they don't have to clean it up."
good,Kohls is where I learned and mastered my management skills. This is where I managed a lot of employees and had to jugle a lot of diffrent tasks on a daily bases.
good,A typical day at work would be managing associates and interacting with customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was multitasking and being on my feet. The hardest part was the shift I had. My co-workers were capable and attentive to their duties and worked very well together.
good,Advancement is a matter of who you know rather than how well you work
good,Pros:
good,"A typical work day involves me greeting customers every day, making sure their need are met no matter what it may be. finding a paticular product, helping find the right size and even at times sizing customers for the best fit, and making sure the customer leaves the store satisfied with their experience."
good,my review may have been higher if it were not for the fact that in my four years there i had 2 manager 2 district managers and 3 diffrent sets of my 3 assistant managers and they they tend to move supervisors and specialist around the store. that being said the store had 1 manager 3 assistant managers 4supivisors and and nine specialist one for each area.
good,"Train in each dept., to receive more hours but hours still amount to about 4 hours per week. During district visits, work 12 hour days to get store ready, but not thanked. Every management change means your hours will be changed."
good,"Worst place to work i was hired to be a cashier of 35 hours. Not one time in the month and a had that i spent working there i got more than 9 hours a week. And i applied and got hired for cashier, i had to do everything else too that i got no training whatsoever for but learned to do on my own , sales associate and also customer service rep becuase they were aways short. In the short time i spent there i was way too exhuasted"
good,"Training was good, great customer service. Most of the employees were very nice. Management was good, but room for improvement."
good,i like working there cause the customer and friends not cause the job.
good,I have worked for kohls for about 2 years now. The biggest thing I would point out is I am not valued at all. The pay is horrible and they cut your hours like crazy!!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Nice part-time job.I enjoyed working with the sales floor staff. Not many hours consistently offered unless its near a holiday or seasonal. Lower paying compared to Target and  Old Navy .
good,"Long term wise, the way you're treated by the company in general, especially by higher up managers, along with the little amount of pay isn't worth it. The plus is you always busy either doing projects or helping customers."
good,"During my time at Kohl's the most prominent thing that stood out to me was their lack of organization and staff ignorance towards their jobs. It seemed to me that many staff members were left having to overcome organizational issues that were avoidable by higher management. Other than having to work around organization issues, the work environment has been fast-paced and friendly."
good,"When I started working for Kohl's it wasn't very welcoming , I felt like an outcast, and training was not very thorough. After months I began feeling more accepted and really enjoyed working with my coworkers. hours tend to fluctuate due to the sales of the store."
good,The thing I like most about working at Kohl's is that they are very lenient with the amount of hours you work. This is very important to me as a college student because my schedule can be very hectic at times. A typical shift would consist of 4-5 hours. I would say I learned the most throughout these past 2 years with this company. I've learned a lot about time management and how to interact with others.
good,I will start by saying the pay is awful. If you are working in the off season dont expect many hours. Promotions are based on your current pay and have no reflection on how much more work you will have to do. That being said if you dont care about making much money it is a good place to work. Managment does seem to care about its employees well being. The promote from within too.
good,"I like this job! Catching shoplifters overall is a ton of fun and gets the adrenaline going for sure. I would stick around this position longer if it weren't for the managers being so passive-aggressive and intrusive. That is what killed my love for the position. When you catch a case, you are to put it into a system that keeps track of the subject and the merchandise you recover. If you word something they perceive as ""incorrect"" in the slightest, they mark your case as uncompleted and then you have to go through again and try to fill it out to the manager's liking. On top of that, you are expected to meet a quota every week. This doesn't include run outs and it does not include deterred cases. To me, this does not seem productive for LP officers or supervisors. As you can get 10 deterrences one week and no cases in which the subject actually proceeded to walk about with merchandise. Very backward if you ask me and an outdated way of managing loss prevention officers. "
good,customer satisfaction is number one priority and i did my best every day to make sure every customer has a excellent shopping experience and leave with smile
good,Shifts are all over the place. Have to work most holidays and weekends. I think the managers are very nice but they still have to go by corporate rules.
good,The managers there are terrible. There key to drawing in customers is big deals on over priced products to make the company look good. Also prioritizes customer happiness.
good,A typical day at work consists of waiting around for someone to tell you what to do. You are mostly out on the floor completing mindless tasks that have no real bearing on the store.
good,"Coworkers were fun and had really good humor. Very few of them were hard to work with. Even the store manager knew how to put on a cheerful face although she felt kind of unfriendly...ah well."
good,The people are ok but the business model sort of sucks. The goal seems to be hire a whole bunch of people give them little hours with little pay as possible
good,"Loved my coworkers. Management were very strict with hours, not much room for promotions. Holiday season hours were great, after that, not so much. If had better benefits and easier to move up then it would be a 5."
good,"Working as a seasonal associate for Kohl's was more enjoyable than I first expected. My coworkers were quite friendly and there was a sense of community that made my time there much more enjoyable. However, I wish that I would've been given a more consistent schedule. I would go from 6 hours one week to 35 the next and constantly bounce between late night and morning shifts. Trying to establish a daily routine was impossible and my sleep schedule got totally messed up."
good,"Managers join in rallying together about other employees. Lots of bad talk about employees. Fire good people, so others can climb to the top. Lots of favortism in the company. Not enough employees to work the store. Lots of stress."
good,"I was a cashier mainly, and left due to mental health issues that are now resolved. Didn’t do much other than cashier and occasionally answer customers questions."
good,Working at kohls was a good experience for me. I don't believe it is for everybody but it is a good company to work for overall. Especially for the holidays.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Overall a decent place. Come there to do simple work for good money and up front time off but don’t advance to problem solve or team lead. The pay isn’t worth the headache.
good,"Too much focus on Customer happiness and making sure they don't throw a fit.  Not too much focus on policies or worker retention.  There is also not a lot of staffing, always calling for backup and no one to come up."
good,It's a nice place to work. Staff is for the most part warm and welcoming. It's usually pretty busy so you're not typically bored and without something to do.
good,Managers were constantly up your a** to sell Kohl’s charges. They pretty much told you not to take no as an answer. Some days I couldn’t take a break for a 7/8 hour shift because I was the only one up at the register and no one would come to my register to take over after I asked several times.
good,You can have almost as many hours as you want during the holiday season. Hours are somewhat flexible. Great discounts! Pay could be better. Somewhat of a toxic work environment at my store with a lot of dissention in the store. Employees are treated like they are somewhat disposable at times. Not a lot of appreciation for long time employees. It could be contributing to the high turn over.
good,"When I worked there, I had three managers. The 'boss', the sectional floor manager and the store manager. They all gave me different tasks to do at the same time that did correlate with each other. I would be expected to handle the cash while folding clothes while being the only available cashier at the time. "
good,I am just getting started at this location..  so far the bosses seem nice and people keep to them self’s.. fast moving job.. detailed oriented.. clean
good,"I worked here a while back so things have probably changed, but I enjoyed working here. Fun environment and kind employees but the pay wasn’t enough for me so I ended up changing career paths"
good,I still work here at kohls only because i still haven't received any call backs from other jobs yet but i've been there for two months now and i barely get any hours. i only work one to two days a week and we get paid weekly so my checks are never that big and it really hard to make a living with a paycheck that's barely $100. not only that but there are so many employees who work there its hard to get access to price scanners or walkie talkies. management doesn't know what their doing if you ask them for help. i still do know how to do all my duties correctly because ive never really been trained around the store.
good,The best thing about working at Kohl's was the people - I worked with many good people over the years and every manager I had was great.  Kohl's IT has an open cubicle concept which was hard to get used to but did encourage collaboration within and between teams. I was hoping to retire from Kohl's but my role was not in their plans.
good,"I did the jobs I had to do and that was it. As long as you stay in line, its not a bad job. Pay was alright, people were fine, customers were okay. Holidays, like any other retail store, were a nightmare."
good,Was kept on the books after quitting by the store because it allocated them more hours for other employees but having to pay mandatory benefits for child support corporate threatened to sue me for not paying the premiums after I had quit
good,"I would show up 15 minutes before my shift, put my stuff in my locker, grab my radio and ear piece, look at when my breaks were. I would then wait 5 minutes before my shift started to clock in as expected. I would then go my assigned area for my shift, whether that be the register or on the floor. I would help the customers with all of their needs as best as I was able and get my job done in the process. I kept my area clean and neat. If extra help was needed I would head over right away and answer store calls on the floor. I would ask to take my breaks at the set time, make sure I had someone to cover my break and watched the clock to make sure I went back out right when my break ended. Before my shift was to end I made sure I got my job completed and asked my manager if they had anything else they needed me to complete before I clocked out. "
good,You would be scheduled to work in one department but they would sometimes have u work multiple departments. They dont give enough hours. Some manegers would rather call you to do something quick instead of doing it themselves.
good,"The stores used to be a great place to work, but not anymore. Staffing has been cut, and workload has increased. There is very little training, and even supervisory positions start a just barely above minimum wage. Most positions have been decreased to part-time, which offers no benefits. Full-time benefits are good, but nobody does your job while you're gone on vacations. Turn over is very high, especially among supervisors, who are so overworked, yet held to impossible standards."
good,Was ok not really into rtail with clothes but time flew by on the midnight shift this job seemed more for older middle age employees who like retail basically.
good,"Started out as a seasonal employee right before the holidays. I'm still here four years later as a department lead. Your pay jumps are tiny unless you are actively threatening to leave. Managers definitely have favorites. Any complaints about scheduling will be reflected in the next schedule posted, they may give you worse shifts on other days and it feels almost like a punishment. It can be fun to work here but we are almost always severely underpayedwhich is reflected in the attitude of employees. I honestly have really loved working here at times and been on the verge of walking out as others. You will be busy, at least in my department. The floor staff is so light that leads are working on all floor sets and store projects leaving departments without their supervisors for most of the week."
good,"The current management is half great and half terrible. The hours are super flexible, but I will say that if you get on management’s bad side, your hours will get cut. You’ll love the other employees you work around, but just keep your head low and stay out of trouble... you’ll be fine. There’s good employee discount events, and the only times you’ll actually have to work hard are when there are visits from corporate."
good,This is a great job for someone who is just starting out. Nice people to work with and just a fun place to be. Good advancements too you can learn how to work on all kinds of departments!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Management was horrible. I started and when I needed help they told me to find it myself. Told me to go faster to unload the truck on the first day when I had no idea what I was doing.
good,"When starting my shift at 12:30pm I started taking phone calls. I took phone calls for three different departments: such as Credit Cards, Collections/Retention, and Retail. Learned how to multi task it was a high pace Call Center. Customers you could not please no matter what you or the supervisor tried to do. Sometimes being  pulled off the phones to decorate or to get a breather some free time."
good,"They were obsessed with reaching credit goals. They wanted you to really push it in every customers face even after they say no. Their focus is on GREAT which includes stuff like circle a survey, push credit cards, and thank the customer. My coworkers were great, very friendly and management was okay enough. When we were short on credits for the night the manager on duty would try to make the employees sign up for a credit card. There was no way to advance at my location from registers. They promised me another spot then gave it to someone else. They do bring in food on national food days like pizza day. The discounts are 15% off anything with the occasional extra 20% that can only be used on the non exclusive stuff."
good,At times there are just not enough people scheduled to cover the busy times. This results in not being able to keep up with things. This is tough on the end of the day shift that sometime have to stay hours passed closing to put things back in order.
good,Must be able to multi-task and go with the flow.  Holidays are stressful and at time frustrating.  Must be able to work weekends and there are no fixed schedules or hours.
good,"social, great work ethic from most of my peers. it was a great experience working with customers the way i did. i also appreciate the help from my fellow coworkers when i’d need help"
good,I have worked here twice and the first time was definitely better. My second time started ok but after some time I realized that management and I were not working well together. Lower management and I worked extremely well together but the store manager ran the building like a school principal and I'm too old for that nonsense. If you need some extra cash and can tolerate it then try working at this location.
good,typical day at work is busy. the management isn't what I Anticipated it would be. hardest part of the job is keeping down all the fitting rooms when there is constant traffic flow of customers and being the only one on the floor until near time for me to leave.
good,"Its an okay place to work, if you want to be overworked, because they are completely understaffed. You end up in positions you weren't hired for and it can be confusing because you haven't been trained on that specific position and cant help the customers properly."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls some days...It gets really annoying when your the only person on the floor and have to manage all departments. I cannot be in 6 places at once! THEY WILL CROSS TRAIN YOU and have you running around like crazy. Management also doesn't follow rules and give any discount the customer asks for. And when it's not the holidays its 4 hours a week...but wait you have to give them 4 days of availability a week, so no way to get a second job and be fair to both :-/"
good,"A typical day at kohl's is spent time inventorying, setting up end caps, cleaning up displays, ringing up sales on a typical cash register, and cleaning."
good,"Good job for students. Terrible pay with no advancement opportunities."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a seasonal position for minimum wage. The only thing I didn't like was having to push customers into opening kohl's charge accounts.
good,"A typical work day involves me helping unload a truck then merchandising the product onto the sales floor. Or a closing shift calls for recovering the floor and making sure it's presentable for customers the following day. I also fulfill online orders and prepare them to either be shipped to the customer or for in store pickup at the customer's convenience. The most difficult part of this job is never having enough to do. It being a smaller store, the tasks are not endless and I often find myself having to constantly ask for something new to keep the work flow going. Overall, it's a decent place to work, I just need more to feel a sense of accomplishment."
good,Worked as seasonal employee. I felt I was not treated as important as full time staff. I id not get enough hours. I was not kept on after the Christmas season was over.
good,"I spent a small amount of time with the store but it was disorganized every day I was in. Managers ""miraculously"" never hear when you ask for your scheduled break, and without that confirmation to make sure your position us taken care of, there are MANY times you go without your break and then when they ask about it, they pass it off. Theres tension between management, so it was hard to feel comfortable at times depending on who was listed for the day. They want you to hit numbers to make the store succeed, but if you aren't able to they tell you to pick it up and to do better. Theres no encouragement, it's just ""do it next time you're in, no exceptions."" "
good,"I enjoyed working here when I first started.  Then later on I started to feel uncomfortable working here because management kept pushing associates to open credit card for customers.  I didn't mind opening new credit to my  customers,  but when your supervisor watches over your shoulder....that's a HUGE red flag!!"
good,"I really honestly hate working for Kohl's. But when you are hurting to find a job and get food back on the table for your kids, I just had to take what was out there whether I liked it or not."
good,"Easy job to to have while going to school/college. Management was supportive of availability and flexible with hours. It was easy to give away and add shifts to schedule. Long hours, often stayed a couple hours after close to clean up store."
good,"Raises are rare and there is little to no room for advancement in the company. Working there is a fun environment and the management is  well liked and fun to work with as well. The hardest part about this job is probably just helping difficult customers with ease and grace. The best part about this job is the people I work with, I like getting to talk and work with them on the daily."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Honestly, not the best place to work."
good,"Should pay better,  for the amount of work that has to be done.. Schedule should be done better. part-timers should atleast have  paid time off.. I don't feel that there's room for advancement!! they base your hours on the amount of credits yoiu can sell, which is not fair.."
good,Working at Kohl's was quite an experience. It was very fast paced and the people there were really helpful and patient. I'm not sure i'd recommend this as a place to work but it gave me experience
good,"Discount was main plus.  Management did not follow the availability form I submitted when hired.  When they scheduled me for those times I informed them I was not available, I was required to find someone to cover my shift.  Not fair."
good,"Providing positive, efficient customer service while receiving and packing orders for online purchases. Learned to use bluebird operating system. Also how to multitask in hourly restrictions. Management can be difficult considering different managers giving conflicting instructions or having differing visions. Hardest part about retail is the customers but that's also the most enjoyable."
good,"When I worked here the only thing that really kept me going was friends I had made and the managers that actually did their jobs and were good at it. "
good,Co`workers were very helpful.Customers are very demanding.The management staff all have different ways of communicating with the workers.  The customers have learned that they can change the amount they pay for the items selected if they ask to talk to a manager.
good,The best part of my job was working in new areas and finding out new skills i had to use in order to get the job done. The hardest part was keeping up because this was new to me but once i figured it out it was very easy. The managers were very humble and was very understanding when giving instructions.
good,"This is a decent place to work during the holidays as a temporary worker or something along those lines, however hours are not consistent and sometimes nonexistent."
good,"Working at Kohl's made me realize that retail isn't meant for everyone. The pay was decent enough and the employees were pretty cool people overall. The scheduling managers would often schedule people outside of their posted availability, which could get very inconvenient and annoying at times but otherwise a decent place to work."
good,"At first It was a great experience. But very little training. througought the years, had to push for any extra training or positions. in the end had no support and leadership lacked. You had to look out for yourself. NO help when needed. if you wanted to change departments you couldn't really."
good,"A Typical day consisted of restocking of merchandise both in storefront and stockroom and helping customers with any requests. "
good,"I worked seasonally at Kohls on Morrell road and I truly enjoyed my experience with them. Good working environment, kind co-workers, and a good positive outlook on things."
good,"Kohl's was a good place to work.  If you were not where the supervisor wanted in my case, she used  everything against people they do not like.  They find a way to retialiate."
good,it was a job. always stuff to do. weather it was stocking shelves  facing shelves doing ship from store or deactivating electronic signs. was a ok job for a college student
good,"Very low pay, but good for a first job or holiday pay. Benefits are low or non-existent, and management is hit-or-miss . Some were good, but some were overbearing."
good,"Poor management, work place was clean and organized but they don't treat their employees very well. Training is way too long for the job, they tend to over complicate things"
good,The shift supervisor was good and dept manager good but plant manager was always push push push even if safety issuses were not followed.He didnt care as long as numbers got done even if someone got hurt.
good,Overall its a good job to make extra money but don't make it to a career. In order to get more hours you really have to be flexible with your schedule and open to work in any department. But overall its your typical retail job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My team of 18 hired 3300 applicants over a 4 month span. Screening application, drug screening, opening and closing requisitions in workday, moving applicants through Orientation and Onboarding. answering phones, customer service, problem solving, data entry 1 9 information, schedule into Knonos, I 9 auditing. Follow up calls with applicants."
good,"All the coworkers and customers are typically great people but hiring too many fun coworkers causes a decrease in hours which obviously leads to a decrease in pay. I was there for a year and made under $10,000."
good,Kohls was not a team oriented organization. I prefer to have a team to work with to help drive productivity.  I often found myself working alone for large portions of my shifts.
good,management told me that my best wasn't good enough and that is when i decided to leave. Other than management i loved the customer service aspect of the work place
good,It feels like you’re running in the circles the entire time you work there as nothing really gets “done” per se. There’s a lot of pressure on you at all times to push for surveys or credit cards. The employees are nice and the managers are overall very helpful but you can’t ever do enough for the store. Expectations are always really high even if the time allotted doesn’t make sense with the to-do list. A lot of things are left unfinished.
good,Being a cashier at Kohl's was frustrating. They constantly pressure you to get people to sign up for credit cards even though most of the people who shop there already have a Kohl's Charge. My manager was super unprofessional and had me train someone when I had only been there for a month and then proceeded to call me stupid for not training her correctly.
good,"Bad pay and over worked, the management doesn't work as a team. Multiple managers talk badly about employees to other employees. .09 cent raises per year is terrible."
good,"Stressfull, fast paced, work force not large enough to handle all the duties required.  I'm sometimes given responsibility outside of my job description"
good,A typical day was just cleaning up after customers. I learned that just about everyone feels that they are entitled to everything.  Management was terrible. I had an anxiety attack on the job and it took a customer to tell management what happened in order for me to leave.
good,THE MANAGEMENT IS VERY UNORGANIZED! Also any other place you work at in retail there’s designated people for certain departments the clothing departments always where a mess! The merchandisers do more walking around than straightening as they go. Which leave other people to do the job for them.
good,"Worked here for seven years, there is a high turnover. It is good for part-time associates but in recent years they have added additional work to many supervisors without compensating pay."
good,Kohls was a good company to work for. They are pretty flexible with their scheduling when you needed them to be. The management cared a lot about the company and always wanted what was best for their employees.
good,Worked with some really pathetic individuals in my area. Most Kohl's employees are good individuals but there are many exceptions. Supervisor was a very poor people manager.
good,"The work environment is pleasant, there are benefits for meeting goals. They do not offer professional development. There is a   good team work. "
good,"The variety in workload is limited and there is not many opportunities to advance."
good,"wasnt there for very long. its good for a starting position cause its not too many responsibilities. "
good,"Kohls is a cool place to work., great discounts especially if your an employee. Only con part is rude customers when they dont get their discounts. And sometimes trying to reach your IC goal."
good,Very fast paced environment if you work weekends and afternoons. E3's (shift supervisors) don't seem to do much which I know that more is expected of them. The manager I had while working here would seem to listen to complaints of certain employees or shifts but never really follow through with talking to them about it. There was a lack of consistency for those that work on the sales floor in regards to how many hours they get to work a week. One week I had 30 hours and the next I had 4. I think they may have over hired.
good,"Working here was alright, a typical day here was standing at the cashier register for about 5-6 hours and helping out customers find certain things. I learned that the customer isn't ALWAYS right."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Very unfriendly working environment. It was a seasonal job but even after the season was over and I was offered a full time position "
good,"Great co workers and loved the customers .  steady, busy work throughout the day, you are kind of all over the store throughout your shift taking on different tasks."
good,Good place to work and great discounts however they ask to much from. People that work versus making the ones that don't pull they weight recognition is good
good,"Gained a lot of experience, and learned how to deal with people better. Was able to be a translator in Spanish for customers who could not understand English."
good,"Took the job as a short term thing and that's all it really can be. Most of the time my problems were with the company and not the individuals working in the store. Corporate has the tenancy to change the rules, so management and associate often have to find work-arounds. "
good,"It was a good job to have during school, I didn't work too much and the management was great. Towards the end of my time there I needed more hours and I wasn't receiving that."
good,I liked working with the people at Kohl's. It was very busy cleaning up after the shoppers. Busy unloading the truck and replenishing stock to the floor.
good,"Receiving Inbound collection/fraud call. Learned a variety of systems, software and programs for different departments. Work culture was always putting customer first.  The hardest part of my job was being without a coordinator/supervisor or team lead to assist with changes & updates. The most enjoyable was assist customer in resolving ways to bring accounts current and initiating investigations or open cases for fraud accounts."
good,"As far as working for the company goes it was an easy enough job. The customers can be a bit harsh from time to time but they were easy enough to deal with. The only real part about that job that made it hard was how demanding the management was at times. I was just a basic clerk and they wanted me to do supervisor jobs, it was tough at times but for the most part it was easy work."
good,"If you dont mind a changing schedule or working directly with the public, I would certainly recommend Kohl's. This was my very first job and I stayed for almost 4 years. It was a fun place to work, I had just gotten to a point where I wanted a set schedule and weekends off."
good,The pay hovers around minimum wage. Wish I could have gotten a raise more often. it was nice working in a clean environment and the staff when I began was wonderful.
good,"The job will be more enjoyable if the managers are not rude and snappy. No matter how well you use your communication skills, you are never told, good job, or asked how are you today."
good,I worked there for 10 1/2 years I had one major promotion into management and a total of 3 other positions I was promoted to before management. But the pay didn't reflect all the I was responsible for.
good,Not enough communication and direction given by management. I was left on my own. There was no opportunity to discuss ongoing issues with management as they were part time also and very hard to approach due to scheduling differences.
good,"You come in, do your job and leave; As you do in most jobs. The customers, to me, make working in retail worth it. Being able to help someone should be your mindset when working in this field. Customer is always right, until management proves them wrong."
good,"Honestly, I'm glad Kohls had hired me and has taught me retail for almost 3 years, but I'm just bored with it now. It feels like I'm just on autopilot and going through the motions. The people are nice there, don't get me wrong, I am just looking for a change of scenery whether it's profession or just where I'm working."
good,"If your looking for a low risk/ low stress job, this is perfect. If you want more ability to move up and have progress in your career this isn't the job for you."
good,"Kohl's Wichita-East definitely needs drastic improvement, not only within the associates, but the management as well. Enviroment could be improved. Overall, their scheduling isn't the greatest; and they have a consistent problem with new hires leaving/resigning shortly after being put on."
good,"Can be fast paced an stressful at times but co-workers were easy to get along with and helpful, pay was low, hours were very minimal, management was ok nothing to write home about"
good,I worked at Kohl's for 6 yrs. and it was a job that was great; if you only need part-time. The employees are what made things enjoyable; along with the great people I met while working there.The company itself was good to their employees and worked well with the hours you needed. The hardest part was low pay and not enough hours.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My store had more management, if you didn't agree with management you didn't move up, they made promotions personal. Customers are rude and crazy with no back from management, lots of micromanaging, crazy retail hours with minimum pay! coworkers are fabulous like family. I enjoyed merchandising and helping customers"
good,"Management was ever changing, no consistency on training, changed our work from collections to fraud with minimal training and expected us all to pick it up quickly!"
good,"This job was stressful.   Overworked each shift due to lack of employees scheduled, had to ask for required breaks, management shows favoritism. Cliques of employees.     Closing shifts are the worst, clearing fitting rooms, folding after Store is closed.  I tried to transfer to another state, impossible to get any manager to help with transfer in computer, seems like HR is unorganized, even corporate office was no help.  Finally gave up.  Very disappointing."
good,"If you don't need a lot of hours per week and work just part-time then this job is for you.   The hours you receive each week is not the same.  You can get cross-trained in a lot of different departments if you are willing and eager to learn.  If your life schedule changes you are able to change your availability.  This job has been great for me to be able to change my availability while my young child was young since I taught him from home I was able to get off to take him on field trips, co-op classes, etc.  It helped me balance my work/life.  They have been great when I needed time off.  I have been trained in almost everything there and that helps in getting you more hours.  The hardest part in this job is dealing with the customers.  Keeping calm, smiling, not getting angry at the customer is the hardest thing I have to deal with on a daily basis.  I think everyone should work retail in their life just once so they know what retail employees have to go through.  Just maybe the customers will have more respect for the employee and their actions/re-actions.  We have had more bad management than good, but they tend to not stick around long."
good,"It's a place where one can hardly make a living with the pay.  they intentionally reduce the hours as one approaches the limit for benefits, However, the schedule makes it easy to combine work and school."
good,"Folding clothes after a while just got really boring and tedious. It didn't help that trying to get days off for family vacations was incredibly difficult. Management was very inconsistent in how much they tried to do/cared about their job. I would often be the only one manning my department because they liked to work with a skeleton crew to avoid paying too much. Luckily I wasn't a cashier because management would constantly pester them to get more store credits (which, according to rumor would just secure a pay raise for managers). Somewhat adequate training. I would not recommend."
good,"the people I worked with were amazing and made the job worth it! the management wasn't the best but where is it these days? the work was pretty easy, but I was also doing truck so that was always fun."
good,"It was fun to work there because a decent amount of my friends were there, the majority of the supervisors were nice, but some were unfair and not give the workers what they deserved."
good,"As a seasonal worker, I was given fewer hours than most of the staff, which to me, was no big deal since I was at the end of my school semester and faced with finals and projects. The staff at my store was generally friendly, except for one nitpicky manager. Working in a department got hectic during busy hours, as I was most often on my own. The cash register felt like a nice break, but the regular cashiers had quotas to maintain, selling Kohl's credit cards. Overall, the experience was not bad if you do not plan on staying for too long."
good,"Just atypical summer job as a high schooler, learned how to deal with customers, manage time with a work schedule, it was a coming of age job. Enjoyed to laid back environment of the job, it wasn't too much responsibility as a high schooler."
good,I worked there for 10 years.  I had 4 different store managers and countless assistant mangers.  Sometimes you would have 3 different mangers tell you to do 3 different things at once.   I felt the expectation of employees was unfair.
good,"I worked at Kohls for many years, and during my time I worked with many different managers. There were times I absolutely loved working at Kohls and times I hated the job depending on who was the manager."
good,"I worked upstairs primarily, in a warehouse type setting. I would pull products from shelves that were needed to be restocked on the sales floor. I worked usually alone at my own pace.The only downside to it is the temperature. In the summer you would get very hot, no air conditioning upstairs. Then in the winter, you would freeze."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's despite it being a little stressful.  Working in the clothing departments you had to keep the racks clear of clothes by returning them and keeping the folded clothes neat.  I was always on the go which was fine.  Once you had one department under control you started in another and by the time you got back, the racks were full.  It was constant."
good,"Stressful, fast-paced, constantly want you to move on to another project and get things done quick and ""efficiently"" with no help. Management (Area Supervisors) are in charge of the trucks if you have to run freight and are constantly on your tail about getting it finished, moving on, helping other departments. Reaching the sales goal is not as important at this location because we typically hit it easily but there is never enough payroll, hours are cut, there is no help in departments and they become a mess. It is a stressful environment for only getting $11.25 after working there for four years."
good,Feel it was a nice place to work  however did not give enough time for a seasonal employee warning that job was ended . told us that day .training was good but only in your department .
good,"a typical day determines the day of the week, Tues and Thurs a truck comes, overnight team unloads the truck, loads it all u boats and z bars to be pulled onto the floor for the daytime crew to unload."
good,To great the customer and balance my work. Theft customer what I learned that are existing.  Management are okay. Work place were fair. Hardest part at Kohls being by yourself and workload were overwhelming.
good,"Like the people, supervisors are great, just no advancement,  been here 8 years and can't seem to get further than what I have been for past 6 yrs...."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,If you have back problems this job will be very difficult. You are typically going to be on your feet for the whole shift. Often times I am clearing out the fitting rooms and will be running clothes all over the store for my shift. The coworkers tend to be really nice and helpful. I had an issue with one of my managers/supervisors. I had to miss several shifts because a) it was not clear how to change my availability so that I didn't have to work on days that I couldn't and b) I was very very sick with the flu. I almost got fired because of that. Some of the managers are very very helpful and all of them will help you out when you're confused. If you are scheduled to close you will most likely not get out on time. Customers tend to be nicer here though because there are a lot of really great deals. If you like to organize or fold this is a super fun job.
good,"You rarely work in the area you are hired for. "
good,"Nice place and hard work,in busy seasons u need to work rally hard,the line never end there..No benefit for employs and minimum paid salary for employ is not enough to take care for the family"
good,"Management don't do their jobs properly, they think they know better than you when you were taught different, expect you to know the store with little training and when you mess up, like to gossip and spread rumors about you when they think no one is listening. Because of their inability to provide for new workers, if they are not particularly fast, smart, over weight, they tend to use offensive names (again behind your back). Some of the long term employees are also rude. We were told the customer comes first, if I stopped my job briefly to help a customer, I would get reprimanded. Several times since working there."
good,"I only worked 8 hours a week. It was boring not an enviroment I wanted to be in for longer than I had to. But, if I needed to I would go back. Everyone was good to me, it just wasn’t my thing."
good,"The company itself has a culture of integrity, fast advancement, and acceptance of others. Unfortunately my particular store has a tendency to push down people who show potential, for fear of losing their own jobs. It is a great place for part time work."
good,"The work environment is fun and active, you are respected by everyone including the management. Everyone looks out for each other. The culture is very friendly. The most enjoyable is creating relationships that I couldn't create at my previous jobs."
good,"I worked there mainly unloading trucks twice a week. It was okay, but I was only there over winter and then they let me go."
good,"it was a nice job to gain experience. was not completely in love with the management, after working there for three years, i needed a change, everything became too repetitive and i felt unfulfilled."
good,I would arrive at work and go clock-in then i would be assigned a side of the store to be the point of sale then i would login on the computer and begin ringing up customers. i would be given a daily goal of credit cards to get people to be approved for.
good,The job is advertised poorly and misleading. Did not expect to be cleaning out messy dressing rooms when I was hired for the beauty department. Not my thing after working in the beauty business for years.
good,"It is a fun place to work but that is about it. the pay is different for every associate. The pay is not the best, plus the hours are terrible. always being told we are short on payroll, however the young kids have more hours than the adults with responsibilities"
good,"its under new management now, so I don't know as much as i used to. The management while i was there was poor. you have 5 different managers, so five different bosses. Very hard to please 5 people who all want different things."
good,I met so many people and made friends with everyone! Unfortunately management was unorganized. I RARELY if ever talk to or was given direction by my supervisor and was trained by other employees at my level as I went a long because training does not prepare you for anything you have to do on the floor.
good,"Kohl's has great benefits and the culture is very family oriented. However, if you seek to move up in the company it could take YEARS. The management style is very micro managed where they do not give you the opportunity to make your own goals. They DID have very competitive bonus's when I started, but those soon went away about 1 year ago.  Make sure to follow the policy VERY CAREFULLY. After 9 years of loyal service I was dismissed for taking a picture of my desk space when my co-workers decorated my desk WITH the approval of my manager. The picture was taken in 2016, I was dismissed in 2018."
good,"Typical retail environment. Can be fun at times but also very stressful. All depends on the store manager. Some great, some horrible. It takes the company too long to get rid of the bad apples."
good,"It's difficult to rate this because I worked in two seperate stores that were vastly different in environment and management. My first experience was, despite the low-pay and pathetic yearly raise, a good one. The managers and other staff were like a family. Everything was well-run, you had a clear idea of what you were supposed to do and were rewarded for hard-work with more responsibility and a chance to move up in the company. Working as a sales associate meant you spent the day folding/picking up clothes on the floor, and cleaning out the fitting rooms. "
good,At work the environment was just very non accepting which made me feel like everything i did was wrong and I also had school early mornings and they would make me stay passed my clock out time which we only had one car and had to give the other people who need the car.v Not very understanding
good,"I was provided a three day training for the job position I held for three years.  Typical day was spent doing time card maintenance, schedules for 50+ people weekly, and light supervisory duties such as giving breaks, counting down cash registers and working in the cash office.  The workplace culture was a mixed bag of emotions at all times. The hardest part of the job was watching fellow employees being treated badly and ridiculed by management. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day.  This job provided an income that was fair and allowed me to still be an involved parent with my young children."
good,"Busy and fast paced environment ."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This job is quick paced and often wants you to complete multiple tasks by the end of your shift which isn't necessarily a problem but is stressful and annoying when you are the only one working in two departments. I loved the people I worked with and most of the managers. I didn't appreciated it when two of my managers were breathing down my neck about having the two departments perfect despite being the only one who worked the departments and at part time.
good,"-A typical day at work involves working the sales floor, assisting customers, and running register when needed."
good,"Working here was terrible, but it was not beneficial. Lack of benefits, flexibility, steady hours, and passive aggressive management makes the good people that work there just not worth the meager pay they provide. Work here if you need a quick job to fill the void, just don't fall into the trap of staying."
good,"A seasonal job as Kohl's was not all that I expected it to be. While it was good for the money, other than that, it wasn't the most enjoyable job. Most of the time it's fast paced and all about getting customers through a line and making credit sales. The managers however were super nice and willing to help out if you had trouble in the job. To someone who likes boring retail work, this might be the job for you, but I wouldn't return myself."
good,"My experience with Kohls was not that great. They threw us into training, I wouldn't even call it that, by putting us at a cash register and making us figure it out. There's so much wrong with how Kohl's is managed."
good,"If you aren't liked by managers, you get no hours. There are some weeks where you don't even get any hours. Management does not care about employees, just numbers."
good,"I am no longer working for Kohl's but i enjoyed working for them part time because I also worked a full time job during the day. It was a pleasant environments with different people with various personalities. I enjoyed being busy all day long and performed various duties throughout the day from sales, stocking, pricing, bill pay, balancing registers at the end of the evening and locking up the store."
good,Working at khol's has been an experience. It helps in learning how to handle tough situations with customers. The work isn't too demanding and can be good for any person to work in temporarily. If looking for advancement best look elsewhere.
good,Great starting job in a fast paced and friendly environment. You are always offered extra help if you are in need of it and it has good hours available to those who want to work.
good,"it is hard to advance, and if you do the compensation is not sufficient.  Employee concerns are not addresses, and hard work is not appreciated.   The benefits are good, but the pay and bonuses are below average."
good,This was a great place to work at if you are in College. They tend to work with your college schedule and makes it easy to focus on school. On top of that they train you in multiple areas so you become a jack of all trades
good,"They have high expectations that are That unrealistic at times. Although it is a production job, you aren't paid on production. But they use production to right you up. When you talk to some of the Supervisors, they brush the issue off. They is no room for advancement.  Advancement is becoming a problem solver 6 months. There is no median between management and employees. There is no follow up or grading scale for the employees about the immediate Supervisor. I wasn't a part-time or seasonal associate, so I'm not speaking from 6 month to a year frame of mind. I'm speaking from a 5 year plus mindset. If you need a job, work there. Let this be a short-term job until you find something better. You can get caught up with the schedule and the flexibility to be. The benefits are great."
good,"Working at Kohls, although not required for my position-I wore designer dress clothes & shoes every day. I was trained to work in every department, so although I was a fine jewelry key holder, I was given the opportunity to work in other areas of the store when jewelry was not busy."
good,It was good work experience. I think that the workers are under paid and it is very competitive. The managers for the most part are motivating and give good direction.
good,"Seasonal retail - it's almost become a cultural rite of passage. "
good,"Definitely did not enjoy the pressure of having to sell credit to the customers, they tended to get very annoyed"
good,"It was somewhat boring, not enough to do when store was not busy.  Staff was pleasant to work with, customers were at times rude and hard to work with."
good,Fun people that work there but leaders and upper managment are rude. Not many opportunities for hours besides once a year. Clean and great breakrooms.
good,"Overall working for Kohl's was a good experience, employees had fun working together. The new store manager was not so friendly. I learned alot about retail."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working with your co-workers and most of the Management at Kohl's made it a wonderful part-time position.  However, these employee's are working with the public (and most of time like 90% of it) the public is wonderful.  You do have that other 10% that you should be given a large bonus...the discounts help though!"
good,This job was ok for someone who is solely depending on one job all that it really consist of was stocking and helping the customers with what they where looking for.
good,"The job is more stressful than need be. If you work retail you are required to work Thanksgiving,Black Friday and the day after Christmas. If you call off do not bother going back because you will be fired."
good,"Not a very social environment - all about doing the job and nothing else."
good,"They weren’t as understanding to other associates other than their favorite associates. fast paced environment. when they say jump, you have to jump.."
good,Working at Kohl's was an okay job. The management was pretty poor and we were all given limited hours but they paid on time so I guess it was okay. There was a simple balance between quick and slow pace as everyone knows. Would I go back? Probably not but its a GREAT place to shop and they have good deals.
good,"Kohls is a good company to work for, only main problems are that career advancement is specified for the cliques, and suck ups, and the benefits as well as pay, are completely inadequate for this day and age (most of the time minimum wage, for a lot of work)."
good,"Constantly changing policy and procedures with in short time frames. Specific schedules to work. Management was the worst, made rules up As they go. Company could careless about personal life which made finding to work and actually enjoying it a problem."
good,I was hired as part -time but was given full-time hours without the full-time benefits.  This place was more intended for teenagers/young adults.  If you wanted a promotion you had to prove to be one their top sales associate and sign as many people for their store credit card.
good,Kohl's retail store is no different than any other retail. There are caddy employees and favoritism. The pay was low and eventually hours get cut. Most of the time the store was under-staff and energy spread thin.
good,"Kohl's is very laid back and very upbeat work environment, however, it is not meant for me. I dreaded putting away clothes because I never knew where things were and didn't know where half the items went. Customers at the Kohl's I worked at were very rude and expected things to be handed to them. Management was friendly, however, they lacked on giving appreciation and positivity. They were also VERY demanding at times."
good,I did seasonal work here for a number of years but never had much of an impression of the place. The employees didn't seem to talk to each other much and management was never really around. I was forgotten about many times when I was there. Sometimes they'd tell me to go fold a rack of clothes then they'd forget about me. A full shift there felt like it went on forever.
good,"I learned how to sort, scan and package material. Learned to work at a fast pace. I did mandatory 12 hour shifts. Learned how to operate a forklift machine"
good,"Great first job for teens and college students. The pay will not cover any major responsibility's or bills, but for a side job the salary would be enough."
good,"- Challenging work environment "
good,Very fast pace. They have a good discount for the employees. On your feet all the time. Nice clean environment to work in. Not a very flexible schedule.
good,"Schedule is set and as fulltime in management, there really is no flexibility when taking time off or being sick. Management team not all on same page and it becomes confusing for associates."
good,It was a seasonal job. Very hectic and not fun. They basically had me work the dressing rooms for womens and teens. Would barley get any help working the dressing room.
good,"Easy traditional retail job, but became difficult to balance school and having another job when management wanted employees to be more available. Customer Service was the hardest part about the job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Work environment is good.  Very few full time employees. Mostly part time employees and seasonal employees hired.  Working hours are good and flexible.
good,I started at Kohl's as a way to earn a little bit of money while going to school full time.  I was tasked with responsibilities I did not expect as a temporary employee.  I was kept on as a regular employee and slowly worked my way up to supervisor with more responsibility.  Kohl's was a great way for me to make a little bit of money and get my foot in the door with some retail experience.
good,"I was one of the people on the floor, folding clothes and trying to help customers find things. They gave us all some safety videos but didn't really give us any pointers on how to help the customers. "
good,"There is not enough people to get the work done. As a manager I feel that my concerns are not addressed."
good,"The people of Kohl's are nice and care a lot about their obligations to customers and other employees. However, so many changes made to cut the overall costs made it impossible to maintain the level of service the team wanted. As result, hours worked went up, stress levels went through the roof and poisoned the atmosphere."
good,"Am able to work in any department and am familiar with the quirks of each.  Prefer projects when there is no specific work to be done, but zone so as not to remain idle if no set work is provided."
good,"I worked at Kohls in the early 00's. I was a rep in the Juniors dept. I mainly worked alone,keeping the area clean,refolding clothes,helping customers. Sometimes I had a second employee helping. I mostly loved my job. I was hired on for seasonal during Sept but was made permanent part time after. I ONLY worked in the dept until they decided the day after Xmas to put me on the return register. I had never been shown anything on a register so I tried my best but I had a customer complaint bc she had wanted the money on a card and not a cash refund. So I actually got in trouble for that...even though I hadn't been trained and the lady had not informed me of her preference. Hours after the season went down to around 8 a week. I ended up having to quit bc I moved two hours away and the management really didn't help me be placed at a store in the Greensboro area. I applied to work at Kohls again a few years back. It had changed SO Much. I was hired on for the Women's dept....which also covered all of housewares,children's and seasonal. That is half that huge store! But somehow you are also responsible for making sure there is no theft! You also were to be available to cover the register. So...basically they took away the jobs of 4 people and put it on one rep...and still priced that position at minimum wage. Ridiculous. Training consisted of hardly anything. I folded towels for 5 hours one day and then they wanted to hand me over to yet another dept with no training in THAT dept at all. Most of the employees I came into contact with talked about how great the company USED to be. It's"
good,Working with the public can be quite difficult. It became harder to work their as the hours were cut. Knowing that there are retail other jobs out there that pay more than what I am making makes it harder to stay
good,"Fast pace, Great Co-workers. Worked for the Alhambra and Downey location. Learned multiple job. Flexible with hours. Paid weekly and have great benefits"
good,"At $9 and hour, it's more geared to highschoold students.  You don;t get many hours except for during the Thanksgiving and Xmas holidays.  I dot feel there is much room for advancement.  Management at my current store are not  very helpful and the store doesnt supply you with the headsets, bluebirds needed to efficiently do your job."
good,I did a good job here at Kohl's department stores however I was not able to obtain the necessary hours and career goals here. I did get along well with the employees here during my years here.
good,Employees aren't treated and recognised induvidually for hard and good work. Management is horrible and getting their job done. For the past year the schedule never comes out on time like it used too.
good,"This company wasn't a bad place to work. There was always so much to do that the shifts just flew by. However this job may be more desirable to those looking for part time work. "
good,A typical day at work is busy helping customers return and buy the merchandise.  I've learned quite a lot about dealing with different personalities and being able to handle situations in a calm manner.  The culture was diverse but friendly.
good,"Didn't like working here to much, it was super busy of course it was around Christmas time but ppl are so messy and destructive. None of the coworkers wanted to help me, except one lady from a different store. I was new , I needed help."
good,"Constant cleaning and moving. A day would consist of cleaning my area and helping customers with a smile on my face no matter the situation, as, well as stocking and organizing shelves and backroom. I would be called back and forth from each side of the store always doing something for someone else."
good,"I had the ability to cover every position on the floor, so I was able to pick up lots of shifts, typically working 50+ hours a week. I cover the customer service desk mostly as no one liked it and I was good with dealing with people. "
good,"My typical day consisted of helping at the cash register, working the sales floor by folding and picking up, and cleaning up the fitting rooms. Occasionally would help at customer service for returns or do overnight stocking or price changes."
good,"This is the kind of job that you keep untill you find something better. Dont get me wrong its not a bad place to work, but it isn't a career maker. The Employee discount is a plus."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoy working when it's busy. When it slows down and you have straightened and folded everything the day is very long."
good,low wage job unless you're in upper management but aside from that it's a good job if you're new to the work force or need a job in-between jobs or as a 2nd job. They work with your schedule to keep you in the hours that you need.
good,"It's not the best company to work for in retail. From my experience, some managers never keep a promise or is always late on doing somthing. There will always be that one or two managers who are fun and great to be around because of their mood. But others we tended to stay away from."
good,Started working here as a seasonal sale associate full time. Once the holidays were over they kept me and worked with my school schedule. A very great place to work!
good,Every day was busy and filled with work. A lot of silliness with workers being childish. Not a terribly serious work environment. Not much opportunity to grow.
good,Low pay fun people advance quickly just a job not to great not to bad I am filling up one hundred and fifty characters now by writing words in this box
good,"A typical day was cleaning and restocking shelves and racks. Made sure clothes were in correct place, dressing rooms were clean and all areas kept tidy. I also worked as a cashier when lines got too long or during rush hours."
good,i enjoyed my co workers and the opportunity to work in ll aspects of retail- from unloading trucks to merchandising. Very little opportunity for full time or better pay.
good,"I was very proud to be working for Kohl's, i think the Company as a whole, does a lot of great work for the community on a philanthropic level. They actively recruit associates to get together and volunteer in the community and support local organizations in our free time. Big Green initiative, and rewards associates accordingly for giving back."
good,"Kohl's is a good store.  It has a lot of good quality products at reasonable prices.  The customer service is great because of the ""Yes, We Can!"" attitude."
good,Busy environment especially during sales and holidays. Deal with rude customers that demand their discounts. Easy to level up. Co-workers were cool and kept work fun.
good,working overnight is a tough shift.  It was very fast paced but the nights went by fast.  Always had a a lot of fun working the the people on my shift and made a lot of friends.
good,I worked here as a second job.  very friendly place.  flexible schedule. pleasant atmosphere.  management was very easy to get along with.  they treated everyone the same regardless of your position with the company.
good,"The work is not hard, you do not work everyday. Also you don not get as many hours as you may want. The new members of Kohl's get all the working hours and you only work 4 to 6 hours a day."
good,"We started our job at six in the morning, we unloaded the truck, separated  the merchandise, put the merchandise in its proper place, and then take it out to the sales floor.  All employees working together as a team is awesome, we would get the job done quicker."
good,"I worked for Kohl's for about 10 years. Great people, everything else was very stressful and frustrating. No matter what your position or title was, unless you were a manager, you were basically on fitting room and return duty all day."
good,Kohl's is a starter job.  There is not much opportunity for advancement unless you plan on staying for a really extended period of time.  The hours are basic and rarely get over 25+
good,This is a good place to work if you need quick money and don't have any kids or a family. It is hard to work for them cause the management was horrible and always made me feel weird.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls has a great team to work with. Many associates have been there for years and we have formed a strong bond and work ethic together. I have learned that every piece of the puzzle makes everything flow and all the pieces need to be there for everything to be functional or the whole operation falls apart. Management expects the senior associates to keep the new associates in check and gives new associates little training before sending them to the floor which was difficult and confusing for senior associates.
good,Working during the Christmas season allowed for me to purchase gifts for friends and family at reasonably reduced employee prices. The credit card Support Center was least than effective unfortunately- having entered permanent address information personally in the obtainment of 30% a bill was never sent for payment due until a late fee had accrued. The conclusion in settling the bill left a sour taste in my mouth for the company at large.
good,"the work was pretty strait forward, as was the pay. 3rd shift unloading trucks, nothing that crazy. It was a paycheck for the holiday season. Not much else to say."
good,"Kohl's is great place to work. Can sometimes depend on your team/leadership and the decisions they make, but overall not too bad. Great place to start your career. Given a lot of responsibility very early on usually with a lot of room to grow."
good,I was hired in as a cashier/floor associate. I went through 3 days of computer training and shown how to fold cloths and perform recovery. I folded clothes 95% of the time at that job.
good,"Only there briefly, people were nice, i was real sick, so just surviving shifts. It was nice working half as cashier and half fitting rooms, so part of your shift you are social, get to talk with people as you check them out, then the other part you are organizing and don't have to be super social, extroverted and just do your thing. I like hworking half and half in a shift."
good,"Organized, friendly co-workers, orientation was easy to follow, store was kept clean, lunch room was nice, close to eateries for lunch breaks, lockers in lunch room was nice too."
good,Very petty coworkers with barely any chance to advance. Managers are nice but favoritism is common. Biggest downside is having to push credit cards on a goal.
good,"Working here was a good learning experience. Hours were not good, no work/life balance because due low hours. management was good. fellow employees good, just low hours even for a seasonal position."
good,"The retail world is changing.  Stores are putting a lot of ""buy online pick up in store"" options.  It's time consuming and payroll even is never close to enough so salaried managers end up working 60 or more hours per week."
good,Low salaries and high attrition rate. Limited training with limited opportunity for advancement or growth. Good for summertime job or short term employment.
good,"Great place to work, associates work together in a good atmosphere. Sometimes it's hard to understand why Kohl's is hiring when you only get 5 hours for the week, and been an employee for 10 years. There is a big turnover at Kohl's and most associates continue to look for other employment or work 2 jobs. The management team seems to hand pick and use favoritism to those who advance. But I enjoy my work mates and the pleasure of helping customers.                                   Cartersville, Georgia (store # 1091)"
good,long but goes fast and the supervisors rarely know whats going tell its too late.Management is always a day behind on whats going on and the regular employees know more about what is going in then upper managment.
good,"It was a fine job, co-workers stuck to themselves, I got fired over missing days the didn't tell me I had. I asked for the days off, got them then got fired."
good,"It was okay. We had decent break times. When it came to your personal life, management didn't care, as long as it meant they were getting money in their pockets and numbers/reviews looked good. Got upset when I needed to go home cause I threw up in the restroom and when i had a family emergency and called out."
good,"The place was a great first job, but i do not think I would have stayed there longer than i did. It was very hard to talk to most management, and some of the workers that I shared shifts with were hard to connect with and even shut me out completely."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Kohl's.  The coworkers were great people, but the management was lacking.  There were four managers in the store I worked at, and nobody could get along together.  There were days where two managers would yell at each other over the headset we had to wear.  I actually had a customer ask me what was going on because they could hear the two managers yelling."
good,"Retail is a ever changing job. With the seasons and trends things are always coming and going. You had to be able to balance getting new product on the floor, the old off and provided customer service on a daily basis. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyed my career at Kohl's until several Sr. VPs left the organization.  The culture and direction of the of the business changed.  The organization is more focused on the business and not the people who support the business.
good,They did not give enough hours. Also the amount of work that need to be done did not equal up to the pay. Some of the co-workers were not the most pleasent people to work with. A typical day consist of being at work at 7 AM until 5PM. During that time I was sorting out orders. There were two breaks during the shifts.
good,"this place no place to build a future, but it is not bad for temp work. they will cut your hours at the drop of a hat and force over time during peak season."
good,"The days I am usually working at Kohls, it is very understaffed, leaving many people as the only ones in their departments. I find this difficult, being as it is a large store and the holiday season."
good,Descent place to work during season.  Terrible opportunities off season.  Inconsistent management goals.  Inadequate overall supervision and/or direction
good,"Typical job was to help field technicians on the phone with wifi / router issues. I also made schedules for deployments but was primarily stationed in one room. Most nights I only worked with a handful of others in the same room, and I would leave when they started night shift."
good,It was a good 10 years of my life. Friendly but fast worked environment. I would work there again if I wasnt so far. I will move back soon and will reapply.
good,Stressfull at times. Policies for handling customer concerns and performance evaluations were constantly changing. Scheduling for work life balance needs improvement.
good,"You are a person that wears many hats and are cross-trained in all departments.  This is merchandising, problem-solving, mark-downs and cleaning fitting rooms and customer service."
good,"You were never bored at work. Typical day at work consisted of doing go back from fitting rooms, customer service, and registers. Cleaning out fitting rooms as well as picking up clothes off the floor and hanging them up or folding them and putting them away. Hanging up clothes that were left on top of racks. pushing in hangers so they are not sticking out of the racks. Getting backup on registers."
good,"Sales Associate position was required to manage the fitting room, sales floor, the register, and customer service.  I learned about patience and working in a fast pace environment.  The management was probably the most difficult task of working because, there was a lot of communication errors with the managers themselves.  The best part was working with my co-workers, there's an understanding with certain coworker that came to work and get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The hardest part was also the limit of staff and the overwhelming of not having anyone's help.  Sometimes we would get stuck on register for an hour and then return to a packed and overfilled fitting room.  Once again my most enjoyable part were my coworkers the joy and camaraderie spirit made everything seem possible."
good,"I somewhat enjoyed working for kohl's ,the job itself was easy to learn not much to it. A typical day at work was always busy with customers . Management was always friendly and some coworkers were friendly others were not."
good,"If you like working retail this is not the company to work for. The management staff is extremely unprofessional. They don't promote based on who can do the job the best. They promote based on who they like they best. They tell their employees to do things against company policy and then they will fire you for it. And they deny telling you to do it. And if you contact the corporate office about it, they will do NOTHING! The pay is not based on experience. Your starting wage is minimum wage and you don't get increases that make much difference. "
good,"Okay place to work if you just want a little extra money. Poor compensation is by far the worst part of a position at the Kohl's stores.  Also you have to plan your life around them, as they schedule your shifts by the week.  A good store manager can make a big difference, which  was lacking when I moved on. The In-store discount is the best part of employment with Kohl's. Issues you will have to deal with are: rude customers that tear up an entire section within minutes, people who leave arm loads of clothing inside out & on the floor of the dressing rooms, customers returning items that they know they did not buy from Kohl's in the first place, and needing to cover the entire floor on your own due to others calling in."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a wonderful learning experience.  The hours were hard to keep because you worked mornings, evening and weekends.  I learned about retail, sales, inventory and how to apply make-overs for women ages 14-65.  My co-workers were pleasurable to work with."
good,"For a basic part time job it isnt bad however they hire alot of people so staffing is always changing. The Managment is amazing and great people, the people who have been there a long time are great however you see alot of people come and go."
good,"The atmosphere is generally casual and relaxed, but sometimes things happen. I.e- there are some scheduling snafus and people are always asking me to take their shifts or switch with them, which becomes a pain. Some of the management is lazy, which is hypocritical because that particular person expects a lot from others, yet will not do the same, or meet those same high expectations he imposes on others. Another issue I have is that Kohl's is not efficient or customer friendly in that there shouldn't be six registers open, and still have an insane line. That's why we can never get anything done."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Kohls. I liked the co workers, and most of the management at the floor level were very helpful, and let me do my job. Although sometimes it meant losing one of their valued employees to theft. The upper management was, and to this day, is still the problem with that entire Loss Prevention dept. They give you so many other jobs, while wanting you to keep your eye on the subjects inside the store, that you end up missing some very large theft cases. Which results in them asking you why you didn't catch the theft in progress. They also have certain policies for certain employees. The others are held to a higher standard.  This was the main reason that Kohls has lost some very valuable team members in their loss prevention dept."
good,It was a bad environment. Not the most helpful managers who really couldn't relate to what we where doing. The co workers where nice but very temperamental all discussed openly how much they loathed the job which made it a harder place to work in. The systems we received would not work properly which made are jobs a lot harder when 100 percent of the work was done with computers and multi-line phone.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's Department Store used to be a fun, reliable place to shop with high quality merchandise and plenty of staff to assist customers. Corporate has cut staff, stocked the store with cheap, poorly made merchandise, cut payroll and benefits for most employees. They have done severe damage to their brand and reputation with these moves."
good,"I enjoyed the customers and co-workers. Greeted and helped customers. worked with merchandise. handled paperwork, money deposits and ordered money for the store. cashiered. price checked. Answered phones."
good,"Workload is difficult because there are often not enough people scheduled to work on a daily basis, but it is clear that everyone is passionate about customer service and making sure the customer gets what they need and want."
good,"Upon beginning my employment with Kohl's Corporation a typical work day was anything from going in to unload the freights early in the morning, stocking the shelves and merchandising, or cashing out satisfied customers.  Since beginning employment management has changed drastically, my co workers and I feel as a whole that we are being talked to with a lack of respect, but it doesnt stop us from going in and completeing the tasks at hand with a smile."
good,the management sucks. do not know how to schedule employees. the plus side is they have a laid back kind of work style. i worked there for 6 months and the managers still didn't  know my name.
good,"Younger associates try to tell people what to do"
good,"It can be very hectic depending on what day it is and what kind of sales and coupons we have out. We are understaffed most of the time, so keeping up with everything can be difficult. I learned to try and not let the small things worry me and to keep a calm head in the throws of chaos. My co-workers are awesome, we have a wonderful team here. Management is okay. There is one specific manager who isn't very good at her job, and has caused quite a few good workers to quit because of it. Other than that though, Kohls is a great place to work. The hardest part of the job is when you have to deal with a difficult customer. Keeping your cool while someone yells at you for something that isn't your fault can be pretty difficult, but it is a good character builder. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of family we have with our co-workers."
good,They stopped having consistent hours and promoted people who quit and came back. The previous salesperson would make up excuses on doing they're job and receive no disciplinary actions.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, efficient, and cohesive. This company prides itself on teamwork and it is surely a component of being an employee. I learned how to multitask, complete projects proficiently within certain time measures, and how to work with others to reach one main goal. Management was dependable and always granting positive reinforcement to employees. Co-workers are friendly, and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job would be helping other employees with tasks, and completing yours as well. The most enjoyable part would be after completing everything as a team."
good,"Co-workers were great, very friendly easy to talk to. Envirnment was very high pace almost every single day and can be very stressful. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be the team work."
good,"A typical day at work depending on what department you are in, in my department I basically check out customers and bagged items and when slow I recovered the department I was in such as Misses, Mens, etc. I learned Point-of-Sale system operation. Management was management making sure you were doing your job correctly. Co-Workers were nice except for a few. Hardest part of the job was sucking up to management because they only trust a few of the workers there and they will fire whoever their friends say isn't good enough. And they will not stop talking about CREDITS... even though 99% of the people coming through the door already have a Kohl's Charge. Most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers definitely made the job easier."
good,"my task were easy to  catch on. I love the fact that you get to move up quickly. diverse work staff. helpful management. Ill say the hardest thing about this job is cleaning the fitting rooms, because it can get really full fast."
good,"I was surprised to find out Kohl's hourly pay. I stock and organize the whole shoe department. I also do cashier as needed. The most important point is customer service. It does not matter what you may be doing, but what the customer needs is your first priority. I love working with people."
good,"if you are looking to be a cashier and love handling people, this place is good. There were many times you have to deal with crabby attitudes whether from co-workers or customers."
good,Managment obviously varies from store to store. It is a fun easy going environment and a great first job for a teenager. Relaxed dress code and very understanding of tattoos and piercings.
good,Kohls was a good job.  I worked overnight setting the new sales.  I wasnt too happy when they switched to digital signs because that meant I was out of a job.
good,I enjoyed my experience there but would have liked to work longer to have a better judgement of the company. From what I did experience it was a very positive work environment.
good,"Kohls is a very nice place to work with some okay benefits, but they "
good,Working here is quite fun with the people and the laid back nature of the management team. The one pitfall would be that the hours will be cut sporadically.
good,"The store I worked at was alright, I don't remember much because it was the holiday season and it was hectic, but it was just a secondary job to supplement my income, so it served its purpose"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I was hired in at Kohl's as a seasonal basis only. I knew when I was hired in it was just through the New Year. It was a very fast paced job that required one to be available 10 hours a day 5 days a week. We were very busy as it was the Christmas season and our job was to fulfill orders placed on Kohl's.com
good,They hourly wage is really low and they dont pay you enough for all the hard work you do. Very short shifts and dont give you many hours. Sometimes flexible with schedules. No paid time off. The pros are I had very good co workers. The cons are no advancement and the salary.
good,"This was a part-time job, weekdays in the evenings after I had already worked all day at my full-time job with the State, and one or both days on weekends.  I might have been tired when I drove to the store/job, but when I got inside, I perked up.  The people who worked there were usually quite nice, and the store atmosphere was bright, with attractive merchandise and a lot of work to do to make the time go fast.  I worked in the shoe department, which, other than possibly the customer service desk, was the busiest department in the store, and I worked and walked a lot.  In face, I got plantar fasciitis from all the walking on the concrete floors there.  But, I sure bought a lot of shoes, and I had never been much of a shoe-person before.  Unfortunately, also, I bought a lot of shoes, but since I had that second income, I could afford them, and knew when the big sales were."
good,My day would start out as a cashier helping the customers find items or just fold clothes. The hardest part of this job was that the pay was low and it was only seasonal. I always enjoyed talking with the customers.
good,Love working with people with different personalities. Enjoy making others feel comfortable and satisfied. Setting a goal everyday and set out to accomplish it at the end.
good,"Nice Place to work part time. No full Time work,Coworkers are great, I do Three Different jobs.I provide great customer service ."
good,"A team oriented company that engages their employees in every aspect of production, including motivational meetings at the beginning of every shift and stretching is a must to start the work day/night. The hardest part was trying to meet your daily production percentages when there wasn't enough work to go around. The company did offer small perks to boost moral including weekly raffles and company provided lunch during the holiday peak. Overall my experience was good, only bad for me would be the travel."
good,it was a fun intense work place4. field with highs an lows but what company isn't field with those. it helped me become more patient and understanding. i loved getting to hang out with my employees and expanding my experience .
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the part where I get paid. A typical day at work starts with me doing what I need to do, and then promptly getting belittled shortly into my shift. A lot of things come down on me because I am young. I learned a lot of skills, such as inventory and backstock. I can ship orders. My coworkers are relatively friendly, but majority of them don't really pay attention. Not many of them know my name, and I've been there for a year. The hardest part of my job is keeping my composure. I get a lot of criticism for things that are not really my fault."
good,"Being the beauty lead was a lot of fun, bringing in a lot of new faces and a lot of great opportunities, including an all-expense paid training expo trip to Orlando. It was a job that I absolutely loved doing. However the management seemed confused about their roles and didn't care to resolve issues within the store. Everyone there is friendly however, and will listen, even if nothing is done to resolve the issue at hand. Hardest part of the job would have definitely been running your own department for the most part, because it was brand new and many of the managers and fellow employees didn't know how to help. Most enjoyable part of the job was definitely doing something creative and working with clients - range between teenagers to the elderly - and helping them leave with a smile on their face no matter what."
good,"Personally, this is a 'first job' place. Unless you plan on making it a career, and kissing butts, you will have a hard time advancing. My store was so much fun to work at though, and since I helped open the store from Day 1, we were like one big family. But the hours are short and you make just enough to get gas to go to work some weeks."
good,"Never in my life have I worked anywhere I ever been so emotionally drained. Customers feel entitled, and are very rude when they have a coupon. The coworkers are great people to work with though. Management has their days, but hey a job is a job"
good,"like working with people"
good,"I currently am a customer service representative and I really enjoy my job and the people I work with. It is ,although, not a career choice for me."
good,Clock in at my assigned time and go to my cashier station. I would continue to check out customers and help answer there questions till either it was time for me to leave or to take my break / lunch. Then do it all over again
good,"I learned how to merchandize, use a RF unit, back stock and replenish items in the stockroom and sales floor. I also learned how to deal with overtly obnoxious customers. Management is extremely patient and flexible."
good,"part of management, resposible off kids, houseware, shoes, and seasonal. floor plans, planograms, training, run register, open/close store, stock floor, off load trucks, verife deposit for bank"
good,"Hired as a Picker .  Was un aware of Flexible hours at the time of hire.  Work was your responsibility.  You clocked in and picked your hand held order finder and went straight to work .  Sometimes after you start an area you could be pulled for another area at any given time.  Breaks were done on time via buzzer and return was via buzzer.   Must be able to stand at all times and light weight at all times. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's as a department store has great merchandise at a great value, with lots of promotions for savings. A typical day as a Misses Department supervisor was spent cleaning out dressing rooms, working the cash register, putting out stock, changing signage, and taking markdowns, etc. The way the store operates is different from other retailers I had worked for, where I had more responsiblity being a department supervisor, such as scheduling and training my staff. At Kohl's you are just a ""glorified"" hourly salesperson, They really don't offer much customer service which is why I preferred working as the jewerly department manager becuase I got to have more interaction with the customers."
good,"I typically tidied up the Misses Department, attending fitting rooms and the sales floor. I was frequently called to Point of Sales to assist customers during their transactions."
good,Typically day at work was to load and unload stuff. Clean and restock merchandise. Hardest part of the job is not falling asleep.
good,"I loved Kohls! I was a cashier and credit solicitor. So I rang out many people a day and signed them up for Kohls charge cards and our promos .  I learned the importance of a smile and great attitude there it makes a huge difference in the customers response to you . Hardest part of the job was learning to cope with the favoritism at the job as far as employees . The managers had their set group of ""go-to"" people and they had been there for 5-10+ years . But all in all I enjoyed working there and the discount I got."
good,"i had a lot of fun the first few months i was there , however once your managment teams sees how good you are at certain things it becomes over powering and stressful, they took advantage of me knowing i could get alot of incentives and pretty much decided that i would be the one that would get them as many incentives as possible because i was good at it but also because they didn't rely on the other part of my team, and never pushed them as hard."
good,"Great people there to work with, but not enough planning with hours and department shifts. Some management could improve with how they handle their employees, and tasks."
good,"its just a typical day at work, balance well with lifestyle, not very many promotions, or opprotunity to move up. Management really tries to be flexible with your schedule."
good,"This is part time position and I work mostly at the cash registers"
good,"Enjoyed my time there, I enjoyed each and every customer i helped. Would love to work there again. Some manger was a wonder to work with"
good,I started as a full time employee and worked up to supervisor in just a couple years. I went back to school and Kohl's worked with my schedule.
good,Typical day at work is okay. I try and reach all my goals get upset when its not met. Some of my co-workers are fun to work with and great friends. Others they're okay. Hardest part of the job for me is to reach credit goals. I ask every customer but you can't make them get a card if they don't want one. Its frustrating when I don't make my goals. Most enjoyable is when I do make my goals.
good,"All about the numbers and catching shoplifters.  Extreme pressure is placed upon LP personnel.  Always telling LP that more number of shoplifters is needed, but lack of equipment and working alone makes it very difficult."
good,"Very good place for employees with full-time employment. If your employment status is any less than that, you will need another job to support yourself."
good,"If your in need of a part-time no pay but minimum wage for being in school or retired job, here ya go then. Management was great co-workers were fun. Hardest part is multitasking departments and pleasing every customer, but it is possible. Enjoyed regular customers and co-workers."
good,When I work Cash Office. I have about 2 hours to count an balance all the register in the store. Sometime that can be hard to do when 1 or 2 register are short on money. And working at customer service is dealing with many types of people.
good,"Very slow paced job unless working through the seasonal months.. I worked from September-March it picks up through the holidays.. Learned how to operate a cash register, count down money at the end of my shift, and customer service.. The co-workers I worked with here very friendly and willing to help whenever needed.. I didn't really get to close to any of them.. The hardest part was around Christmas and Black Friday.. Most enjoyable was pay raises and employee parties.."
good,"* Loved seasonal trend shopping"
good,Kohl's is a great starter job. Your day would consist in helping customers to the best of your ability while maintaining store cleanliness. You will have to learn how to manage your time very wisely because there is always something that needs to be done. There are a great many personalities at Kohl's that you will have to get used to.
good,"working at kohl's has really allowed me to grow as a person . its fun and especially , when it comes to meeting people and learning techniques that can help me in life . Team work really comes together on a daily basis making sure the job gets done and the management really are great mentors which makes my typical day at work a happy one knowing im behind a great team"
good,"I had a good experience working at Kohl's. The most of the staff was nice and outgoing, others of course were lazy and I would have to do the work for them. We did have flexible hours, and they were able to work around my school. When there was two of us working on the floor it was easier and faster to get the job done. The fitting rooms did get crazy though."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"kohls was a good job with good co workers. management was shaky and they weren't giving hours accordingly, but nevertheless an ok job for being in school."
good,I have been working there for 10 years and help a lot of employees and customers. During my year I had the pleasure to work on every shift
good,Its a lot of fun stealing cars for dealers but long hours and very dangerous
good,"Worker morale is very low, leading to unpleasant conversation and behavior."
good,"I worked a variety of departments so no day was typical for me, which I liked. It kept me busy and interesting not doing the same thing everyday, but we were usually understaffed. I worked with some great people but also with some that that slacked a lot but that's to be expected in a department store. It was hard trying to keep up with managing a department and helping customers when a skeleton crew had you running several at one time and they expected you to help on registers as well. But it did help the day go quickly. The scheduling could be bad as well too, keeping you late at night and then having you open the next morning, and the inconsistency made it difficult to have another job, go to school, or have a social life. I worked there for many years and was never able to make a living wage, but overall I did enjoy my time there, but it was not a career."
good,"most are hired in at min. wage and part time. Good thing is that you can customize your avail hours. Bad thing is that part-time can mean zero hours for a whole week without any notice or explanation.  Another con is that you are asked to do many things that you have not had training on- they do not have a good training system. Plus they hire lots of help during holidays and those who are not holiday workers, lose hours.  A good thing is that you can go to work and laugh. Plus, you leave work with a smile on your face. Co-workers are great and hard workers. I have not seen any gossip or bad mouthing of another coworker. Manager of the store is always avail and very friendly. She can be found out on the floor working with the team almost everyday that she is there."
good,ok place to work for a part time job too many employees to keep the full time status I needed to be able to stay.
good,Would clean fold as much as possible and Managment would never notice it this while working the whole front half of store for a few hours. would cover Men's women's Intimates and youth and petites and never get help when i needed it but i would get sent to help other departments. Co-workers were the best ever.
good,"good teamwork,just overall not happy with rankings,LONG COMMUTE,TOLL TAGS,ETC...."
good,"Typically it was pretty slow at times but always interesting. I learned a lot about makeup and how to apply and sell it. management wasn't very supportive and was kind of like employees versus management, which wasn't always a comfortable environment. I had the best co-workers and friends there, we were always there for each other and had a lot of meet ups after work. the hardest part of the job for me was always feeling watched and afraid to make a mistake. Flexible hours and doing something I enjoyed was very enjoyable."
good,Was a nice hospital with friendly staff.  Everyone is helpful.
good,"Management at Kohls in Burke were very friendly and reasonable. They were well organized and flexible with my personal school schedule. I enjoyed working with Kohls customers and perhaps future ones. One thing I will say that there is little expanding in the workplace. I am all about learning new concepts and skills, little was offered here."
good,"My typical day at work involves bouncing between many different tasks - attendance reviews and payroll, scheduling, filing, responding to emails, receiving mail and telephone calls, and anything else that is asked of me by my supervisor."
good,"Assisting customers, folding clothes, checking fitting rooms, ringing up customers, I learned zoning ,inventory retail, as well as cookware, and house ware. for the most part management was good everyone besides the store manager. my co workers were fun and vibrant people and made my time there worth it. the hardest part was finding merchandise in other stores. the most enjoyable part was the people."
good,It was a great experience to a certain degree. I love some co-workers and how willing they were to help but the management was off a few times. they would lie about the benefits you were going to receive and well that wasn't ok with me.
good,I enjoyed restocking the inventory and helping customers and checking customers out. Management was not very good they had their favorite employees and you never knew from week to week when you would work or how many hours you would have a week or what department you would work in. I like to keep busy and have a steady weekly work schedule and what I will be doing before I come to work. It was a pleasant place to work.
good,"Customer service is great working for people we serve, but the pay is not great for the hours they work you and having to work insane hours on holidays for the lack of pay when it should be with family, its different when you are doing something like saving a person life but shopping is not a life or death situation"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work was handling any point of sale situations with the customers or other employees."
good,Great company to work for ... Many wonderful opportunities for growth for a career in Retail.
good,"Day to Day varies on assignment given, but mostly assisting customer locate items they prefer."
good,Was a good place to earn a little extra money over the summer.
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's because it gives me the opportunity to work on project alone and to grow as an individual. It has also pushed me out of my comfort zone by forcing me to work closely with customers, and train new hires. It is a physically exhausting job, and the constant cleaning up after customers who don't seem to care can  become tedious. However, there are many projects that must be accomplished and it is quite rewarding to see how your project can boost sales. Management is overall very good. There is some favoritism that goes one, and the cashiers always seem to get more credit, and hours than anyone else. But besides those two things I have no real issues regarding the management."
good,"It feels like they schedule me purposely on all holidays! They need two weeks notice for days off, which sucks because sometimes you don't know what days will be needed off 2 weeks before. Low pay, the raise each year is less than 10 cents! Hours are cut all the time, sometimes you only work 4.5 hrs a week. Understaffed the majority of the time and they wonder why service scores are so low sometimes...We CAN'T do everything. The Buena park store is a busy store compared to others so we always do have a lot more work and they expect us to do great floor recovery, fitting rooms, back up registers, take calls/help customers when 90% of the time its only 1 associate per department having to do all that. I give it 3 stars because your co-workers is what really gets you through the day, they know your pain. If you plan to apply, let Kohls be your LAST option!"
good,The management was my issue. They typically were power hungry and belittled you ever chance they got and usually if they did something you didn't like you got fired and didn't acknowledge any accomplishments from employees. I'm sure its not every Kohls though. They thing that kept me there for so long was my coworkers.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's involves keeping the fitting rooms clean.  As for myself, I work the fitting rooms while doing the work that is expected to be done by the department supervisor."
good,My experience with working at Kohls was awesome. Dealing with the aftermath after my seasonal job was over has not been pleasant.
good,A Great work place for students and or those who need summer jobs. Khols is not a job for someone trying to make a living and possibly a career.This was just a job.
good,Retail has it's ups and downs and Kohl's is a popular retailer. The work environment was typical and the employees were friendly. But the focus on selling and driving credit and the way the hours and scheduling works is crooked.
good,I did not like working here.  The management was horrible and very unorganized.  No training.
good,this is another decent place for beginner carrier starters
good,most enjoyable part is some the people i work with and helping the customers .
good,"They have a wonderful CRM program however the Manager of the store was more focused on gaining bonuses from corporate than giving employees more hours to do necessary tasks. Overall friendly environment, great people to work with."
good,"Co-workers and management are nice to work with and is a nice place to work. I learned all the departments and how to work each one. In a typical day, depending on where you work, you are interacting with customers, cleaning the floor, and doing projects."
good,"Working for this company was different from my other jobs, I helped open this location so I learned a lot of new things when it came to retail and sales."
good,Kohls CEO hogs are the money sadley. It took me 5 years to earn from 7.35 to 8.00 an hour.
good,Seasonal employees were very uninformed about being hired and eventually EVERY seasonal employee WAS laid off regardless of skills and points.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Very busy and chaotic but it was worth the experience. It's a great first job for a teenager. Co-workers were always willing to help when needed.
good,I learned how management suppose to treat employees. I enjoyed my co-workers and assisting customers.
good,"Kohl's overall is a really great company. I've learned a lot more about the retail industry and what it really takes to be a great store. But some of the managements expectations for the stores success throughout the day is unrealistic, I've often felt like they wanted you to be superman or wonder woman. Hours during the holidays are excellent and you pretty much bust your behind and work like crazy only to be let down after the holidays to a measly 16-24 hours a week sometimes only getting 8 hours depending on payroll. Co workers are absolute the best people I've worked with at a job in a long time, we often have to put our heads together to work in teams to get things done and I love that people are actually willing to help. Management wise, the store manager is so sweet and actually is physically hands on in helping the team and store succeed, one of the assistant managers is VERY lazy ,she mostly gives orders and has the nastiest attitude and sits in the back office eating and talking on the phone. The other assistant manager is nice, she can be fiesty at times but overall she is pleasant to work with. The other parts Of management like the E3 on duty are all exceptionally amazing people, except one, he has the most nastiest attitude and doesn't know how to talk to people, people constantly complain about him but nothing ever gets done , and he acts like he doesn't know anything but has been with the company for years. I honestly could care less about the pay since I am only using it to pay minor bills while I'm school, but I would appreciate a little more money hourly for"
good,"When I was there, it was an awesome experience. We had a crew that knew each others strengths and weaknesses, and we all got along, so work ""flew"". Down the road, I definitely look back and think of good things, though, I should've took more precautions with wearing a back brace. It was hard work but I loved the fast pace of things."
good,help customers find and look at items. check inventory if customer needs an item not on the floor. run the cashier
good,The center's atmosphere is always inviting and welcoming. My co-workers are always helpful and upbeat.
good,My hard word was generally recognized and I learned many things.
good,"In a day i chasier,take care of customer and put out merchandise. the last seven yrs ive learned some supervisory skills,merchandisier,customer service,replenishment,project management.The people who work there are friendly nd work together very welll. The hardest part of my job was implementing the truck process to unload nd merchandise clothing in one day to the floor. The best part of my job is being in charge of project nd running a team to complete them."
good,"great place to work, good values in a job but the hours they give you are weird. you could work a 1:45-4:15 shift which just a pointless day"
good,It was always busy with lots to do. You needed to stay on the ball constantly or you got behind.
good,it's a good second job but i would not rely on it as your primary source of income
good,"while I was at Kohls I did gain a lot of experience and I loved the people I worked with I didn't really enjoy the people I worked for, the company as a whole isn't very good."
good,A typical day at work would be following up with associates to make sure that we are accomplishing our departments sets and planning for freight to come in. Communication with your team must be spot on because our associates must receive great communication to make sure everything is done on time and we meet our deadlines.
good,"go in do your work and go home, learned that name brand is always that good, management didn't seem to know what was going on, coworkers were ok, the hardest part was lack of direction,enjoyable part was some of the coworkers"
good,At 6 am I would begin by counting all the money from the day before and making the deposits out. I would then open all registers and count the money. All customer service registers had to be set up. And then I would finish my day in customer service. Management was not nice at all. The co-workers are very hard working and they treat you like a family. The hardest part of he job was the way management would speak to people. The most enjoyable part was counting money and dealing with numbers and customers.
good,"If you are used to working in a more professional environment, this is not for you. It's just a typical, low-paying, retail job, with very little training. You are expected to figure things out on your own and then scolded when you do something wrong. Very frustrating way to work. Expected to work at a very fast pace but not told exactly what you are supposed to be doing, If you are lucky you will guess it right, if not, you will hear about it from management."
good,"Assisting customers with in store kiosk and helping them find what their looking for. Answer customer's questions. Refolding clothes, restacking shelves, reorganizing clothes racks. Cleaning out fitting rooms."
good,Great place to work if you dont have a need for a work life ballance.
good,I loved working at all my jobs ! Every job I have had I have learned something that can benift from in life and at the job sits
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"communication problems between coworkers and management, customers were very rude, coworkers were very rude. never wanted to work w someones schdule. Had some good days working there, but wouldnt tell people to apply there"
good,Basically your number one job above all else it to push their credit card. Don't get enough credit apps? you get no hours!
good,"Working at Kohl's helped me be able to talk to many people of different race and culture. I enjoyed being able to be myself with the customers, also since I worked there for so long I knew a lot about my job and was able to help customers more with out having to wait for someone to come explain something. The hardest part of my job was trying to explain things to angry customers who did not believe me and had to wait for a manager."
good,"This job is great for the young, and old.. need to have a tough skin for customers, espicially with Christmas, and how busy they are."
good,Kohls underpays their employees and over works them. they expect way to much in a short amount of time.
good,"The people i worked with at kohls were awesome, our management staff...not so much... cocky and really treat you like dirt, any and everything they can pin on you to get the district manager off their behind they will.Not all management was like this but currently in Orange, CT forget it probably the worst management team possible for a hurting small store."
good,Managers were usually helpful and friendly. Work area was always extremely HOT. Work schedule was basically set in stone. I was given the same closing shift every time I worked and I could never get it changed.
good,"I left kohls for the reasons i stated above. A year and a half of work with no raise, asked for extra hours and I was told no because I couldnt get 5 people per day to sign up for credit cards. Kohls is a bad place to work in the off season."
good,"As a truck unload-er I wasn't on the floor a lot. But the management I dealt with downright insulted me more than once and often called my work ethic into question, and I will not stand for that."
good,good associates. poor management. too much work for the pay.
good,I am just looking to do something a little different. I have a family and was really trying to find a 8-5.
good,"I liked working at Kohl's because you could do something different every day. One day you could be a cashier, the next you could be working in clothing department. I also liked that it was a friendly environment and everyone seemed to enjoy working there."
good,"You get what you put into it. The hours are bad, the pay is bad, but they are flexible around students and working professionals. Great 2nd job."
good,I worked hard and became a supervisor in a few months time but little money. I worked three differtent areas
good,easy job sort hour not to much to offer good first cooperate job
good,"Training programs are always available for the employees, theres on going training for the employees as the business moves forward in their field of sells"
good,"Don't expect to have any free time after this job, after working 10 hours (There's an 8 hour option for college students when given proof). It's a very tedious workplace, you can't change departments as a seasonal so you're stuck in whatever position they gave you until you leave. As a permanent employee,  you need a second job once peak (August- February) ends because regardless of being full time, there isn't much work and they *try* to give everyone at least 30 hours."
good,"Kohl’s wasn’t a bad job, but it wasn’t a good job either. Everyone in the work environment seemed tired and didn’t want to be there and all complained about quitting so it would get negative."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They cram selling credit cards down your throat. You will be required to solicit a certain amount daily, otherwise managers will be down your throat. Some management is more helpful than others."
good,Working at kohl's was engaging. But the management was truly horrendous. They were great with customers but were frequent to throw new employees under the bus when they made a mistake.
good,"Being a cashier at Kohl’s was my first job, and it helped me learn how to communicate and talk to customers in a polite and professional way, and how to handle transactions and money."
good,"Management did a poor job of training new associates and left newly hired  untrained people alone with equally newly hired associates to train each other, communication was inadequate and vague."
good,Most days were slow except when it was a holiday. The hardest part was ensuring shoes were properly fronted. Usually ran the whole department alone so be good at working independently.
good,Young culture with plenty of opportunity to develop and grow. Some work life balance depending on which area you work in. Experience dependent on area you are in and manger you have.
good,My review was very well....although temporary I'm expected to return next year. Management would like to have me return saying I was a hard efficient worker.
good,Working at kohl’s was tiring . It wasn’t for me personally I can’t stand for long amounts of time I like to move around a lot. So if you’re into just standing all the time this is for you
good,I mostly enjoyed working there. They were flexible with me. The hours and pay were the problem. I enjoyed speaking with my co workers. Overall it was not a bad place to work.
good,"It was an average experience. Wasnt a bad or a good place to work once you learned your way around, some of the managment was nice but then other were insufferable."
good,A typical day at work would consist of being at the register and asking each customer to sign up for a Kohl's credit card if they don't already have one.
good,"Kohl's comes with expected retail issues such as grumpy customers & long nights, but it also has a solid schedule, fun coworkers and a positive environment. Could be way worse, really is a pretty good place to work."
good,Pleasant coworkers. Positive environment . Growing experience. Room for enhancement. Personable working towards customer service and welcoming atmosphere along side progressive due diligence
good,"Working at Kohl's is fine. The people are nice enough, and the work isn't bad. Most of the customers are okay. Management typically has a good idea of the realities of the job, and expect you to do your job but don't typically ask too much."
good,"If you have initiative and ability to learn as you go this is a good place to work. Job offers flexible work schedule, but you must be willing to work weekends and holidays."
good,"The managers can be nice except one, kept making me move between departments I wasn't trained in and complained when I didn't do too well. It's pretty hard to work there if you want to be in only one area that you know well and can give great service in. The other employees there are fantastic and sociable. But the best part is, I get good hours, I just want to be in a different workplace. I don't feel like I fit in there anymore."
good,"Very busy environment, always on the go if you work sales. Although, I did enjoy working here, Kohl's needs to recognize their hard working employees, so a little more pay for the hard work would not be a bad idea."
good,"In the years I have worked there I have seen many changes, The older Supervisors are being thinned out to bring in the younger generation, the saying Kohls cares is no longer and the family friendly Kohls does not exist anymore its about sales and numbers, in the past 2 yrs during peak I have seen alot happen that is not giving us a good judgement for who we are working for. The past 2 peaks during employment times the seasonals they are bringing in have just been bodies to fill positions and not reputable to do the job. It is really bad this year as we deal with the seasonals they hired on a day to day process.  Kohls used to be a good company to work for but we are seeing it going into a downhill spiral. Lack of good judgement, hostile work environment ( with the seasonals they hire). and now during break times all those on that shift go at the same time and it has become a crowded chaotic atmosphere, you cannot relax and enjoy your break times because of the noise and crowded break areas"
good,"-15% associate discount (no brand restrictions) "
good,This was a good internship that helped me to learn more about the retail industry and all of the things that go on behind the scenes. Is a great resume builder and can help you to decide if it is what you would like to do with your career.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Weekends are crazy and people can get upset very fast. Long tedious work and weekdays are very slow. People there can be very nice and helpful but management is not ideal
good,"It’s alright, the job isn’t the best and the pay isn’t either. A day at customer service isn’t so bad, it could be slow or consistent, the only issue is the registers would shut down and not work constantly and left with only one register working making it hard to clear the line faster for the customers."
good,"They had to many favoritism, race, and abuse their power. It was finding favor in family and friends. Let go good people that they should have kept and have more understanding. For the person who made schedules always had attitudes plus hires her nephew to even stay there. She wouldn't pay attention to what people wanted days off and would not"
good,Wish they would pay more and offer more hours. The coworkers were awesome. Management was easy to work for. Location was good. The discounts were awesome
good,Stressful and frustrating place to work if you’re in management. Pay can seem low during in comparison to the amount of work required if you want to be successful.
good,"Job was ok, fun group to work with, not enough hours to feel fufilled. Management was ok, typical day would be unloading a.m truck staging merchandise on sales floor, sometimes performing inventory"
good,"But they treat the hard workers bad because they depend on us too much,  while the not so hard works get less work and not have to work as hard as the ones who work hard everday , we also get very little Recognition for what we do after all the hard work"
good,great job for someone looking for flexible hrs and work part time maybe after school job or seasonal work hardest part was keeping floor clean and fitting rooms up to par
good,As a cashier you just stay at the register all day. Managers are constantly on you about getting credit cards. Breaks and everything else are fine. It’s ok for a temporary job.
good,"Must be able to stand on concrete for up to 12 hrs per shift. Lots lots of walking and stairs involved. Mostly a good group of people to work with. Peak (Nov through end of December) can be exhausting, especially if you've never experienced a distribution center in action."
good,"I enjoyed the little time i spent there, but I saw a lot of people get hired and fired in my short time there. They prioritize getting customers signed up for credit cards over employee comfort."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's.I have always worked well with customers and use my sense of humor.I have no trouble starting up a conversation with customers.However,some of the people that worked there did not like me and even one of the managers did not treat me well.I think there was favoritism at Kohl's and I felt like I did not fit in with a lot of the store rules and it seemed like one manager would tell you to do one thing one way and another person would tell you differently.We were told not to use coupons we had at the cashier unless the customer asked or knew but I used them anyway because the customers were so thankful."
good,"It was as a good place to work for a long time. Lately, however, hours of lead positions were getting cut more and more. Help in departments was also being cut. Work loads continued to increase. Raises decreased and disappeared. On a typical day, work to get equipment began before on the clock (if there was any even available).  Once on the clock, people struggled to get breaks, lunch, or go to restroom.  "
good,Overall it was a nice place to work. I received no benefits and the breaks/lunchtime was normal. The manager was relatively nice. The work in and of itself was easy. The girls seemed to get along pretty well. I worked 5am until between 11am and noon.
good,"I made the best of my experience here. I learned Spanish to speak with the many Spanish speakers, I excelled in selling Kohl's cards and I met my AMAZING girlfriend whom I intend to marry!"
good,"I worked at Kohls for a little over a year, and the management were quick to hype you up whenever you did well. However, there was never room for advancement. In fact, my hours were CUT  even though I was one of their best employees and a trainer of new recruits."
good,"A typical ranges drastically dependent on the time of year. Holidays and back to school season sees intense amount of customers while hours are regularly cut all around during summer. Workplace culture is entirely dependent if all the managers get along. I learned a lot, and was able to cultivate many skills. However, there is no stepping stone position before relocation for higher positions or the demand to have a completely open schedule (something unrealistic for parents/students)."
good,"A typical retail job. Expectations high pay low. "
good,"Good and fun to work for but the pay was not great. Usually, there were not enough employees working on the floor. Often, we had to go cover the registers, when the lines got long. There was always something to do. You never had to look for something to keep you busy. The hardest thing to do was, get people to sign up for a Kohl's card. So many people already have them."
good,"I enjoyed being at Kohl’s. The people, customers and management are very kind and caring people. I would just prefer something more in tune with my school and something that pays more."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's not hard work, but experience and work ethic mean very little to being promoted in this company. It's more about how many customer's you can get to open a charge card and how many customer's mention you in surveys. You could get a ton of accolades from customer's in person and manager at store level, but if you don't get credit and surveys then you aren't going anywhere anytime soon."
good,"This workplace trained me for the job. The managers made sure everything went smoothly, they made sure all of their employees were comfortable yet doing the jobs that they had to be doing."
good,"Was able to gain valuable skills, however the workload to pay ratio is not ideal. Management could have been more efficient. More extensive and adequate training should be offered upon hiring."
good,"Great work environment, pay was good, work was moderate. Everyone was nice but the scheduling was a bit sloppy, had to leave because they didn't work with my school schedule."
good,Everyday is the same. At first it was alright but then after 90 days it was so boring but the management was amazing. I learned how to use the register and how to use a blue-bird.
good,"•I mainly work in the shipping department where I load packaging on the belt for shipments."
good,The team I work with is great when they are scheduled. The amount of things we are asked to juggle is completely unreasonable! And The pay is not so great.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's during the holiday because I would actually have hours, but then I switched to full-time and I was receiving less than 10 hours a week. Also, some of the managers did not necessarily know how to manage the store"
good,Worked during busy holiday season. Not a hard job. Learned how to work in fast pace. Great discount. The staff is not happy due to high volume/stress during the season.
good,Work most days was fast paced and stressful due to the quantity of customers and limited staff. Closing was mostly relaxed and took very little time to complete.
good,I loved that I made my own schedule. I liked that i was not micromanaged. As long as you perform your duties and are actively productive then your time there will be easy. The pay is the number one reason why I want to leave Kohls. The paid time off is awful too. The room for advancement is very small.
good,"Working at Kohl’s is not bad, yet it is not good/ideal. As it is a retail store it can be very slow paced as well as  moderately paced. They don't exactly offer raises but they do offer benefits. Shifts are usual short but can feel very ling if they aren’t busy days."
good,"The people hired to work in the store are all hardworking, decent people.  Individuals in management worked along with employees, but those in higher management positions left a lot to be desired."
good,As a frate member I would wake up at 6am drive 35minutes to get to work. At kohls i would go to the back room and help unload the truck. Next  I would have a break and then pull things out from the stock room on the floor the needed to be re-stocked or re did. Some days we would spend re-tagging clothes for clearance. We would make new displays and make the floor a safer environment for customers.
good,"most days you can get by with having decent hours at kohl's, however they take care of the supervisors first to make sure they have a lot of hours and then we just get the butt end of shifts."
good,It was a decent company to work for like for the holidays that’s when you’ll get your most hours. It’s very laid back an quiet and easy going. Family company also!
good,"Lots of work required to be done , with small amount of pay. Very determined, Great management and friendly staff. I would recommend as a first time job."
good,Depending on your availability they will place you in any job they need to fill. Your job title means little as you work most of the positions when you are needed.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of of keeping the store well maintained, and helping all customer's with questions. I learned a lot through this experience, not just how to use a cash register, or being patient. I learned that you have to have fun with whatever you're doing, even if it isn't the most enjoyable activity."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Good Place to work very professional . They don't offer  enough hours and there is no positions to move up in company. peak season is the only time we get the most hours or pay.
good,"Working at Kohls is a mixed feeling, some aspects of it are amazing and some are downright terrible. My co workers and managers are amazing, they are always there to help and are great people to work with in general. Like any job, it does get mundane. Also the major downside to working at Point of Sales is the credit cards-- we have a goal every day and we have to issue a certain number by the end of the day. This mainly what made the job not as enjoyable as it should be because it's unrealistic and of the pressure. Also how breaks are managed are horrendous. You are not guaranteed the breaks that you are entitled to take, and the managers sometimes would care less. Also the raises I have received are embarrassing. The amount of work I do at this job I should be already receiving at minimum $10. "
good,"Fine if you just want part-time. Starting pay only $9/hr. Hours not guaranteed and can be minimal for part-timers."
good,It was very flexible. Work was self-explanatory and consistent. Management was helpful. Workers were friendly as well. Gave you the opportunity to learn multiple positions.
good,"They offer amazing discounts and I loved working there to a point, but unfortunately they have some poor management (only a couple of the managers are not nice) but there are a handful of managers that are great about working with you when it comes to scheduling and other stuff like that. The store manager unfortunately has a problem with singling a couple of people out and treating them horribly and making it miserable to work there."
good,"I worked for them for a couple years, throughout college and high school. They were always very considerate about working around my class schedule but you had to work a lot of weekends. Management was always hit or miss, but there was a lot of turnover due to poor management. The pay was very minimum wage and you typically worked long shifts. Even though the schedule said you would be done at a specific time you nearly always stay late. You cannot work overtime or you will get talked to. Everything else is pretty traditional of retail. Overall, I would not go back, but it was decent at the time."
good,"its not a bad job to work at but its the greatest. It needs better managers honestly hopefully they did get better mangers. their main focus was the just the cashiers and not the hard working people on the floor, thats one of the reason I didn't stay long with them."
good,"I''d either be assigned to the check out desk, where I'd ring people out. That part isn't too much, because management has a hawkish eye on you. And you're more supposed to treat customers as things. No small talk, no holding their items for a while. Just a small greet, cash them out, and make them sign up for the specials Kohl's credit. That felt de-humanizing."
good,"Fun place to work and fairly flexible. Had to be available four nights a week to close and got scheduled for overnights a lot. Definitely didn’t like getting 10-15 hours a week even with open availability and reliable transportation. Also didn’t enjoy three hour shifts which we would finish early.  It wasn’t worth coming in for two hour shifts at 8pm in the end. "
good,It is a good  facility to work in and the coworkers are very helpful and nice to each other and customers.  But mostly we know how to communicate when we need help with things.
good,WMJM associates have to do a lot more then you’re told. It’s not fair to have to do more then everyone else in all the other departments and still be made to back up the cashiers. In my time working for kohl’s wmjm associates were always taken advantage of. And all they truly care about are credit sales. The pressure they put on cashiers to grill customers into signing up for a credit card is obnoxious. All coworkers were pretty cool but there was a manager or 2 who definitely took advantage of their position.
good,"I worked there fresh out of High school, it was my first retail job, and I didn't know much. I made mistakes, being young and new to the job, and you'd think management would bring up mistakes in a way that ensured I could learn from them without feeling like I was doing a bad job.... wrong. I was forced to stand there in the middle of the store (never bothered to sit me down in an office where it was confidential), where customers could hear my manager yelling at me because I inputted a coupon wrong. I feared my managers and felt like I was about to be fired with every talk we had. When it came time for my 30, 60, and 90-day reviews there would be call-ins or no-call-no-shows listed in my file that never happened, my numbers would be wrong for credit sales and rewards signs ups. When I switched colleges to one that was out of town, I had to quit because the closest Kohl's to transfer to was one hour away from my college. When I put my 2 weeks notice in they were rude and tried to make me feel guilty about quitting to go to school telling me that they were now going to be short staffed and it was my fault, and I was screwing people over, then they cut my hours for my last 2 weeks. This was 4 years ago, I hope the managers in question aren't there anymore."
good,"It was alright but management was all over the place. I’d work here again but only seasonal, never long term. Good hours at first but then reduced to almost nothing so it’s not worth the drive."
good,"Managers are sometimes jerks, but depending on what department you’re in, it’s fun. I would recommend shoe department to anyone because it’s fun and easy"
good,The management and the co workers were all great but pay and the hours were all horrible. It wasn't enough. They would only give me 12 hours a week or less.
good,I have not worked at Kohl's for more than a year. Many things have changed since I have left. The store I worked at is under new management so my experience there will not apply anymore.
good,"Flexible hours, I feel most franchises have both good and bad locations. Just do research on your nearest location. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyable work culture. If the pay wages/salary would've been more liveable I would still be working at this Retail department store. Daily operation were fast paced but managementable. Customer service heavy; this is a good starter job!
good,"As much as I appreciated the opportunity to work, the workplace was competitive even though it was a temporary job I was there for. Management did not seem to listen when I told her I was not a permanent employee, but after some explaining finally understood."
good,Constantly cutting hours been with this company for over 10 years and the last 2 to 3 years full time hours drop 20 to 30 hrs a week making it hard and bring pt time in when not needed leaving us with no work and saying we need more ecommerce buildings when we cant keep us busy for starts.
good,Some of the managers were pretty cool and they pay was pretty good but you never got enough hours and the managers were so thirsty for credits it was kind of ridiculous!
good,"I worked there for a couple of moths, while working there it was not organized at times or hardly any employee to cover shifts because people were always calling out.. Overall it was not bad."
good,"during holiday its great, easy to meet 35 plus hours a week. afterwards its very difficult to even get 12 hours a week. extremely hard to advice. doesn't pay enough to support even one person let alone a family. great for seasonal work."
good,Kohls was a decent job to work. The other workers were nice but I did not like it for a long time job. I did not like working in sales as much as I enjoyed working with animals.
good,"I like working here. There is a good atmosphere and most of the managers are cool. I do not like the lack of hours I get, but when I am there the time goes by pretty fast."
good,Great crew members and a good job to improve your people person skills. You don’t get enough hours unless its the holidays. The amount of work put in isn’t worth the minimum pay.
good,working there for 6 months was cool. You get paid every week on a Friday. the break room makes you feel like your in a good healthy job where i worked at. One thing i disliked was the consistent push on gaining store credit from customers by making them apply for credit cards. The store manager will give you a bad look if you dont gain as much store credits as the goal needed. they will take away your hours if you dont people to open up credit cards. But overall i tolerated the ratchet cashiers and the friendly diverse customers who always want a discount on things simple because of the weekly pay
good,"It was a fast paced, but long hour job. It has its pros and cons like every job. It was very tiring, you stand on your feet for however long your shift is. The management could use some work."
good,My job at Kohl's was often times very busy and somewhat stressful due to how much there was to do. The most enjoyable part of the day was making costumers feeling satisfied and happy. Coworkers at Kohl's were very nice
good,Was a fun job with good culture. Didn't pay very much but was a great early career job to have. Didn't pay very well at all but taught you a lot on dealing with irrational people and how to take control.
good,"Not a fan. They pay well during the season but employees have a superficial hierarchy which is testable and among the staff only a few actualy care for the employees, company, or anything for that matter."
good,"First of all - Training... There basically is none. They throw you into random places and expect you to instantly know what you're doing."
good,Ok place to work a great work place starts with management and works it’s way down. With a great staff team the job can be very fun. With growth and opportunity
good,"The store was good, management cared more about credit handling than your happiness in the job. I hated working the floor because the store is a mess as well."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Fun and friendly co - workers. Talk was friendly. Management knew what they were doing ahead of time or made a plan to get it done if there was any change. Everyone was treated equally and management was professional.
good,Most of the time the equipment needed to do the job did not work properly. Processes for moving products was confusing but doable. Management very critical of performance.
good,Back when I was employed at Kohl's my day pretty much consisted of me ringing people up and having them apply for Kohl's Charge cards. Also helping customers with whatever questions i could from working at the register.
good,they were not very willing to work with the part time schedule i provided or around my schedule when my availability changed due to my full time job that i worked at.
good,"I learned many things about working at Kohls, of course, I had my bad days, but some of the management was definitely loyal and always there to talk to and to assist with any additional training that you may have needed. They also had the older women who worked the customer service area (who took care of returns) in their own little clique as well as certain others who had their own little cliques. The hardest part of the job was possibly trying to meet the credit goals because many customers already have the Kohls credit card and rewards card."
good,"Most days were decent, co-workers made it more bearable. I highly enjoy working there and taking care of customer needs/concerns. Discounts are a bonus."
good,"Hours per week all depend on work load, the pay is good but work is extremely draining. There are 3 shifts to chose from in the warehouse, but once you pick a shift you are not able to switch for any reason."
good,"lots of mtgs, lots of red tape, lots of room for personal development, ability to think differently and push the status quo, lots of team collaboration opportunities"
good,If successful at a lower entry position they will keep you there is long as possible before promotion because of your success at that lower level position.
good,"average position, must get a lot of credit card apps.  this is number 1 above everything else. my day would be to walk around and ask every single customer if they had our card and would they want our card."
good,"It’s a super competitive  environment so it keeps you on your feet . You always do your best because if you lack and fall behind a lot of pressure falls on you ."
good,good customer service. they are hiring for the holiday. been there for a while. big on credit. get high satisfied surveys and do that with a smile on your face
good,"I really enjoyed working there but not enough hours so I had to find a different place to work , but pay was ok .management was a little difficult but ok"
good,"-customer service representative, clothing manager, front register."
good,"A day working at Kohls consisted of arranging clothes, cleaning fitting rooms and helping on registers. Management was very helpful and was quick to helping out employees when they needed help."
good,"Santa Maria Kohls needs to improve its cleaning staff, customers viewing a messy environment will only think negative about the place. Friendly staff but one stressful manger."
good,"Culture is going to define your time at Kohls. In my case, management was an awful, cliche-y, stuck-up group, but my fellow employees were really lovely, amazing people in general. That's what made the work tolerable. Management was so pushy and snobby that I considered actually turning into one of THOSE employees, who doesn't show up all the time or on time, because I despised having to deal with them that much. It was a relief when the better managers were on the clock because the store atmosphere was so much better as a result."
good,This job at Kohls was not that bad. I came in sometimes at the morning shift which was 9am and we had a moring meeting then got work and was on the sales floor answering questions for customers and finding what they were looking for. I learned that customers can be rude. The managment at my kohls had their favorites and if you werent theirs then oh well. But overall it was an okay plcae to work.
good,"The experience wasn't specifically rewarding towards my end goals, but it did provide me with an appreciation of salaries and money in general.  The environment was generally pretty nice.  I don't have much to say negatively about it, but I also don't have much to say positively."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"If you need the money and don't mind working long hrs on your feet consistently pushing, pulling, bending, lifting, standing..ect then go for it. If you can't do any of the above for long periods of time then I wouldn't recommend this job for you."
good,"I was a seasonal worker for the thanksgiving/ christmas holiday. The senior employees were not open to help and rude. The managers would get frustrated with constructive questions. Even though the environment was busy , it would have been nice for them to have patience with the seasonal employees."
good,"I just want to find a better job than this. Retail stores are dying and the hours are always being decreased. Despite the 12% profit Kohls made, we are getting less and less hours and the treatment with some of our managers are rude and disgusting. Along with management, some of the customers are extremely rude. Not a great place to work when you cant live off the random low hours you get."
good,"It's okay for what it is. I do not prefer factory or distribution work, but if I had to, I would return. Do not know about anything but seasonal associate work."
good,"Long hours of standing, always talking trying to make sales, limited break & restroom time. After Black Friday store is open 24/7 so shift vary, but if you can work holiday you will be working holidays."
good,"When I first started at Kohl""s In 1995, I thought it was the best place to be.  The CEO of the company at that time made sure family came (First). As the years went by they started hiring people that didn't care about you or you're family, It became about making the money, building. If you got an "" Excellent* on you*re review they did not like it , and stated that you did not need to be with the company because, there was no room for growth... Really!!!!!!!!!!! No matter how hard  you tried no matter what you did it is never enough for this company. Always a penny away of what you need, In my 23 years you're always looked over never a promotion no matter how hard you try."
good,"The employees are great , but the mental stress of working customer service is not worth the pay. Not to mention it's only part time . Good for a first job but nothing further then that."
good,"The typical day at work foe kohls'."
good,"Kohl's as a company made me feel appreciated as an employee and was happy to work for a company that actually showed it cared. However, the management at my location was absolutely terrible. There was a severe lack of communication, but no lack of attitude or fingers being pointed from management. Some definitely played favorites. "
good,A typical day at work never really deviated from a similar routine. I learned how to better deal with people in a retail environment. The management was stellar often times helping employees through tough situations and always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,Some of the supervisors can give attitude towards you. I did learned a lot about customer service. The workplace can be very stressful at times. Some of the new hires do not care if they leave a mess after their shift is over. Management is suppose to let them know how to do their jobs and to clean their area before they leave.  The workplace has changed.
good,"The company is fast pace and physical. Standing a period of 9 hours or longer, lifting 40+ pounds, bending and unloading or loading trucks at a steady pace. Worker uses a RF scanner to process freight by scanning barcode."
good,"The pay is low for the area, benefits are on par, job expectation on par with other companies in same industry.  There is no advancement, development, actual communication, or teamwork.  Most associates angry fellow associates are not held accountable but do not want to be held accountable themselves. HR is deceiving on more than one occasion or could be horribly misinformed. Not a good career company but a good first job company."
good,Its not a place to work if your not a hard worker. You have to be fast efficient and friendly. Have to work weekends and holidays and it can be soul crashing but the people you work with will have your back and make you laugh.  It can be a great place to work but its high stress.
good,If your someone right out of school in desperate need for a job it works but it's not meant for a long term deal.  But if your just looking to maybe catch up on some bills or need some money for the Holiday season it's great.
good,Very degrading and mean manager of the whole store. Made you feel less then all the time when asking for help or assistance. Did not like when you you needed something from him.
good,"The work isn't hard, I've learned a lot from working there with some great associates. In fact I think working with the associates was best part of working at KOHL'S. They run good programs for the community and local causes. The problem however is when you try to move up there's not much opportunity to advance. I worked there for a long time and didn't feel like I was advancing for all the work I put in. It became so frustrating to the point where I had to decide to leave the company."
good,"Kohl's is a great company and job to have, especially as a college student. The part-time hours were scheduled especially to align with your college schedule. The co-workers were always nice and so were the managers."
good,"a fun place to work but last couple months it has changed. The pay is too low for what you're required to do and whom you deal with. The hours are horrible. You go to management about your hours and they say'll theyll fix it but they never do, but they want to keep hiring people."
good,"Kohl's provides entry-level associates the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience that will help them become more marketable in their careers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Dynamic and challenging environment with evolving company staying relevant in retail landscape. Competitive benefits and compensation package and opportunities for development.
good,"The core role of the company is what is always preached to the employees. Expectations and goals can be exceeded, however, you will only receive a standard 3% raise annually."
good,"I was a floor associate and it was always busy sometimes so busy that I was extremely overwhelmed. Management did their best but the upper management who did not see the store were horrible to us. I eventually left out of frustration for being over worked and exhausted. I felt the expectations were to high for an under staffed high volume environment. I did like a few of my managers, not all of them. I stayed as long as I did because of my co workers they were amazing and I liked the customers a lot"
good,When i worked at Kohl's it was very fast pace for the truck unloading. You start at 6:00 am and need to have the truck unloaded at the end of your shift. This means all of the boxes need to be off the truck and opened then if you didn't finish that in a decent time you need to put all the clothes out on the floor.
good,"stressful. fast paced, good benefits, can have flexible hours. Can work from home if you choose. many perks, dry cleaning, bank onsite, large cafetera"
good,"I was the head of the shoe and apparel department. I was placed in charge of inventory, stocking, as well as customer service for my department."
good,"Nice place cut throat. It was cool at first no advancement do to so many changes very hard to bonus and make more money , they don’t care about employees families all they want you to do is work even if you have family emergencies "
good,"Great for a high school student, or second source of income.  Doesn't pay much, but can be an easy job if you get a position not having to deal directly with customers."
good,A typical day consist of setting the direction for the day. I would chat associates in and assign them designated tasks for their shift. Management took turns running the business and worked varied shifts.
good,"Managers are key to good hiring and scheduling. Kohl's managers are not qualified and fail in these areas. Many times I tried to work with managers and the ""corporation"" barriers seemed to get in the way. Previously, at other jobs, my managers were more personable and willing to work along with me during specific scheduling/personal issues."
good,"Typical day is putting away recovery, operating registers, and cleaning the fitting rooms. Managers were nice and understanding of family situations. Hardest part is not enough people working."
good,Kohls pay is okay. If you are a young adult with little to no financial responsibilities then it is the place for you. If you have bills do not work there
good,"multiple departments in the warehouse. Associates are assigned to the different departments ranging from receiving, stocking, pulling, sorting, packing and shipping.  30 minutes of lunch is paid for every 5 hours worked."
good,"busy, fast passed no time to breath type of job. also friendly and helpful employees. always motivated fun loving group of people to work with. would never change the experience."
good,"Some management had patience and was encouraging, others expected you to come out of the gate running full blast when you hadn't even been trained for your area."
good,"Learn the gist of the cash register and you're all set. Sales pitch becomes a routine, so being able to solicit charge card is a must. Put customers first, above all. Be comfortable handling money and maintain professional composure. Be able to put back any clothes left at the registers and have confidence in yourself. Fast pace, flexible work hours, online software for schedules and other personal information."
good,Too many chiefs never enough Indians. Turn over is extremely high. No consistent rules. Far too much brown nosing and butt kissing. Judgemental environment with isn’t healthy.
good,"For as little cashiers as they had, they always managed to never give enough hours to those who needed them. After the holidays it started to get as worse as getting only 4-6 hours shifts twice a week. I couldn't live off of that. I had bills to pay."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"the management never knew what was going on with employees hour. some weeks you would get 20 hours then the next week your only working 8hours. there no consistency, nice place to work if you can live off the low hourly wage and hours"
good,I learned how to get things done in a timely manner. Was a fast paced and very relaxed environment. Having to get the store back in order took the most time
good,"I thought this job was pretty easy, but not very organized  because we are always having to leave our department to  do point of sale. Managers are kind of lazy in my opinion."
good,Its okay if you are looking to just work an easy 40 hour work week as a material handler (AKA Mindless Robot) than its a very stress free job for most people. The pay is okay but dont expect to be well off. If you think you want to move up look for a job with better opportunities.
good,"Kohls is a good place to work for part -time, new students as a starter job.   If you desire to advance in the company, it is also possible to do so.  Be warned, middle management is petty and corrupt, will require butt-kissing and cut-throat tactics to move up.  Supervisors and lower management are given high-stress unrealistic goals and are harassed to reach them; failure to do so is punished with even higher goals, or termination"
good,"A typical day at work would be to great all customers that pass by you, recover your department as well at detailing by size, assist to other departments"
good,"I found the culture at Kohls very difficult to embrace as an outsider to the field of retail at the time, an often constrictive atmosphere especially in loss prevention; even acknowledging the usefulness of a department like Physical Security which year-to-year brings down the cost of servicing the loss prevention department's overall spending, our budget goals were not realistic and were visited only once per year in an very specific niche in our industry that requires careful consideration as the technology and software utilized in our profession evolves and outdates."
good,"Great if you're a college student or in need of supplemental income... not recommended if you are not comfortable soliciting credit, as that is a big factor expected of associates at kohl's. Management could be more present and helpful, but overall for a retail position it's a decent place to work."
good,"I started at Kohl's as a seasonal employee and enjoyed it despite how fast-paced it was. The job requires a lot of energy and commitment. Upon becoming an official part-time employee I enjoyed it much less because of this. My schedule wasn't so flexible and the work environment was very negative. Overall, it gave me good experience with communication and interpersonal relations but I'm glad I was able to leave and find something I loved to do."
good,I was only there for a holiday season. Holidays in retail are extremely stressful and busy. I had to work Thanksgiving night for Black Friday sales. Pay was minimum.
good,"Easy-going, slow-paced work days. I work in the jewelry department so I learned the different diamond cuts and different gemstones. The management was fun to work with and very accommodating to my school schedule. The employees' ages range from 18-65 so there was always  variety of people to interact with. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers and help them find what they needed."
good,"This was an okay place to work.  It wasn't really my cup of tea.  The benefits were great.  Management was less then impressive.  I learned a lot, but in the end it wasn't the place for me."
good,"Constantly pressuring to sell kohls cards. Didnt have too many breaks. Candy for opening kohls cards was a plus, so thats good. Always work to do there"
good,"My co-workers were the best people to work with. The pay and the benefits are great. There is a lot to learn, putting customers first is definitely Kohl's priority."
good,This place was great at first but as time went on the workers became very cliquey. Promotions and rewards were based more on who you were friends with then who deserves them. Hard to get hours sometimes. They do have new management now though and I think that will help tremendously.
good,The store manager was very nasty. She would yell at employees and give nasty atitude. All other department manager were fine. Would not recommend knowing that nasty person.
good,I really struggle with the management. They seem like they are all over the place and I do not like the inconsistency with my schedule and the are flexible to an extend.
good,Loved working here co workers were awesome customers were nice always moving around so the day never dragged out! Wish I was still there.employee discounts are great as well.
good,"Worked in hidden valley. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for especially if you are just looking for seasonal work. Good management and a very enjoyable place to work. I would highly reccomend for those looking for just a seasonal or temporary position.
good,"As soon as the employee start working there was something to do, especially if the person work in the customer service area. There are a lot of specials going on throughout the year."
good,Productive and fun with decorating contests. We  donate and run food drives.  Volunteer for many corporations and  great discounts. We also have VTO .
good,"I had some issues as far as my job was concerned. I loved working with the customers and my management and co-workers were awesome. There was some people that made it experience kind of annoying. There was some who was so obsessed with credit, which is fine! I understand that's how our company gets anywhere is through credit, but when it comes to people cut throat each other to get ahead, then it's a issue to me. I usually don't care about being on top, I just want to help my company, and there was people who only cared about the numbers and no quality of work. Other than that, it's not a bad job. The hours get bad around the holidays because they bring in new people to train, but average part time hours overall. Not a bad job for someone in college and just needing a little extra cash."
good,"overall environment and the people to work with were very relaxed and consistently on the move, however the pay for the role was low for the amount of work being completed"
good,There is always someone to help if you need it for a work app on the store units.  It is usually busy and the work changes daily so the time goes fast.  Kohls is as friendly a place to work as it is to shop.
good,"I have heard worse but this was a very competitive store. The are very serious about credit and are very pushy when you don't get it. They gave many hours when I told them I'm in school. But they are understanding, nice and will help you when you need it."
good,Great company but personally looking for more opportunity for growth. You are issued certain task that is really a leadership role but your efforts are compensated.
good,"Kohl's was my first job. Management is very fun and patient, other associates were very fun, helpful and loving. I have grown to see my team members as a true family even becoming very close friends with most. This job has helped me gain customer service experience and has also gave me volunteer experience with their Kohl's Cares program. Hardest part of the job is rude customers and having to return items customers do not want. These are called ""500's"" and you can have up to a whole basket full of items that must be returned by the end of your shift all because a customer simply does not want the item any longer. Kohl's is a very big department story and it's not always easy finding where an item goes back."
good,"I started out as a Cashier, but now I am mainly on the floor as a Sales Associate. Being a Sales Associate I don't think we get paid enough for the amount of folding and recovery that we do, especially when we're put in such big departments by ourselves at times."
good,Working at Kohl's was very fun when it came to customers and work together with employees. I've worked retail for a few years before and never been treated the way I was there when it came to training or lack of communication.
good,I think this is a good place to work if you are a student just needing some type of income. fast pace only during sales or holiday time. wish it was possible to go fulltime there but only managers can be fulltime.
good,I worked at the Cypress Kohls and it closed soon after I left. I am unsure how the other stores are. the one I was at cut my hours to 4 hours a week..
good,"Everyone wants more hours so there is competition there. If you get credit card applications, you got more hours. Management does not train you per say...hands on and other employees help you along. Customers were best part of job...the friendly ones were a blast to see on a daily basis."
good,"If you're interested in Brick and Morter retailers, Kohls continues to stay strong in the industry with ever-changing technology to fit the e-commerce world we are entering. A typical day at work could start at 8am, 1 pm, or even 3 pm depending on what shift and the hours of the store. I learned how to manage 180 employees to properly run a 21 million dollar store. I learned the ins and outs of merchandising, inventory, customer service, cash office, sales and any new processes that would be implemented. The hardest part of the job was knowing all of the answers. The most enjoyable was interacting with customers on a daily basis."
good,"Doesn't keep you moving in the non peak seasons. Very slow paced, mainly helping the sales floor clean up all the clothes customers like to throw all over the place."
good,Wasn’t very team oriented at all. Managers over worked employees. Didn’t do much to help other than walk around the store and acted as if they were busy. Hired a bunch of young people and fired them right after. Inconsistent.
good,"I prefer not working for Kohl's anymore in a certain location simply because they are completely unorganized and they weren't flexible with my times, I let them know ahead of time, that I have to take care of my mother and they were just not receptive to the duties that I have at home."
good,"My overall experience working for kohl’s was a good one. The over time for the seasonal help is awesome. You can work as many as 70hours, if your built for it. The catch is, it’s only seasonal!"
good,"Operates like any other retail company. Deals with customers on a daily basis. Follow store rules and procedures, provide good customer service. Managers are adequate. Employees are enjoyable. Great discounts. Part-time associate. Hours are inconsistent, as most retail companies are. Great job for college students or night-time/side job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,6am-12pm...
good,It was good for the beginning of the employment but as time went the management become very unpleasant and stressful and the environment became very uncomfortable
good,Generating sales and pushing customers to sign up for reward programs or kohl's credit card. Restocking merchandise communicate with other department. Doing your best to help the customer find what he/she may be looking for.
good,"i had inbound outbound calls that took, help identify customers needs inquiring of what made them fall past due, offer top down negotiations overall employees where great to work with every said hello, then sr management went threw change  also CEO retired"
good,"Poor pay, terrible managers, only good if it is your first job, there are better places to work than kohls, there are no opportunities to move up if you expect a raise because they hate giving raises"
good,"While I love working for this company the pay is not great and neither is the job. You can be very sociable but still not enjoy working here. They really push soliciting credit, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however, a majority of the customers that do shop here already possess the credit card making it very hard to open new credit with customers. The pay is good if you are a high school looking student for a part-time job, but beyond that working here is not worth the trouble because work weeks are inconsistent and full-time doesn't exist for certain positions."
good,"I loved the place, they help me a lot with my schedule because of my college, but they were giving me only 5 to 10 hours per week. I do not want to be ungrateful but I am a student and less than 90 dlls per week is like nothing. But the job is perfect like a second or like a third job."
good,I love working for this company. everyone makes you feel like home and family. Does need some work like benefits for part time employees and the ability to further your career.
good,"Shoppers can be terrible anywhere you go; Kohl's is no exception. The major difference here is that the sheer number of discounts and coupons available at Kohl's, while convenient, cause more unsavory customers to try to abuse the system. Shouldn't be a dealbreaker, but something to be aware of."
good,Kohl's doesn't give many hours for people with families. It was a job I had while I lived with my mom. I would possibly consider management being that they were getting all the hours.
good,The two reason I'm am leaving kohl's is because the pressure of standing on my feet for hours on end . They also do not pay very well as expensive as everything is nowadays . I was paid 9 starting off now I am paid 9.70 . I worked on the floor and it was very messy ( a never ending job) . The discount is 15% some times it good when there is a friends and family sale because associates get 50% off .
good,I had a really good time working here. Kohl's offers a lot of good benefits to their employees. Yes there were stress full time but there was enough stuff to do where you didn't have time to worry about the bad things.
good,A work day consisted of making outbound calls to people who were past due on Kohl's credit cards. I learned better negotiation skills and how to think quickly.   Management was great with checking on you throughout the day making sure you were engaged. the culture was very hectic as we had 500 plus calls pushed through to use daily and a dollar amount that had to be met each month to ensure you kept your job. the hardest part of the day was the pace as it was my first experience with being on the phones.
good,"This is a very fast paced place to work. you really need to hussle on the sales floor to help all the customers. The sales floor does not have the proper coverage, and you need to fill in many different departments for your shift."
good,"We should  report to our post on time and be prepared to take care of the customers' needs."
good,"the worst was the fitting rooms, they were always a disaster no matter how hard you worked on them. The only good thing was being able to switch shifts with someone."
good,Kohls is a stressful place to work. the manager isnt the best. but it can be fun when theyre not harassing you for talking to your coworkers when its slow.
good,"Could be slow or fast paced always productive.Learned how to do cash office,merchandising,Management had her favorites,not fair to all employees.The hardest part of job is that your schedules are different every week.I enjoyed the discounts and people I worked with."
good,Good if you enjoy retail. f it is not in your career field or something you don't want to do the rest of your life then I don't recommend. It's good for getting your foot in the door job experience wise.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work for someone who appreciates a retail environment. It was fast-paced, and asked employees to push the sale of a credit card. That seemed like our primary goal on cashier shifts."
good,"Everything was ok working at kohls i did have fun working with others folding and stocking clothes even if the store got crowded. working at kohls helped me learn to work with others no matter what situation they are encountering. They had poor management the managers had preference and considered other co workers. The work place culture was like a jungle the floors would get messy but their were associates that would work hard and get things organized. However, the hardest part of the job was dealing with what the managers wanted us to do for the day. lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping and interacting with diversion of customers because honestly you learn to be more attentive and patient and satisfy their needs. i just loved making them feel at home and show a positive attitude."
good,"Very annoying company to work for. Too many coupons, too many needy customers, too much of a lenient return policy that customers take advantage of. Great learning experience though."
good,Its a good starter job but not much stability. They hire a lot of temps and a lot of seasonal employees. It is good if you don't have a more stable job
good,"Great environment to work in, but pay is horrible for the amount of work a mjm sales associate does especially at a really busy store. They also weren't flexible in scheduling shifts."
good,"I'm a supervisor of a department, the job can be very stressful due to lack of staffing. The overall managers and fellow employees are what make the job a little better."
good,its an ok place to work. pay is minimum and so are the hours. they expect you to open at least 75 credit accounts a day.if you have a question dont bother asking hr
good,"Was there for 6 months and there was not an opportunity to work full time.  Worked with 6 other people at the Kohl's facility in Menomonee Falls, had to walk to work from Silver Spring and I-41 because of no public transportation, and the manager most of the time was nowhere to be found."
good,"To be honest, the best part of the job was getting the discount.  During the Holiday Season, that discount helped a lot.  The worst part was, as a cashier, pushing the Kohl's Charge card applications.  Some customers get really snappy when you ask and you HAVE to ask.  Mystery shoppers came in to test you and if you do not make your quota, your yearly review suffers."
good,"It was an okay place to work for a part time temporary job. The managers were nice and friendly and fair. The job hours were okay, they were hesitant to change your hours, you had to find someone to switch hours with you or take your shift to take off."
good,A typical workday can be fun and energetic depending on the promotions. Cash registers are very easy to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job is working Black Friday sales.
good,Kohls is a great starter job but very difficult to move up in and odd hours. It's very hard on new relationships to work here. And you don't get full time pay or benefits.
good,Time was well spent. This store is always busy. No time to socialize with co-workers.They worked well with my full time job. I had no complaints. Really could not rate my supervisor because we rarely worked the same shift.
good,This was a okay job. A lot of politics for advancement but a very good company and culture. I would recommend this company to anyone but like every job who your manager is very important.
good,"My store tends to be one of the better ones, but we can be very disorganized.  they under staff and so floor associates constantly have to come help registers making it difficult for them to get their responsibilities done.  the cashiers are given work to do in their off time so that they don't have to be bored during the downtime when it's busy but they are also given work even when everything has been busy and they don't have enough time to get anything done."
good,"Problems with scheduling"
good,"A typical day at work consist of maintaining the sales floor, and assisting customers. Kohls really pushes the employee to make customers sign up for a kohls card."
good,"Good, secure job. Does not have a good work/life balance. Hours suck for the most part if you have children or a social life. Rarely get weekends off, the companies wants you there a lot and late!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was hard and stressful being a seasonal associate there and I didn't like my management. But the pay was better than my other jobs and it wasn't too bad.
good,"The music played throughout the store is terrible. Many of the products are overpriced; the clientele will either be people in the upper middle class that can afford such products, or they will be people in lower classes that constantly complain about the prices. There's really not much of a grey area here."
good,"The opportunity to learn new skills is certainly available within the workplace. I was able to learn and grow in my own abilities and perspectives regarding customer service, however, employees are largely left to their own devices in solving problems in the store. While Independence can be a positive quality, I feel that it is taken too far in respect to the to the relationship of management and staff. It appears to me that often times the management staff rarely confronts issues relating to the general operation of the store. Instead, they choose to place blame upon lower ranking employees in order to satisfy corporate policies. This in turn creates an environment of self servitude instead of relying upon responsibilities of teamwork. My general view of leadership within the store is very poor. Nevertheless, I have learned the importance of customer interaction and satisfaction within the workplace, whether through my efforts in providing customers with store services or simply attending to a customer's desired needs. In a typically day I am often found working in the front of the store assisting with transactions, greeting customers, informing/providing customers with store services (credit cards), stocking/organizing products, and helping the customers with any issues at hand. I also frequently assist the store with with product advertising/ sign management duties prior to the opening of the store for the day."
good,The cashier job was a lot of time spent on your feet. Kohls was very aditment that you took breaks whenever designated to. Wasn't sure on how to ask for days off or who to talk to about it.
good,Kohl's is a great job if you are looking for a part time job.  Most times they are extremely flexible with things like school schedules and other work schedules.
good,"The company is good from a retail perspective.  The continued focus on active and wellness categories has been a great move.  There needs to be more focus on developing, retaining, and promoting talent.  It is being pushed by the wayside in recent years."
good,I enjoyed working with the freight truck crew. We all worked as a team. We unloaded the truck in a timely manner and stocked shelves. The management team always had a smile on their face. Always willing to help.
good,"There wasn't much there. Due to the fact that it was a clothing store, it was always very organized. That was somewhat my fault though, since when i wasn't working in the back docks unloading i was on the floor fixing the place up."
good,"You will primarily be sitting in an isolated room, maybe with one other person watching cameras. Sitting there waiting for a suspicious person to enter the store or parking lot is 95% of the job, so there is a lot of free time to be on your phone, listen to music, talk, etc. When you do get a shoplifter in the store, the job gets very serious very fast. You have to observe all 5 steps which you learn about in training, before making a stop and calling the cops to get a case out of it. There are quotas you have to hit, which was the worst part of the job. A part timer like me had to catch at least 3 every two weeks in order to hit my goal and full timers had to get 2 every week to hit their goal. This job can be really fun if you get to work with someone you like and if the cops near your location are cool. But the pay is not worth it for the danger and stress of the job. Kohls does not allow LPs to even touch lifters, so no tasers, mace, batons or handcuffs are allowed to be used."
good,"good breaks decent people to work wit,nice working hours .i have learned to work wit people better .its a motivational place to be at when u see alot of good things to have in life"
good,I only worked for Kohls for 3 days because it seasonal and only for the thanksgiving weekend. The interview process was pretty easy and they told you whether or not you got hired right there on the spot. They start you right away and make sure you are very well trained. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,I worked primarily in customer service and sometimes as backup at the cash registers. I had fun with customers and would joke with them often. I made their day. Many walked away laughing.
good,Weekly pay was perfect even though as a seasonal associate I was only being paid $9.00 an hour and didn't get as many hours that I wished I could have
good,it is a good place to work but some managers really need more people skills and learn how to respect employees and not punish them by throwing the risk of losing there jobs in there face other managers do treat you like a person and show respect.
good,"If you are planning on working here, be aware that Kohls does not really care about you.  Your hours are based on how many credit cards you push, managers often ignore requests for days off (even for your own wedding, rumor has it), and there are so many managers in the store that often standards vary wildly from one to another.  My managers in particular jerkwads, but some of them were really exceptionally nice.  It really depends on what store you work at, but Kohls as a company does not really care about you."
good,"Kohls was a wonderful place to work if you could manage to get hours. Several weeks turned up $0 paychecks, with 5+ days in between minimal shifts. There were too many workers hired at once, and poor management. However, the work was enjoyable and the atmosphere was exceptionally pleasant, making the few hours spent there enjoyable."
good,The hardest part of the job is doing multiple things at once. Most enjoyable part was merchandising and visual presentation set ups. The management was not the best at communicating differences at times. Learned to be more open about my thoughts and feelings.
good,Working for Kohl's you experience  ups and downs with customers and you have to have a lot of patience and be able to maintain your professional demeanor and I a lot working there.
good,The management position comes with a lot of responsibility greeting and treating customers with a friendly smile and respect making sure all employees do the same through team building. Closing the store to prepare for the next business day has to be a priority to continue customer service. The hardest part of the job was to keep employers we hired a lot of high school kids and college students this was the hardest because when you train a good to have them quite was frustrating
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls trys very hard to make the distribution center a nice place to work, but the fact is, its a hard dirty job unloading trucks!!  They are trying to get starting wages up to $12.00 with great benefits.  they cater several meals a year in addition to all of the little goodies they give away just to show appreciation.  (cookies, great points, chip night, casino night)"
good,"Job is ok for part time seekers.Cant exceed 40 hours and wage is at minimum wage. Long hours, management is ok but not concerned with your well being, family life,only concerned about soliciting credit and meeting targets. If you don't meet your targets,you lose hours and are given to the leading associates. Favoritism is given to certain associates where dress code is concern. over all fun place with little hiccups like any place."
good,"Working at kohls gave me a great opportunity to meet new people, handle all types of customers and handle money. They are a bit unorganized and it felt as if I was always needed to work all the time. Being in school and trying to work was hard. They were not very flexible. It really bothers me that the store is open until 11 on weekends. But it was a good time meeting new people."
good,"Most days have an ebb and flow to customers.  Starts out slow picks up around 10-11 slows down again around noon then picks up again from there until 4-5."
good,"Kohl's is pretty good about holding to an employee's availability. Hold hours as an incentive to sell their charge cards. This makes it a fine ""something to do job"" but you can be homeless and starving if you try to live on this job."
good,Kohls is a great company to work for when you are needing a part time job.  there is always something to work on when you are there and the people are great.
good,"In order to advance you have to buddy up to management, whether you are part-time, full-time, or salary. If you are an ASM you only advance if they like you personally, its not completely based off ability."
good,Management made me feel important and like a valued employee. Management was flexible with scheduling. They always gave us free lunches on Holidays which was enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work for me would to arrive, get my rf device set up, then go ahead and pick things off in the stock room to be put on the sales floor. In the meantime I would answer customer calls and customer questions."
good,Learned patience. Worked here part-time and hard to get more hours. Worked really bad hours for holidays. Some employees have low expectations for a person who is a little o.c.d  I ended up looking like I wasn't doing the job. Hard work might not be appreciated.
good,"Good place to work, learned everything retail through Kohl's. I was mostly a cashier but I did work in different departments and learned how to dress and address customers as well."
good,"Essentially, We would work different stations on a assemble line ether unloading, opening, or sorting items off the truck."
good,"It's a typical cashier, stocking job. There was nothing that absolutely stood out to me other than some rude employees than never seemed like the accepted new comers."
good,"Typical day would start with organizing and ticketing any merchandise that as been returned to the store. Adhere to the ""Yes We Can"" policy which ensures and gives employees the power to resolve customer issues without the constant approval of management. The most important take away from this job are communication skills and the ability to think quickly to resolves issues efficiently and correctly. My management is very helpful with explaining tasks that need to be done as well as providing support with customer issues. Hardest part of the job is inconsistency in how to navigate the return policies the right way while also making the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships developed with the regular Kohl's customers and my fellow associates."
good,A typical day is doing your job of nonstop moving. You can work your butt off but management don't really care. If you slack up a little bit then management has something to say.
good,"I had many up's and down's with Kohl's.  I for the most part enjoyed working for the company.  They do contests and events for their employees which is kind of nice.  However I had a bad experience with a temporary store manager while mine was away on leave, which caused me to be taken from the store by ambulance, only to have all my hours cut and be black-listed from working with the company.  Aside from that experience, I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and the business is clean and offers great customer service."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"For students in high school, just graduated, or college, it is not a bad place to work. The employees are fairly easy to get along with. It does teach responsibilities."
good,As work the worker we come together like a big happy family.. And I love it... Of course some of the mangers are in the family... They're great but you have you few that are castaways .
good,"You start at minimum wage and you'll get a raise after a year for $0.10-$0.25. You'll work anything from 0-26 hours a week typically. No guaranteed hours. When the holidays come they will lift the restriction on hours from 26 to 40, so you'll be allowed to work more."
good,"Kohls was a great experience to work outside the home. Helping customer find items they were looking for, being a team player,  great trainings were provided when needed."
good,Working at Kohls is enjoyable. The enviroment is very friendly. There are no benefits for part time workers and full time is almost unavailable. The hourly rate is not sustainable. There are employee discounts which is the only benefit from working there.
good,"Kohl's is a good company to work for, but it depends on the store. My current store has a great team and pushes each other to be their best. My old store did not. I would have left a long time ago if I was still there."
good,"Love helping customers and help them find good out fits , skin care ittems or fragrance. Also working in jewlery is a very fst pace enviorment especially over wekkends."
good,I worked for Kohls Department Store during my senior year of college. This job was great for me at the time. I was in my final year of school and was getting ready to get out into the world for my career. It allowed me flexibility with my Technical Theatre degree and was able to give me as many or as little hours as I wanted. I liked my job but I did not see it as a career path.
good,I enjoyed my time there. Though it was a seasonal position. Wish that there We're more permanent job opportunities for the seasonal people that were looking to stay permanent.
good,"The ideal work environment of Kohl's can best be expressed by the joys of holiday music and the cheerful faces of coworkers and consumers. I worked an early morning 6 am till 12 pm work day. I would sign in at the main office at the beginning and end of each shift. My main area in the work place was in the stocking department in the back. Beyond the doors leading to the back-stock were shipping docks for freighter trucks. Lifting boxes of varying weights, shapes and sizes out of fully packed eighteen wheeler freighter trucks was a great source of exercise. "
good,"I loved my job but the managers were very condescending and didnt care about their coworkers. But other than that, work was flexible, customers were wonderful, and holidays were a blast."
good,Good place to work for great atmosphere. Co-workers are nice and work life balace is great. Have time to learn and grow as a manager.
good,"Great environment to work in"
good,Working at kohls was very fast paced and my co-workers were very nice and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who were always nice when anyone needed help.
good,"the way the manage the store is not good, and there are not way you could yet promoted with in the company. they promote someone base on if the like you or not not base on your results."
good,"No proactive management took charge of hiring. The overnight was shut down due to poor communication and unfair expectations. The day crew would do whatever they thought was ok, and the overnight crew was left to clean up the mess, before they could even begin their work."
good,"I really enjoy working here. Nice people, work with my schedule. Employees get discounts. It just doesn't pay near enough to keep up with Austin's cost of living."
good,I like this job sometimes. If the  supervisors  would care a little more about the  associates and a little more about getting the job done and who they hire for peck time.
good,"I love the environment & everyone that I come across. It's a happy & friendly place. The only problem with working there for me is that my hours aren't good enough to help me pay my bills with no hesitation. It's very hard living on my own & working at Kohls but like I said, I love everything else about it."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Smiles and teamwork verbally and physically. Up to beat and well taken care of by employer with food, pay, and comfort. Everyone helped one another and never neglected I felt at work and not afraid to ask questions."
good,The people there are very friendly and educated. They like to help out unfinished work and there work effort is very good. My only conplain is that they don't give you a lot of hours
good,"For a University student, working at one of Kohl's department stores is ideal. They pay well and work around your schedule"
good,"The hardest part of working at Kohl's was the amount of work and the lack of staff to complete the work. No matter how many hours I would put into getting a project done, nothing seemed to stay presentable. Despite that, the co-workers I had made working together to achieve a project fun and enjoyable."
good,"Typical day at work includes opening/closing registers depending on time you come in. Running change for the registers. Checking out customer and convincing them to sign up for a credit card or rewards program. Gain customer loyalty. Run recovery."
good,Good for refining management skills but not for long term career. Only willing to compensate you for your accomplishments when you're resigning.
good,"Kohl's was on okay place to work, but the management at my store left something to be desired. You were expected to be every where all the time, regardless of if you were busy doing something else or not. There really was no room for advancement as they would always hire from outside of the company to fill management positions."
good,"For the yr and a half that i worked there they were really great. I worked with them while in my pregnancy, they were very supportive. They gave me the time i needed after having my daughter."
good,Constant hours per week should be given to each worker so that it's convents for them and the company also faster.trash compactors need to be installed
good,"I absolutely loved my team I worked with and met a lot of great people at Kohls that I will remain friends with.  However, being a parent they do not work with your schedule at all.  One week you have 4 hours, the next you could have 25.  So random.  You definitely cant pay bills from this job.  It is a fun job with great discounts where you will meet nice people.  Great for young college kids looking for extra money or retired people looking to get out of the house."
good,Kohl's Department store was a big account which I worked as an Account manager. Many of their mid-level managers were not helpful in assisting to customers or others.
good,Working at Kohls helped me build my skills a lot in warehouse work.  The people that worked there were nice and friendly people and I made a lot of good friends there.  I really like working in the ship from store department because it was new and different.  The worst part was running register mainly because I liked working on the floor and stockroom best.
good,There are a great deal of opportunities available. There are multiple management positions that you can work to achieve. Dive is definitely a must for this job. Without a will to learn or to achieve more you can get lost in the workload.
good,It was a very routine work day. There is always ways to keep busy throughout your work shift. Co-workers were nice and they all worked as a team well.
good,Fun placExcellent part time job. Good starting pay. Benefits are greate to work at. Excellent volunteer programs. Employee able to work additional jobs.
good,"they allow the customers to have a little bit too much lee-way, but overall it was an ok experience gave me a drive to move on for better things"
good,"Just something I got to do for the summer of 2015, not too special. Very mediocre yet okay enough for three months. Personally I thought working alone was the best part."
good,"There is a large turnover for managers and assistant managers. there are politics in the upper management where friends cover up things for other friends. If you are young and need a good job, it is a great place to work. there are great benefits."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Work days could get pretty long with the required overtime.  Management was good with people. Coworkers varied.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours with the amount of days worked in a week. The most enjoyable part about the job is that even though the weeks were long, management seemed to care."
good,This corporation is a good organization. I enjoyed working there for my duration and learned valuable skills in organization and maintenance of  store appearance.
good,Maintaining the department and focusing on sales.  I've learned how to interact with customers and handle the daily chores necessary of the job.  I've trained other employees.  I enjoy coming to my job because I feel that I am part of a team.
good,I like the challenge and fast paced work. There's a lot of multi tasking required. On any given shift I cover several different areas.
good,My typical work day was just unloading the truck during non business hours overnight trying to the truck unload before the store opened up for business.
good,"While the management where fun people, sometimes I felt like they where too lenient. Some employees could get away with things that they shouldn't have. The scheduling was sometimes to lacks on busy days and over scheduled on others. The employee discount was descent but only as certain points in the year. Wasn't a bad place to work, but wasn't the best."
good,"Not much room for advancement, management was a little harsh, hours were average, the people there are were good.  The Warehouse did move locations after I finished my seasonal hire."
good,"I would walk to the back and clock in to start the day. After about 4 hours at cashier I would take my 15-30 minute break, then finish of the day working at cashier. My coworkers were amazing, but it was always difficult being the youngest one there. Even though my coworkers were older they taught me a lot. The managers were great, besides one; he/she did not take into consideration any of your requests. I also know the management has changed a lot since I left and that many quit because the working condition are getting worse."
good,"My typical day started with me coming in and fixing whatever the previous associate hadn't done or did correctly. constantly changing out sales signs and informing customers of our products and sales going on currently. I was also responsible for maintaining the appearance of the men's section and the shoe department. I learned a lot of people skills and different ways to approach situations when dealing with different types of customers. I also learned patience and that teamwork is very important! more than once was I saved by an associate who knew where or about something that I had no idea about. Hardest part was the hours along with school because they were so understaffed, the most enjoyable part was working with awesome people."
good,"Many managers were not friendly when trying to improve an employee's performance. Company very goal focused, in credit, customer surveys, and overall monetary goal for the day."
good,"This job is good for someone who needs pocket  change. A typical day is alternated between slow and fast times. Only during holidays is when the pace is constantly fast. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the ""customer is always right"" status."
good,A lot of work and expectations are set very high. Customer service is a must and all departments are shown. Management is very strict and does not tolerate a lot. co-workers are always changing for 1 reason or another. A lot is expected of us and some people are even let go after a period of time because the company doesn't like paying people that have reached a certain threshold. Hours were very flexible and most of the employs are down to earth and very laid back.
good,"I will willing to learning something new to teaching me to do work with you. "
good,The management and staff were very unfriendly. I would not work for this store again. Very unorganized and rude. Working in this kind of atmosphere is not welcoming.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Kohl's, in my opinion, is how friendly everyone is - the customers and the employees."
good,"It was a very long time ago. I just remember not getting enough hours and not making a lot. However, I was only hired seasonal so that could of been apart of it. The most enjoyable thing was meeting new people and interacting with the co-workers"
good,"I got good pay, but management would only give me four hours a week. "
good,"kohl's is a fairly good company to work for, they provide benefits and such. The people there are awesome! Customer service isn't as bad as everything likes to think."
good,"Day usually starts around 8, depending on who is there and what is going on. Customer service is the primary focus. The management is usually on the same page and there to help. Co-workers are great. The hardest part is babysitting associates that don't want to work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Greet customers"
good,I was always on a register. Most of our customers were really nice and friendly. Most of my co-worker were really nice and I'm now friends with a couple of them outside of work. Most of the mangers are nice as well but need to learn to communicate better. There was also a lot of drama between some co-workers that got in the way of their job performance. Also I didn't like how your hours were all based on how many credits you get per shift.
good,"We were normally under staffed, and running around everywhere. Way too many customers for how many people we had, and that just made customers upset. They pushed the credit cards too hard. And were too crazy about making customers want them."
good,It was my first job while a senior in high school and I need money for my senior project. The work experience was good but the job lacked hours.
good,i really enjoyed working at Kohls. however they don't really have any sympathy for their workers dealing with family issues and crisis . the best part of my job was getting to deal with making customers happy by making their shopping experience as easy as possible. The worst part of my job was having no positive enforcement and encouragement when you had a job well done.
good,The store was on a role at one point but the lack of leadership and overt favoritism shown to some employees led me to believe the store was headed down hill. Sure enough it closed a little over a year after my departure.
good,"Great people! Solid team work attitude. Losing hours of part time help is decreasing morale of most stores. The job can be very fun with the right amount of payroll, but the sharp decrease over the last 2 years is forcing managers to settle for less or work even more than they already do."
good,"I enjoyed my roll as the store administrative assistant working with all of the management staff.  There is only one admin in each store and you become the go to person for HR, administration and all other departments."
good,"Overwhelming to say the least. Co-workers were great and friendly, welcoming to others. Hardest part about the job would be having to recover the department all on your own with only 3 hours to spare, including recovery, cleaning the floor, getting a break and cleaning the fitting rooms. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the meetings at the end of the night. Management was amazing, loved my managers."
good,"A typical day of work is a long hot 12 hour shift day, due to no AC in the warehouse. I learned a lot of things working there, how to meet and talk to new people everyday was probably the most relevant one i've learned there for future jobs. It was a temp job so i was not there long. My co-workers were really nice and fun to be around, would recommend friends to work there. The hardest part of the job would be waking up at 5 AM and working til 7 PM and going home and gong right to sleep because the day is over and you have to get back up in a couple of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, always in a good mood to work."
good,"While working there my job was working on the sales, so anything from folding clothes, answering the phones and stocking was my job as well as interacting with Customers."
good,"Kohls is a family oriented place to  work . I learned the Kohls ways ,very supportive management team willing to help you with anything to get to the next level."
good,"This environment is nice, but the management was not that great they did not take their jobs serious. I never felt professional as an employee working in that type of environment."
good,Kohls has a lot to offer there are a professional retail department store. They stay on top of inventory make sure customer are overly satisfied. They keep the work environment clean at all time and have great management.
good,"I loved the job and I worked with a wonderful team of people but I felt there was no room for advancement sometimes I got 4 hours and other weeks I got 40 im growing and I just really need stability, so it was very hard to be comfortable there."
good,"fun work place "
good,"The management needs some improvement. There was slim to no communication skills. The initial training needs work, you were left not really knowing what your job was."
good,"It was my job to keep the store going smooth. kind of the back stage worker you don't always see. I mean that in a way where i could be doing replenishment in the docks and you see me maybe 30 mins out of 4 hours of a shift. i went in early in the morning so the store wasn't very busy and i enjoyed the silence and ability to work without distractions. the hardest part was the management. as a back stage worker, the managers all had something important they needed to get done, and i was often their dump associate. sometimes the disrespect was unbearable, but other times it was good to know they thought of me as dependable."
good,Worked at Kohls seasonal but enjoyed the work. Heavy lifting and walking a lot on 12 hr shifts. I was a pick and pack worker and liked the fast pace because the time went by fast.
good,Pay is good but that is almost the only good thing working here. Management is poor and the company does not offer opportunities for advancement.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical workday for me depends on which department I'm in at any given time. In visual, I make sure the store's advertisements, graphics, and mannequins are presentable and constantly updated, while at customer service I insure all questions and returns are taken care of in a friendly, efficient manner. I have definitely learned how to be productive in many different environments depending on the demands of each department. Management has almost always been friendly, however, they unfortunately can't give out more hours than a part-time positions allows for, and nearly all associates are hired on part-time. The most difficult aspect of my job in visual is time management based around when we receive the products and when they need to be set up. At customer service, I have no difficulties aside from the occasional upset customer who tends to leave the store satisfied. Overall, it is an enjoyable work environment, but I would prefer to be challenged and to be paid a competitive rate based on the skills I am able to offer."
good,"I felt over worked for this company. I had to watch/work on three departments most of the days I worked here. What I learned from this store is not to be taken advantage of, a lot of my co-workers were lazy and rude."
good,It wasn't that bad of a job. Sometimes short handed. Fun to work here. Nice music to work to. Fast paced and nice customers.
good,"Saleing shoe was the most fun thing that could have happen to me , but this company did not want to see people as a black woman ."
good,"Loved the people, retail hours were hard; all over the place, but very flexible with availability, great discount, great benefits even as part-time employee you received paid vacation."
good,"Over all, they company meets your needs. Management is happy to give you what you need and meet you where you are. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and interaction with guests."
good,"Good place to enjoy customers, along with team mates that help you along the way. Room for advancement and other opportunity"
good,i didnt like working here they arent reliable with their hours. management was okay i just think they could divide the hours better and more efficient
good,"Terrible pay, not worth it one tiny little bit. You work way to hard cleaning and organizing and stocking the store and get paid way to little for it. It is a great part time job to have along with a full time position somewhere else. The teams that you will work with will help you learn many valuable skills for the rest of the working world. Very hard to make a career out of a position at Kohl's"
good,Being a new location managers would cut corners to get the job done. i cannot speak for their practices now since i have been gone. in  just a judgement call i would say they were a little bias with their advancement protocol.
good,"Good company to work for, pretty good job security unless you decide you don't want to work there and don't do your job to the ability they know you can do, customer service oriented and expensive benefits (I did not explore the benefits due to having another job with fantastic benefits I did not need their benefits). LP was fantastic and would help you gain store knowledge."
good,"Pros:"
good,Kohl's was a very productive workplace. We always got our jobs done and always had more to do. The managers were always really friendly and always did their best to work around my school schedule.
good,"Kohl's is great with their willingness to work with your schedule, co-workers are amazing, and overall the management is great. A great team makes it enjoyable to go to work everyday. One downside are the hours that are given besides the holiday season. This job definitely does not pay the bills. On another note, for students this would be an ideal job."
good,"Check price points"
good,"It is retail what do I need to say? You have your supervisor constantly asking too much of you. The pay is nonexistent. I'd say the only pros is your team, and a 15% discount."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much very busy!"
good,"Its an overall good job if you are looking for something temporary."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers in every department whether it be in shoes, apparel, housewares, or kids. Recovery would be done every few hours until the store closes to ensure quality presentation. Putting away returns is something done every hour to ensure the departments are fully stocked and put together. The hardest part of the job would be when you have to run from one and of the store to another helping customers. The job is very rewarding in that I get to help find products that meets a customers needs. Making customers smile is the most fulfilling thing about any retail job"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This is a good job for people just starting out, although the pay is not good I enjoyed going to work everyday. They also have good looking clothes and great sales"
good,one word awesome company to work for if you obtain a managerial position. Overturn rates are high.
good,"My day would consist of walking through the store and changing signage. I would look for defective electronic signs and swap them out for working ones. Prior to the installation of electronic signs, I would have to scan every item in the store to print paper signs and enter data into excel on sign count per each section of the store."
good,"It's a good job for supplemental income, but the pay isn't fantastic and there isn't much room for growth."
good,"one of my first jobs and still can go back if needed, very hard work and long hours, most time you are set with numbers and expected to meet them with zero mistakes, will work with schedules if needed"
good,"I worked at Kohl's during the holiday season and of course it was busy. I love being busy and having things to do. I took care of the childrens department while also being a cashier. The hardest part of the job would be during this season, keeping the dressing room cleaned as your being called up to help ring customers up. I really enjoyed just being busy and helping people."
good,"Merchandise freight"
good,"Receive, stock and replenish merchandise during the overnight shift."
good,"I was in charge of taking in catalog order calls, handled complaints and also handled customer information changes. I learned how to communicate with ease especially with irate customers. Management was o.k. Never had a chance to chit chat with other employees. The hardest part of my job was to stay on time task with each call."
good,A typical day at work consists of working in different departments to help new employees learn new things.
good,"The store is always busy on the weekends and when there are big sales going on. I learned that a lot of people shop at Kohl's. If you have a Kohl's charge card you could save a lot more money and shop more. The managers are nice and understanding. Some help with stuff in the store, some doesn't. All the co-workers are quite friendly and nice to one another. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store nice and neat during big sales or the holiday. Also, meeting the credit goal every day can be hard to, especially if most of the customers already have a Kohl's charge. But overall, its a fun and cool environment to work at."
good,"Its slow but when everyone wakes up it on, non stop thru out the day I learned how to be patience, and learned to manage time and people I am a people person the interaction Is outstanding the co-workers are a big OK in my book the hardest thing to do is catch a break the thing I love the most is helping and working with people because when I give a customer satisfaction I go home with a smile upon my face."
good,"Working in the back, (inventory warehouse). Walking around the store and helping customers if needed. Cleaning the store, picking up clothes, toys, hangers, etc. Also, helping customers with carry-outs. Managers are good, but if busy, we would busy, no wasting time. Co-workers are friendly and very team helping."
good,Depending on when I scheduled to work I would show up for work and immediately start unloading merchandise onto the sales floor and the appropriate areas. If the lines would get too backed up then I would step in and help by getting on a register and moving customers through the lines with as little wait as possible.
good,"for summer its super hot winter its cold they really need to fix this problem its really hard to work like this and they don't really let you wear winter coat,and for 3 moth mandatory over time a lot of us have family or are single moms its hard to do some thing like that..."
good,wasnt my best work experience. easy job. inconsistent hours
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and going to relieve someone and take over their register. You stood in the same spot (if busy) for up to four hours at a time just pressing buttons on the register while talking to customers and promoting the store card."
good,"Push out new freight, straighten out the fitting rooms and the folded tables, help customers, answer calls for your department. Run up to the cash register to help when needed. Cover breaks for others, help a hand in finding stuff from out back in the stock room or by carrying out large items to peoples cars."
good,"Good place to work during the holidays for extra money, however after holidays you get about 4 hrs a week."
good,"Working in clothing and accessories. Management was acceptable. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part was lack of hours, small pay, and no benefits. Working with the public was the most enjoyable."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Unloading store merchandise and all store stock from trucks. "
good,I work out I the check out aisle.  So sometimes it can get busy ad other times it can be slow.  During down times I hang clothes and do some recovery to keep myself busy.
good,"Great team to work with, everyone works as a family. One person needs help there are many people to assist. Great prices and sales on items in the business. Very positive atmosphere, very accommodatable with outside life when scheduling to work. Hardest thing to do is be patient when a conflict occurs and you need a managers assistance to fix the solution because you have no authority to do so. A typical day for me would be to work at customer service, opening cash office which would require me to open the registers while counting the balance to make sure they equaled the amount needed. After cash office the store would be open and I would deal with returns, and payments and even exchanges or any receipts issues. I like to fix problems so I enjoyed working customer service."
good,I love helping others and it is a great company. The mangers have poor leadership skills and lack clear directions. The most enjoyable part is to put a smile on a customer face and know that they had a great shopping experience. I learned to always smile even when you are not able to make everyone happy but still try to the best of my ability.
good,"The hiring process was lengthy, after being hired it took almost a month to get my orientation. "
good,"It's a fast pace job with lots of great people and customers."
good,"Its a very quick paced environment. From my experience there I learned how to pace my self when having to do multiple things in a certain time period. My co-workers were very positive and motivational when times got rough working alone. The only hard part was being scheduled by my self on busy weekends, and having customers get irritated because I was unable to be every where at once. The most enjoyable part was helping my customers, and meeting new people every day"
good,"It is basically like any other retail job. Low pay, low appreciation, and can be highly stressful."
good,great job if only they did not use temp workers to be the primary driving force of the company to avoid paying benefits.
good,"Busy place to work a lot of stuff going on, lots of different tasks and people to work with"
good,Can be a fun place to work. They work with you on your schedule and have many perks for being employed with them.
good,"very easy and basic job, with very friendly and helpful co- workers"
good,"I was a good starting point to educate one’s self on what loss prevention does. However, there is not a lot of room for growth within the company. This company also focused on the physical numbers of shoplifters than preventing theft and making sure the store is up to date with operations. Daily activities consisted of reviewing transactions that took place the day before, review video footage, perimeter walks in and outside of the building, and building a good report with local police departments and employees."
good,a typical day at work for me was loading trucks for delivery to department stores and being harassed by others for not completing my task as fastly as others.
good,Make sure customers find what they need and want. there isnt much else to say
good,typical day was busy. my coworkers were decent. the hardest part was the difficult customers.
good,"The people for the most part are very kind and caring people and helpful as coworkers. The day goes by pretty fast because I'm constantly doing something which I like and has also helped me to manage my time better even outside of work, but just like every job it has its flaws which I would say the pay and a lot of the times I felt under appreciated for my efforts given to the company with providing great service to our customers. The customers would have to be the hardest part but it was part of my job so I didn't really mind it at the end of the day. My most enjoyable part of the day were my coworkers I'm a easy going person and can strike up a conversation with anybody so it was easy to get along with everyone."
good,I had a great time helping customers with Christmas purchases.
good,"A typical day at work is clean fitting rooms, check the recovery and clean up tables and fixtures. Help customers with anything they need. My co-workers are great, at least most of them. Management needs a little work; they tend to change things to make the store better but then slip make into their old ways. Don't exactly have respect for their associates. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable for me is knowing I helped a customer out."
good,I loved working at Kohl'.s Department Store. I loved working with the variety of customers and employees.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Store is very upscale and productive, but hours of work are fought over competitively."
good,Kohls values their customers and takes care of them with a Yes We Can policy. We do not let a customer leave our store un happy.
good,"Moderate place to work, compensation not enough for all the work required of the job, management could definately be better."
good,"Come in check your 500's call e3 to see where you will be places, also glance over walk sheet. Head to department and start working fitting rooms and keep an ear out for when more pos associates needed and head over there while keeping an eye on fitting rooms."
good,"I like working at Kohl's however, the pay wasn't enough for me to continue with it for long. I worked as a cashier which was an easy job. I rarely got hours and again they didn't pay enough. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for their credit card. I enjoyed it."
good,"Working at Kohl's can be fun if you make it that way- you have to be willing to do anything at the store and take the hours you are given.  Like any retail store the customer is always right and you cannot tell them no."
good,"After arriving at work I was to clock in, check all the fitting rooms, put all clothes back in their rightful place according to size and color, attend our daily meeting and goals for the day or night, I would help in any other department needing help in their area, help mark all clothes down for new inventory and new season of clothes, back up on register if needed, and before leaving we had to make sure store was clean neat and organized as if no one had stepped foot inside."
good,Enjoy it very good place help the children learn we did lots of fun thing with the children.
good,"A typical day at KOHL'S is that no day is typical!!  As in many retail stores direction, workload and people are always changing.  The hardest part of the job is figuring out how to balance all of the workload and still maintain a healthy work-life balance.  The most enjoyable part is the people and how passionate they are about KOHLS"
good,A day here is fun and the environment is relaxing but they do not give enough hours and mostly what they focus on is credit more than customers experience.
good,Worked at the register and assisted customers on finding items or explaining deals or the Kohl's card. This job allowed me to become better with customer service and work in a fast paced environment.
good,"A typical day a Kohl's distribution center consisted of fulfilling online orders by preparing, processing paperwork, and moving merchandise. During the holiday season, the usual ten hour work day increased to a twelve hour work day (November-January). Within the distribution center, there were two individual departments. I feel that the management had extenuating challenges of integrating the two departments which, in my opinion, lead to more erroneous orders. Aside from the poor communication between the individual departments, I feel that I was able to effectively establish a professional, yet friendly relationship with all of my co-workers and managers. The hardest part of my job at Kohl's was issuing orders to other employee's with little seniority. However, I was able to overcome most obstacles with minimal difficulty. "
good,"A typical day at my job is okay unless you are doing a closing shift which can be overwhelming at times. As far as my learning experience, i learned an incredible amount about how a company is ran, how to be a team player, assisting people with problems and being respectful at the same time as well as many other things. My co-workers are very helpful and considerate of me as well as everyone else they work with. The hardest part of my job would have to be recovering the store at night. This Kohls department store is the number one Kohls store in the company and we get a high volume of customers daily. Which means closing are incredibly messy, but the work always gets done. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with things they need. I enjoy people thanking me for helping them and most importantly pleasing the customer. "
good,"Ring out customers. Clean Departments."
good,"Kohl;s is a nice place to work but the hours are not available, I enjoy working with custoners and making sure they enjoyed their shopping experience."
good,Under paid associates are not happy and take on duties as a supervisor in most cases.
good,Wish the job would have been longer instead of seasonal. I also wish the pay was better.
good,I was a cashier and retail associate. I rang up customers purchases and handled the cash in the drawer. I also brought out new products and organized the floor space to incorporate products.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good, Worked fitting rooms
good,My store is particularly challenging due to the geographical area we have the local customers and a big flow from Mexico.
good,"Unload the truck, merchandise and backstock. Customer service as well."
good,The best thing about working for Kohls are the discounts and benefits. As a part time employee you are elegible for benefits after your first year. The worst thing is the pay it is awful to say the least. To say they are a multi billion dollar company $7-$8 salaries are laughable. Management is a joke and only takes action when there on the hook.
good,"This job was very well maintained just didnt offer enough hours, but the job it self was consistant and fun. My co-workers we're great to work with and we got along very well as well as management. I've learned the different materal and how to stock the merchandise properly."
good,Creating a environment that is positive so that our customers will have a great experience every time they visit our store.
good,backup at the registers when needed. recovering my section of the store which was children. had fun with the co-workers. bending was the hardest part of the job. interaction with the customers were good for me
good,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customer with every need, maintaining a presentable sales floor, and handling registers. I learned how to be patient with customers and the customer is always right. The management team worked well with employees. They were organized and kept employees and customers satisfied. My co-workers are all very friendly and outgoing people. They make work time enjoyable and are professional workers. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with unsatisfied customers or having to tell them that our policies will not allow us to perform certain requests. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing the customer with excellent service. Such as, knowing that they are leaving the store happy and satisfied."
good,Managed the freight receiving process
good,You interact with all different characters. I learned how to manage different situations.
good,I know little about KOHLS other than working there for a short while after college. The hours were not good but I feel if we weren't in a small town in Iowa with little room for advancement it may have been good. The pay was not good at all but it was a college town so it's expected.
good,"Worked in teams. Unloading and loading trucks by hand, using pallets and manual conveyor system."
good,"Depends on the management for the day, sometimes we have to have a lot of things done in little time and other times we don't. Co-workers are nice though. The hardest part of the job is the low pay and doing so much for little pay. The scheduling can be good and some times bad. Some weeks its 4 or 5 days of work and some weeks its just 2 or 0 days. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the store closes for the day."
good,"During my time with Kohl's I learned the importance of time management. My average day as the Visual Supervisor included checking my calender for set dates of new products and sales and working in accordingly. I would regularly check my e-mail for changes to corporate directives and notify necessary managers. The management overall was less than exemplary, but I was fortunate enough to have two very pragmatic bosses that really helped me achieve a lot."
good,"The work environment wasn't horrible, but it is retail. Management could've been a lot better. Customers could be terrible. The pay sucked. The hours sucked. Coworkers made it a lot better."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working there and the experience I had while helping customers and fulfilling the goals of the store.
good,"A typical day at work is very hard, I have no help in my department. I have requested additional help, but have not received any as of yet. I have learned how to process the truck on freight days, I have also learned how to re-sign and to develop my working skills. Management do not treat every employee as equals; favoritism is used among the employees. My co-workers are nice people to work with, the hardest part of my job is trying to complete an assignment without help when it comes to the inventory in my department."
good,Only part time. Very busy/steady work environment. Helped in developing exellent customer service skills. good management and staff. hardest part of job is dealing with angry customers. most enjoyable part of job is seeing those angry customers leave with a smile on their face.
good,It was always work to be done as soon as I got there. I learned that in order to get the job done you got to communicate and plan. Management wanted everything rushed without knowing what really needed to be done when they knew a visit was going to happen soon. The hardest part is keeping your done when you are covering half of the store without help. And the only thing I miss is my usual customers and my old co-workers that made it happen when it came to getting the job done.
good,The store could be better. I have learned working with others. The most enjoyable part of working at kohls is working with certain co-workers
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Greeting customers and helping them on a daily basis is a pleasure. When i was working at Kohl's, I learned great qualities about myself and others on howto treat everyone as an individual. Morning meetings before store opened were always great, because you knew your staff for the time you were at work. It definetly helps whn your store as a whole is a team, and is willing to have that family/friend environmen but in an apporopriate manner. I was disappointed with myself if I didnt help my customer to the best of my ability that I made it my job to find them around the store and alwas ask how I could improve my customer service. I am always willing to learn and improve. At the end of the day, as long as my last customer was satisfied, then I was always satisfied with myself as well."
good,I worked point of sale and shoes department. Mainly I assisted on the floor inventory of the shoe stock. It was a learning experience as my first job in retail.
good,The family of associates are the greatest. Every one pitches in and helps regardless of their department.
good,"I work at Kohl's for 7 years and I left for 3 reasons. First did not make enough especially after 7 years and being a supervisor. Second the hours, varied all the time. I needed something more consistent for my child. Third, way to much stress. It started to interfere with my home life and I was not going to let that happen. Oh and the benefits were not that good at all for the full time staff and really bad for the part time staff."
good,"Helping customers have a good shopping experience, assist them when they are ready to check out or with any questions. I learned a lot of customer service. Surrounded by great co-workers. Meeting new people and learning about customers different backgrounds and just being able to help customers."
good,Associates were great. I loved working with the customers.
good,"Was supervisor of my department, but was difficult given the supervisor. Supervisor seemed to be under stress and was upset with co-workers making it a difficult environment. Spouse got a job in a different town and so ended position there."
good,"Khol's is an okay place to work. Their training isn't very involved, but the jobs easy enough to learn on your own. They push Khol's credit cards though and if you don't get people to sign up you'll soon find yourself being talked to. I didn't like the store manager, he was rude and didn't bother to get to know workers as people. The assistant managers were nice and helpful though."
good,"Assistant managers are young and have very little leadership experience. They are very disorganized and do not communicate well. Working at Kohl's is like any other department store, tons to do and not enough employees working to do everything."
good,"I was a cashier. Maintain the cash register and helping customer check out. On my down time I would arrange the clothes on the racks near me. Once a week I would come in early to help with the freght truck. Very productive, never a dull minute."
good,"basic cleaning up sales floor,helping customers,merchandising,re-stocking. This isn't a place to work if you need money. This is more of a job I'm bored on weekends and I really don't need a job"
good,"No further comment. I would consider future employment with Kohls, part to full time."
good,"Great young growing company. The senior leadership has a definite vision on where, when and how they want Kohl's to grow and expand."
good,As my employer Kohl's has been a great place to gain valuable work experience. The company has allowed me to maintain full-time employment while attaining my bachelor's degree. I have been able to relocate with the company several times. I have learned various skills from Kohl's that will be assets to any organization I work for in the future.
good,fun easy going job. staff was good i enjoyed working with my team and making the customers happy. Many times it was slow paced but at times it gets fast paced. Great benefits and great pay. Employee discounts are amazing too.
good,"They barely give you hours, customers barely shop there because it located inside the mall and the job is pretty easy because customers was hardly shopping there."
good,The main thing I didn't like was the amount of work I did there and the pay wasn't very good. They were very flexible though with my hours. I did appreciate that.
good,Still I take  this job very seriously. I have a great day most of the time I just like  a more fast paced and challenging work environment that is borderline dangerous like construction work or industrial warehouse production factory work where you have to be at high alert at all times it's a great way to pass the time
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Peak season was okay after peak season is when it get slow and it's best if you have a second job. I went 3 weeks with out no schedule and had to find a another job.
good,"It’s great if you’re a high school student who needs a job, but otherwise not really. Advancement opportunities are few and far between and sometimes I question how some even became managers in the first place. It’s all about the bottom line with them honestly. I guess the associates are nice though."
good,I enjoyed my job at Kohls but management was very negative and created a poor work environment. You never got any praise for a job well done which caused employees to have a bad attitude.
good,"i was ""trained"" how to prepare online orders once and then left to navigate the store by myself and with the store consistently changing with the holidays and season it was hard to learn where everything was."
good,probably one of the best places ive ever worked. management was useless but associates are amazing and fun. The job is super easy and self explanatory. I learned customers always feel entitled and take everything with a grain a salt
good,"This job was my first job out of high school. I was more of a learning step for me. I did like it there, but it just was not for me. I highly recommend it to those who have free time or are retired!"
good,"Its great in the begining when you are actually noticed for the hard work you do, and slowly after a certain amount of time you will be ome burned out because the management will always overload you and are usually very rude."
good,"Poor schedule, wouldn’t respect my schedule and wouldn’t make me change my hours. Workers there should mind their own business and help other new employees."
good,I liked working here and worked very hard only to get laid off. Very disappointed because i advanced rather quickly and took initiative to learn all i could about every area of the warehouse.
good,Great for a first time job. They are a lil messy at the store I had so there was a lot of chaos and it was never anyone on time. You were expected to do your job and your manager's job.
good,I only worked for a short time because it was a seasonal job but overall working there was a good experience first time working at a retail job and it went great.
good,"Once settled in, you go through the motions. The specifics will depend on which part of the warehouse you are sorted to, which for me, meant doing packaging."
good,"Just like any other retail job. Luckily was in a location where I had a lot of great coworkers, made the day go by quickly, and made tasks easier. Had lots of management changes, some great, some terrible. Learned a lot about retail and clothing industry after 7 years. Zero benefits if you are part time, but will be very flexible with availability and time off if part time."
good,"The Kohls I started at was a great place to work because the employees and managers were friendly and understanding. We were understaffed, and the managers did their best to make everyone feel important and valued, as well as understanding that corporate goals are not to be met at the expense of your entire crews morale. Second store tried to force few employees to meet said goals."
good,"Great company, good pay. Training was fun and i learned a lot. I love that this company is soft collections. They are strict on attendence that is why I am no longer there."
good,"Kohls as a company is a great place to work. I know the management at the specific location I was at, wasnt very good. Karen the GM wasnt understanding, and belittled everyone on staff."
good,Was sick for a week and was told that my need to run to the bathroom was okay so long as I wasn't in the middle of helping a customer when it happens. As i was very sick and could potentially have to run to bathroom at any moment. A few days later they told me in a Meet jg that my disappearing acts as they called it were a problem and they would need to let me go
good,"It was alright, management could use some work and the overall culture isn’t very welcoming. My training was two work days and it was a very brief not at all detailed training. I eventually got the hang of it but it took some time."
good,"Highly recommend not applying for part time if you’re looking to work here. Part time sales associates hours are beyond inconsistent and management loves hearing themselves speak - specific to an Ohio location - "
good,"The job was good , easy , a bit tough, overall I got my work done. not many friendly people, & the management lacks respect for one another. Only needs more days of work, working two days a weeks isn’t paying the bills."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I would typically clock in and get right to work. I learned the cashier system pretty fast and was able to work on my own pretty quickly. I learned time management through my job. I enjoyed always having something to do, if no customers were in line I would work on organizing the places around my register."
good,I go into work and I’m in packing so it’s a day of me scanning and boxing/bagging items or I get put in shipping sometimes and I would go and load trucks
good,"Sometimes slow, depending on the shift you worked. Sometimes fast paced, also depending on the shift time. Good employees and good management, very friendly."
good,unload trailers . in morning had meeting to inform us of what we had for the day. was a great culture . management was great to work with. most enjoyable part was end of the day and paycheck
good,it can get kinda boring working at amazon but nonetheless it was a good entry level job i learned a lot by working there you meet a lot of good and friendly people that come into the store
good,Part time can be flexible. Full time is not as flexible as far as scheduling. There isn’t much room for advancement. Holiday scheduling will include a lot of hours but non seasonal times the hours are cut greatly.
good,"Kohl’s was a really nice job and I learned a lot. I just didn’t like that they based your  hours off of how many credit cards you get set up. I want to go to work and not feel pressured to have to scam people into setting up for a credit card, it just doesn’t feel right."
good,"busy, customer service oriented, family oriented, learning, independence, people skills, team work, communication, connection, respect is highly important"
good,"Mostly stocking and customer centered environment. Low hours per week decent for a part time/ supplement income or retired person hobby. Advancing is possible and usually encouraged if one is so inclined, usually promote from within and offer decent benefits for full time"
good,A typical day at work for me was either ; just standing at a cash register with nothing to do or I was folding clothes all the time. The management there is not at all understanding and they are always yelling at people for doing the right things. I learned to work cash register and fold.
good,I enjoyed my job up until now when the store manager decided to start getting extremely rude with me and treating me poorly. If the store manager wouldn't of been so rude and unprofessional I would still consider keeping my job there.
good,Kohls was an okay job seasonal so it is a good thing because it gives you a chance to make extra money during Christmas time I like that they gave you options of the days you wanted to work and how many hours you wanted to work I didn't like that you have to sweep for 10 hours out of the 12 hour shift
good,"It's a team environment. Daily tasks are assigned to each associate. It's pretty laidback, but fast paced at times. It's mandatory to be a cashier incase additional cashier is called. Overall I enjoyed working there, but it does get repetitive."
good,"Typical day consisted of routine tasks like cashiering, providing customer service, and working on the floor of the store. The management was not too involved personally with the staff, and often failed to provide proper training for duties before assigning them. Hardest part of the job was trying to perform those tasks i was not fully informed on, as well as the pressure to do those said tasks with little information."
good,They are great. They work with you and are friendly. They are helpful and great with customers. Some associates could be rude or mean but other than that it was great.
good,"Kohl's is a nice place to work. Everyone is pretty nice and good at what they do. How things are run within the store can be a bit disorganized. Also if you apply for a sales floor position and end up getting it, you will be in store support also. Meaning you will also have to tend to other departments that need assistance on the sales floor including cashier, customer service, Amazon returns and more. It is a great place to gain experience in all areas within retail."
good,Treat you ok but some of the employees have jealous tendencies if you're doing good.   Management are half way decent.   Pay sucks and act as if you're getting paid like a millionaire.
good,"Had large staff, busy for holidays. Workplace was a bit large, unable to communicate openly with staff as shifts were scattered. The managers weren't always on the same page, and they did not manage changes to work schedules well. i.e. I had to take days off to testify in a court case, and though the SM said she wouldn't schedule me on those specific days, I was still scheduled. I then asked to have my shifts covered, and I was told to reach out to coworkers. However, the staff was 40+ people, and I had no one's contact information and was unable to get my days covered. hence, i quit because of the scheduling issue."
good,"They don't give hours. They schedule 6 hrs shifts. After 6 hrs nobody is asked to stay. Merchandise remains unopened til the next day when another truck is unloaded. So more to open with less people. When there is too much unopened boxes, managers complain. Complain they have no hrs to give. How do you not have hours for the holidays? Managers only create more work to do and complain when I isn't finished."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Although I had friends that works there with me, Their turnover rate was high, most of the management team didn't care about their employees, and the starting wage is not enough everything employees have to do."
good,"Unless I was getting credits. they didnt really care about me."
good,"The job is very straightforward and easy, the customers are the most difficult part. Mostly middle aged women work there and they’re usually very nice and helpful."
good,"Pretty much exactly what you would expect working in retail. Overworked, underpaid, and easily replaceable. Discount is great though. Management really does try to help out as much as possible, just a very busy location."
good,"As with many other employers, there are pros and cons to this one.  On the positive side, I greatly enjoy the interaction with many of the customers who come through my.  Not only do I assist them with product information and discounts, but I also have learned many things from them that have helped me with my job as a cashier.  "
good,Kohls was a great place to work while I was finishing or going through school. they were flexible enough with my schedule. I woo;d recommend this job for a part time work
good,"I did enjoy my time at kohl's, for the most part. It's a good place for a younger person who is just looking to make some cash during a summer break from high school, and who wants to add to their resume. If you are a college student, you should definitely be looking for internship opportunities elsewhere."
good,"Kohls was a great place to work with fun and energetic people. The environment was relaxed yet fast paced and the work was continuous, repetitive and easy to manage. I would work here again if i had the opportunity to."
good,I was really never told what to do each day I had to figure it out. Had to work in multiple departments and Finnish all of my duties as well as the other jobs.
good,"You work little hours, but the people and management are great. Lots of free food in the breakroom, so that slaps. The worse part is trying to hit the credit goal everyday, and the annoying customers. You work every department in the store with little training, but it teaches you to be independent."
good,Dont work retail if you have a family. You dont make enough money. People will always shoplift. The policy caters to the shoplifters. Maybe for a internship.
good,If you must work in retail them I'd consider Kohl's. They give excellent employee discounts. But expect to work EVERY weekend and holiday and the store opens really early and closes really late
good,"I worked at Kohl's in high school and it wasn't a bad place to begin learning customer service. I enjoyed my job (when I wasn't asked every shift to stay after) and the people I worked with, including management."
good,"This job was fast paced and fun because it was a switch from my traditional type of work. However, the salary was very low, working hours were often long and there was not a lot room for advancement."
good,I loved working there it was a good experience at first but once I was getting into cashier one of the mangers didn’t understand that I’m not a one time Learner and expected me to learn it once. I mostly cleaned out the fitting rooms. Made the clothing look presentable.
good,"To much turnover, to little appreciation of their own staff, to eager to replace for the same level staff or often inferior.  To much H1-B contracting."
good,I really loved working at Kohl's but the only problem I had was with the supervisors. they were not professional at all. I only worked during the season and it seemed like the favored the regular employees and not the seasonal employees. I would not want to  work there again because of this.
good,Working there was an experience 50/50 I would have to say on the good and bad level I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and most of the customers that you will meet
good,"Learned all operations of completing customer's purchases, applying daily discounts as published by Corporate.  Long lines, but I was a speedy, positive and happy Customer Associate."
good,"I worked in the back helping unload trucks, and with backstock, sometimes went on the floor to stock items. Learned how to unload a truck and backstock. Being off of the floor and in the back was my favorite part of that job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Good discounts for employees. Willing to work with you when you need help. Flexible hours. Always have good sales where as a employee you can get up to 55 percent off.
good,"Kohl’s work experience helped me be more outgoing. Helped me learn great customer service, and how to deal and help all types of customers. Really enjoyed working here."
good,I worked there as a student in college and they were pretty flexible with my hours so theres no complaints on that end. I had a good staff and good managers.
good,It's a good part time job.  The people who work there are great to work with.  Management is easy to talk to. Salary should be increased with the amount of work that is asked of you.
good,Their main concern is to push credit cards.  They say they want the customer to have a great experience in the store but it’s hard to say so positive when you know you’re gonna get in trouble for not reaching a goal. They will pull associates from doing their job on the floor to walk around to open credit cards.
good,"If you like working with the public and selling clothing and home goods, it may be a good fit for you.  The drawback to the job was that there was no guarantee of a set number of work hours per week, unless you were a department manager."
good,"relaxed work environment, not too stressful unless holiday times. Managers were good and you are able to openly communicate with them. overall good place to work at"
good,"Kohl's is a high performance workplace.  Work is high pressure there is a lot expected from management.  There are a lot of call outs so if you work on a day that there are call offs, most of the time the person working will have to carry the load"
good,It was an okay first job to have. Constantly busy. Rude customers. It wasn't my cup of tea at 17. The coworkers I had made the shifts better though. Easy training.
good,Kohl's was nice while it lasted. The only people the Mgrs keep for longevity are the persons that upsell  Kohl's credit. Local commute. Nice benefits.
good,The supervisors pushed for the employees to get customers to get kohl’s cards & if you didn’t meet their requirements for the kohl’s cards they would cut your hours. Didn’t seem fair. The customers wouldnt want the cards so they don’t get in debt which is understandable but the supervisors weren’t trying to hear it
good,Customer would call in looking for a item. You would have to go online into their shopping cart and look for the item they wanted. Help them find it. It could be a pair of shoes or sheets. Just help them shop for what every they need help finding. Those are the best calls.
good,I didn't love working at Kohl's. The customers were often rude and the store was constantly unorganized and messy. Managers were zombies... no one really liked it.
good,"This was a part-time position, but the hours were terrible and all over the place. Some weeks they would have me working only Friday and Saturday from 9-5. The hours made it impossible to get another part-time job. I did enjoy the creative aspect of the job and getting to be around makeup."
good,"Team work not really a thing, you have teams of people to do specific task but team members dont realy assist one another after training you're on your own."
good,It was a good seasonal job and i wpuld recomend anyone how needs temporary employeement to join their team. I enjoyed working there and learned valuable work experience
good,Everyone was friendly to work with. They care about their employees. Willing to work with everyone's schedule. Always making sure everyone has something to do.
good,"They start off by giving you a lot of hours but as you progress they lower your hours a lot, unless you are a full time. They would be low on money and eventually skip a week of our pay day."
good,The Kohl's I worked at was either completely dead or jam packed and people generally came to the jewelry counter as a way to cash out without getting in the main line.
good,"hours are given by how hard you work and how many credit card apps you get, expect to work a lot of hours during the holiday season then go almost no hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They give you so much work, and work you like crazy for such a low pay. I feel the minimum wage at Kohl's definitely needs to be increased. The environment is pretty relaxed as well."
good,Cheerful management that peps you up to work and always willing to assist. The communication between employees could use a bit of work but they ban together to finish every task
good,"Overall the job experience was rewarding and helped build my confidence. I loved my team. They were the best. However, members of the management team had often mistreated and harassed various employees over the littlest things, making the initial job itself more stressful and difficult that it needed to be in the first place."
good,"In the beginning, I loved my job. I was excited to go to work and I learned a lot. However, eventually they stopped training us and you were just thrown into the job. I had little knowledge of what to do and there was little to no staff to train which made it hard. I loved my time there and the discounts received but the stress of picking up the slack became quite frustrating."
good,"Much more labor intensive than you would expect.  As long as you are okay with being on your feet and moving for long periods of time, you should be okay."
good,It was an okay job. But they didn't give me enough hours. It was fun in the sense that I got to work with clothes and some of the co workers I liked some I didn't
good,"A descent job for anyone looking for flexible hours for school. It's a revolving door of high school/college students for the most part, though the managers who do stay are all pretty reasonable. I wouldn't expect any significant change as far as raises, and it has the usual boom-bust retail situation for pre-post holidays when it comes to hours. Expect to learn a lot on your feet, but if you show an effort you really cant go wrong here."
good,"First starting out at kohls was a decent job, nothing too hard. But then as time went on they ignored about scheduling people or belittled some workers."
good,"While the atmosphere and some people were friendly and very inviting at kohls, the management needs a serious re-work. From playing favoritism to bluntly telling you just how unreliable and untrustworthy you are at your job if you dont solicit credits every shift."
good,"I've worked with this company for 4 years, and truthfully the company itself isn't a bad place to work. If there is good management at the location your at, then you will have no problems."
good,"Great holiday job for extra money. College students, High school students. Opportunity for growth in the company.  The managment team was pretty good. Strict attendance policy."
good,I only worked there as a seasonal worker in the jewelry department. Overall it was nice working there some days I could be working in any department. It was one of those place you had to learn fast. It was very fast paced. I enjoyed the experience that I gained from there.
good,"This is a fun, great place to get your foot into retail. College students would benefit greatly from working here. The hardest part of the job was dealing with excessive use of authority."
good,It can be kinda slow or fast pace there was no really in between. Either there was too much to do or none at all. Always expected you to finished everything in one day.
good,"It was very fun, competitive all anyone cares about is credits! I had a very rude manager but it wasn’t really bad. I liked working there. The co-workers were a lot of fun. They were like a family"
good,I took this as a contract position. I found that the employees and management were friendly. I can't speak to their regular employee compensation but they all seemed happy.
good,Working at Khol’s was ok it was seasonal. Per the hiring staff it was supposed to have been 6 months guaranteed of work we were let go at the 3 month mark not good.
good,This is a good job to have if you don't like being bored. There is always something to do and some way for you to be productive. Long hours can be tiring though.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"If you’re looking for a part time job that is seasonal, and gives decent pay for the work, then this is the job for you. I recommend buying a pair of khaki pants, from Kohl’s."
good,I believe that all people should be given a chance to prove themselves capable of doing a job to the best of their abilities some jobs are better for the person than others
good,Had a good learning experience and learned new skills. Would recommend kohls to friends and family to apply for employment at a kolhs store for part or full time employment
good,"Talent is not recognized nor promoted but casual environment in working and seasonal work granted.Attendance  Bonus opportunities make it worth while even though it was taxed at a higher rate. Many people have job insecurities but most are trained properly and can help when needed."
good,"Mostly stressful, customers fill the fitting rooms with piles of clothes and mess up the tables, associates from the before shift are lazy and leave the closers with all the work, managers don,t do anything to help, they do work with your schedule, discounts are good."
good,Well it's always good to be at work on time don't get in the way of other mind your own business well work don't talk to much telling your problem to others because its not none of there business.
good,Kohls had a management program that I was involved in. Kohls is focused on their employees.  Benefits were good.  Salary pay was low for the number of hours worked
good,"Management in this job was horrible. A typical day of work consisted of maintaining the floor clean and helping customers, super easy. The hardest part of working here was the lack of hours. They  were not flexible in schedules , and you had the most random shifts"
good,"khols is a great place for single part time students to work, but not recommended for those who need full time pay. Managment will not give you full time sheduale"
good,only work there for the holidays and had lots of interations with customers and having to deal with loud and chaotic situations that were always met by everyone
good,"It wasn't hard work at all, given the opportunity I would work there again. I would most definitely recommend this job to somebody looking to make good money"
good,Was nice place to work for the manager was really nice the people are nice to work with the customers are friendly nice place to work has ok benefits and partys
good,Only did an internship their for eight short weeks at a larger location. Very happy it was an internship because I quickly learned I could not do that for a lifetime.
good,Love the atmosphere  at kohls.  The management makes it easy to enjoy.............flexible hours for part time employment .... ........... ............ .##################
good,Depends on your store location. Management will make or break how you like working there and how stressful it is. They hire from within sometimes.....
good,"0614 has the WORST MANAGERS I have ever worked with. Very Unprofessional, rude, power trippers, no department training, no constructive criticism, favoritism, inconsistent schedules, verbally harrass associates in front of cudtomers. Very hostile work environment."
good,My biggest issue with the position was compensation. I made $9.00 to work the service desk. I definitely was given a fair amount of responsibility without the pay to match. The employee's were all very nice to work with and management to work for. It served my purpose of having some extra money for the holidays.
good,The building was beautiful and the work spaces were ample and well appointed.  Atmosphere was friendly but guarded. Learned alot about drawings and how much is involved in the store layouts.  I got a real appreciation for the people who work there.
good,Working at khols is very good for a first job. You gain custumer service expirience and you learn how to work a cash register and you learn how to do thing in a quick way  but well done.
good,Pay was average. High turnover rate of associates. There's not much availability for career advancement. Management cares more about numbers than associates.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"During my time it was a good fast paced experience, i had opportunities to learn what i had to do and work with my co workers to finish certain tasks."
good,"Management would push you nonstop to get credit card sign ups, and would be mad if you didn't reach a certain amount. Customers were extremely whenever there was a problem."
good,Sometimes there would be conflicting schedules. We may may not always start at the same time .  I almost didn’t start because management dirent call to let me know I passed my background chemin
good,What I learned from working at kolhs was managing to pack and scan everything to get a good rate by fast paste working. It was really easy. A typical day at work was getting straight to my job and getting my work done.
good,"I would sign in electronically, then monitor cameras in the LP office. Apprehend potential shoplifters and file on certain cases with the local police department and go to court to represent my company. I would clear fitting rooms and depending on the circumstances try to deter the theft depending on the individuals behavior."
good,"Most employees were helpful, it is a fast paced job. I was a truck unloader and stocker. Training is poor compared to other places that do the same work. Upper management is hard to contact unless it is a serious problem (customer related etc,).Hardest part of the job is unloading trucks by hand, using a conveyor roller system. Workplace culture is mixed, but mostly young people work in the position I held."
good,"Kohl’s was a good experience in a new city. Good working environment. Pretty slow paced. Some opportunities to grow. However, some unrealistic credit sales expectations."
good,"HOWEVER, there are many other retailers out there that offer a much higher starting pay than Kohl's.  I think the company's priorities are out of whack & lack properly training their staff. They want to be a green store but are losing sales as a result due to the store being too hot and customers leave sweating (I'm talking running down their faces sweating).  That also makes it hard on the employees. I, for one, don't particularly like being soaked in sweat & feeling stinky. "
good,The reason why I'm writing about Kohls warehouse is because they do a Lot of layoffs out there and sometimes they keep a couple people on permanently and the rest are just seasonal.
good,"The interview process was pretty simple. The job was nice, we were efficiently trained to do our jobs. Holiday season was interesting, only because of the way they scheduled, it didn't leave much time for family."
good,"Typical day at Kohl’s would be go in and put your food away . Go to lockers , after that go clock in . I would go and get a safety sheet for my machine I was operating . Fill it out and get the work day started . Dropping off stuff where it needed to be dropped off"
good,"Kohl’s was flexible with my school schedule. I feel like they paid ok. I left because I wanted to work with kids. I wantedweekends, nights and holidays off."
good,"This is the perfect job for a college kid trying to make money and balance a class schedule. I can’t speak to any other benefits because I was never a full time employee. I can say the way the main store manager treated me and the other employees left something to be desired. She wasn’t the most friendly person and she didn’t care treat her employees with respect, especially the ones that had been working there for years."
good,"Fun and fast paced. You have to be a true people person to enjoy this position, it brings out the best and the worst in people. I learned a lot about myself in this position."
good,I loved working for kohls usually a fun environment with the right people there is room for advancement if you show that your interested and willing. I am currently considering reapplying to the company.
good,I enjoyed assisting the customers and opening up new accounts.   Getting the benefit to shop at a discount helped at Christmas time.  Enjoyed the low prices for clothing.
good,"Not really much to say about this one. This is basically the physical embodiment of what you think of first upon hearing ""retail job"". Pay and hours are decent though I didn't work there for very long."
good,Not enough Hours or pay for the amount required in retail. No paid vacation or pto or benefits at the time. crazy stressful place around the holidays.
good,This company was friendly and helpful for new hires.  They are very good at training you for the position you work and are willing to promote you and give you extras jobs to do
good,"High pace at times, always on your feet. Management always pushing credit card promotions. Never enough staff to answer questions for customers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Overall good company. It has its challenges like most companies. Retail is a challenging environment. Kohl's has been somewhat slow to change & making decisions.
good,Kohls provides a friendly wholesome environment for its associates to thrive in. You'll find Kohls prizes customer service engagement over all and that the customers satisfaction is the goal.
good,I would help people check out there clothing and stuff they were gonna buy. And also I would have to change price tags and signs and help people try and apply for a kohls credit card.
good,The company does not compensate its teams appropriately. Pay is regularly below average and when asked you are told to “find another job if we do not like the pay”.
good,Long hours and Metrix focused. Low staff makes tough work culture. Learned a lot of management skills that I was able to use in my next role and good salary for new college graduates.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Kohl's for the time I was there. I loved my employees and the atmosphere was very positive, however the amount of pay compared to the amount of work you are expected to do are very far apart."
good,The culture of kohl's is as face paced as you can get. The pace that you go at to get the orders together makes it competitive for co-workers. I'd recommend this job to friends.
good,I worked for kohl's for almost 8 years. When I left kohl's I was only making 10.48 per hour. They kept telling me I would move up in the company but never did because they always hired outside the store.
good,They are good if you aren’t in a young mindset but if you are ready to work and want to be hired in overall they are not that bad to work for especially in the receiving department
good,"My biggest complaint was the fact you would have to be on the registers for hours but yet they expected you to get all your freight done, returns done, fitting rooms done, and fill your department.  When you did not they came down on you hard."
good,"I have learned a lot from working at Kohl's and have worked in every area of the store, however managers don't necessarily always know what's going on and hours are hard to come by. It is also a very credit driven company, which is not something I like and I don't think the pay is worth all the work that is put on employees."
good,I actually liked it there. Colorful and mindful work place. very busy place because of the amount of people who work there and it is very clean and presentable
good,I really don't know. Its been over 10 years and I hope that they have changed for the best of there company. During my experience I covered two to three department
good,It's an ight place to work but definitely don't go send try to make a career out of it as you are very very easily replaceable.                                         .
good,"It’s a mindless job that will provide new friends. That about sums it up. Management likes to micromanage instead of letting you do your thing. Checks throughout the night where you are in your zoning of the merchandise section assigned to. Continuously doubts your ability to handle cashier responsibilities, like they can’t remember who knows how to do what. The hours get ridiculous in November and December which is not ideal for students as that’s exam season. My hours increased from 10-15 to 30-40. Temp hires in the holiday season are terrible and barely checked out before hired."
good,On a typical day I would be in charge of the coverage of 1-2 departments. I am in charge of cleaning the dressing rooms for the departments as well as cleaning the displays. I am also to listen for backup on the registers when there is a rush and in the mornings I am to work the freight for the departments. It's a very busy job but at least time goes by fast.
good,Good place to work as a summer job or just getting started in retail. Could have done better with promoting from within. Most new mangers were from competition.
good,"Kohl's is good job to start your experience in the work force but not as a life time career. When you start, it gives you a good sense of your real life work environment."
good,Typical day is stocking and sorting shipments. Meet and greet customers. It was a laid back work. I recommend it to people who do not like to work alot
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was an intern with two weeks under his belt, and they already had me running two departments and training other people crazy. I just thought it was a lot of work for a new worker."
good,"A typical night at work started by signing in to your register and straighten your area if they are no customers. I liked the overall job but, the pay was low and it they put a lot of pressure on cashiers to have people sign up for credit cards. It put pressure on customers."
good,"I worked at Kohl's as a seasonal employee after quitting my previous employer. Working at Kohl's is a typical retail employer if anyone's ever worked in retail. It can be both fast and very slow paced. I was only there for three months but I think I picked up the how to's of the job pretty quickly. Management is okay, though there are some you want to avoid as much as you can. I worked mostly in the stock room and there could be some improvements on the logistics and stockroom side of things, but every store has a different process, some stores are just more organized than others. Overall, I enjoyed my short time there as a seasonal employee, I just wished they paid a bit more."
good,When I first started I really enjoyed it. However as time went on I started to hate it. I worked in customer service and let's face it customers can be so rude especially when they're returning items without receipts. Those who work the service desk know what I'm talking about.
good,There was no advancement. I really do not have much to say other than I enjoyed the employees.  My co-workers were the best but the company started going south once doors closed.
good,"A typical day at work was to find purchases that were made online and package them to sent them out. Also customer service, to help and guide any of the customers and to organize the store before closing."
good,"Had managers call off frequently forcing others from other departments to attempt to manage multiple areas at once slowing productivity, zero trust in employees, no benefits unless your there long term. Short breaks, Ive worked there on and off for a few years and the good management gets promoted away or finds a better job."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at Kohl's.  It was a good starting Retail job.  Not a bad culture for Retail.  No unrealistic expectations while I worked there.
good,Easy for a first job. Not too hard on work hours and are flexible. Management was fine when I was there. It had its ups and downs. You are required to sell gift cards
good,its productive fun job and a lot of nice people . Moving you to different dept everybody. theyre are so many workers that its not comfortable eating at breaqk time and rest room are so dirty
good,Working retail is never going to be fun unless you're some kind of masochist. This job is no exception. Management was all right. You were expected to do multiple jobs in one shift but got paid barely above minimum wage.
good,Retail job. You can’t really expect much from it. It is tiering and boring. But it can be flexible with your schedule. However that often leads to them scheduling us too little.
good,Good place to work. People are very friendly and helpful. You can let them know your hours and days of eligibility and they schedule around you. I always shop at Kohl’s so helping customers find what they were looking for was easy.
good,"Overall if you enjoy working in warehouse environments this job is for you, the only thing I would stress is the lack of communication and professionalism with management."
good,"Kohls is a good company to work for on a short term basis, this is due to lack of pay and advancement.  Had the position I was in there paid more per hour, maybe it would have been enough to live off of.  Also, the hours were inconsistent each week, and I was never given more than a couple days a week to work.  I loved the people I worked with, but since the compensation was not enough and there were no full time positions other than management, I had to seek other employment."
good,The supervisors really stress Kohl's Charge Card sign ups. Has different parts of the day where it can get pretty tough. Always have good hours around holidays.
good,Pretty slow-paced work place. A lot of walking around during your shift but working with co-workers makes the days a lot better. Assist customers and help them with their shopping needs.
good,basic department store experience. Sometimes we would have to deal with unhappy customers but the manages were supportive and helpful in those times. Good first job to teach you the ropes of retail.
good,Kohls is a retail job so it's probably not the most enjoyable. I worked the close shift so we did a lot of zoning which isn't the most fun. It didn't pay very well so that probably helped to not make it very enjoyable. Wasn't one of my favorite jobs
good,"Working at Kohl's is not a place to work if you always need to be doing something like me. Kohl's is very slow paced on the weekdays, but weekends can be stressful at times."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a nice Experience very good management I learned a lot to treat costumer and organization every day is a new experience to upgrade skills for future
good,I love Kohl's it is a great place to work and a great first job. The atmosphere working at Kohl's is amazing and it's all because of the team. There's no doubt in my mind that working at Kohl's is a bad decision.
good,"This job is only good for children, and people whom have a spouse with a real job. You will never get more than 20 hours,except maybe Christmas. Mostly its 15 hours a week. Its also a popularity game. This job is a perfect example of what happenes when woman run the show. Constant drama, in fighting,gossip, and pushing the blame. Also if you are a man you will be expected to do everyone's job. Suddenly no one can lift anything when you sre around. I was doing 3 or 4 peoples jobs, and only recieving the occasional (actual) pat on the back."
good,Overall good company to work for.  The only real issue I have is when the work load is light they send you home. You have to adjust to this if you have responsibilities.
good,"A day at Kohl's was a simple job. It wasn't challenging enough. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough hours given to me to live a regular lifestyle. I learn to fill in a lot of different roles at Kohls's such as: Sales Associate, Cashier, working in the jewelry department, which I liked because costumers where able to take their time with purchases while asking great questions for me to answer. The communication between the team was the hardest part of the job."
good,"the supervisor would let people go home and i would have to tackle jewelry and cashier all by myself at night, plus a million other jobs. it was horrible and stressful"
good,"It's really hard to handle trying to keep the salesfloor, fitting rooms, and return racks clean while being called up to the registers every ten minutes because the store scheduled too few cashiers. Management is too aggressive on credit and will freak out at associates once or twice every fifteen minutes. My coworkers were the best part of my job, and even they were a mixed bag. The turnover is obnoxious, and workers are allowed way too many no-call-no-shows before they are let go. Management has a habit of giving unworthy people lead positions and underscheduling in all departments, which makes the day much more stressful (especially closing). "
good,"improved cashier functions and customer service skills.  Only hired for the winter holidays not able to continue working after the holidays."
good,"Retail is Retail. There is consistency in job duties but not in how supervisors manage you. Credits are pushed highly, and there are incentive programs, as well as commission for credits you get from customers."
good,"I enjoyed that you could either stay in one job, such as cashier, or you could work doing other different jobs in the building. Its really nice to have that option."
good,"Kohl’s was fun to work at because of the co-workers, but a lot of the time the mangers have been in their positions for YEARS and are so burnt out they care very little about what’s going on. Also, they won’t advance or step down to let anyone else advance so it doesn’t ever happen."
good,"Personally, I didn't like working at Kohl's. The management was very rude and condescending towards me, probably because I was younger. I remember being afraid to even ask for a break, so that place is not my cup of tea."
good,The days can fluctuate some times they could be so slow or they could be stressful especially during the holiday season. Some of the people are old and rude.
good,Kohl’s pays more than minimum wage and has a very flexible schedule. The dress code is business casual and modest. The managers are slightly strict and are overall friendly. Holiday pay is included.
good,"Honestly it was a job. It was definitely not my favorite job in the world. The managers were alright, but nothing special. The only good thing about working there was the sales."
good,work starts with mini meeting let everyone how things are going. what to expect for the day. what the goal of the day is. where u stand compared to the people in the company. the most hardest part of the job is to stay at goal. the most fun part of the job is when we have fun active to do with the holidays or sporting events.
good,"The best part of my day was far and above getting to see my regulars.  The other employees were a second plus.  It made it worthwhile, and I've made long lasting relationships with both employees and customers"
good,"Its a decent company to work for. I only left because a nearby store closed down and we got their employees, and i ended up only getting 10hours a week."
good,"The job wasn't hard, but he managers expected you to solicit credit card applications from the customers.  a lot of times the customers would get angry and but the company doesn't really care.  but other then that when we had down time basically all we did was fold and clean up the store area.  Wasn't a position I could see myself in for  the long term at least."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It is a nice place to work as a temporary/Christmas time.  They have enough employee's that work here full time so temps get let go as of January 1st.
good,I didn't think how they put other people above you if they didn't like/ connect with you. I liked that I could be on my own but also talk to people. The hardest part of the job was trying to find something socially correct to wear because if they didn't like what you worse you would be pulled aside.
good,"Super busy during holidays or peak sale days, super slow other days. Management expects the same productivity no matter how busy without extra help. Department supervisors have to maintain a large area, help out with customers, help other staff, etc. Not enough time in the day to get everything done. Stockroom is a mess, attitudes are frequently negative towards management, but co-workers bond under stress and there are frequently outings. :-)"
good,"Kohl's will push you out of your comfort zone and make you comfortable with speaking with consumer's, even if you have social anxiety. I went from being a shy person to a social butterfly while working here simply because I was pushed out of my comfort zone to speak with customers and getting to know my fellow coworkers."
good,Good place to gain loss prevention experience in a demanding retail environment. Was acknowledge for hard work and given opportunities for advancement.
good,Great place to work. Had a lot of fun. Able to take breaks and lunch. Meet a lot of people and fast paced. Work in different departments. Learn about the retail business.
good,As stated above the store manager was difficult.  The manager would yell at folks and showed extreme favoritism to the few that she did like. Could not recommend this store for employment.
good,"Kind managers, friendly staff, you need to get people to open credit cards with kohls in order to get more hours, learned how to properly fold clothes,meetings before shift changes"
good,There are slow days and busy days. Just make sure to be on top of things and you'll be fine. Don't do something that you're not suppose to do and do the work right!
good,"Kohl's is fun to work at, especially since they are big on bringing in food for the employees for lunch breaks. The break schedule is stuck to pretty well. Overall the work isn't too hard but some of the people can be very rude, employees and customers."
good,"I had to quit due to personal safety reasons and because of that, they put me on the do not rehire list. It was not my fault I had to quit and feel putting on this list was uncalled for."
good,"Training needs improvement.  Current store management needs consistency and communication with all employees not just ""core"" employees. Coworkers are enjoyable and positive."
good,I only worked for the holiday season. Fast paced. Energetic. Busy. Was turned down for a part time job. Some of the workers were rude to the people who were working the season.
good,Super messy.. have so many employees working inside but not one of them knows what they are doing and can’t help other coworkers. Half of the customers aren’t even being helped properly due to lack of store knowledge and layout
good,"Great place for Seasonal work. Employees are given chance to choose hours to a degree, especially around the holidays. Employee discount is a nice incentive."
good,Go to locker put personal items away punch in and see where to work stock my work area. Assist customers with finding what they are looking for.  Assist with credit applications and credit payments. Process all purchases and close out registers.
good,"Typical Job Duties:"
good,Going to work was stressful and confusing most days especially on the weekends. There are many managers have different plans and routine on how to organize the store its confusing how they want the job done. If I was discussing with my coworker about the game plan on fitting rooms since they are an overwhelming mess. I would get yelled at because a manager would think that we are slacking off. I don't like when they make that assumption first before they understand the situation being discussed.
good,"I love the people I work with. I do not understand how a company that wants someone to work mon-fri justify the position as part time. If a person is obligated to work at Kohl's mon-fri, it makes it difficult to work elsewhere. They also offer their part time associates no vacation and no pto. Their payscale is very low."
good,"I love it! Great job but no pay or hours. I would highly recommend this job to a friend or two. Easy pace, great people and fun work! I would definitely go back to work at kohl’s if I had the chance and if there were better pay."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a competitive workplace. I learned how to work a cash register and handle customer service. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was the kind coworkers and managers.
good,"I enjoyed working with the people I did and the work I performed."
good,good if going to school and need a little cash flow. its ok place don't remember much since its been years since last i was their indeed just wanted this.
good,"I have had a good experience with kohls however I do not get the hours I was told I would get, u get paid lunches we have nice incentives but it is very fast paced there"
good,"This job was a good stepping stone for me, as I gained experience, and developed myself for what I really want to do. It was a part time job, and an overall fair experience."
good,It was a nice Experience very good management I learned a lot to treat costumer and organization every day is a new experience to upgrade skills for future
good,Kohl's was my first retail job. It wasn't my favorite job but it was an easy training process. I also wish that the management was a little bit better. The stress of opening store charges was a lot which played a part of resigning.
good,I enjoyed working with the other cashier. They were helpful to me when I had a questions. I was only seasonal help but enjoyed talking with the customers and helping with them when asked.
good,"Sometimes it is fast paced, sometimes it is slow paced. Overall it is an okay place if you love clothes. There is more of a pick up during the holidays."
good,The job is great especially if your are a student trying to work and go to school but retail is retail and customers are customers so this job helps you develop your people skills.
good,I liked working in a warehouse that is fast past. If I had the oportunity to go  back to a warehouse and make the money I make now I would go back no questions asked
good,This is the place where I learned the most about customer service especially that essentially 'the customer is always right'. It was very important to listen to what the customer had to say in order to help them in any way possible.
good,I clocked in then headed to check out which fixtures needed to be straightened up or redone altogether. The most enjoyable part was meeting new employees or customers. The hardest part was knowing what to do because my manager never really assigned me certain jobs to do around the store.
good,"Learned a lot about how their computer system worked. Learned how to sell credit. The management was alright, I hardly got to know any of the managers on a more personal level."
good,"It was insanely slow all the time, even on weekends "
good,"Some days were very busy others were slow. I worked over Christmas which was a lot of fun and very fast past. It was very satisfying to work as fast as you could to get the customers checked out in a timely fashion. I loved working with the public. It was a seasonal job, so I was sad to be let go at the end of Christmas."
good,"There's not much that I can say about this company as it has been almost four years since I worked here. I don't remember much about working there. I remember that Black Friday was horrible as everyone had to work a twelve hour shift, but that's about it."
good,This was my very first job and I believe that its a good job for beginners. Nice clean place. I worked there over 9 years ago but I'm  sure it hasn't changed to much
good,"The pay was not competitive with other retailers and department stores. Even with promotions and yearly raises, the workload was too much to expect for a lead or management position. Corporate dropped directives to direct sales and the way employees should be working, which was a draining effect of the job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The employees are overall very nice but the work was sometimes pointless. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other coworkers because they were fun.
good,"Kohl is a retail job with everything that goes with it. Dealing with customers and pushing the store card is what you generally do. Most of the mangers are nice, however some have obvious contempt for seasonal employees."
good,Friendly and caring staff and leadership.  Wonderful opportunity to learn more about retail.  Holiday season is very busy but the staff does what they can in order to make it worthwhile.
good,"good for young people in college and those who are retired. Interest and constantly keeps you guessing, hectic but cool people to work with. if you love retail this for you"
good,Good place to work but hours fluctuate and favoritism over who gets the most hours certainly exists. Management is out on the sales floor helping with work though.
good,I expected Kohl’s to be very intimidating for me considering this was my first real job. To my surprise the people there were very friendly and welcoming!
good,"Great work place, associates and management push to provide the best customer service and make sure their staff set a proper example that exemplifies the goals of Kohl's."
good,"Being that I was a seasonal associate at Kohls during the holiday season, sometimes we wouldn't be that busy then we had those days where we would get very busy. Working here taught me how to be more social and more understanding towards people. The management here was okay overall. I enjoyed being able to help people and meet new people when i worked. My least favorite part of this job was the favoritism that was showed to people when it came to the amount of hours that were worked. Some weeks I would literally get only one or two days of work within a week and that wasn't really beneficial to me."
good,"It's your typical retail job. There's never enough employees to go around, the pay for the work you're doing could be better, and the management is not on the same page."
good,"I had a good experience with this company, but towards the end of my time there I noticed that the company does not care about their employees and wants the to do so much that isn't reciprocated. I also did not get a lot of hours"
good,There is very little training before you're put out on your own. There's generally as few people possible scheduled. Management is often condescending.
good,"Working for Kohl's was simply OK. Some of the managers were very unhelpful and played favorites a lot.  The hours are slim to none, only for salary or full time employees."
good,"Decent job with a comfortable break room and discounts. However, the management was poor. I often found myself being yelled at, or if I was sick being talked down to for it. Naturally if an employee is sick it is only common sense not to get everyone else sick, but that is not how they see it."
good,Working at kohl’s was fun and tiring at the same time. My hours were decent for my first job and the people I worked with were great. I’d recommend this job and have before.
good,A typical day at work would start with unloaded and stocking retail in it's appropriate place. The hardest part of my day was to make sure that everything was placed in the correct spot after customers would misplace retail. This job was very laid back.
good,"A typical day working at Kohl's was in Customer Service. This required doing returns and exchanges for people. When there wasn't customers, I was marking down prices of clothes or tagging different things."
good,"It's worth what it is, but due to its incredibly low salary, it seems unrealistic to work there forever. Only good for part time college students or retirees with a pension to return home to."
good,"Kohl's has been ripping off their customers by double charging them for purchases made online and refuses to release from the double charge, despite already having the funds to pay for the item. When calling customer service, they continually make excuses as to why they will not release the funds they have placed on HOLD from the second fraudulent fund withdrawal."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was my first job out of high school, so as a teenager, I enjoyed working as much as I wanted to. I also liked how they paid weekly. All around, it was a positive work environment."
good,good company. sometimes unorganized . friendly employees. friendly manager. Decent hours. They offer more hours if you ask. Very flexible and school friendly
good,"Good place to start off. Great place to start and develop leadership skills; however, with the decline in brick and mortar business job progression is tough. Many individuals who have been in retail for years hold on tightly to their positions providing little room for growth and promotion of aspiring individuals."
good,I miss my Kohls customers. I always went the extra mile for them. Any questions comments or concerns I handled them for them. I always took extra time
good,"Confusing policies, one manager says one thing another contradicts, poor training, disorganized, but it's a job and I do like working with the majority of customers and the staff. Many times the computers and equipment malfunction and never get totally repaired and never replaced. Customer service has four computers at best two work most of the time. you have to be the one to find someone to cover your breaks, lunches, and bathroom breaks or you don't get them."
good,didnt like working there so much could have been a better experience didn’t give many hours that was promised to me once i started working plus they let there fav picks do anything
good,It's an ok place to work. The managers there need to be retrained and learn to be a lot nicer to employees and customers. What they pay isn't enough for living.
good,"When I was forst hired I had a good amount of hours for the weel to keep me living and in school, now I am looking for a second job because they never stoped hiring, and now I only work 4 per week,"
good,I enjoyed my time there.  Managers in both stores were not just focused on store numbers but genuinely  interested in the employees.  The morale among the other employees was good and was supported by management and incentives were also a contributing factor.  If there was a Kohl's closer to where I lived and the wages were higher than minimum wage than I would definitely consider working there again.
good,Busy and steady work days. Learned interaction with various type people of all ages and races. Management was overall pretty good. Hardest part was the late nights and the best my coworkers.
good,"I worked kohls as a seasonal employee, as well as the overnight shift.  It was very stressful and I was given an extreme amount of hours that I did not need."
good,The atmosphere of working has a friendly vibe. Management has a fair approach on informing both customers and employees of Company policy and dignity.
good,Kohls was a fine job. That is about all that I have to say about it. A general day involved me stocking shelves and folding towels. My only complaint is that the training was extremely poor and I had to find most things out on my own
good,"At first, I would say it was a good job to start off with. It was my first job, worked Sunday through Wednesday from 8:30PM-6AM, Replenishing and Packaging Online Orders. Then, the job started slowing after the holiday break and did not get enough hours."
good,"I was one of the fastest workers no matter what department"
good,I worked here over 10 years ago. I doubt anything is still the same so a review of employment from me would be useless. I'm sure its still a good place to work.
good,The best thing about working for Kohls was the benefits and the discounts. Its the worse management team I have ever worked for. I would not recommend them to anybody.
good,Co-workers have a positive attitude and are fun to work with.  Team work is used to resolve problems and get the job done.  Always busy so the time goes fast.
good,"Fun place to work if you're young, just getting started in the workforce and looking for easy money. As  cashier the job was easy but management sucked, everyone wanted to be chief of the tribe. Some managers would be real laid back and allow you to swap hours with other co-workers and some would scoff in your face and threaten to fire you if YOU didn't show up for YOUR shift. Coworkers are alrite and the type of coworker you get depends on where your store location is and who they hire, so you never know what/who you'll be working next to! But the discounts you get on clothing is great, so if this is a part time job for some quick cash to blow on okay quality clothing, then you'll love working for Kohl's."
good,"Environment is very ""cut throat"" and there is no room for error. In 12 years I have never received a promotion. Lots of pressure to be perfect. Often receive inaccurate or incomplete direction from upper management. The people are great and so are the benefits...those are really the only positives!!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was hired on for the holiday season to help with restocking shelves and various other duties... namely, helping to bag items. We were given little instruction and didn't know how to address customer inquiries when they came to us. I feel like the whole situation was a bit of a mess and it's probably much better now."
good,The Store is nice and calming while shopping. The layout of the store is convenient to walk around in. The sales ladies/men area always helpful and kind.
good,"Khols is a productive working environment. I do enjoy helping customers with their problems. The job is also stressful and very demanding at times, but it keeps me busy."
good,I worked at Kohls while in college and they were very flexable with my hours. I was able to work in many areas and not just stuck as a cashier. I worked at Cambridge mn location and then tranfered to Riverdale.
good,"Kohls department store is a good place to learn team building skills, independent work, time management and great customer service. Anything from freight to the floor to cashier, it's a fun place to work."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a good customer service experience. It gave me a better opportunity to interact with the customers more. Working at Kohl's being part of a team, the co-worker's did not feel as if they were any less or any better than ant other. Everybody was treated fair."
good,The work culture at Kohl's was fun and even paced. There was no shortage of diversity. The hardest part of the job was searching for hard to find items in the store as well as maintaining a neat work environment on busy days. The most enjoyable part of working at Kohl's was providing friendly and efficient service.
good,Mediocre Job at best.  vastly underpaid for the loss prevention field.  Heavy workload and job expectations with nearly no benefits.  Aggravating Supervisors.
good,I was always assigned night hours and more than the 20 hours per week as requested.  Hours were long for standing.  There was always a challenge.  Most of the people were nice to work with.
good,It's a good job if you like talking to people. It's really easy. They do a lot of hiring so you will have a good chance on getting hired or at least having an interview
good,"Not enough work hours to learn the jersey. If I could get more hours, it might make the job easier for me so I could be more productive. This is the time of year for holiday hiring."
good,It was a good job. The pay was fair and everything was run by the book. If i didnt have to move away i definitely would have stayed at that job. There was also room for advancement.
good,A typical day at Kohl's consits of me working the Cash register. We get slightly busy around noon until 3:00pm after that Ive been told to stand at the door and just greet customers or find busy work. This is the part of the job that I don't like. I am only being scheduled between 10-15 hours on a good week and when I asked for more hours I was only given one more day than what I already had. Its been difficult only working a few hours a week and getting payed $9 an hour and on top of that basically standing around at work when I am scheduled. The people are friendly and easy to work around but That's about the only pro of the job from what Ive seen so far. In my opinion this job seems more suited for a High school or College Kid. This is not for someone looking for a job that's gonna pay the bills.
good,Great company wish the pay was more. Loved my coworkers. Fun environment. Decent discount. Needs better flexibility with hours.Great products and merchandise.
good,Company was great when it came to trying to motivate associates but that's mostly due to the long hours they wanted you to work. During Christmas the hours were almost unbearable. Impossible for work/life balance.
good,I learned how to become a productive worker. Management was good they helped me & showed me what I had to do. The hardest part was leaving but I got back on my feet with Walmart best job I could have asked for.
good,It's a great opportunity to learn and advance to different positions. For anyone willing to excel this is a great opportunity for someone willing to learn
good,"Enjoyed it for the years I was there.  Employee's come and go but when you are left with a crew that is constantly pulled out of the department for ""more pressing things"" the department gets out of shape and gets put on the back burner for the next day, then they get pulled again which is a circle from day to day. Falls on someone, which was me.  I didn't take vacation at all to try to get the department up to standards and was fired because it wasn't 100%.  Upon firing vacation was null and void so any vacation is gone, no chance to cash in."
good,"Kohls was a good company to start a career in PD.  I was able to learn a lot and have a lot of opportunities at an age that I eager for advancement in the industry."
good,"The experience from Kohl's is very backbreaking work for little pay. You are expected at all posts to maintain the sales floor throughout the day, even cashiers. You are expected to maintain high numbers of credit card solicitation. The discounting system was very relaxed and made it easy to help encourage customers to save money in various ways, which felt helpful and accessible for people in this area. Very typical department store experience."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Typical day was fast pace and constant recovery. Learned a new skill in a retail with boxing and delivery. There were good days and bad days when dealing with management during Christmas season.
good,"The day was always very busy during the holidays you would get up to 6 to 7 trucks a week. The amount of help changed with each year, less in numbers."
good,"Stoking up and putting items on display, working the register and helping customers."
good,Good company but the hours were not consistent with the work hours. It a good place to work if you only want to work 10 to 20 hours a weeks not enough to live on
good,It is very stressful when working at the registers. You are pressured and expected to sell and meet goals of sold Kohl's credit cards. Most managers are friendly and very happy while few are constantly hostile.
good,"There was a lack of professional training, which management did not address. Instead, employees were blamed for falling short of goals they were ill-equipped to meet."
good,"With the increase of online shopping, company is staying relevant. Weekly schedule varies on workload and adjusts to the seasonal sales trend. Nice discount for associates during Friends & Family shopping events!"
good,Working for the store wasn't that bad. I just wanted to expand my knowledge and grow in a different environment. I did enjoy who I worked with and was given discounts on items if I purchased them at the store.
good,"Doing payroll daily and working on schedules,"
good,I worked during the mornings to help unload the truck at 5am and put the freight away. I learned very quickly that people more often then not would complain about how the store needed to be zoned and cleaned while we put away freight. Eventually wasn't getting enough hours and had to find a new job.
good,I liked working there just i didnt have guantee hours one week would be 4 hours and another week i could get maybe 30.  Never made enough to suppprt my growing family at the time
good,It is good job to work at and is fast paced..... They do have good hours and work with you on your flexibility..... You gotta dress nice fit along with dress shoes
good,"A day at work would usually start with me heading to the back stock room and restocking everything that we were out of on the shelves, then would go to the clothing section and fold shirts and sweaters."
good,"The environment was not what I was hoping for but at sometimes it does frustrating when you do your job, appreciation does not get you anywhere. Some associates fight to get 'employee of the month' and some don't. Some associates will work their behinds off and do not get 'employee of the month'. What is worth fighting for. I tend to give so much customer service and but no credit at all, being a shoe salesman and knowing so much about shoes and helping out customers and they come back to see me to thank me or wanting to get more shoes for comfort, I don't stop helping. I took my job seriously. New management took over and my vibe starts to de-escalate."
good,Good company to work for as it is orderly and focused on its mission to deliver value to its customers.  Team work was a norm and it helped to produce results.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of checking in, gathering my equipment, finding out what department I'd be at, and carrying out whatever tasks that needed to be done. I had basic cashiering duties and was as well tasked with folding clothes in my area, etc. typical retail clothing store stuff. Objectively, I didn't really learn anything new other than how to operate the Kohl's register, and taking off hard tags, but it was easy to adjust to since I had previous retail experience. Subjectively, I learned that retail is terrible."
good,I worked as a packer and there is a lot off competition on production those who didn’t get enough numbers were not likely to get hired on that is a con for anyone that isn’t fast paced but gets the job done
good,"Kohls compensation is not very good. They cap total weekly hours to avoid paying any benefits. Local management team was great "
good,Not much to say other than this is your average job. A lot of retail stores are dying out these days. I can't say my time here was terrible because I definitely enjoyed the job when I got hours. I worked all positions at various points in time
good,"Kohl's is part time, never steady hours always different. Management at the time was not great. Good thing they were always changing what brands they were promoting."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls is a great starting job, hours are flexible, its a fun and exciting place to work. A typical day at work is mostly doing ""gobacks"", helping customers with questions and finding merchandise."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kohl's. Being the only one in my department, I was not micromanaged. Working at several different locations, I could see that policies and procedures were consistent across the entire company."
good,"lots of overtime opportunity, decent pay, only downfall was that it was seasonal, friendly people, managers were friendly and helpful, over all enjoyed the job"
good,Retail is only for certain people. I like to have a set schedule and with retail that never happens. The pay is not competitive unless you are in upper management.
good,"I don't have a long review as I worked here only for a few months. I worked nights and weekends to get healthcare coverage. I had a day job, Monday- Friday  and worked only for healthcare."
good,"Fast paced, scanning, sorting, boxing, and packaging items, friendly people to work with, very helpful material handlers, and supervisors. Work was pretty easy"
good,great place to work during high school and understanding of school necessities. Typical day of work is fast paced and having to talk and listen to customers. Rewarding place of work.
good,The managers didn't really care or trust you. Always yelling about getting credit. They did promote nicely though. Very fun environment when the right people are working.
good,"I worked on the sales floor stocking and straighten up merchandise, check customer out, worked in the cash office, also worked at the customer services desk doing returns"
good,Typical retail work load. Great co-workers. Learned all departments. Supervised shoe department. Hard to deal with some customers. Enjoyed helping customers.
good,"Well the job was boring and the pay low, the only thing that was worth was the closet and the cashiers, if you know what I mean. I mean I liked the managers they were professional and friendly."
good,I loved all my coworkers but managers wouldn’t work on problems we had in our departments you have to bug them constantly to get things done around the place. Constantly picking up their mess...
good,The job escapes my memory because the month went by so quickly. No major complaints about my employment there I just appreciate the opportunity for seasonal work that they offered me.
good,Liked the people coworkers were cool & funny lots complaints from management & supervisors sometimes give us pizza liked the work environment great people to work with.
good,"Sales, inventory management and merchandising are the primary duties at Kohls. The company has a lot of call outs so those of us who do show up regularly are required to pick up the slack."
good,"Went in a 6am some people were already there, started unloading truck and opening boxes. Put clothes on the Z rails and hardware on Uboats. After we finished; we backstocked items we didn't need to go on the sales floor, and got the trailer ready to go back to the DC."
good,Kohl's was a fair place to work. I was seaonal help so I did not work there long or often. Work stayed busy during the holidays but it wasn't bad for minimum wage.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is very flexible with scheduling. Workplace is friendly and engaging. Jobs vary, including positions cashiering, working the customer service desk, and working on the sales floor."
good,"A job like this is a great one to start with but isn't a career. You get an idea of what working is like and, while you have a specific job title and area, you end up doing a little bit of everything in the store."
good,"Very fast paced, but understaffed. I like the job over all but the lack of communication did make the work experience more stressful than it had to be. I felt like the work load was not distributed evenly among the employees."
good,It was Kool to work at the employees where Kool I never had any problems with anybody was a great work environment breaks were given on time and no bad things to say
good,They tend to push a lot when it comes to signing customers up with the kohls credit card. They also push being in said departments to ensure there is always assistance when needed by customers. Cross training and being able to work in other departments of the store is also heavily encouraged.
good,Kohl’s is a retail store that provide great customer service. Our job is to not only keep the store clean but to help customers with their inquiries . We offer assistance to our customers and to inform them that we are here to help them.
good,"Over all pretty laid back job once you get the hang of things . You have a sales goal that you have to reach  but it is pretty manageable."
good,"A typical wok day can be very stress full, but I guess that what you get when you work in a department store. very low on staff. something we have to do a the apparel departments with just 2-3 worker and still do more on top."
good,Enjoyed  the job .the work ethics very strong they where self motivating .Training was key whether it was in dept. or cross trained. Attendance was rewarded. Safety was up front and looked at .
good,I worked at Kohl's in DeKalb when I was attending college.  It was a good job for extra cash while in school.  I also got good experience in retail.
good,I worked for Kohl's for over two and a half years and greatly enjoyed my co-workers. They made the job fun and overall enjoyable. The management did not always care about their employees and appreciate all the hard work we put into the company.
good,"Worked there for Christmas and, yes, it was very stressful. It's not a good work place unless you can handle others very well. They mostly want you to sell their credit, but other than that, it's like the ""bosses"" didn't care. Just my opinion. I was let go at the end of the season. I've tried reapplying for them towards that time again and nothing."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl’s. The company was fair but it wasn’t something I would want to do for a long term Career. The work environment was very nice.
good,"Typical day was assisting customers, folding and organizing clothing And also using the point of sales . Management was amazing. I just didn't like how they weren't clear with direction."
good,"I enjoyed the job itself, but the store manager was very moody and some days felt like he was personally harassing me. There were lots of wonderful people working at my store, and I enjoyed getting to know them as well as many of our customers. The company has started downsizing, and they aren't treating their employees particularly well anymore. I don't appreciate being treated like a number rather than a person, and that's what it was becoming."
good,"working at Kohl's was a nice experience because it teaches you how to work in a professional retail environment while still caring for the customers first. The pay isn't amazing but there are good opportunities to advance in the company. In fact, one of the people I trained when i was working there is now an E3 (supervisor). Only downside is lack of hours for newer people."
good,"It was a pretty good first job. The mangers were friendly, and there is room for movement within the company. Soliciting credit is very important for your performance reviews."
good,"Not too bad of a work place, but the management made it a bit hard to enjoy the amaounr of work put on the employees. Would’ve stayed, but there was a better job opening, and they didn’t seem too sad to see a person go."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Most of the managers were very strict and always on your butt even if you are doing exactly what is expected.  There is also a requirement, if you are a cashier, to get so many credit applications per week."
good,I don't like it at all. I don't like the early work hrs (5am) because it interferes with my daily life. I know that sound crazy because it is so early you would think the hours worked perfectly. But during the day you'll be extra tired.
good,At this time I do not wish to speak on my time at this company or my experiences with it. I am exercising my right to privacy and not comment on my time with this company.
good,Overall Kohls was a good place to work. They worked well with my schedule. The only issue I had was the lack of ability to climb up in the company and the lack of pay raise opportunity's.
good,"i worked in the shoe department receiving shipments, stocking shelves and checking inventory, arranging sales tags, waiting on customers and ringing up sales"
good,Kohl's is definitely not the worst place to work. A typical day would depend on what your position is but at my location it always included multiple people calling out and their responsibilities falling onto those who had shown up for their shifts to complete. The hours and schedule were flexible but if you stay late once they will expect you to do it over and over again with no regard for your life outside of the store. The most enjoyable thing about the job was having fun with coworkers and the hardest part is not losing your patience with customers who come in determined to be right. I cannot speak for all Kohl's locations but my location had horrible management which never held people accountable for their actions and took out certain things on people who were not responsible in the first place.
good,"It was usually slow in the week. The managers were always hard to get when you needed help, they also expected you to know certain things, without having good training."
good,Fun place to work if you like customer service. The Shoe department was hard work with lots of customers and phone calls from customers looking for shoes and prices.
good,"I didn't enjoy my time here much, but a paycheck is a paycheck. The bosses didn't care much for the happiness or comfort of the employees, and the environment felt more like a dog-eat-dog environment, which made productivity lower in my opinion."
good,"It is a common sales job, friendly customers most of the time but was constantly having to clean up around the store and after the customers. Closing was ruff and you did not get the choice to leave directly after your shift time was over."
good,This position really entry level and good as a work fill while attending school. There is little chance for advancement from within because a majority of jobs are part time positions. Cannot make a living because there are not hours to be worked with the way shifts are constructed. The people i work with are very nice and we are treated well by management
good,"a typical day would be performing cashier duties, as in point of sale, credit card payments, and directing customers when asked/needed. Worked in departments only twice."
good,"I have learned how to do many different things at Kohl's which includes assisting in point of sale by working registers, help with inventory counts, balance cash office and registers, and unload freight and merchandise items to the sales floor."
good,"To stressful job as taking care customers hours not the best ones for you to take care your family, they expect to much for the employee and the paid not the best."
good,"The Kohl's I worked at required us to sign up 4 new credit card holders a day. If I failed to meet this requirement, my hours for the next week were cut. All of my floor managers were incredibly supportive and excellent to work for."
good,Had many great opportunities here. Love the managers and other members. Hardest Part is not having anything to do. Most enjoyable is making the guests make and feel amazing.
good,"Kohls uses a college type approach whenever it comes with training there new employees,and at first it was hard learning everything on my own but soon enough I learned take charge of my environment."
good,"It could have just been my specific location, but there was a lot of unnecessary drama in the workplace. Management seemed detached from associates needs and mindsets."
good,"nothing too spectacular. They don't really have that many customers, but you are supposed to push credit cards and most of the customers already have one."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,the hardest part of the job is that u need to go to every department and make sure everything is clean and organized i learned how to actully fold the clothes the way the workers folded them
good,"Helps employees with time off and understanding about life events. Very little hours. No employees other than management and supervisors are full time, average employee gets 20 hours or less a week, 20 if you're lucky. Refused to give me my sick pay time and time again after asking. Nice management team though which makes the job overall easier and more enjoyable. A lot of store events that include volunteer work as well as the store providing food for the employees just to boost morale such as pizza or nacho days and other themed days as well as a pot luck once per month."
good,"it was an okay place with great people of different backgrounds. lots of customers during the holiday time. great discounts for employees, especially during the holidays. you do get a lot of breaks and perks for getting credit cards."
good,"Although I can't say much of the Seasonal Sales Associate's benefits, hours, or being able to live off the wages provided, I can say that the team and managers I worked with were all wonderful people, and the particular store I worked at was well-kept. I would absolutely recommend them as a model store for the entire chain, although the chain overall puts way too much emphasis on signing people up for credit cards, but that is no fault of the individual stores."
good,"/""when first starting  there the vibe is kinda weird.easoned emoloyees are not very friendly to the new comer. did not feel like there was any team players on board"
good,I was just seasonal for christmas.  I do not have a accurate opionion because I was just seasonal.  I didnt have enough hours to rate or review the company fairly.
good,"Fun to work, if you have decent management. Growth is an issue unless you have tenure. You could be the best associate but you have to play the game of being loved by everyone instead of being good at your job"
good,The job itself isn't hard. The worst part is the customers. It does get dull and boring pretty quickly. Management was pretty good for the most part. There's almost always food in the break room.
good,"a typical day at this establishment consists of waiting in the lobby for about half an hour, then afterwards you'll swipe or scan your I.D  to have access granted inside, I learned that they're slightly organized & have a nice online ordering system, the hardest part about this job is standing solitary on your feet for 10 hrs, The management team  isn't very great at times with the random pattern of scheduling,"
good,You will be searching for various Kohl's products to either stock or load them for customers who ordered them. The hours can vary. This is in a warehouse.
good,a 'meh' job. Fun. Nice people. Slow some days and extremely busy others. Easy work but they hardly gave you hours on a schedule and constantly called you in on days off(nearly every day)
good,"Loved working there, had an opportunity to take a FT position with another company and had no time to leave a 2 week notice. I felt bad, but I was only trying to better provide for my family. I was told I was not able to be considered as a re hire due to leaving with out a 2 week notice. I understand... but think that is not fair due to the circumstances."
good,A job that your really on your feet the whole time. They're days when time go by fast then there's days the clock moves slow. Wasnt a very clean place.
good,"very busy days ,i learned a a lot from my managers and peers.the hardest part of my job was dealing with irate customers at time.Most enjoyable part of my job was greeting and assisting customers."
good,The work environment is very slow and the workers there weren't very friendly. It was my first job so I had a rough time with the cashier but I was taught very nicely. The hardest part of the job was the customer sometimes because they will complain about their product but I always keep my cool and work out the situation.
good,The was my first job ever not bad. It was seasonal so some days it was slow other paced you just wanted to quit cause it was super busy. Overall not that bad.
good,An average workday is basically get everything done that needs to be done for that day. the managers are really fun and understanding but the higher ups are not the best to work for.
good,"receiving ,packing , and preparing freight to be shipped and delivered. Working as  a team player and being prompt and professional. A lot of over time was there if employees wanted to pick up extra time."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This was my first job and showed me a lot of things and obstacles in life. learned the different departments. recovery wasn't the best because i still was in high school  and recovering the store always took an hour or two after closing and the store closed late as of 11 pm already.
good,"Very helpful,  competitive wages,  great bonuses.  Lots of fun to work at.  Would recommend this work place to friends and family.  Great month end meetings every month,  rewards and prizes given to great job done"
good,I liked to work there. I just started to get a little annoyed when the managers would depend on the cashiers to get the people to open up a Kohl's credit card.
good,"Kohl's as a whole is great. They truly care about their employees and their local communities, they have amazing part time and full time benefits, volunteer and charity hours, and employee discounts. Management is horrible, there is never any communication between them and the area supervisors. The store is ALWAYS understaffed regardless of holidays. No one ever wants to take responsibility for scheduling problems. We've had great area supervisors leave because of management. Half of the store departments are without leads because they've step down or left all together because of management."
good,It was a great place to expand in and learn new things from every department. All though I would not advise to be there more than a couple of years due to the fact that they hire at a young age and there is drama.
good,I would say that Kohls is a very busy place to work.  You have to be on your toes at all times and keep up with the rush.  The managers there were very dedicated and open to new ideas.
good,I have enjoyed a long and fullfilled career a t kohls.   I would recommend kohls to anyone who wants to learn and griw with a retail company.  Kohls has provided me with a wealth of information and career options.
good,A typical day would include loading and unloading the trucks every night. I would take all the Merchandise off the trucks and put them where they belonged in the store
good,enjoyed meeting new people and customers. Also enjoyed working with my crews. Store was kept clean all the time. My coworkers were helpful and caring. I would not mind working there again.
good,"Working third shift is always interesting. Everyplace is different. In this regard...it leaves just a little to be desired. The coworkers were excellent. Everyone for the most part got along just fine. It was a relaxed environment where everyone did their own role. After the off-loading of the truck, typically we would split up and do our own part in different sections of the store. Holiday seasons were of course the main source of our income. Plenty of hours in the those days. However, in the off season hours fall through sharply. Going from working five to six days a week. To working maybe one or two days a week is not reliable. Perhaps the most frustrating were the weeks where there were no hours for me and others to work at all."
good,"I like working in Kohl's Plainfield, I hope they gave more hours. I do not want looking a new job but just 10 or 12 hours for a week that is difficult for people like busy like me."
good,I learned how to help people better. The hardest part of my job was when I had to closed for them some days u got to make sure everything clean and then wait till everybody leave.
good,"i liked working at kohls in the beginning, but like any other retail store it gets crazy around the holidays. the management for the most part was good, but scheduling was crazy after a few months. at first they respected the days i couldn't work but especially during holiday season they would schedule me even when i said i couldn't work."
good,"always learning new skills training available for new programs team huddles  with occasional fun activities"
good,I do not recommend working here as a seasonal worker. They screw you out of hours and when you do work they make you work holidays and black friday. Other than that the people were nice.
good,"My tenure at Lord & Taylor was less than 1 year working on a project that involved a conversion of systems to the platform of their acquiring company, Hudson Bay."
good,"cleaned the shoe section which means having to reorganize the shoe boxes and dealing with the shoes in the backstock, put out new inventory, assisted the customers, put away stock."
good,"fast paced and busy for a seasonal job,friendly people,it would have been better if it was fulltime work,I liked the Omni dept But they didnt give me the opportunity to show them my abilities."
good,I was a sales floor supervisor for department store. We would be really busy during the holiday season. Other times we wouldn't be as busy and work would be slow going.
good,"Work can be done quickly if you focus, if you dont focus it still doesnt take long. Its a decent company to work for. Most of the managers are fairly chill and understanding."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a decent company to work for. They always have things to keep you busy as an employee. It could be a happy and fun environment. I would suggest other people to apply here.
good,"Bonuses can be tough to achieve, and are divided in a tier pyramid form top to bottom where only half of your team may get a bonus and the other half no"
good,"The first few years that i worked here, i absolutely loved it! Over the course of this past year, a lot has changed. Management is not on the same page. Which makes it hard as an employee because I never know what is right or wrong. Also, if anyone is having a bad day, you can expect to have everything taken out on you. Management makes you feel less than because they are a higher status. I just do not agree with the management."
good,Khols was at grate learning experience they had grate supervisors they were organized very helpful people work environment was neutral not a bad place to pay was fair
good,If you can manage in an environment with stress from managers and customers. While shifts are understaffed then retail is for you. 2 words Christmas shopping
good,"Retail is retail, you will encounter with the craziest people."
good,"Busy work day"
good,"I had to organize all of the clothes. I had to clean out the fitting rooms and hang all the clothes back on the proper racks. I would use the register occasionally, but mostly I walked around and cleared out all the fitting rooms and organized the clothes. I would also stay late after close to help organize more."
good,It was decent Just were not willing to work with my hours. i am currently a student and they were not willing to work with my hours of school or give me anymore hours than 4 hours every 2 weeks
good,Was put in a very large store volume wise that was already far behind on everything and was never really given the tools to be successful. Everything was constant chaos and the work environment was extremely negative.
good,"The store is managed similar to a factory. You know where your supposed to be, when your breaks are, who is covering your breaks "
good,this is a fun place to work because you have a lot of younger people working here. You can also make it fun yourself if you have the right attitude and right group of friends.
good,Great to work with customers with their need and their expectations. Staff wonderful to work with as a team when it gets busy..great discounts for customers
good,"Typical retail work environment"
good,Mostly friendly managers and supervisors  depending on location. Mostly  part time but you can move up to full time in certain departments. Flexible schedules if you are a student.
good,"Just like any other deptartment store. Lots of Work to do. Unload and loading of trucks, Stock merchandising, price adjustments, and put backs were also part of the job."
good,"ok place to work depending on your management staff. Some managers are very caring, kind, and smart and really care about the development of their associates. While others only care about their own advancement not their associates. The worst part is really the customers, and the outsourced call center employees."
good,They were very flexible to my life.  I was able to work and maintain work life balance.  The teaching and training was hands on and I learned a lot about customer service while working there.
good,A typical day at Kohl's is overall average working with customers to help them better understand the current sales and what coupons are available to use upon their purchase(s).
good,scheduled either too much or too little. management was unstable and the lack of personal help was large. i recieved very little training and had no ethics training and no explanation of what to do for sick days or anything about hr services.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Loves the work/life balance, but not much ability to move up and the pay is not great for the work you do. It gets very busy and the store gets messy quick and you will always be understaffed."
good,Unloaded truck in the mornings I did shipment packing frates price changes helped customers lots of customer service clean bathrooms made friends love chatting with customers and finding them nice clothes
good,honestly cant remember anything but how cool the employees were everyone was really nice but it is a lot of work for the pay they give you I think its minimum wage and everything is overpriced
good,Kohl's is a great place to work if you're a young teen who only needs a part time job. If it's your full time job be ready to do the job of 3 associates when there is not enough payroll. A pro is that after years of working at a retail store you do meet great regular customers who make your day.
good,"Kohl's has a high turnover rate and flexible hours, making it a great place to work for students who have varied schedules.  Not a lot of benefits, but some potential for advancement."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohls until our last manager left.  There has been many stressors in the prvious months. The previous manager is not easy to work with
good,I ran the register and helped people pick out clothing and household items. I also solicited credit applications and filled out information to see if the custolmer would be approved. The hardest part of the job was to fight the temptation to buy things all the time. The best thing was to be able to know when sales were coming and prepare for the crowds that would come. Management was fair and training was extensive.
good,"If your primary position at Kohl's is Point of Sales then expect to hear, ""credit, credit, credit"".  I enjoyed helping customers but was not a top credit earner.  As a result, it hindered my pay raise at the end of the year.  When you're hired you are not told that the number of credits that you are averaging will impact your raise.  This was frustrating because depending on your position in the store this may or may not impact your wage.  Also, I would go in between several departments.  Although my primary position was at Point of Sales, I would often help at customer service and even in the jewelry department.  This was not taken into consideration when determining my raise.  On their busiest days, I would be told to ping-pong in between locations to attend to the busiest lines.  The thing that I was grateful for was their willingness to work with my school schedule.  Also, I enjoyed the people that I worked with.  I also earned paid vacation time based on hours worked.  I believe that if you work ""on the floor"" you have a greater chance of some small upward mobility in the company than if you are working Point of Sales."
good,I did enjoy my almost 6 years at Kohls. I learned a lot from every department. The coworkers was great. Management was helpful. I liked that the company did a lot of charity work. It was being in competition with other stores.
good,"This job was OK, not the best to have. Management didn't know i was there time to time. employees didn't really communicate on the sales floor. You have to make the best of your experience there."
good,"There are nice co-workers but the managers are not the best at the moment. However, I do expect a change of managing for the better. This is a great place to work if not looking for a full-time job. It is also a great choice for a second job because it does not give many hours due to it's overstaff and little available hours."
good,"Working at Kohl's will make you appreciate people who work long hours in retail. We often would stay and work late into the night, cleaning the store. The management was okay, but I never felt personally appreciated, more like one cog in a huge machine. Fair first job, but I would not build a career here. Also, pushing customers to apply for the credit card felt manipulative to me."
good,"On a typical work day it is slow and you often find yourself with nothing to do, but that keeps the work space organized when you have plenty of time to clean. The management are really sweet people, but they don't really train you before throwing you behind the cash register. They also don't care about your life or responsibilities outside of work so they don't work with your schedule and try to call you in on days you requested off. Working in the app to take days off doesn't work. You will always get put on the schedule if you ask for the day off. The employee discount is great and the break room is always full of snacks and coupons."
good,"Working during the holiday's is very quick-paced, requiring you to check out purchases quickly but efficiently, running throughout the store to gather shipments, and organizing clothes that will be a train wreck less than an hour later."
good,kohl's is a all around good place to work when i was working there it was bad management but now the management is great now and i love it and wouldn't mine going back
good,"good eviroment "
good,it was s fast pace environment to work as a team and individually. another experience under my belt and the employees who worked there made it comfortable and fun to be there working for them. great discount on products.
good,Kohl's was a great company but room for advancement was slim to none for internal talent. was responsible for associate relations as well as several departments throughout the store.
good,"You're typically not very busy at this particular Kohl's, meaning that you stand around a lot doing nothing.  However, when a customer does appear, you are required to try and get them to sign up for a credit card.  Additionally, you have to ask them about the rewards program.  You're basically asking the customer twenty questions when they're just trying to buy something."
good,Coles is a fast paced place but you are surrounded by good coworkers and good people If you get a job there and find yourself liking it you will feel content
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a fun high paced environment great for teens and young adults looking to for work experience and to start off with some sort of job. I've really enjoyed my time working here and wouldn't change it for the world. It is just time for me to move on and find what I am suppose to do for my career.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for. Great discounts. Flexible work schedule for part time people, full time are scheduled to business needs or workload."
good,"a great place to have your first job, the pay is not good along with the hours. the managers are great along with your coworkers. We all worked as a team and its very competive for Khols cards"
good,Very good environment to work in a few up and down along the way but over cane really easily. Flexible on hours that we where able to work and worked around school schedule.
good,"I was at Kohl's for 2 and a half years and I didn't get a raise from 7.25 an hour until the last half of year I was there. The overall vibe was pretty good because i'm a social and interactive person. Dealing with customers is something that any person that does retail knows it just depends on the customer. Here teamwork is put above everything because you are representing he store. I worked closing shift so we were in charge of making sure the store was spotless for the next work day.  Management was in a state of flux. Hardest part of the job was being dependent on others because they dictate when you get out of work, also the pay was sub-par before the pay advance and even then the work didn't match the pay. The best thing about the job was it was a very friendly work environment and the associates that were there were very motivational/ influential."
good,"Working on the salesfloor was preferable to working in the backroom. Unloading and pushing product was often given unreasonable completion times. Managers didn't always feel like leaders, but the coworkers were enjoyable."
good,"Stressfull workplace, with lack of management. However they help me to grow as a employee and be recognize a few time because of my hard work. The team perse was absolutely fun to work with and help each other to finish the work quick."
good,"*folding and displaying Customer Service Representative/Cashier"
good,I don't feel I should be asked to review a company that I have not work at for over 12 years.  I would expect the culture and environment to have changed substantially one way or another in the time since my employment there.
good,its a ok company to work for. better management and more hours would def make the company better. better sick day policy. better pay. co workers were ok. favortism was shown
good,"Kohl's is a fun place to work at because there is constant movement and things to do. Although customers are tough, it is a great place to start learning how to provide customer service and strengthen communication skills."
good,"This job isn't just for anyone, you have the work at a fast pace and can't slack off or you will definitely get behind on your work. Overall the people you meet is either a good or bad experience. There tends to be groups, cashiers talk to cashiers, sales floor associates get along each other, and so on."
good,A few managers were nice. It was busy so shifts seemed to go by pretty fast. You could start at 9 am and end at 5 pm and it felt like only an hour since you clocked in.
good,"Training for the job was hassle-free and easy-going. There were always employees willing to help you. The days could get stressful if you were worked alone, which didn't happen very often"
good,I enjoy working with the other associates.  I also enjoy the employee discount.  Unfortunately management needs to do a better job recognizing the sales associates that work on the floor.
good,"Very stressful during holidays, rude managers, poor salary, poor management. Too much work/stress/ etc for so little salary. Would only recommend for fast cash or part-time."
good,"Working at Kohl's is a good place for someone who is looking for casual work, nothing that will put additional stress on you if you are looking for an extra job."
good,Working 3rds for Kohl’s as a seasonal associate will drain you during peak season. Other than being exhausted Kohl’s was a great job that offers good pay and an on site physician free to employees.
good,"Kohls is a good corporation but struggles in various arenas. The expectation of its associates is very demanding and hard work.  The pay wasn't good for associates compared to other retail stores."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a good place to work at. Met alot of new people in the workspace and the workers were very nice. I learned alot working at kohls. I learned how to do the register.
good,A typical day starts by clocking in. I didn't care working there because I would get told by one manager to do something. I would start to do what that manager told me and then not even five minutes later get yelled at by another manager for doing that exact thing.
good,"Good for high schoolers; I quit because someone anonymously  backed into the front of my car making it so I couldn't get to work; they refused to take a resignation from me and told me I'd be fired."
good,"Kohls was my first job I was super exited I started of with good hours and enough working days, but out of the no where I started getting less days and less hours I would only work once a week for about 4 hrs."
good,"It was fun. Slow HR though, i wasnt payed for over a month. other than that it was good. Nice People. my most enjoyable part was cashier probably. It was always fast paced."
good,"Nice environment, fast pace, fair upper management and store hours a plus. Mainly hire for part time positions with lots of new hires. Plenty of outreach projects to volunteer for and stay involved with community."
good,I liked working at Kohl's until the store I worked at got a anew manager. She was awfully rude and aggressive and adversarial and didn't comply with my allowed hours per my doctor and I was forced to leave as a result
good,"You learn a lot about report writing and how to use cctv, the down fall low paying job, but if you want to advance your career in loss prevention, this is a good place to start."
good,The company is a good company for part time workers looking to get extra money while going to school or during the holidays. Very open to flexible schedules
good,It was a great place to work. Very chill environment. Flexible hours. Good pay. The managers were very understanding. The hours weren't the best.  The food was awesome when we had it.
good,manageable.  Monday thru Friday schedule.  Patient flow ok.  would recommend for new graduate to gain experience in primary care.  Would be nice place for preceptor for NP students
good,"Long hours of stocking and working on Holidays, but the people you work with are really nice. You are required to check tasks and see what stock is low, going to the warehouse and filling the missing stock from back stock. You also need to ensure that all displays are filled. You will also be called to be a cashier on occasion."
good,"As a person doing Omni it was stressful when you couldn't find a item, its either you get yelled at because you can find the item but I blame the lack of training you receive. I had a 10 minute training and was sent on my own."
good,"poor management, lack of communication, unpredicatable hours, even tho I was part time they expected me to do the work of someone working 45 hours a week"
good,Love the job and people but poor compensation and raises are small/rare. Too much responsibility and pressure placed upon someone who is making a less than livable wage. I still like the job but it's also complete garbage. The discounts are awesome though.
good,"This was a good place to work for a part time job. They worked with me when I needed days off, but I was never gaurenteed days off.  Management is what kept me there as long as I was."
good,"The job mostly consisted of completing hiring events and orientations for seasonal employees. Besides that mostly you would be in the office filing or answering employee questions. "
good,"The hours were good, management was also good. You can work at your own pace, as long as you get done with all your tasks. Overall a good experience.."
good,it was cool for a seasonal job the requirements for most of the positions in the building were reasonable and the work was always pretty simple and straight forward.
good,"Great service and productive"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"•	Offered assistant to customer as needed"
good,"Fun place to work. Did not provide enough hours to make a living."
good,Worked as seasonal only employee and received less than 20 hours per week. Store manager was fair and professional. For what's required pay is too low. Little to no training provided for what is the busiest season of the year - Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,it was temp not enough pay for the work they ask but i di enjoy hte position but im looking for something eles more pay with beneifits hope to find something else
good,"At Kohls, I had to learn to work with an amalgamations of people. I had to be very skilled at multi-tasking and become more time efficient. My inter-personal skills became my most valued work ethic."
good,"Good Job ,would recommend, no issues, good discount, good shift premiums............ primarily clothing products...... the hardest part of the job is the late shift........"
good,"it was nice while it lasted, i honestly loved working at kohl's they are very strict on who they keep after seasonal though i learned that the hard way"
good,Very fast paced environment the training was extensive and very efficient co workers allow you grow within the workplace. Very fun work place and great management.
good,"Get money and get people to work with. "
good,I believe that Kohl's is a very good work environment for college and high school that  are looking to make extra money.it has really good discounts if you have a Kohl's card
good,Working at kohls was a great first job that paid well for the short amount of time that I worked there.  (seasonal employee)  Employees tend to work in all departments.
good,"It was a fine place to work, I worked there while I was going through culinary school, so I would work when I could and everyone was very understanding of that."
good,"There was no typical day at Kohl's, sometimes you went in at 5am, 8am, worked overnight.  I learned a lot about working with different personalities.  The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of each days expectations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
good,I dont wish to add anything else. I did not work here very long it was an ok job I quit to go to college. The managers were ok I worked well with the associates.
good,"It was fun working here at Kohl's. the environment was pretty nice. One thing that was a little disturbing to me about this job was having to work in the ""Intimate section,"" which was considered to be the messiest section of them all."
good,I was only their for seasonal help. But I enjoyed the time I was there. They treat you well. If you not permanent you don't get many hours. But if you are permanent you get all your hours.
good,working there was OK I guess. I don't really wish to review this job. you are on your feet a lot. the managers always seemed to contradict each other. I didnt really enjoy it there it was just a paycheck to get through school.
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work for a part time job.  They provide training for your specific area with some cross training available. It can be difficult being on your feet for long hours and during the holidays, the store hours are quite long."
good,"Very busy days,you can learn how to solicit credit and run cash register, management was okay, the culture was pretty okay, worst part was the fitting rooms, most enjoyable i'd say was styling"
good,"Not a bad place, as far as friendly co-workers and managers willing to jump in and help or answer any question while on the job. They don't schedule enough people to have enough time to do what is expected."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,i didnt State I worked for the corporation. I work in the retail and I had a couple of managers that were a little unhappy and like to share their unhappiness I had others that were extremely good managers very positive and encouraging and extremely adept team leaders. Unfortunately it seems corporate  does push our managers who intern become very stressed resulting in a not so comfortable workspace I feel affected the entire teams Quality of work During these stressful times
good,It was a good job out of high school. Part time / holiday work. Reasonable management. Easy enough work if you make sure the customer is always happy and right.
good,"This was a retail job, which required working nights and weekends. It was a temporary job, and I wanted something full time with benefits. It was nice to get a discount on all items I purchased from the store."
good,slow moving and can be boring at times. coworkers were nice not a big fan of the mangers. provided food on average so that was a plus. its not a bad place to work and you are guaranteed hours
good,"was required to meet time, but was not trained on how to perform quantity amount of work. Fast pace work environment needed more training and instructions. too many supervisors giving contradictory directionsl"
good,"very socialble environment with computers in the breakroom to have internet access.mthe co-workers there are very friendly, and helpful.also a very clean environment"
good,Work with different warehouse machines. Management takes their time to teach their associates the proper way to work on machines. The work environment was fast paced there is always something to do.
good,"Good work environment , great people , great employee discounts , overall great experience . They also have great benefits for the employees of the job"
good,"Kohls was not really an exited place to work but i had a very good working relationship with the people that work with me. The work is hard for the money paid. Management do everything to prevent you from working 8hours. Too much task in a short period of time. Salary too small for work done."
good,"Kohls was an ideal candidate for a long term position, unfortunately the poor decisions made by management effected the company in the long run. Most of the supervisors were thrown into a position where they had almost no previous knowledge."
good,just a temporary job. a few managers are fine but others can be vindictive and demanding. their are times where the compensation does weigh out the work you do. they put way too much merchandise out on the floor.
good,many amenities restaurants and activities available to the employees Kohl's values employees and give many promo and choices to employees. Kohls has a great campus walking is promoted and healthy eating provided
good,After working here I was sure I would never work retail again. the store was always crazy maybe it was the location. but I still love shopping at other kohls til this day the prices are always good.
good,I was a cashier so my day consisted of standing in one spot and ringing up customers. with a responsibility of getting the customer to apply for a kohls credit card.
good,"fast passed, very long lines out the door, i don't remember much besides the lines and having no service in the building. On a regular day it should be a decent job but black friday was mayhem."
good,"This was a temporary Christmas position. I'd never worked on an assembly line but ended up having a back surgery after this short job. I really wish I had know more of what lifting and twisting could do to your body."
good,"it was a nice place to work. a lot of stress, not a lot of help from your supervisor when dealing with a difficult customer. the hardest part is when they would listen to you while on the phone with a customer and they would pick you to death on what you did wrong. then they would rate you. a lot of times the supervisor was no where around when you needed them or refuse to take the call when the customer requested to speak to one."
good,The call center is merging to a universal representative with no extra compensation and no option to stay with the same position. There is a lack of training and floor support.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work was going to be slow paced, especially during the Christmas time of year. But this job had over-hired too many applicants. There would be weeks where you wouldn't even be scheduled a single day, and that's just not acceptable when you have bills to pay."
good,Great place to work for.  will accommodate your schedule if you go to school or have another job. but will decrease your hours if your asking for more
good,Worked in the shoe department handling customer requests. Worked with coworkers and management to move product and stock product to keep up with sales plans. Cleaned and stocked store to meet company standards
good,It was a good job to work and good paying the hours wasn't right for me because I had smaller kids at the time. Overall it;s a job and everybody needs
good,"Working with the public, helped me develop better communication and people skills. Retail is the best place to learn how to work with the public, in my opinion."
good,It was a temporary job for me since I had just moved to Maryland and I need to get to know the area. Some co-workers were fun to work with and managers were rarely seen.
good,it would be fun to work there but we were always short on people and it would be hard to get things done so we wouldnt be able to help the customers as much as we want to because we tried to get things done quickly as possible
good,"A typical day at work was greeting customers and helping them with whatever they need either in the store or via telephone. Along with doing that, stocking shelves and organizing racks would be another typical day at work."
good,No advancement for a male they are pretty flexible with their scheduling which was convenient if you needed it but very inconvienent because it was abused by nearly everyone
good,"Very physical job.  Cleaning, walking , bending over, carrying., lifting.  Working in the retail environment during the holidays is very busy, tiring work.  Very physical for low pay"
good,Was a good place to work people were great management was very helpful  when learning the ropes of the job ask allot of questions stay busy saft is high priority
good,"Working at Kohls had great environment skills, the pay was great and the people working with you. The hardest part about the job eould be communication with new projects. The best part about being at Koh'ls was how you're treated and incentives."
good,Honestly Kohls isnt as great as i first thought it to be the most hrs you could get a week is 12-20 never the average for any other job of 40hrs a week
good,I worked at Kohl's corporate for a little over two years. Some leaders are very caring and positive. Kohl's have an internal medical care and food. Very safe environment.
good,"You won't get paid very much (Around minimum wage) and it won't be full time. I started as a cashier and moved up to a supervisor role. Even though I was a supervisor I was still considered ""part time"" and got a $1 raise over the minimum wage. I left because I could get a full time manufacturing job and make way more than Kohls and have less responsibilities. You will never have consistent hours. One day you are working 10AM-6PM and the next you are doing 3rd shift mark downs 10PM-6AM. You can pick up lots of hours for the holiday season and you will have a ton of fun during the busy season. I have fond memories of working there and would recommend it to someone who is just starting out looking for a job."
good,"Great crew to work with, able to learn within means of the job and sometimes in other departments, if you wish. Management very helpful to get things done."
good,This is a good place to have as your first job. You can gain a lot of work experience and friendships. A great way to learn how to work with others and get customer service experience.
good,"Hired seasonal, was never told in interview that freight is only one day a week. Just a waste of your time, just a dead end job. Training was awful..."
good,At kolhs you will work all types of people. You will meet a variety of customers and help them with there shopping experience at the store. It can get stressful but it is worth it at times
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyed my experience at Kohls.  Left because of pay and was hard to move up to a full time position.  They would hire from the outside.  They offered great discounts for the employees.
good,"It is a good atmosphere, and people are very friendly. There are however some downsides to working their and there are with many places that you have to work."
good,We had more then enough hours to get the job done.  Manangment and district managers very helpful...too much overstock during holiday seasons.  Employees well trained
good,Fun meeting people and very competitive in getting customers to sign up for credit.  Nice company discounts.  Getting customers to apply for credit.  Seeing the faces of customer after they get their customer discounts.
good,This is a retail job. This is not intended for those who have goals beyond getting money. The company issues sales goals to make things a little more interesting. Temporary work intended.
good,"-Started off working overnight changing signs according to the next day's sales"
good,Being able to solve problems and spending 10 hours walking and completing orders. On average you can walk up to 30 plus miles per day and it can be busy at times but mainly it's slow all year around.
good,"Flexibility, friendly, contests, time off as needed, switch schedules w other associates. Good communication during shift on radios, discounts throughout the year above normal discounts.Great Management , Easy To Learn"
good,"Start work at 6:45am - Login - Check schedule- Take Customer Service calls / Place orders - Check customers credit for credit limit increase."
good,"It was an ok first job. I was a seasonal worker. After the holidays and clean up from the holidays I wasn't really given any hours, maybe like 4 hours every two weeks or so."
good,Kohl's is the one store where customer satisfaction is a guarantee. Every associate helps out each other. Everything is really fast-paced and multitasking is definitely something that everyone will have to do.
good,"They are pretty good at training you, management wise is what needs work. A typical day varied all the way from stocking or truck or getting online orders ready to cashiering."
good,"Help customers find what they need, help them check out.  Maintained responsibility with money and the ability to work under pressure.  Holiday hours were long and required patience and ability to deal with frustrated or difficult customers.  Customer service was a big part of this job."
good,I really did not get to experience the work experience there long enough to get a feel on how tings worked. I was only there as a seasonal sales associate.
good,Great discounts and great workplace environment an great pay but no benefits for seasonal partime associates. Discounts was overall really good around an during seasonal times
good,"good first job learned valuable customer service skills,cash handling experience and management skills...pay is not that good even if u get promoted hour may drop"
good,"- Fast paced "
good,Seasonal employment good for an high school student or extra Christmas cash for the holidays. Pay is not great and there are no benefits offered. I would not work here again
good,"Working in the Kohl's department store you are expected to solicit applications, provide customer service in the area in which your currently working, making it presentable to the shopper"
good,"Its fine to work in here if you need the money. Nothing special, it's a good temporary stepping stone in order to gain working experience. Overall 3 stars."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Very slow never really had customers come in, only time we were busy was during Black Friday as well they don't have the best training team, they trained me for a day then let me loose"
good,"Let me start out by saying I worked at two kohls and they were both stressful in their own way. The first kohls I worked at was one of the biggest Kohls in the USA. The second one was located in a college town and was constantly under staff. I did stay for two years and did like it,"
good,"The following errors occurred:"
good,"Right after I clock in, I collect shoes from around the store to put them back in the shoe department. After collecting I usually recover the shoe department from the past shoppers that shopped in the store. If I have enough time I detail, merchandise and/or work the freight. I learned how to back stock, work the register, merchandise, return/exchange items at customer service and put up visual. This job is extremely easy."
good,This place i wouldn't recommend to anyone. It wasn't a good place to work. I had to do alot of work for little pay.It's not worth the time if you dont have patience
good,it was pretty cool working there it was pretty calm for the most part the only time it would get intense were holiday seasons and black Friday but my managers and crew were good perple.
good,Dynamic and demanding environment; enables work / life balance for some positions but not all. Appears to be typical retail environment for today's economic challenges.
good,"- Easy job"
good,"Working for Kohls is exactly what you would expect from a retail job. Depending on where you work, managers may be good or bad. It's a lot of work for not a lot of pay."
good,a typical workday was filled with steady pace work. the management at Kohls was great. the hardest part of the job was working in the hot warehouse while lifting heavy objects.
good,"Customer service.    Open credits accounts,  stock inventory on floor, help customers.    Get lots of experience in dealing with customers.  Hardest part was upset dealing with upset customers"
good,It was a good first job. Teaches you how iT'll be exiting high school and getting into a career but not a good long term job. Recommend for high school students.
good,Worked for them during high school. I like the manager and co workers. I was with the disable program during school and after it was over I applied for a job. I guess they were ok with the school paying me and not them.
good,"Very fun place to work, made a lot of friends. Great discounts and first dibs on clearance products. Flexible with schedule as far as when you can work."
good,"Working during the holidays is always an adventure, but kohls was a crazy nightmare. The main manager was not nice and rude, the rest of the staff was nice and helpful. The hours were crazy, but if you asked for certain shifts they ignored your wishes."
good,This is a nice place to work as a first job.  It definitely helps you build a resume for future employment.  People get along pretty well there.  Your schedule is constantly changing and the best time to work are during holidays when you actually get more hours.
good,"I liked working for this company very friendly atmosphere.   I enjoyed the people because I am a people person. A typical day at work was very busy and fast paced. I learned how to communicate well with customers and coworkers. The management was great, the hardest part of the job was returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,"Kohl's is a very good place to work for."
good,"Kohls is slowly but surely going down, get out while you can. Typically was folding clothes and checking customers out at the register. Pretty independent but boring"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Tough to run store with minimum hours given to area manager. High turnover rate among part time associates. So frustrating to deliver great customer service with no coverage in store.
good,hunt bad good bad great thing let more mender time cameron josh use able not to from where when why how to just able turn wrong best to hang out weird
good,"An okay place to work however, effort demonstrated did not correlate with hours received or the ability to be kept past seasonal associate. Management was hidden."
good,"I worked during the holiday season so the environment was pretty fast paced most days. Most co-workers are friendly and help you get adjusted to working there. Management is good, pay could be a bit better but not a deal breaker."
good,"There was poor communication between associates and management. Associates who work hard were not necessarily rewarded or compensated for their work, while those associates who barely did any work continue to be given hours. There was no accountability for a poor job done when it came to part time workers, showing other associates who did work hard that there was no point to doing so because it wasn't appreciated or rewarded. Compensation was horrible, with supervisors working 40 hours a week making less than part time associates who were employed at competitors stores."
good,The standards and quality help by the corporate environment is very different from the store environment.  There is also no advancement according to management from store to corporate except in rare situations.
good,"This is a standard retail job. Greet customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs. Open and close cash registers, performing tasks such as counting money, separating charge slips, coupons, and vouchers, balancing cash drawers, and making deposits. ... Describe merchandise and explain use, operation, and care of merchandise to customers."
good,"Great Associates and Staff with terrible pay, i enjoyed the associates i worked with but you can see people who have worked their 10 plus years and would be lucky to be making 13 dollars an hr no advancment"
good,"It can be fun working there, however we finally have gotten a new manager so I am hoping to see some turnaround. They never have enough people working at the Henrietta store."
good,I worked at Kohl's many years ago but this was an enjoyable job. I only worked part time so i did not receive any benefits. The management team was very friendly.
good,"It i'snt the worst place i've worked, but it i'snt the best either. The hours suck and the pay isnt any better. If you arent desperate for the money i wouldnt want to urge anyone to work here."
good,"Typical day involves point of sale, interacting with customers,  On-boarding was less than smooth, Some supervisors conduct themselves with than expected professionalism.  Other colleagues are friendly,  Overall the sales floor is fine for a part-time job."
good,"Setting UP registers @ Customer Services"
good,"My day starts with getting registers set for the day"
good,Very good job. They were flexible with the hours. The worker are some what young so a lot of immaturity happens. I liked this job for part time work. They gave raises also
good,"The employees at Kohl's are very helpful and they're always moving. They're always willing to help other coworkers on projects and can always help customers. The only problem is that the store is very lenient with prices and it's ""the customer is always right"" attitude, which can only work for so long until the rule is taken advantage of."
good,"lot of nice people but pay was suck, was only there for a summer and part time job , but enjoyed the time there made many new good friends there and they were very helpful"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Worked here while in college. Best part would be the flexible hours that allowed me to work while on breaks from school. Coworkers were great and easy to work with.
good,"Some upper management is fine, from my experience they believed anything they heard, scheduled me whenever they felt like it which sucked, and can be rude."
good,most of my days were spent in the shoe section organizing all the shelves and making the displays immaculate. my hours were not good enough for me to stay longer than I did. not my favorite job.
good,"Loved my coworkers, but my supervisors were relatively rude. We would get talked down on, even in front of customers. I could tolerate rude customers, but rude supervisors crosses the line."
good,Flexible with schedule; expect to not get the same amount of hours each week. Expect to be cross-trained so that you can work in different departments; that will increase your hours a week!
good,"It's ok, i don't get many hours but the associates are nice and they keep cross training me in other departments. The hardest part of the job is the monotony of working the same area."
good,"they didn't really train me to well , just had computer training. but the other co works always help if I didn't know something. the work place was very family like everybody always helped each other out. there was never anything really to hard about this job."
good,"I am getting no pay this week because they had no work. Otherwise its a very pleasant place to work. The people are nice, and management is fine. They bring in lunch on inventory days and as rewards for a job well done. I simply can't live on 10 hours a week pay, or no work at all. Part timers get 9 dollars an hour. Full timers get 10."
good,"I was kept busy at Kohl's performing multiple tasks including unloading semi trailers, delivering merchandise to the sales floor, maintaining shipping ans receiving logs and training new employees."
good,"The team members , some not all, were not friendly at all. The hours are great though. There's always work to be done  and the work days go very fast."
good,"The management was okay. They didn't schedule well at all. I constantly did jobs that 3 people should have been doing by myself. They didn't have enough workers, people constantly quit."
good,You are always on your feet working to get things done. The other workers are easy to get along with and it is a great place to work in groups to get big projects done.
good,I do not want to participate in this survey. If you would like to call me personally I can answer any questions that you may have. I can be reached at the number on my resume.
good,"When you get to work you'd plan the schedule for the day and let everyone know where they are going and what they are doing. You'd then get a BB of RF and go onto the sales floor to do a walk thru and price changes or whatever is needed that day. The associates are nice and I love the fast pace of the job. Something is different everyday, I love retail.  There is a good balance of merchandise that is expensive and reasonably priced. From the day I started everyone was nice but they also talked bad about the boss and now I know why, this just wasn't the right fit for me, good pay or not.  The assistant managers and supervisors were nice and they really helped out when they could. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and some of the seasoned co-workers."
good,"Easy, laid back job. The hardest part was management always taking the customers side, working holidays, and making unrealistic credit card goals. The best part was that you are given many breaks and most of the customers are very kind. The work environment is friendly and laid back. The worst part was folding clothes in one place for hours and working in the fitting room. I was also given no training."
good,It was an alright place to work the only major problem is the fact that there was no room to move up into a fiull time position but for people who only wont part time jobs its great.
good,It was fairly fun and easy to work for there was just no full time positions making it hard to move up in the company. Would have stayed if there was anyway to move forward.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I solved a customer's issue and he/she were able to perform their job duties with no hassle or interruptions because of computer problems
good,"The staff was extremely nice and the work was fairly simple. However, my 40 minute drive was not worth the 4 hours a week they were giving me. They kept hiring new people and cutting our hours because they were ""over budget."""
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I loved this job. It was my first job, and the employees made me feel like family. I've had multiple opportunities to do different jobs while at kohl's."
good,I worked at 2 different locations and I must say the people I worked with were great. I had a few bumps here or there with some employees with this company but all were resolved
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls when I was 17-18 and finishing high school. "
good,"Benefits are great, work life balance is decent, management is terrible. In the 3+ years I've worked for Kohl's, year after year the culture changes for the worst. Round tables are had to identify areas of opportunity but very little changes. Leaders do not invest time in associates as they should for development, only to reprehend."
good,"Your typical day in a retail space is very hectic and you have to be ready for those types of situations mentally. ""The customer is always right"" , this quote literally applies to how you handle yourself in a work space like this."
good,it was very stressful working there i worked in the shoe department with no help what so ever. managment was very bad they didnt help one anager even laughed at me wen i asked for help it was hard to get someone to cover my breaks.
good,"I really liked it there the people were nice, the work there was easy to learn and I never could say I didn't have any work to do and that was the best part to stay with something to do."
good,They were always on me for no reason.  They got rid of me for something that wasn't even my fault.  Its not a bad store but to work there would not be the best in my eyes.
good,The managers are very nice and helpful to all the employees. On the job training. Employees help each other.  Never be afraid to to ask for help. Working black Friday and other busy days meals were supplied for the employees and Management made sure everyone ate.
good,It was okay I really didn't like how stressful the enviorment was sometimes but it is what it is. Friendly staff but not the most helpful when you are trying to do something you are unfamiliar with.
good,Overall OKAY place to work if you're a teenager looking for extra money. Upper level managers were okay when it came to life outside of work. Fun work
good,"Okay place to work, management is always stressing, and customers will be customers. Unable to say no, unless you are backed by a manager. Will be punished with lower hours if you decline to pick up extra hours certain weeks, or take vacation/days off."
good,"People I worked with were great, but the managers didn't agree on what was important. Discounts were decent. Store manager truly believed the customer is always right, which I disagree with."
good,"Make no mistake, this is corporate culture: pay as few employees as little as possible to maximize profits. The work itself was fine, the hours flexible. But you're just a cog in a machine."
good,I did not care for working for company not enough staff for a proper shift change and training. Although pay was okay the amount of time scheduled did not add up.
good,Worked here in during the school time and was able to work around my schedule.  Very flexible and allows for time off.  No opportunities for advancement.
good,I enjoyed my time at kohl's.Sadly there just wasn't enough help when he came to backup on registers. It felt like a one man show most of the time. It could have been easily avoided
good,"Typical work day starts off with group meeting that is administered by the manager in charge. Goal of the day is then directed to all sales representatives. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working at kohl s was nothing to brag about it was a job in which i unloaded a truck and put items away and then on off days i would walk the property helping sell where i could if my department wasn't busy.
good,"You never stay in the same spot the whole time you work for Kohl's. If your department isn't busy, they will move you to another department. It can be a good thing seeing how it gives you a chance to be trained in numerous departments, however, it can being annoying to some especially when you just get used to doing a job and they move you to train you for a new one. You are on your feet the whole time you're working and have to do a lot of walking."
good,Nice company they work together as team to get the job done. They also help other company events with projects. What they do for others is great. Great people to work with.
good,A typical day at work consisted of re-folding clothes in my department in order to maintain an organized department section. The workplace culture was difficult to describe as there was only one associate in each department section so there was rarely any communication between co-workers. The hardest part of the job was determining when one would be scheduled to come to work as there were certain days where the schedule for the upcoming week or month were not available yet despite being the last day of the week I needed to come in to work. Therefore I needed to come back on my day off to see if the schedule was updated.
good,Kohls has a very fun and exciting management staff. Competitive pay and a good programs for those who choose to grow within the company. Very supportive to those that are in school.
good,"The Kohl's I was working at had fantastic managers, but the whole store was unorganized. Terribly. Most of the staff needed to be retrained to do their job properly. But that's only because the trainers were horrible at training in general. The store also hired a lot of people for sections were they didn't need a lot of workers working; So those workers end up not receiving a lot of hours. Usually no more than 2 shifts a week."
good,Picking different locations of clients merchandise for the customers to have it sent directly to the customers home.  With out having to go through a middle man
good,"If you are one to always be in motion, this is the perfect job for you. at the time i worked here it stayed packed. nice discounts for employees and always promotions going on. customer moral was always up."
good,I loved working with retail. My downfall was that I spent my money where I worked.  I have immediate growth in working there.  I started in Customer Service and elevated to Cash Office quite quickly.
good,"The Kohl's I worked in was located in Brooklyn, NY.  This store is the highest grossing store in the US from what I heard.  It was very stressful.  Always crowded with long lines.  The management were good people, always trying to keep up with everyone."
good,"Working at kohls is a great experience, the only downfall is they didn't really work with my school schedule. It's hard to change your availability, they usually have people who close all the time or open all the time"
good,Things are getting tougher due to change management. Wonderful benefits and all around work environment is great. The specific job I have is changing in a way that I'm no longer happy with.
good,"The pay wasn't that great, but it was an easy job to do after class. I couldn't say the same about the weekend or holidays, but I did get along with my co-workers."
good,"Extremely tedious work, however could be made fun if co-workers are genuine and interested in doing the work. Working together is the key to success. Good job."
good,"I learned a lot about retail from this job but am not sure I would take it again, managers squeezed everything out of sales associates and often took the customers' side in disputes."
good,"My typical day would be clocking in, get my id, then walk to the registers, greet customers, help customers, and then check them out with merchandise."
good,Retail assistant. Cashiering and cleaning up after the store. When working the late night shift you have to count up the money and give it to the manager
good,"It was your basic entry level retail job.  You ring up people's purchases, take their coupons, then tell them to have a nice day.  Not a bad place.  Worst thing about it are the customers that want things their way.  This ain't Burger King, honey.  That, and that you don't get a paid lunch break.  I worked during the holiday season, so I had lots of stressful periods where the lines wrapped around the store and people had hundreds of dollars worth of product.  But your fellow employees usually understand what that's like, so you get to vent with them about how stressful it is and how dumb some costumers are.  Managers for the most part were super cool.  Only a few that took things too seriously."
good,"Overall, Kohls is a well run corporation.  The company is very demanding of their management team.  Unfortunately, time restraints often cause unhappy and stressed lower management.  Kohl's does offer great discounts to their employees, however, low wages often prevent employees from taking advantage of these opportunities.  As a consumer, the company offers quality merchandise at affordable prices, a neat and clean store, and constant turnover of merchandise."
good,"The company would have been way worse to work for if it didn't have great employees. Store manager was hot and cold with you, liked you one day, wouldn't speak to you the next. My store was a rural store and didn't get as much customers, weekdays tended to be slow, weekends and holidays were fast paced and fun."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Hardworking"
good,"Working at Kohl's was okay, it was just a job. It wasn't horrible, however it wasn't amazing. I enjoyed my time there however I wouldn't go back to work there."
good,"As a Kohls associate my job is to help customers with all their needs and keep up with the fitting rooms. The hardest moments are also when the fitting rooms over flood with clothing customers try on and later on decide they don't want the item anymore. Us as sales floor we have to put all the items back to where they belong in a fast paced, which that can be sometimes very challenging since we also have to keep up with other situations. But one of the most enjoyable part of the job is getting great compliments from customers and watching them walk out the store proudly."
good,"I get to work go inside and punch the clock, depending on what i have going on that day. i'll help customer or stocking boxes in the back or putting up merchandise on the floor neatly and in order, organizing, cleaning up the store. managers are there if you need them and help you with your job and many others to help the store run smoothly, like a team. the hardest part of the job is not getting your task complete at the end of the day but you will still keep going to get the task done. the good part about the job is your coworkers and working as a team and customers having a smile on their face when they walk into to the store."
good,Company needs more organization. Scheduling not set according to an individual  availability. Corporate takes a long time to get to any kind of complaint.
good,"i would work there again part time if given the chance "
good,"At the time I was still at school while working here. They typically scheduled me about 4-8 hours per week. During that time though, I was typically assigned to either the Home or Kids department. Every now and then, Loss Prevention would have me helping out with some of their cases. They also ask the floor associates to help solicit their credit cards while helping the customer, but its not too hard."
good,Kohl's has a great environment depending on which store you work at and your management. The store I was employed at I felt that I was able to learn how to work in retail however I felt that there was not a lot of communication on the management part on what could be done better as I worked.
good,"All the hard work specially standing the whole shift, busy hours and complains but its fun, Management are cool. Co worker is just doing fine. I've learned a lot of things."
good,"As a floor associate, my job was really just to fold clothes, assist customers and clear the fitting rooms. It was sometimes painfully boring, but not bad work by any means. I did not really work closely with other associates, which I didn't really enjoy. But the company as a whole seems great and like they sincerely care both about employees and customers."
good,"Productive work environment"
good,Working with Kohls was seasonal job. They didnt care about your work environment because you were only there for a short amount of time. Management wouldnt check on me during shifts to see if everything was going smoothly.
good,it was  a good place to work and learn new opportunities. we were rotated to other departments on slow days but being rotated taught us a lot of how the other department worked and connected to every other department when being operated on productive days.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kohl's.  Company shared expectations and key performance indicators frequently.  You knew exactly where you stood at all times.  Good place to be.
good,"I enjoyed working for Khols, it was an experience that taught me a lot about customer service. I learned more about the retail world, while working there. It would make the perfect first job for anybody."
good,"Getting ready for Black Friday was not easy, it was manageable. Working with some managers made the day go by faster. It was also in the middle of town which made it easier to get to every day."
good,I would recommend this job to anyone that is looking for a part time job that is relaxed. It is not too hard of a job and it is a good working environment.
good,"Fast pace job always something to do. You have to like helping customers with finding clothes, outfits, and be able to run the registers. Also ordering merchandise online."
good,Strives to provide good customer service. Has many associates who have been working there for long periods of time.  Is expanding associate opportunities with higher wages.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This was my first job and the people that trained me weren't very nice. Nice that you get paid weekly, but you're lucky enough if you get more than 15 hours within that week."
good,"I worked stocking soft lines"
good,Perfect p/t job! Employees are wonderful & always helpful! Ability to cross-train and learn new skills if desired. TEAM atmosphere! Wonderful customers!
good,"This was my first job and was a great place to get my foot into the door of the working world.  I enjoyed my time there, but could never see it as a place to stay forever.  The pay was quite minimal for the hours I was putting in, but it is retail going by minimum wage.  Great for a part time job especially during the holidays!"
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls.  I only left because I was pursing a full time job and did not have time to work both jobs.  The people were great.  I was always learning something new and was crossed training in almost the entire store. There was always something to do.  Very enjoyable to work for Kohls.
good,"Kohls is a great company with a lot of room for advancement, and many standards for their stores. However, it may be overwhelming to those with little experience trying to get in on the ground floor, especially during their holiday season. Not for me, but is good overall."
good,"I applied and accepted the offer for the Beauty Advisor position. As a cosmetology student, you have certain expectations going in field related jobs. This position was nothing as I expected. You were briefly informed on products, but no true explanation. They weren't really concerned about your knowledge on products. They wanted someone to give out samples and clean and stock. It did not live up to a true position as a Beauty Advisor."
good,"if you have ever worked retail, then you know that the hours are not the best. I did love the people that I worked with. which is what I would say was the best thing about this job. I had to sell khols cards in order to receive any hours at work, and they didn't pay very well when I worked for them. I was a great worker but it just wasn't paying the bills. great customer service experience though"
good,"This is a job with a high turnover rate. There is a reason they make announcements in the store asking for new hires. The most important thing to them is getting people to apply for credit cards, even if they do not understand what is happening."
good,"It is not a bad place to work. The supervisors are 50/50, some are awesome and some make you wonder how they got their positions. They offer paid time off and good medical and dental plans."
good,The company is a fine company. I just don't want to work retail any longer. Kohls would be a good second job for someone but not as a primary source of income.
good,"I didn't quite enjoy working at Kohls. Although, my supervisors were lovely, I wasn't very fond of the work. Nonetheless, I commend supervisors for attempting to make their subordinates feel the most comfort possible."
good,The over all experience of me working at kohl's was very interesting. I felt that the staff was not motivated at all to do their job. Some days it seemed we were a team and other days it seemed as if it were every man for themselves.
good,"While I did appreciate my time and what I learned in retail, there was no room to grow.  The overall staff was very friendly, but my home location played ""favorites"" with employees.  At first, it was enjoyable to be able to do what ever I felt like in a days work.  Then after a while of working with some suspicious staff, it was very tense.  It was my first job and I feel like they tried to get me to do what ever they could do with a naïve mind.  They did care about their Kohl's Cares Program, and taking part in the volunteer work is the only thing I miss about working there."
good,Job in itself is not bad but the duties become monotonous. They love to cross train and assign every duty and expect some projects to become completed at an unreal time. You are given tedious tasks regularly and it can really get to your head. Management is generally easy going and does not get on your case about much of anything. They also tend to be passive aggressive at times and it miscommunication can arise.
good,"Kohl's Is A Fun Place To Work . I Really Enjoyed My Time , But The Pay Wasn't Enough For Me. If Your Looking For Somewhere To Work That's A Great Environment , It's Definetly Kohl's"
good,"On a typical day of work, I was constantly helping customers, working on the registers, and taking in returns at the service desk. The place had an over all at-home-feeling that made working there enjoyable."
good,"Employees are not permitted to leave the store for lunch break, no food is provided for night time crew. No smoke breaks are given, freight nights are usually awful. Price change nights aren't too bad."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical work day was productive & busy. Communication skills improved. I was forced to step out of my comfort zone & deal with difficult situations.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kohl's.  It is a large corporation and you can definitely feel it.  the metrics are heavier related to pedaling Kohl's charge cards which is necessary but not what I enjoyed selling.
good,I only worked here seasonally but it was a very emotionally taxing job. You're expected to know job requirements within a week of working there and I was not trained.
good,I was here for a little while but I seen the in & out of how customer service & deliveries work. I was a picker/packer. It was a large work place & their was many things happening at one time to get the job done.
good,"Fast paste friendly environment would've been better if they hired permanently . Pay good every week. "
good,had a great time working here. seeing all the people come in to shop was great and I loved all the discounts you got as an employee on the merchandise
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. They have great benefits and incentives. They also have a plethora of options to advance in your career. I would highly recommend.
good,"My coworkers and bosses were fantastic. I came into work, worked at the register, had occasional breaks, and then went home. It was never too exciting. I learned a lot about customer service and that customers can be very difficult and I learned different ways to approach specific customers. The hardest pert of the job was learning my way around the register technology and how to bypass some of its glitches to make the customers happy. I enjoyed the job once I learned the tricks to using the register and when I didn't have to call the managers to ask them every little question."
good,hardest part of the job was dealing with customer service to some really impossible people. but it was for the most part a fun part time job i enjoyed except around big sales and holidays
good,Worked seasonal for this company.  Very busy during peak times of the year.  Wasn't a fan of having to push the credit cards as part of the sales/checkout process.
good,I did not really enjoy much of my time working at kohls. the managers did not make it a fun environment to work at. they were very bad with giving me hours I asked for
good,It was a lot of labor. They weren't very good with their hours but I worked there two years in a row as a seasonal employee. The atmosphere is bright.
good,"Kohl's is a place where is always busy, a lot of customers returning merchandise, time runs fast because there is a lot to do. The hardest part at kolh's is when we get customers with bad attitude, but i was able to handle that situation."
good,A typical day of working there was long and tiring. i like that i was able to listen to music while working.the hardest part was working 12 hour shifts in that hot place.
good,"Heavy work load, little prior planning before project requested. High stress due to short deadlines. Design is an iterative process and can take time, when there is short production time, it is harder to produces high quality work. Often had to sacrifice family time and adequate sleep. There was a lot of overtime with little financial compensation. I became organization's ""go-to"" guy as the word got around regarding the quality and originality of my work, . Highest management levels requested my design services, however you are penalized for overtime, as they are not willing to pay for additional production time due to very tight budgets."
good,"okay work place, boss at the time was rude. a worker was being harassed and she told them to suck it up or go home, they left and she got upset."
good,Kohl's and the management at the time definitely molded me into a lovely sales associate. Its a great starting point and even better work enviorment.
good,"Enjoyed working at this company."
good,"Nice workers and easy to learn from other employees"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Awesome place to work as a college student. Managers are willing to work with schedule and pay is decent for a college student.
good,"a lot of running around "
good,"Working here was pretty fun. I liked learning how to be a cashier. The management was pretty cool, I wouldn't say they were the best. My coworkers were pretty friendly and welcoming."
good,Job pays weekly and the pay is good. The only reason I anticipate leaving is because its seasonal and hours are limited.  Co workers are great and management is good.
good,I loaded trailers the thing I hated about this job was that it was to many lanes you had to deal with. Running from this end of the warehouse to the other end.
good,good place to work if going to school or have small children they will work with you. during the holiday good hrs but after youll get one or two days a week
good,"A retail store where tasks are simple and easy. However, the costumers can be problematic but capable to resolve their issues."
good,"Those who I have worked for"
good,A good job and a good pay. The only problem was holiday scheduling they would schedule even though I requested off and was out of town. The managers were very nice and easy going.
good,"Typical retail position. best part is all of the discounts you get. Depending on your district manager, there is a lot of opportunity for management and advancing. however, if you are a salary employee, you can bet on working 60-80 hours per week."
good,Basic retail and freight work with opportunities to learn basic sales skills across a broad section of products and move up.
good,"Most of days were typical i observed, i learned patience and quick decision-making in order to deal with situation. Management was like as usual throwing work downward without calculation of time. work place culture was friendly where all employees lived with integrity and discipline. I never passed through any hardest part of job. In fact, i made many of hard task simplified. Most enjoyable part was learning and meeting new people everyday."
good,Great job if you want consistency in a work place warehouse setting great pay great learning environment only this I didn't care for is that it was seasonal
good,A regular day at Kohl's for me is interacting with customers at the customer service desk and on the phone talking to customer answering questions. The hardest part of the job for me is having to turn customers away because of something that we don't control on the store level. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to customers and helping them with the things that they need.
good,this is an awesome stuff to shop at and work for. the floors are always kept clean bathrooms are smelling fresh and they always keep things in stock you want
good,"It was good to work there , but it wasnt for me , they didnt give me any hours i worked 8 hours a week at one point and the pay wasn't all that when i had to bills"
good,Good but could be better.  Management is very inconsistent when it comes to following corporate rules which lends to some confusion.
good,I thoroughly enjoy what I do. The coworkers are great and its pretty great being able to meet new people everyday. You have those regular customers who you are able to build a bond with and I believe thats what working in retail is all about. You could easily feel under appreciated at times for things that you do but thats something that could happen with any job. Just gotta get it done and keep moving.
good,"This was a good place to work at... It offered less hours than my last job, but a steadier paycheck, so it was kind of even steven for me."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a good company to work for. If you like close customer interaction this is the place for you. It is a good company if you are looking for an easy way in to the retail business. This would be an excellent first job for someone in high school. The pay could be better, but the discount makes up for it."
good,"Khol's was a seasonal warehouse job. The job was fast-paced but, very easy. I received two thirty minute breaks a day. Management wasn't excellent at communication; many of them were very rude to the employees. Although the management wasn't very well-kept, I met some very good people during my time. I got along with generally everyone I talked to. The job itself wasn't very hard at all. Occasionally, an item wouldn't be in it's location and I would have to see if it was out of stock or whatever the case was. However the best part was during the week of thanksgiving; there was $250 incentive for working a 50+ hour week. The job overall was simple, the coworkers were nice people, and I was by myself for a good portion of any normal work day."
good,Some days were stressful because of certain management and messy customers. It was fun meeting new people and becoming friends.
good,"I had fun working with Kohl's, even do we were worckin  at 10 hours 6days a week ,if we needed help ,they would help us ,there lunch room was really big ,with lots if microwave, and refrigerator, we never had a problem to warm our food."
good,"There was always something to be done in a timely manner. Nonetheless getting it done was a great satisfaction. Peers were kind and generous, the customers seldom rude and the work was adequate."
good,Remaining calm in a fast paced and usually very busy environment is key. Kohls is known for their awesome coupons and sales so it is usually always busy.
good,I loved the people I worked with and worked for. I loved helping customers with great service. I enjoyed working in Housewares and helping customers finding house hold items.
good,"I cannot really tell you about the environment as a whole, I only worked there for day on a special hiree agreement. It was okay and the ppl were nice."
good,"	Maintained knowledge of latest fashion trends and provided counsel to customers with clothing options"
good,"I already told you guys about my experience with the company.  I don't want to repeat myself, You can go back and look at my statement from before."
good,"Check assignment"
good,"Kohls is a decent job. It's fast paced, and you have to work quickly and efficiently. I personally feel that the employees are not appreciated or cared about the way they should be, but you do get a lot of great deals on clothes and household items."
good,"Normal working environment for retail. Come in, start your shift, go through the day helping customers, and clock out. People were very good there and everyone enjoyed working there. Management often seemed to not know where to put people as a lot of new people were put on customer service or tasked with doing something they've never been trained for."
good,Learned omni system and worked with team to complete sales. Communicate issues with online orders to supervisor. Help customer find products or solutions to their needs. Christmas time can make it hard to get fully trained then regular associates do not understand you are doing your best with what information you have been trained on.
good,This position offered a friendly work-life balance. I developed great relationships here that I will cherish forever. I also have maintained great relationships with customers.
good,I took the job because I needed the money during the winter. Manganemt was good. I enjoyed it mostly. I prefer more interaction with people though.
good,"I wouldn't consider Kohl's a bad work place, but you must have a lot of patience in order to work here. The management is decent, depending on who the manager is during your shift. If a manager is in a bad mood, it seems like the whole staff is. However, there are some good days where the team has a lot of fun together. Overtime, they really become your family, but be prepared for your personality to change overtime. Customers can run your patience thin."
good,Only worked for a short period of time. Coworkers and management were friendly. They did not push for advancement. Best part about working there were the discounts!
good,Kohl's cared about their employees and worked with their schedule and emergencies. The team was incredibly friendly and everyone had respect for the company and how things were ran.
good,"typically the day goes by slow if you have idle hands but either a supervisor or manager with find something for you to do, management can be tough to work with at times but it gets easier just stay on their good side, coworkers are great and supportive."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was a pretty easy job. You keep the dressing rooms clean and the fold tables have to be properly folded at all times. The cash registers would also have clothes that customers would change their mind on, those would have to be put up as well."
good,"There isn't much training. You mostly learn as you go, Sorting clothing and running registers. The hardest part is leaning where everything goes so you can help people."
good,The thing I remember most about working for this company is the employees. We generally had a younger staff so there was plenty of drama to go around. It didnt help that management would often be at the core of these incidents. Overall enjoyable as long as you weren't involved with the politics.
good,"I don't remember to be honest. This job was a while ago and I was only doing stock, so I only had to learn where to put things."
good,"•	Move freight to and from loading dock stations by hand or manual pallet jack."
good,"The customers were characteristic to the way the world is moving at this time, no care for others.  A me-self mentality, the care of others in the store was not considered by the other customers, they were pigs."
good,"Kohl's is a fun place to work, with opportunities to be cross-trained. They are very flexible in terms of scheduling. A few cons is the fact that they only offer a 15% discount and they barely give you any hours. Management is notoriously hard to track down."
good,"Nice place to work mainly for entry level applicants who needs the experience. I have always been more of the hands-on type. And i love driving forklifts, i never had the opportunity here."
good,The job was challenging at times and i felt that management showed favoritism towards different employees. Never really got help where it was need as well.
good,"Its a great place to work during the holidays, the pay is great an there's all the over time you want. The people you work with are some of the nicest people you'll work with"
good,I was a sales associate. I mostly worked as cashier in the Men's department and also assisted customers. Occasionally I would do early morning freight unload shifts.
good,"I had a few problems there buy you will have problems at any minimum wage job, so it's a good place compared to a fast food restaurant and good work environment. But they work you really hard and expect too much from you in certain job positions. Keeping your sales floor clean, keeping the fitting rooms cleaned out,  keeping the return room cleaned out,  and helping customers can be way too much sometimes. Especially when they expect you to put away the clothes from the fitting room.  The managers would make me feel like I didn't get my job done when I was working hard all day.  But they have gatherings for employees and parties and do different things to show appreciation to employees.  Great break room.  15 minutes breaks are short."
good,"Management besides the store manager, Casey Beckley, was dismal. The hardest part of the job is ""truck day"" when most all employees get to the store early to unload, unbox, organize the new shipment to send out new merchandise to all the departments within the store. Registering, pricing and tagging items before they go out onto the shelves. That would have been the hardest part of the job."
good,"Kind employees, just started this job. So far it a lot to handle and watch over but so far so good. I appreciate that.this job can be better what what can I say a job is a job. Manager is nice and the supervisor is kind to he know how to train very well and to give good compliments to his workers. New coming employees and older experience employees too. He notice the hard work the employees are putting in on the job"
good,"It is not a bad place to work by any means, good part time job but don't expect to be appreciated for your hard work.  Just do the job you are hired for and everyone is happy."
good,I enjoyed working at the store I worked at ! Very corporate though which causes the workers to sometimes be swept under the rug because all we are is a number .
good,"I worked in the QC department as a temporary employee in the Kohl's e-Distribution Warehouse. The hours were good and the work was fast-paced and physically taxing during the holiday season. Once the rush was over, though, my work hours dwindled to nothing and I was not offered a permanent position. Overall the place was well-managed, clean, efficient, and everyone had a great attitude."
good,"Team work"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,loved working here. everyone is very friendly and nice. never got any hours. learned how to deal with money better. loved working the register and interacting with the customers.
good,"For the short time I was there it was a decent job, just didn't like that it was temporary. The work was hard at first but very manageable. The hours were long but the pay was worth it."
good,I love working with people. This store has a large selection to chose from. The clearance items are always the best and cheapest
good,"Customer service is what I love to do and kohls is a company that is based on customer service. I enjoyed working with the ad-set team we all became very good friends. My favorite part was the leadership i took when my supervisor was away. I'm very dedicated to my work, and being a leader has its pressures, but im very controlled and calm under pressure. The job was complete on time with no complaints while i was in charge."
good,Good environment and friendly people. Fast paced during holidays.Great customer service and great employee participants. Makes for a happy and fun working environment with great team memebers.
good,"Review CCTV/ over & shorts apprehend shoplifters. Conduct daily, weekly and monthly audits. Responsible for store safety and compliance. Write shoplift reports/ testify in court."
good,"Working at Kohl's is a love hate relationship. Certain days are better than other and it depends on what type of customers you get that day. As far as management goes, when I was there the manager where helpful and personal. The hardest part about working there was trying to make sure you were giving the best customer service the whole time. The most enjoyable part was working with the great employees."
good,"flexible hours and schedule, friendly coworkers at the location in linden NJ."
good,"Flexible schedule and great associate discounts"
good,was front end manager set up registers in the morning supervised cashiers and customer service made sure associates had change when needed counted out each associate at end of shift
good,"This was a really fun place to work. However because of the low compensation rate there was a high turn over rate! This job kept you busy, and the coworkers were awesome!"
good,Kohls was my first job and it taught me much about retail. I learned how to handle crisis like situations and have a better understanding of people in general.
good,Overall good place to work good staff and friendly managers.They where always very good about meeting your needs when it came to your kids.
good,Kohl's is a fast pace environment.  There will be times management would want you to be able to multi-task. For an example: You may have to work the sales floor and put merchandise away and work the cash register when you are called. The management team are very friendly and they work with you to help you in what you need help with. Co-workers are very friendly and they will help you especially if you are a new employee. Hardest part of the job would be if you are the only one on the sales floor it can be frustrating and stressful but the management team will help you with anything they can.
good,Decent work for starters would like more room to advance however great for those wanting to get their foot in the door of retail would be a good opportunity.
good,"Like many other retail jobs. Can be fun, but busy. Hectic during sale days and holidays. I don't really want to say more, but Indeed requires it."
good,Great first job. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle multiple situations. It also made me work very good as a team as well as alone.
good,this company has good vacay and work hours during holiday season isnt that bad. this company will work you tired. if you can go for another retailer.
good,The people are awesome.  The policies and guidlelines set forth for Loss Prevention are vague.  Need to improve on aiding assosciates.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Busy work place with occasional downsizing. Excellent compensation with varies hours available. Hardest part of the job is lifting, some things are heavier than others."
good,Good place to start you career. The schedule is tough and gets old after a few years. Senior leaders never seem satisfied. Nice team atmosphere. Easy to advance.
good,"seasonal help "
good,Nice layout of the store and awesome discount very clean everybody works well together as a team fun working nought stocking the store and build showcases
good,A typical day at work your minding your own business and everyone thinks their the boss. I've learned to stay calm at all times. The management was a complete disaster. Some of my co-workers were nice and some were bossy and not helpful.
good,"it was my first job, and I loved it. I was there for 3 years, I learned many things. I loved all the staff, we got along great."
good,it was ok. team was ok. the store has no hours so even supervisors are part time. that needs to change. can never get anything done. lots of 4 hours shifts.
good,"Very fun job and great atmosphere. Wonderful customers and customer service. Learned proper customer service skills, development great communication working with customers, learned point of sale system and cash handling, learn about loss prevention strategies, fast paced environment."
good,A typical day at Kohls always begins with preparing myself for the shift ahead. This meant equipping myself with a radio and palm pilot so that I may properly assist customers. Customer service was always the focal point to everyday. What I found most enjoyable was watching customers walk away from the store with a smile on their face and knowing that it was the work of myself and my peers that left them in such a great mood.
good,My typical work day would be from 10 am until about 2 or 3 pm and I would work only one to two days a week if that. I never had any hours.
good,It's a really big store with lots of things to do when your finish doing one thing. But your not getting paid for the things your doing. You don't get paid enough for what you do
good,"Management was overall amazing, teammates were not always the best but most of the time I worked with people who worked just as hard as I did."
good,home depot starts at $11 hr for freight team part time a lot more than Khols and they have very flexible scheduling...khols wants you to have unlimited availability...hard to do with the pay rate
good,"The average day was often fast paced and busy. I was able to hone my customer service skills and learn how to operate a Point of sale system. The management was great most of the time, but there were 6 managers and a manager in training. All my coworkers were helpful and pleasant to work with."
good,Busy is the only word to describe working in retail. It was never a dull moment working at kohls. The hardest part of the job was getting hours.
good,"I have learned how to deal with many different types of people I am a very friendly , calm & patient so customers seem to gravitate toward me even the irate one's who I have had to deal with often enough..    My co-workers are great - we try are best to help one another as best we can."
good,folding clothes checking people out at the cashier station hard part was management co workers were great. i knew how to be a cashier
good,Working at kohls was nothing exciting. You came in did your job and went home. Did not care for how much they expected just one person to do.
good,All of the fellow workers were super nice and always helped eachother out no matter who or where you were from. Mangers were rude though.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"For a part time job all is well.everyone is considerate. management is indescribable, the job is easy, the hardest part of the job is when the customers complain."
good,It was a job. After doing customer service for 3 years straight it's much the same as any other retail job. Even working on freight team you will still get pulled into cashiering.
good,Working in Kohls Department Store was a pleasure. In the morning there was always a daily meeting about what goals had to be met that day. Wonderful environment to work in.
good,"I loved my job because of the people I got to work with, but the company itself is quite stingy. None of us were really trained adequately (or sometimes at all) so if you're a quick learner it shouldn't be too hard. My first day I trained for 20 minutes using a separate register and practice scenarios, and when the computer program crashed, I got stuck on a register to shadow someone else. Then five minutes later, when their shift ended, I had to take over their register alone. I was never trained for any other area and just learned on the job. Some of the managers also picked favorites and let those individuals do nothing all shift, while the rest of us picked up their slack. Which the co-workers who never did their jobs and were rude to customers were never let go, which they should've been. Other managers were wonderful, made people do their work, but were still nice and friendly and caring. There also aren't many, if any, opportunities for advancement and many of my co-workers worked two and three jobs because we all made minimum wage. To worsen the blow we were never allowed to exceed 26 hours a week, so sometimes when a co-worker needed you to pick up their shift, you couldn't because you'd reached your limit."
good,It is a busy store and you will never be bored. Always something to do. I've met a lot of good people there and became close friends. Volunteering is a big part of Kohls with different events to give back to the community which is awesome. They try to make it a great experience for you to work there.
good,A typical day is grab a scanner log in then go to assigned door number. I learned how to maintain a steady work paste for a long period of time. The management was okay could have been better. Co workers were hard workers. The hardest part of the job was loading trucks that were high paced and had different sized boxes at random. The most enjoyable part was lunch break.
good,customers phones and requisters  customers were fun and the employees and managers did not work well together the hours were different and varies from week to week
good,"Kohl's was a decent employment setting where I had the experience of gaining team work skills.  Within a group situation, I was able to work with other employees in assisting the unloading of trucks to prepare the packages for unwrapping and preparations for display within the store.  Often, I was able to communicate with management in order to learn about steps to prepare retail items for packaging, and/or for in-store showing.  This would not be a bad option of return-work."
good,"I’ve greatly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity I’ve had to gain some much needed first corporate job experience. I’ve learned the importance of teamwork and communication, which are things I will take with me throughout my future careers. In my positions on the sales floor as well as behind the register I faced many conflicts, both internally and with customers. With this I was able to learn how to maintain good customer service when faced with disagreement, corporate and effectively work with associates regardless of personal feelings, and remain professional in any situation."
good,Management was very friendly. I worked as a sales associate (cashier) so my day consisted of being behind the register and handling money. I never ran into any issues as far as management or customers. Great place to work.
good,"I took the old sale signs down, made the new sale signs, and put the new sales back up in the right spots. I went through the clothes on the racks and put all the sizes in the right spots."
good,I wasnt there for long but it was okay for being a seasonal employee. Can't really say much about the company since i wasnt there for long.
good,Typical department store job and nothing more. I worked for KHOLS for almost 5 years in the Asset Protection Department (LPM)  It was fun while it lasted.
good,"It was stressful, high paced and there was a lack of protection from customer abuse. Customers were allowed to go off on employees and management would placate them with coupons etc."
good,"I worked there when I was 16. I was shy and timid, they were very pushy with me and got frustrated easily with me and yelled at me a lot."
good,"When I was hired I was told they would work with my college and summer schedule, since I couldn't work weekends during the summer.  However, I had lots of issues with scheduling.  It seemed when I was busy I got scheduled lots of hours but when I was actually free I was lucky to get 4 hours/week.  However, the employee discounts were pretty decent and there are lots of opportunities to extend some discounts to family."
good,The store had each employees space cleaned. Each persons place was always being worked on to make sure each customer can get what they needed without any problem. The store ran smoothly with each employee doing their part.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day involved lots of reorganizing and very little time actually helping customers. The hardest part was not being able to help every customer properly. There were many times when we needed more help on the floor, but didn't have any and the customers who needed one on one attention were the ones who suffered. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually helping and interacting with the customers because I had answers to their questions and I could understand their situations. It was a great feeling to know that you helped someone in someway that needed your assistance."
good,"Management and coworkers were great! Job wasn't too bad. But, due to not getting enough hours per week, I stepped down from my position."
good,"There wasn't ever typical days, because you were given new tasks to do everyday, which kept me busy and i like personally. I liked taking on new tasks, and helping as much as I could. Something's were a little off, such as new employee's were kind of threw into working, no training or very little, which had led to preventable mistakes. Also, it was alot harder on student employee's to get hours, because older employee's were not willing to work or change hours, many of us stayed very late on school nights, and hours were short, I had no choice but to resign because I was hardly working. I did learn self discipline/"
good,Kohl's was my very first job. Good learning experience and a good place to start off in the working world. The pay was ok and they will work with you availability. Average retail job. They also had volunteer events and special days when they would bring food or snacks.
good,Type of environment that gives employee to showcase adept set of skills and potentially advance from within company; However there is insufficient amount of training.
good,The pay is comparable to the rest of the industry.  You get paid every week which can be a bonus to many.  My direct supervisor may need to revisit her management abilities.  Often it is very difficult to get a hold of her and often important matters can go weeks without being addressed.  Sometimes it was weeks before I even got a response at all about anything.
good,I like this job but I just didn't like how they treated us at some points as if we didn't matter. I like to be treated with respect . but overall the pay was ok
good,"Work days at my current jon Kohls is pretty smooth customers are usually nice , since i been there ive learned how to cover different departments threw out the store.I had gotten along with my co-workers since working there.I would say the hardest part aboutn the job is there isnt much hours."
good,A typical day at work consisted of customer service and the folding and rearranging of clothes. The managers and co-workers were friendly.
good,This is a great place as a part-time secondary job.  Many days there is free lunch and I really get along well with my co-workers. I enjoy my associate discount. Several times a year we get 30% off on top of our regular discount.
good,"what i did was 	Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits"
good,it was a cool laid back work place. really enjoyed my time there. but really was not giving a real shot either...its job ended so quick...
good,"Cleaned and organized the store, including the checkout desk and displays. "
good,The Kohl's family is very entertaining. The typical work is a laborious for the pay one receives. I learned good communication skills and a lot about customer service.
good,"typical day at work was hectic most of the time you were thrown into a dept on a very busy day by yourself keeping up with 12 fitting rooms, and running to two other depts cleaning those fitting rooms. too much was expected out of you on a busy day. I learned complainning got you nowhere. My co-workers were awesome loved them all. some of the customers acknowledging you working hard before ur managers did was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"very nice people i worked with, great work environment, unfortunately little pay with a lot of work expect, long hours as well."
good,I did a lot of merchandising back stock and truck deliveries. I learned a fair amount working with Khols. Using their tools and equipment was more fun than it sounds. Management need help this holiday season. I am not sure why. I was new to retail. The coworkers were great i would not have survived Black Friday without them. The hardest part of this job was that there was not any formal training the most enjoyable part of this job was helping a customer find that perfect gift for there loved ones. That to me was my motivation everyday.
good,A typical day at work would be busy helping with customers and maintaining the store. I have gained knowledge of how to place product to increase sales. Our management team helps encourage our store sales associates.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,At the beginning of every work day each associate was assigned a set of loading docks to maintain through out the work day.
good,"A typical work day consist of clocking in,going into customer service and getting a radio,RIFID gun,going into the office and checking my mail box for any important information.Next i would usually check in with my store manager,then depending on what im scheduled for that day i would run my freight and or run recovery..as well as helping customers and being an additional cashier when needed."
good,I had a seasonal position for the holiday shopping rush.  The hiring process was pretty disorganized and the management didn't really take any time to offer training and support.
good,"A typical day of work was loading boxes off of a fast moving belt line onto a semi trailer. Loaded about 10-15 semi trailers a day. Assisted in consolidation of cartons. I learned a great deal about the inner workings of a large distribution center, and I learned how to use all of the necessary scanners and shipping methods. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult supervisors who didn't always have the knowledge necessary to help the workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the productivity of it and the friendly co-workers."
good,Your advancement is limited - depending where you work the work/life balance can be compromised. It really depends what area of the business you are at
good,I went through resume's and set up interviews for employment.  After they interviewed with the managers I would job offer and set them up for Orientation.  After the orientation I would make sure their files were complete.
good,"I've loved working for the Kohls company. Just time to move on in search of a full time job...moving up in the company have the proven hard to do. management is ok, some are appreciative, while others are not. But could be worst."
good,it was a very fun working there I loved it breaks were nice and hours for days witch is good wish they paid more. everone was really nice and outgoing working there and helping people was great I loved it very much
good,"very great job as retail. everyone at this particular location was nice and friendly. in the womens department it can get crazy, but even when others saw I needed help they would help without me aasking."
good,Working in retail is not for everyone. I especially did not like this type of job. People were rude and inconsiderate and the money in this field of work was not worth the time you have to put into it.
good,"A typical day at kohls consists of merchandising, answering customer calls,assisting customers, and strict recovery of all areas of the store."
good,when i work at knolls it was nothing but manual labor and teaches you how to be a hard worker and you can learn about receiving from the truck in the morning
good,Working for Kohl's was a good first job for me and it taught many great work skills. It taught me how to manage time at work well and the skills of working with a team.
good,This position was seasonal i rarely got a  feel for the company during my short time there. The company had good merchandise and great sale also was  convieniet location for me to commute to and from
good,Getting the returns was the start of my shift. After that I would go to my dressing room and clean it as best as I could. From there I would assist customers if I needed to.
good,"Overall Kohl's is a good company to work for benefit wise. you have no since of appreciation for the work you do. The work increases from Oct - Dec, however; the remainder of the year is spent trying to make the 40 hours for fulltime position."
good,"going and folding and makeing everything neat. helping people in there need, being casher and ring up things and bagging it"
good,This company is rather organized with credit-based incentives and competitive pay. Overall it is the typical retail environment with some  positives and negatives like most jobs.
good,"folding clothes in several departments"
good,Various departments and opportunities.  Very gossipy place to work.  Many people there are more concerned about what others are doing than completing their own work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day would include selling and merchandising jewelry. "
good,I enjoy working at Kohls. Coworkers make going to work fun and enjoyable. There have been instances where miscommunication between management and employees was lacking.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of constant cleaning of dressing rooms and racks of clothes. I answered customers questions and helped solve any problems that they had. I learned how to fold, hang and organize clothes in a swift and quick way. Management was always helpful along with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep every customer happy and satisfied. What I loved the most was being able to satisfy the customer and help them find what they were looking for."
good,"I learned how to use equipment that I needed for the job, and how to approach customers in a friendly manner . Some of my coworkers didn't get along and it would be an awkward working environment."
good,"I enjoyed the nice co-workers and management was usually easy to work with, although it changed often.  As department supervisor, I coordinated with the store manager to make decisions on projects and priorities and being able to use my own creativity was a plus.  It was a pleasure working with customers successfully to help increase sales and organize the departments to allow for an improved shopping experience.  Retail hours were not my favorite part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work was standing near/at my register all day, engaging with customers. I've learned how to keep myself occupied  while sometimes being the only cashier on one side of the store.The management wasn't too bad, I had seemed to get along with everyone for the most part. My co-workers I did not see all that often while being on register unless there was more than one of us on each side. The hardest part of the job was working on black Friday a few years back. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly customers that came in."
good,"Very easy job, minimum wage. I was a cashier, be prepared to try and convince people to sign up for a credit card. Be prepared to stand around doing nothing bored out of your skull for long periods of time, only occasionally doing any actual work as a cashier in the summer/fall time. Employees and managers where genuinely good people for the most part. If you're unambitious and in a slog this is the perfect job for you."
good,I worked seasonal at Kohl's. they lied to me and told me I was full time but I wasn't. I apply back up there for seasonal again
good,Not a bad place to work. Was never afford the opportunity to  become a permanent employee. Management always rewarded the hard works with hours if they were requested.
good,My typical day included doing go-backs and cleaning the sales floor. I learned the difficulties of working retail. Management was awesome. Super encouraging. Co-workers were all very fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is when the fitting room would get overloaded with go-backs. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with.
good,"Very fast paced during the holidays. Management was great and very motivating. Fun group of people to work with/for. Looked forward to going in each day and at the end of the day, you felt very accomplished"
good,"Great job for driven individuals, you will advance within the company if you work hard."
good,Hours were available all the time. Management was great. Point of sale system was easy to learn. Some people were favored more then others so they got more attention from the management.
good,"It seems that because Kohls is such a large company they do not care about loosing loyal employees due to life changing events. It's all about numbers. I was with the company for 3 years and I unfortunately suffer great loss and I NEVER was written up before for my performance. Yet they just fired me, no warning nor sympathy. I guess they figure we rather get rid of someone they were paying ""too much"" and hire on a new person for less."
good,"so kohls is not a place where a person can develop, they barely give employees hours I use to work 12-20 hours and my paychecks would barely be over 90 dollars"
good,"good company to work for, just bad management group within store. Not enough help to get job accomplished. Too much work for one person to get through when several people work within the department. Warped ideas of the team work concept."
good,"kohls is a big coorportation but the managers pick and have faves"
good,I took this job as a seasonal position and it was super easy to get I really didnt't get interview just immediately hired on. The pay was great at the time but they would send us home early all the time. It was really unorganized to me.
good,If you come to work and work hard there is room for growth within this company.  The pay is min. Wage and the hours are few and far between.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"With a supportive Crew it was always fun to work in the department store with a great team. Maintaining the sales floor by organizing shelves, racks, go backs was what i enjoyed the most."
good,"·  Developing ideas to prevent shoplifting, performing internal investigations, and monitoring the premises."
good,"Fun place to work, especially around the Holidays. All about the numbers and reaching daily goals. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with people my age, who helped me grow into the company."
good,"Kohl's is a good company to work for. They offer a great benefit package and comparable pay. The position is what you make of it. You can go in and do minimum work and collect a paycheck, or you can go above and beyond and have opportunities. Your never gonna get along with everyone. I have some great co-workers and subordinates I work with."
good,I worked hard with what I was tasked to do and I went home every day knowing that I worked hard.  It was not mentally challenging work rather physical
good,"On a typical day at Kohl's I normally do a little bit of everything. I will be on a register, and then I will be responsible to get different duties and projects done throughout the store. When I am on the register I convince customers to open a Kohl's Charge within the store. From Kohl's I learn about different cultures daily, and I learn to help customers even if they say they do not need help. Management at Kohl's is not the best, it could use some work with communication and the way they treat their employees. My co-workers at Kohl's are wonderful, we all work together to get the work done that needs to be taken care of. The hardest part of the job is having customers open a Kohl's Charge for you, and meeting the needs of customers. The most enjoyable part of this job would be working meeting/helping new customers daily, and making them happy when they leave."
good,Kohl's had a great work environment. I learned their merchandise location system and worked in customer service. I also learned how to locate items in the store and do call backs on them.
good,Learned what it takes to keep a job and how to please management. Management created a good work environment. They were very flexible working around my school schedule.
good,"Yes We Can for every customer every time... and No You Can't for employees. No you can't get your actual job done because you'll be digging out fitting rooms and being ""backup"" to the cashiers your entire shift."
good,"I was ad-set manager, stock room manager and dept manager. i stayed busy a lot. Loved the customers. It was a big store and had to stay over night on lock down when me and my team had to set ads."
good,Co-workers were great. Some problems with upper management. Seemed disorganized at time when really busy.  It was a good experience for a part time job.
good,"picking an packing orders that people order online from all over the world. you got to meet new people from different cities, an they had a lot of overtime an holiday pay."
good,It was really boring as a cashier because it can get really slow at times and you are literally trying to find things to do. You don't get paid enough and the management wasn't great.
good,"Besides people messing up the clothes that you had just organized, it is not a bad job. There is a lot to do, which keeps you busy. Like any other retail, it gets busy and crazy. Met a few great people while I was working there. It was only seasonal, but was still a fun job."
good,"Had a great time there for only 1yr but it was fun, the personal I had to work with like to work, we work hard and had fun, at no time did employees question work."
good,"Kohl's was a decent workplace. It was my first job so I wasn't really exactly sure how hard I had to work. But working there taught me that if you don't enjoy your job, even a little, you come to dislike it. The coworkers are nice and the management is nice. But I never felt like I could talk to my managers because my ideas would be put aside. It felt very impersona."
good,Kohls was a great place for a to learn about retail. It provided me with knowledge that helped me expand and learn things that I still apply today.
good,Good place to work. Meeting new people all the time is a great feeling. The hours wasn't all that bad either. If you are a employee you get great deals that one thing I like about it
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work is both fun and productive. I learned a lot from working at kohl's such as unloading trucks and good customer service skills. Management is fair and impartial. The hardest part of working with kohl's is being able to use a pallet jack to moved the heavier items off the truck properly. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"Spent days ringing out customers sales. In free time I would clean out the fitting rooms, fold clothes, and organize the clothing racks, Management was flexible with my schedule while I was in school. I some experience with loss prevention while I was there,"
good,the work place had a lot of people was hard to connect with everyone .the managers were not nice either. the customers were really fun and good.
good,working with people come and go that is just retail. management was good to work for but the come and go as well.Nothing mo re to say at this time
good,"Everything is rather easy and simple to do.  Great management team & flexible with your schedule.  What to expects as a Post Sales Associate, run register and when not busy you will go to the floor and organize each department."
good,fun work place for anyone. everyday is a new day for a new project. its a foot in the door. helping customers in my number one priority
good,"The store is on the move, always busy. Constantly striving to improve merchandise opportunities in order to increase sales. Customer service is crucial. Task are specifically assigned to every associate for every shift, and they work towards a common goal. Time management is essential, and falling behind schedule is unacceptable. Overall, Kohl's is a fun work environment in where associates are always in sync and usually in a positive note."
good,The managers run the store in a very strict manner. They make sure the store is always clean and presentable for the next day. The hours aren't that great. The associates are friendly and helpful
good,The job is easy.  Racking clothes and cleaning area is the entire day.  Customers usually don't need any help so it is what it is.
good,It's a great first job but the hours are not consistent at all. You could be working any shift and could get anywhere from 4-32 hours a week. You just never know.
good,"Easiest retail job I've ever worked. For the most part, co-workers were easy to get along with. The ""Yes we can"" policy made the whole retail environment more enjoyable."
good,"Plenty of work to be done, and opportunity to get to know each department within the store. The coworkers were very friendly and easy to work with."
good,"Management seems to be a bit unorganized at times but overall a good company to work for with solid business procedures, Many opportunities."
good,Overall the company is good. Easy hours to work around. A good company where you don't bring your work home with you. Kohl's is an open door policy company.
good,Provide a good balance of work and education demands for their college employees in addition to being a good starting point for building work experience.
good,"A typical day at kohls would be helping customers by showing them where to locate items, knowledge of sales, customer perks such as credits and rewards."
good,its very diverse. mabagement is ver nice i have been with the company fir 3 years so i learn aloy everyda that im there. i love m coworkes we all get along ver well andwe tr to help easch other out
good,The management there is horrible people are nice but is not worth it. There's no incentives for part time associates and is so hard to get promoted.
good,"keeps you busy with work, non stop movement, always energized and no time for break, love the training. fun working with the different kinds of machines in each department"
good,This job was very manageable with where I was as a mother of three school aged children. Kohl's allowed employees to choose work hours within limits so that they could fulfill outside commitments. This company provided a positive environment for their employees.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,great place to work there is a great support for development. great place for college grads to join the mit. big company that continues to grow
good,Working at Kohl's family seasonal has been a great opportunity I was able to get a feel of the work field. I did retail and stock. I folded clothes and restock them. On top of that I was able to cashier. I love cashiering the most because you are able to get close and personal with the customer. Making sure the customer is satisfied is the best part.
good,"*great first job"
good,"The people I work with are great,like a close family. The job is not difficult, just tedious at times. The schedule is what can kill you and your family time. Full time is 36-40 hours a week, however, one day your shift starts at 4 am,the next day you work till 1130 pm, and the following day your shift starts at 6 am. It takes a toll on your body and family."
good,"This was a great job to have while I was going to Rock Valley College. At one time of the year it could be very slow and then at other times it was super busy, I love to stay busy. Overall it was a good company to work for and I would work for them again if given the opportunity."
good,Working in kohl's was an O.K job. Never had a problem with my fellow co-workers always help each other like a team to keep the store clean. There were no hard job at kohl's it was easy and not stressful that what I enjoy about that job.
good,My co workers were friendly and always willing to help. The work was easy to understand and follow. I left due to scheduling conflicts.
good,"It's not a bad place to work. Ironically enough I felt like I wasn't being challenged and was exhausted by the boredom and general easiness of the work day. I was mostly frustrated that I was not getting the hours I needed. I ended up working the worst shifts, which I wouldn't mind, it's just that I needed more work to be justified working at all. They were flexible with schedules but it just wasn't enough. I'm not a big fan of management there although most of the managers are all nice and reasonable people. Still I was not able to get enough hours. I just stopped trying as much after awhile and was still not reprimanded or even noticed that I was trying less. This made me feel worse about my job. I know it's retail but I would love something more. "
good,The hardest part of the job is the hours especially during the holidays.  The hours start at 6am and go until 12am.  This is very hard when you could be opening or closing.  Not much of a work life balance.
good,"They are too pushy when it come to getting people to sign up for credit cards thats all, people are friendly and so is the staff"
good,Can be pretty hectic and stressful depending on the time of the year.  You get to work with some pretty awesome people though.
good,"- Working there day to day was an easy process, but working with kids is also difficult. I would teach the kids, put on movies, give them lunch, and change a lot of diapers"
good,Good working environment. Great employees to work with. Good Management team. Many great deals for employees. Decent amount of breaks.
good,"I would clean dressing rooms and return merchandise to where it belonged. I occasionally covered as a cashier when necessary. I liked the work hours and when it was busy, but to be honest, I felt the retail area was not for me."
good,"The work place was a great place to work. All co-workers we friendly, and willing to help each other with challenges that may arise. The management as well was great. The hardest part of the job was the weekly schedule, it was changed week to week. This was a challenge if you had personal things to attend to. "
good,"Working for this company was a challenge (in a good way). I was responsible for keeping the dressing rooms clean and free of clutter as well as making and keeping the floor presentable and free of clutter as well. Management was production driven and made sure our daily responsibilities met the companies standards. My co-workers ranged in different ages, cultures, and backgrounds. Management worked hard to keep up the morale and was a finger tip away when they were needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in retail was new to me and I enjoyed it very much"
good,Customer service is #1. Learning to multi-task is very important in this fast-paced environment. Rewarding benefits is helping customers who have difficulty in shopping and completion of a job well done.
good,The job was fine for being a retail job.  Nice employee discount perks. Not great pay and not many hours. Definitely not a place for a career.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Typical day for me at Kohl's was to run the cash register and maintain the departments by putting clothes and other items back in their assigned areas.  I learned a bit about how a department store needs to be operated.  There are several areas with moving parts and needs constant attention to make sure all works perfectly together.  My management was average, hard to say anything special about them.  They were so busy that I never really interacted with them much.  Co-workers were good, lots of different people that made things interesting.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the items that needed to go back to their assigned places.  Most enjoyable part was dealing with customers, everyday you'd meet several knew people."
good,I enjoy working with people. I enjoyed learning to work in the jewlery department. Being able to work on my own and as a team.
good,"Work was typical, not too hard. Only hard when dealing with difficult customer or cagoule. Other words nice stepping stone for a job experience."
good,I enjoyed working for khol's wish I could of stayed longer. I learned a lot working there.  experienced a lot of new things there.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's because the people that work there have pride in their work. They take their job seriously and work hard to accomplish their goals.
good,As an ad-set supervisor I had the responsibility of setting up pricing for sales for the next day. Unfortunately sometimes this had to be done short handed. Some managers were very understanding and others were not. Some sales could take up to 4 to 5 hours to set so you'd find yourself there until 1 or 2 in the morning if everything went smoothly. Certain co-workers were very friendly and made coming to work fun. Overall the inconsistent hours were what made the job stressful.
good,"The company had very kind managers but they would promise things and not return on those promises, They would have employees in areas that they knew nothing about"
good,Money was poor and time off was granted when needed if the business warranted it.  co workers were great and a lot of team.  General Manager was horrible and not even sure why she got the job.
good,"Worked at a call center, so the bulk of my days were assisting customers through social media channels with a variety of issues. Some examples are coupons not giving at store or online, damaged items, or orders not received by customer. Also helped customers with questions they had for products on kohls.com. Some days I did this for all 8 hours."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's for several months. Everyone was nice and friendly. I made new friends and I got along well with all the managers. It just got kind of tough when business slowed down and I had to find something else to make ends meet.
good,A typical day for me included clearing dressing rooms while answering customers needs and providing a speedy checkout.
good,I loved the department I worked in I loved the people I worked with however I didn't feel the way they scheduled hours one week I only had 4 and the next I had like 30 I left because I needed more hours!
good,It Was A Good Experience  With Interacting WIth My Co Workers And Supervisors. A Well Managed Environment Overall. Breaks We're Great Too.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's because of the management team and my co-workers. I learned alot and loved having the opportunity to work in all departments
good,"You won't get ahead if you don't ""pretend"" to be friends w/everyone. It's all who you know and not how good your work is. The common theme is others perception of you and once that is tainted it's hard to change it. If you aren't a people person or tend to be shy they perceive that to mean you aren't outgoing or involved with your team."
good,"Unload the merchandise truck at 4am until the truck is empty. Put the merchandise out onto  the sales floor of the store, continue to give great customer service. This goes through your whole work shift."
good,smooth paced workplace but it is very hectic during holidays there are a lot of rushes. the managers were great peple I have never had a problem with anyone there.
good,This is a good job for an entry level person. You will learn some of the basic aspects of being in a retail store. Your co-workers are energetic and find ways to have fun with each other in occasional spare moments. The hardest part of the job is soliciting credit.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you enjoy a flexible schedule and fast paced work environment. There are many different positions at Kohl's with the potential to grow and move up in the work place. A majority of the jobs here require physical tasks such as lifting, moving merchandise and fixtures, walking, standing for long periods of time, etc."
good,okay job not for me hours were a nightmare and when production is down no money to be made for any one big break room lots of fun and activites
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at kohls was fun for the most part, but only because I had friends there. Kohls is very big on customer service and meeting their daily goals. The managers were cool but everyone in the store gossips a lot. I felt like I was working for People magazine due to how much they were gossiping. Also, people within your department will help you out, but certain managers will call you over the walkie to tell you to pick something up that was right by their foot. It's very dysfunctional and can become irritating. Managers get upset if things are done like they want, no matter how busy the day was(and they don't offer any help). You do a lot of work for little pay and no one works full time. Have fun! (:"
good,I enjoy the retail environment a great deal. There is always a challenge to stand up to or a goal to meet.  I also love to train associates on the best processes of the company.
good,Its a stressful and tiring job. Requires a lot of heavy lifting and standing for long periods most of time. The management is very ce and understanding of home situations.
good,Clock in then start picking/packing for 10 to 12 hours staright two 30 min breaks. Hardest part of the job is standing on my feet all day.
good,"Most times the job was laid back and you could move at your own pace. Sometimes though, you had to work with a quota and needed to pick up the pace. Picking and replen is a very simple process to master. The managers had a lack of communication between departments. Co workers were very lackluster and lazy. There were a handful of actual good hardworking employees. Hardest part was during peak season when it was 12 hours shifts of nonstop boxes. Most enjoyable part was being floated to different departments during slow periods."
good,"the days workloads was big. never enough associates to help. if there ever was it was with managements pals. All my training was done on my own. I taught myself my skills  of my job title. co-workers over all were great, except for the few that were pals with management. advancement was non existant unless you were the managements friends. mananger stayed in office all time and micro-mananged."
good,"I loved working here, it was a fun fast paced environment. My favorite time to work was the holidays because it was the craziest and was so busy you didn't have time to think! Worked for them for almost 3 years and never moved up once."
good,"Kohls has a great environment for people who want a nice, clean, and friendly workplace. Enjoyed to work with the team. Loved that is was required to wear professional clothing. It's nothing like working at mcdonalds. Kohls is great!"
good,Was able to have a flexible schedule. Able to move up from one position to another. Used customer service skills daily. Helped customers with online orders and return.
good,"Kohls is a good place for a young individual to gain work experience and possible move up to management quickly, boring work though"
good,A typical day at work included checking out patients. My coworkers and I worked hard but made sure we laughed a little to pass the time. The most enjoyable was interacting with customers.
good,"It is a fast pace job. Management are supportive and friendly. "
good,I liked the cleanliness of the store and how spirited the associates were. Everyday from open to close customers poured and that shows great business.
good,"A typical day at work would be clock in go to register and ring people out along with providing good service and keeping my area clean. Occasionally helping out other departments and working customer service as well. I haven't learned much, besides learning how to use an RF and the computer systems there. The management was good, i'm not sure how i feel about the management lately. The hardest part of the job is well folding for me, i am not a very goo folder of clothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the people leave happy and seeing my co workers."
good,Day to day work consisted of sales merchandising fitting rooms and customer service. I learned sales techniques merchandising. I enjoyed working as a team with positive co-workers. My favorite part was helping customers find what they were seeking as well as following up with any questions or concerns they might have
good,"About merchandising and retail"
good,"The work is good and tends to only be difficult around Black Friday. However, if you are not a Full time associate, don't expect to be treated like an equal. Part time associates have a hard time getting work hours. They have recently laid off many of their part time associates. The frustrating thing about this is they don't claim responsibility for laying off associates, and they blame the part time associates. They are terrible at arranging schedules to the point that many have lost their jobs for ""not coming in."" Great place if your full time. Part time associates will have a hard time just trying to get work hours."
good,"Provide prompt and reliable customer service to every customer, every time by delivering Kohl's service concepts."
good,"Greeting customers, cleaning and stocking items at the lane. Answering questions on sale items. organizing tables and folding"
good,IT was an alright job just not enough hours to pay the bills and to take care of yourself good company to work for.I liked the co workers and management
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,the training was horrible. other then that i liked working with the customers and opening credits. My coworkers were nice people. There was nothing hard about this job was very decent.
good,"poor wages. poor work environment, awful management skills, no growth encouraged. dead end job. weak raises. horrible work hours.no recognition."
good,There was a lot of drama working with this company if you decided to jump in on what everyone else was doing. If you stuck to your job it was an enjoyable place to be.
good,"A typical day at work was me going in and figuring out who has been there before me, what needs to be done for the remainder of the time I am there, our goals for the day, walk the department and set goals for myself, discuss how it went for the person before me."
good,"You clocked in and met at the back for a meeting. They assigned you to a place to work, majority of the time they didn't know where to put you because they had to many workers. The people were nice. The job was easy. Good job to start out at."
good,Great benefits and OK starting pay for full time employees.  Very heavy at the top with salaries and senior executives.  Employees get discounts to shop at the stores.
good,"Great management, low pay and lots of work to do and cover in a shift.  You must hustle from one task to another, never enough time to complete a task properly or fully. Co-workers were mostly unhappy and unfriendly, but there is always a few that make your day better with their sincerity and kindness.  Supervisors and management were awesome."
good,"get my ""cherry picker"" pick up a list of work to do for the day. return paper to desk when completed. pick up another paper ""if any"" if not be moved around the plant to find work when there was nothing to do. I learned how to operate machinery, pack orders, ship orders, also pick orders to be packed by packers to then ship. What Management. Hardly see them. they are never around when problems arise. Most co workers were fun, helpful, and reliable. finding work to continue working threw out the shift was the most difficult part of the job. being able to work with no interruptions. Get my job done, and done correctly."
good,I have been working for this company for over 2 years now they just recently changed the management team. The gentleman that now is my new manager is always out to get me also never does anything except sit at the computer or go outside and smoke.
good,Great business model that serves customers well.  Expense control is a fact of life to support that model.  Top of category performance results; works best in expanding economy.
good,"random words for a random review, I would really like to say more but i would really rather just finish this process and continue on elsewhere, Kohls was fun"
good,"Great co-workers, always friendly and will help any time. Managers help workers and help cashiers when needed. Veterans always show the new guys how its done and how quick they must be."
good,Kohls was temporary job to start out there expectations where unrealistic they would put 25 people in our area and expect 10 people to do all of the work
good,"Working here you never new what to expect! Tasks change constantly and you have so many different situations that you can't plan on the day ahead. I worked in every area of the store, I loved being able to change my location throughout my shift and stay busy constantly. The management at the time wasn't my favorite because they never worked together and they often always wanted you to do different things at the same time. Since they have got new management so I can't say if the project still exists. The people there are amazing and make your work experience fun!"
good,"Everyone was so cheerful and eager to help. Overall, a very laid back and stress free environment. I enjoyed working with everyone."
good,Learned a lot about welding and fabrication would have enjoyed to stay longer but found a better opportunity.
good,Alright Retail Job. Not the greatest experience Manager and coworkers not friendly
good,"Great people , Customers didnt care most of the time . co workers are okay just hard to along with , but overall its great part time job just not full time worthy"
good,I had a lot of fun and learned a lot from there. Position was a stepping stone to help mature me.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Change the signs when up coming sales are arriving."
good,Managing day to day operations of a store. Ensured associates actively interacted with customers and consistently provided them with outstanding customer service.  Built strong leadership team that helped drive the number one credit acquisition performance in the district. Enjoyed promoting great talent and building relationships with my peers.
good,"Got to work with great people, overall management could give more hours to employees."
good,Kohls is an average retail store with a good selection of items. My only problem is that this company fired me and did not inform me for two weeks.
good,"I will never work for Kohl's again. "
good,"As an frieght worker i was put to the test in skills i accumulated over the years at Jean Simpson Personal.Some of the skills were stocking, recieving shippment and unloading."
good,"At Kohl's I was responsible for Cosa (cash office) every morning, Provided customer service. Handled all returns, voids and all problems a customer may have had during their purchases. I enjoyed working with all employee's from every department. The management team was going through several changes therefore it was very inconsistent. I love to work with people, so meeting new customers and engaging in great conversations was always rewarding."
good,The company benefits took all my pat check when I call to cancel do to being homeless the would not do it

good,Learned how to handle face to face and phone customer interactions
good,good place to work decent pay cool people working there i enjoyed working there and the employee discounts
good,"It was good work, but this job didn't meet my needs as far as pay goes."
good,Typical retail job working with fun people and dealing with impatient customers.
good,I had to greet every customer and sell them the kohls credit card. I was given a goal everyday that I needed to meet.
good,"This is more a job for students to want to earn money while they are studying or on vacations, is more like a temporary job, no benefits for part time jobs."
good,"Typical day would be: setting up the jewelry and watches out in the display, repairing customers' jewelry and watches, stocking inventory, calling customers about their layaway, planning marketing techniques. The hardest part about the job is to deal with different customers and meet their demands. The most enjoyable part is to help people who need your service and product and making their day a lot better."
good,"Assists in the execution of merchandizing and operational functions to Company Standards within sales floor areas where assigned"
good,Great place to work... great people and I loved working in this store...they were kind and very inviting.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"No comment. Looking for another job. Nothing further to say. Is this enough, yet?"
good,"nice, active, teamwork.. love going to work every night.. only thing is the overnight schedule. LOTS of sleep"
good,Very great experience while working with different people everyday.
good,If you want a simple plain job this is all for you! Good for college students who need to have a part time job to pay for school....
good,"Time goes by quickly."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's but the hours were not enough to take care of my family and bills, this would be an excellent second job opportunity for someone."
good,"Fun, faced paced and my co-workers were the best!! Hardest part was dealing with upset customers but overall the experience was great!"
good,"Its a very friendly environment and the customers as well as my fellow associates are amazing, my managers they are very friendly. The hardest thing is trying to get customers to open a store credit card and the most enjoyable thing is being able to help my customer with what they need. I learned how to help and treat a customer with any concerns or questions they had."
good,"I enjoyed the small amount of time I spent at khols. One downside is that I lived about 40 minutes away from the store and they were not paying me the state minimum wage, it became to costly to transport myself to work every week. The management was available most of the time to help out with problems and my coworkers were almost always eager to help out. The hardest part of the job was having to pick up used sanitary products out of the dressing rooms and cleaning up after very dirty customers."
good,Great Job and great flexible scheduling but horrible pay. Asked to do way too much for pay. Great environment and co workers are amazing.
good,At Kohls everyone works together in such a way that you build great relationships by depending on one another in order to get the job done.
good,"busy help customers, late hours sometimes, great people to work with"
good,Needs more improvement with management. I have been there a long time and have been apart of a lot of changes. In my store we are having some issues now that have never been before.
good,Working here was my first job out of high school. It was a bit of a learning experience for me.
good,"Decent workplace for part time job. "
good,have strong customer skills work really hard get along with other assiciates
good,Workplace is a mess. Retail is only meant for certain individuals. Customer Service was always busy. Good location. Grunt work for small pay.
good,friendly people and a good fast paced environment. long hours with good pay. bad coffee but clean bathrooms
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and the staff.  Although it was only seasonal
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I worked with my dorm roommate.We always had a decent time. I loved when costumers would ask me to help pick them out outfits. I like knowing I am able to help someone.
good,great part time job for students or someone needing extra cash
good,"I was hired to provide extra help during the Black Friday sale, starting from 9:00pm Thursday, until 4:00am Friday. I managed the checkout line, directing customers to available cashiers in an orderly fashion. After the rush, I rehung and refolded any merchandise that had been dropped during the night. The hardest part was standing for so long. The best part was time and a half pay for the shift."
good,I got along with my supervisor and managers extremely well. Always willing to help and talk. I loved traveling to other stores to help other LP staff.
good,"Easy work enviroment, just too far from home.   If you want to work retail it is pretty simple and easy to get on, especially part time."
good,"seasonal assoicate"
good,"This was your typical retail position.  I did not have this job for long, but it was neither terrible nor great to work there."
good,Great place to learn about retail. Excellent employee relations. Poor growth within the company however and offer very little raises for employees. Management works for personal gain but moves employees around the store to become well rounded and more experienced in all areas of the store.
good,Working there was ok until I found a better opportunity. Usually not willing to give you more hours. Only allowed overtime around the holidays. Standing on your feet all day.
good,cashier and customer assistance is about all you do. other than cleaning only in certain  areas. there should be more for you to do.
good,Provided a wealth of retail and customer service experience. Over-emphasis by management on promoting Kohl's credit at the expense of the store's appearance.
good,"·positive atmosphere, supportive management"
good,"Clock in, grab an RF help ppl out talk to them about if they found everything okay if not see what i can do to help out."
good,The staff at kohls has always been pleasant everyone enjoys seeing and working with each other
good,I worked in the Jewelry department. I would help people with the clarity of diamonds and sizing for rings or watch bands. I also learned how to have better customer service skills. Management was great to work with and my co-workers as well. It was a pretty fun place to work where everyone got along and helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was learning about jewelry and how to help customers find what they were want. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happiness on customers faces when they found that perfect ring.
good,Not the kind of place you want to work forever. The hours were long and the customers are not the kindest bunch.
good,"My typical day usually starts with unloading trailer, stock sales floor, back stock, merchandise. I also do price changes, and inventory stock"
good,"I worked at Kohl's part time as I was attending a full time job and school part time. It was very difficult to maintain this position so I only worked there for a few months during the holiday season, I usually stayed on the registers and helped clean up after the busy times faded down. I enjoyed meeting new people and working in a fast paced setting,"
good,work temp for decemeber and it was fun looking into the retail clothing
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. The mottos that drive the team members are something to almost live by. The team members were great, but they will work you to death and not fairly compensate you for what kind of work is being done."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The owner/ manager was rude, often used inappropriate language."

good,"Cash out customers all day, open kohl's card, reward kohl's cash, recovery of the store"
good,"The company was ok, I didnt have much to do with management at all. The co-workers was ok."
good,"restocking the floor when needed, cleaning the sales floor, helping at the customer service desk."
good,"Great training programs, good benefits that you can use."
good,Okay job. I was not really a fan. Did like management much. They were rude.
good,"working as team and by myself to load all outbound shipments into trailers, use pallet jack, good management team"
good,team is good to work with....working with customer is an adventure
good,"A typical work day involved helping customers find the products they were searching for and keeping the products on the floor organized. I thoroughly checked the stores back inventory when an item couldn't be found on the sales floor. In addition, I made sure fitting rooms were clean, items were properly folded and sized, and sale markers kept update and consistently monitored."
good,Working with staff and customers to settle customers returns and questions.
good,"For a store that bills itself on being high-end, Kohl's is a lot of sweaty hard work behind the scenes. The management makes sure that the workers are always doing something, either being cashiers or putting stuff away. It's annoying that Kohl's lets their customers act like slobs and almost encourages it, then has the grunts fix everything up. If you stay with it long enough, it eventually pays off. Expect long hours, I sometimes stayed until 2AM cleaning up. However, it doesn't seem like they just go and fire people randomly, but you might get your hours slashed."
good,"I was able to learn different store positions, gaining knowledge in several areas."
good,It was fun in high school fun demanding and worth it typical day is easy management was cool
good,"muy buen lugar de trabajo, aprendi otro tipo de trabajo ya que frys es tienda de supermecado y khols es departamental, mis companeros fueron excelentes,"
good,it was fun for a part time job. pushed way to much for credit cards
good,Kohls is okay. Its retail. The job is repetitive but overall the store was a pleasure to work in.
good,Met and exceeded set goals and quotas for customer service ratings and credit applications. Steady and well organized work environment
good,"Prepped and edited books for tabbing and insertions. Book corrections and rebinds. Packaging and shipping. Office tasks(filing, fax/scanning, mail distribution, etc.) Other jobs as requested, including office assistance."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The part-time flex position is good for anyone looking for a very flexible schedule and a wide range of hours. It's a easy job and simple enough for anyone to do it, I just need more hours."
good,"Finalize point of sale, prepare merchandise and ask customer if need any assistance to vehicle."
good,This place is not a good place to work. They don't give promotions and they don't guarantee full-time positions.
good,Bigger corporation structure. Good leadership. Management work good together.
good,"Company supports cross-functional, internal movement in order to develop and promote talent from within, and provides challenging growth opportunities for high potential associates."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of dealing with customers, processing, and stocking. I learned how to multi-task, while handling customer interactions. The hardest part of the job unloading while handling customer interactions. The most enjoyable part of the job, helping customers and finishing my work area for the day."
good,"A typical shift would include assisting customers, register backup, merchandising, cleaning dressing rooms, floor resets, etc.  Co-workers often needed to work together as a team to assist in the smooth flow of daily operations.  The hardest part of the job was it being only part-time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers smile, great sales, and wonderful employee discounts."
good,A typical day at work for me is productive with busy work. I put out new merchandise as well as replenishing my area. I also clean the fitting rooms and ensure that they are ready to be used for the next customer. I also put out the merchandise I took out of the fitting rooms to be sold. There are a lot of occasions I help out at the customer service desk as well as helping out a register. I help customers on a daily basis and ensure that they are finding anything and everything they need. I've learned plenty of customer service skills with the year and a half experience I have at Kohls. Management at Kohls can be pretty decent. There are definitely times where there is a lack of communication with management. It ties in with the hardest part of my job. I'm told to work on something when another manager comes by and has me quit doing whatever I was told to do to work on something they want done. Most days I can handle it but it definitely gets old. It doesn't allow me to get very much done. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to keep busy while working with my pleasant coworkers.
good,A typical day at KOHL'S was very busy most of the time . What I learned is work hard and you will be acknowledge. Management was understanding . Co-workers was sociable. Hardest part of the job was to have to complete several task In a short amount of time.The most enjoyable part of the job was when they had holiday parties.
good,"The Job is ok but the hours vary for the week, you can sometimes only get 4 hours a week and that is nowhere near enough to live on."
good,This is a standard retail job. Not for those who like to work 9-5. Have to work holidays. You meet some great people but have to deal with customer service.
good,"Assisting customers with their purchases. I have learned that customer satisfaction is the most important thing in keeping customers coming back. "
good,To unload the truck of merchandise unbox it for floor ready and clean the dock when done.
good,Cashier who checked out customers and provided customer service.
good,"I would clean fitting rooms, answer phones, cashier, stocking, straightening would be a typical day. I learned how to do so much like picking clothes out for people to just learning the types of stuff they like. Management wasn't too bad they just was layed back quite a bit. I had wonderful co-workers, because they was willing to help me when I needed it. The hardest part was trying to cope with someone who was mad, because they couldn't get something they wanted right then and there, so trying to keep them happy sometimes was a challenge, but I did what I could to keep them happy. I would say just working with my co-workers and get along and just enjoy our jobs."
good,Great place to get your foot in the door to learn about loss prevention.
good,"Very laid back."
good,"Worked as floor associate stocking shelves and answering questions, also worked as cashier."
good,Im am a cashier. I interact with other while working checking out items that they purchase of there choice
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This job was ok. "
good,I was hired for seasonal but was kept as normal employee because I am a hard worker. I started working in the intimates department then was switched to the jewelry department/cashier and the customer service department. Working in these departments made me feel more responsible. I liked being able to help each customer one on one.
good,its a good job i only left this job because i was moving away. overall a good place to work
good,"You would clock in, and depending on your job that day, you would move boxes onto shelves, unload crates of boxes, sort merchandise, ect... The management was a bit disorganized but my coworkers were kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the constant physical strain. The most enjoyable part of the job was how simple it was."
good,i liked the people i worked with but never had enough hours to work because of them over staffing especially around major holidays
good,I would get a lot of hours during peek season. They would send text messages out offering extra shifts.
good,"Organizing clothing in certain area and assisting customers in finding  "
good,"A typical day, for me, consisted of scanning various departments and changing the signs, while listening to the latest music. I learned how to work fast. Changing signs is a timed based job."
good,"This was a fairly new. up and coming store when I was employeed! I was not employeed long for many reasons! The main reason I left was to go to school in Texas. Other reasons as to why I decided to leave was that, there was so much confusion on who was in charge and how things were suppose to be done. I am sure things have gotten better by now."
good,"It's pretty unpleasant most of the time, simply because it's a never ending thankless job. This particular store is pretty nice to work at, as it doesn't have as many customers and the people who work there are pretty nice overall. "
good,Fun place to work unable to advance quickly however hours are not always suitable for life events.
good,"I was only there for seasonal, but it was a good experience. They helped you if you needed something, and taught you what you needed to know."
good,"I worked during the holiday rush, which means that the store was busy all the time.  It was a fun environment for the most art and have no regrets of ever working there."
good,"Working in an friendly environment. learn to absorb techniques, an believe that there is no job that cannot be master giving the opportunity and proper training. Take direction well and have no problem delighting if need be. Considered to be a team player who contributes and can be trusted to do the right thing at all times. Commended by supervisors for flexibility in changing work hours when asked and filling in during scheduled off-days for absent employees. "
good,i would fold clothes and put them away clean out the fitting rooms i would assist the manager in setting up the area with new clothes. i would be a cashier and help customers with anything they needed help with.
good,work schedule is flexible but sometimes you need more hours.
good,A typical day at work would include dealing with a variety of different customers and attitudes. I learned how to have better customer service even when there is a rush of people coming in. I had great co-workers who were as hard working as I was which made the workplace very enjoyable.
good,Good place to work with great team. The management was very good at making sure the associates got good training.
good,"Kohls is not a career, but, it is a great first job. They rarely give you more than 25- 30 hours, and the management is very friendly, but also not looking out for your best interest, only theirs,"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,good seasonal job and good for people that may need to learn some job skills.
good,My typical day at work was spent behind the jewelry counter. At Kohl's I learned how to use a cash register. I loved my coworkers! The hardest part of the job was being stuck behind the jewelry counter all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"My coworkers were wonderful we just couldn't keep anyone around. The work load was enough to make several people (associates and management) walk in and quit. I really enjoyed working with the customers and being trained on customer service as well as floor for MJM. I wish we would have had more manageable fitting rooms and freight. The store needs a limit of clothing items for the fitting rooms and to enforce that.  "
good,"I was excited to work here, because I love clothes, but was quickly disappointed by the training and heads of management for their lack of knowledge about the store.  They were not good about communicating, for example: Not informing me at any time that I was a seasonal worker (was told that I was not seasonal, and then did not send me information that I was ""supposed to"" receive)."
good,"great people"
good,"This position requires evenings, holiday and weekend hours. Employees are encouraged to work hard and advance within the company."
good,"my co-workers"
good,Responsible for cleaning up the shoe department and keeping it organized. performing customer service. Easy to work with co workers. Hardest part of the job is cleaning up the store at the end of the day.
good,"ok, kind of far, no public transportation, low pay, and very minimum hrs"
good,The management was not clear with scheduling and the employees didn't work as a team .The hardest part of the job is at night because they were under staffed.
good,"multi task oriented, with attention to details. Over all good company to work for"
good,"On a daily basis it seem like I make up work for every department associate, I never get to do my job which is back stocking and replenishment because of other associates needing help with their jobs, and instead of store managers and managers addressing the problem they go with flow and then get on too you for not doing your job correctly. I have a hard time trying to do the job I get paid to do and what I got moved up too do. I love when I'm able to get a full day to do my back stocking and replenishment the stockroom always looks complete and we a awesome sales day when I get a full days work."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's, the only issue was that at times the customers were a little rude."
good,"Overnight"
good,didnt work there llong i was pregnant i would like to work there again
good,"Fast paced, no down time. always moving or helping customers."
good,Kohls is not a bad place to work for but im waisting my talents here and they wont give fair raises.  There is simply no room for me to grow here.  So I move on.
good,"the hardest part of the job is not being given enough hrs to work in order to get things done.."
good,"Perform tasks given such as:"
good,"over all not awful. They do work you to death during holidays, but that can be expected. If you work in the fitting rooms, they do not have enough people to handle the heavy influx of people--thats year round."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great place to work , enjoyed helping customers . I learned markdowns, marketing , setting for sales , also learned all departments"
good,This is a great first job for those new to the work field.  I learned much about different areas of retail.
good,The coupons and sales please the customers and our great customer service keeps them coming back. Employees are quick to help one another and have fun working on projects together. The management helps keep everyone on track but has been known to micromanage. Though it is difficult to be nice and charming to every customer the most joy from this job comes from the customers that praise your good work and helpful hand.
good,"I worked with many customers and coworkers. We were able to fold clothes and put them in an organized manner. If we needed help, there were plenty of managers and co-workers available to help when needed. It was tough sometimes because I felt as if we had a time crunch and I liked things to be perfected; however, always seemed to get it done. I enjoyed being able to help customers and work with my fellow co-workers."
good,"Work environment was awesome as well as management, everyone was upbeat and helped each other."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and loved my lead supervisor of Point of sale. upper management was slightly unorganized and many times did not share information with each other, leading to confusion at times. credit cards were very important to the company and the sales team."
good,"-Learned how to manage all aspects of the Business."
good,The best perk about working here was the employee discount which was 15% and ocasionally they would give you 30% for a weekend. To me it seemed there were too many managers and supervisors which led to alot of miscommunication.
good,Best part about this job was that you got to wear real clothes instead of uniforms as long as it was work appropriate.
good,"I enjoy my days as an employee with this company. I got along with everybody. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, unhappy customers, and sometimes co-workers that did not pull their own weight. I did enjoy working over nights when I had the opportunity, setting up new displays, redesigning shelving structures and working without interruption"
good,Perfect place to build ones work history and or experience.
good,"overall kohls is a great workplace, strong and dependable team. ive learned the ins and outs of retail with this company, the management is great i just think they should be a little more organized when pertaining to the wrok schedule. The hardest part of the job is being overwhelmed with tasks during the holidays, the most enjoyable part of the job is making customers satisfied and getting great reviews from them. I'd recommend khols to anyone seeking a great part-time retail experience !"
good,"From open to close, it is all about the customer.  If you are restocking, merchandising, placing orders, making payments or just having a conversation.  Managers and co-workers make it easy because we work as a team.  The hardest part of the job is the changing shifts, it does not give any stability."
good,I really enjoyed the work but the dynamic wasn't right for me.
good,"It was a great experience working with Kohl's. I have gained much experience in customer service and keeping them happy. The hardest part of my job was when I was in the back working for the holidays, taking phone calls and working with an angry customer. Later in the year I became very good about multitasking, and easier way for me to manage."
good,"Was a fun place to work people were great both customers and coworkers, but feel like most employees were really underpaid. $8.25 was not enough to me for all the things they would like employees to do. I was a sales associate, this meant i was responsible for not only providing the exceptionally great customer service that kohls employees always provide, but i would also be responsible for cleaning out fitting rooms ( Mens, Young mens, Womens, Juniors and intimates) and yes all of those fitting rooms 90% of the time were 1 persons responsibility which made it extremely difficult to keep up with while trying to help customers from each department getting an additional size from the back or being called up to the registers if back up is needed."
good,I learned how to work a cash register. Always had my goals for the day set up for me at the start of each work shift. The co workers were great! Everybody got along with each other. It was a very diverse workplace. Everybody worked together as a team. There was always a manager/supervisor around in case there was any kind of issue. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and low pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,this job allowed me to help other people and work hard. I helped with the holiday season.
good,Most of the day is spent cleaning up work area and restocking the floor.  Keeping the dressing rooms clear of clutter is an important aspect of the job. Customer service is the most important part of my job.  I enjoy being able to help them find what they are looking for.  I do help out as cashier when the need is there.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"nice atmosphere to work in, I loved the environment and management."
good,"My schedule was a bit inconvenient, but I ended up leaving for maternity leave."
good,"i learned about there company.my typical day at work was busy "
good,"Kohls is a good place to work if you like working by yourself at your own pace. I like the hours for the most part I usually only work 4-6 hours in a given day. And Kohls is pretty flexible with schedules. Overall I do enjoy working with my co-workers but there are a few that are extremely rude and lazy. I work very all with ALL my managers and have no problem with any. I do not however enjoy my pay rate. Sales associates work their butts off by not only taking care of customer needs, and/or complaints, we run around the store looking for items on the sales floor and in the stock room, then we also have to make sure our departments are clean and organized. There are some days were we are so under staffed that it becomes very frustrating and overwhelming. Some times it makes people want to quit right on the spot. A few of my fellow co-workers also feel that they are not appreciated. We also frown on Kohls for being open on Thanksgiving when it should be closed so employees can enjoy quality time with their families instead of making money for others."
good,this company likes to try and give off the vibe that they really care about their employees in their interviews but once youre hired on you will soon find out that is not the case. you will feel very disposable.
good,everyday I learned new things there were all kinds of people woring there and coming in and out it was a great learning experience.
good,"Very difficult to get a promotion there, unless you are straight out of college"
good,I had a great time working at Kohl's until they asked me if I wanted to work overnights (it was optional and not what I was hired for). I said I would try it once and after I tried it I told them I did not want to do it anymore because I had to get up at 4am other days to work the freight and the overnights were messing up my sleep schedule. They did not honor their original proposal and continued to schedule me for the overnights because no one else wanted to work them. It eventually became too much and I resigned.
good,I kind of have to learn everything my self not that many nice people.
good,"I like everything I did here, I ended up getting a different job, I thought was gonna be worth it cuz it was a pay increase but after being there for a while i realized it was not. "
good,"An excellent place to work if you wish to pursue a career in retail. "
good,customers can get a little out of hand. some actually threaten you.
good,"Meet interesting people on a day to day basis.  Coworkers are team members and everyone works together to make it an enjoyable place to work.  Management styles are unique, more and more work and expectations are high.  I love meeting and assisting customers!"
good,I am responsible for the store's graphic sets and any seasonal sets for decor or sales. I am also responsible for mannequin dressing several times a month. I over see several assistants to help me get any job completed.
good,"Can be slow, fast on and off"
good,A typical day is just emptying fitting rooms and recovering the floor.
good,"Learned lots of new things about customer service, meet great friends, fun place to work"
good,very clean and everyone was so energetic and ready to work. Management always stayed o top of everything and made things easy for employees. The hardest part of any major retailer is Black Friday and Christmas season. I enjoyed my co-workers they really made the job fun.
good,A typical day at Kohl's included me mostly working the cashier and then when we were slow I would go tidy up the clothes and make sure things were in their proper spots so it would be easier for customers to find what they were looking for. I learned how to help people to the best of my ability and since it was my first job I learned to use the register and how the store was organized. The management was alright I mean I got yelled at because I was wearing dress pants and sneakers because the type of shoe they were requiring us to wear (clogs) were causing me to have back pains and I got a doctors note so I could wear sneakers because I need the extra support in my feet. For the most part my co-workers were enjoyable to work with especially if I needed help with something they would come right over and help me. The hardest part of my job like any other job was dealing with the rude customers and the customers that didn't want to wait for a manager to help fix what ever the problem they were having if I was not capable of helping them. The most enjoyable part of working at Kohls was my co-workers and how pleasant they actually were and how open and friendly they were.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I greeted and assisted costumers. I checked customers out at the register. I learned how to work a register and determine whether bills and checks are fake or not. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The enojoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,The best part about Kohl's are my co-workers.  They are some of the nicest people I have ever met.  Most of them have become some of my closest friends that I could never have imagined my life without.  We all have a great time together even when some days are harder than others.  They make working there a pleasure.
good,"I completely enjoy the Work area but management communication is off, Co-Workers are great, the hardest part is keeping your hours, the most enjoyable is doing things with assiciates."
good,moving employees around helps so they can know the store better and help the customers better
good,"A typical day at work is four to eight hours for me, you help people with their questions, do restocking, scan out shoes, unload freight. So far i have learned a lot. arguably more than people who have been working there longer then me. I even taught my manager something i learned in training that he didn't know about. My co workers have some misconceptions about the job. someone informed me one day of something we supposedly weren't allowed to do because of the dept we were in. I personally asked my manager the next day and he said the person was wrong. so i politely wrote a note informing them they weren't right and i had asked a manager about it. The hardest part of the job is when i can't help some. An example is if the kiosk is down so they cannot order shoes offline in the store for free shipping, as opposed to doing it in their home where shipping isn't free. Finally, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I can help someone find the pair of shoes they have been looking for or seeing their faces when I tell them the shoe is on sale.the reason why i titled  the summary easy job but no reward is because i have done things other people haven't i organized a few rows of clearance that were a mess and the one manager said the dept looked better then it has in a long time but i didn't get a written card for it. At work they have sort of a good job card that you can fill out about someone and post it in the lounge for everyone to see. and the same manager that told me that compliment never even wrote a card for that which i didn't mind but the next night he wrote a card"
good,Made daily sales goals and provided excellent customer service.
good,a great place to work but you hours fluctuate every week. but the people who work at this company were all nice and still am friends with them to this day
good,"i very hard work and time consuming but doesnt pay enough. mostly cleaning fitting room and cleaning the asiles it cconstant work cause the store can get super messy, very fast pace."
good,Kohls is a great place to work if you are in need of a part-time job to pay for supplies and spending money while going to school.
good,"I would ring up sales and solicit credit. During down time, I would make everything around the registers nice and presentable while interacting with customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to solicit credit cards to every customer that came through the line. The most enjoyable part of the job was how many people I got to interact with and hear stories about their lives."
good,Kohl's management is hard working and dedicated. They do what ever it takes to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is balancing the many hats that you are expected to wear on a daily baisis.
good,my co-workers are very pleasant and easy to work with. Management  is very helpful and open to all associates opinions on how to create a better working environment. overall i am content with h my position at kohls Distribution center.
good,"FT and PT options, pay is on lower side. Room for growth. Employee discount."
good,This was a seasonal job. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,The managers were seldom organized and they were always looking for extra co-workers because they were always calling in. I learned product management and how to tag stolen items. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining the fitting room although the job did not require a lot of skill.
good,"Although my experience while working at Kohls has been positive, I have realized that there is not sufficient career growth for me."
good,"Working overnight at Kohls is very fast paced. Unloading freight trucks, stocking the sales floor, and cleaning up are the main priorities. The coworkers make the job though. You really do become a team."
good,"After receiving direction from the Strategy team I review and discuss any suggestions for improved testing to obtain results that are more meaningful. Execute the campaign using Unica Campign tool. Then publish results from the campaign and write an Executive Summary for any testing that took place during the event and provide my recommendations regarding the test. Daily I would learn more about using SQL, SAS and Linux."
good,Great first job for a high school student to learn and grow from. Learn a lot of responsibility.
good,Customer service skills required. Busy during Christmas.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,If you want more hours just ask and they will give you more hours
good,Pretty easy going place and works with you and very flexible
good,"I worked among a 4 story pick mod, counting and correcting counts on all 4 floors, and reassigning locations to new product. I learned how to use a Telxon(IR gun) and edit counts. Management wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The hardest part was walking up and down the steps all day, everyday. The most enjoyable part was being able to work at my own pace."
good,Enjoyed working with the customers and again was allowed to work in my own comfort zone and knew the expectations that were set for the day.
good,In retail there is always a lot to get done and this is no different here. Never ending cycle of tasks that needed to be completed but bosses were understanding of what could be done in a timely manner.
good,"It was a fun fast paced job. I worked in customer service handling returns and even sales when the store got busy. I would also go out to the floor and return the returned items. Helped organized the floor and helped any customer that had a question. Not only that, but I answered phones and promoted ""The Kohl's Charge Card."" Overall, it was a great learning experience, but I was not getting enough hours even after I requested some multiple times. I was a hard worker and no one had any thing bad to say about me. I just can not make a living with the little hours they were providing."
good,Toughest part of this job is doing what is right for the customers and employee's with limited resources from corporate office.  Kohl's takes great pride in keeping selling cost/ payroll to an absolute minimum.  This often leaves the manager to answer the tough questions and concerns from customers and employees.
good,"At times stressful, however good work environment.  I enjoyed helping customers.  The hours could be very long at times."
good,Greeting customers and making sure the found what they needed.  Management was always there to help when needed.  I work with a wide variety of people which made each day a new adventure.
good,"putting up sale signs, scanning, unloading truck, stocking shelves"
good,Really enjoyed my time there. Easy balance between a college student working to get her degree and keep a job. Would have stayed with the company but ended up getting paid more for a different job.
good,I only worked here for a little bit. This location was a lot slower then the other location
good,My work schedule was hinged on how much actual work I got done.
good,"The job consisted of many departments, receiving, shipping, ptl, consolidation,and jewelry, depending on what you excelled in more determined where you were placed. A typical day at work starts with receiving, bringing cartons/ units into the building, unloading trailers was the hardest part of receiving. The units were then processed, and conveyed to shipping, or ptl where they were broken down and sent to their respected destinations after being separated. The work environment was exceptional, and the employees were great, Kohls was a zero tolerance employer. Management was great as a whole, but there were some issues here and there. As an employee you're entitled to tons of incentives, which had to be the best part of the job."
good,A typical day at work is; its never typical.  Always new things to learn and new challenges.
good,"Kohl's itself is a great company to work for. However, some of the managers at the branch which I worked were disrespectful to employees and would show favoritism for specific employees. I typically worked Sunday mornings, which tended to follow sales on Saturdays.  The store was supposed to be recovered every evening, however, every Saturday morning I would walk into a mess in the store and be expected to recover the floor as well as answer pages in every department as the store was understaffed and I would be the only associate on the floor for the first few hours the store was open."
good,"A typical day involved really pushing the store credit card on customers, cleaning out fitting rooms, finding sizes for customers, cashier services, recovering the store after hours."
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for, yet some of their practices can lead you int questionable situations. Very team goal oriented, they our proud of individual accomplishments but are focused more on teams goals, if your strength is customer service and not soliciting Kohl's Cards, your are not reprimanded if you only solicit one Kohl's card. Although company policy is one 15 break and one lunch for a shift from, i.e. 12-8. Kohl's will make it difficult to solicit Kohl's cards as well as some co-workers will trying to steal your customers away."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It's a all right place to work part time. There are not many full time positions. Promises for more training usually fall through.
good,"i haven't worked there in years, it was fine , i just quit because i found a better paying job"
good,"Responsible for the prompt, efficient and accurate processing of merchandise, customer order selection and delivery through a Distribution  Center, in support of 100% customer satisfaction."
good,it was a good place to work. management was nice. worked well with schedule
good,"Good benefits for health care and vacations.  Worked 5-6 day weeks, usually closing 2 times per week."
good,"Decent hours and times, mostly busy to make time go by fast. Not under a manager all day, work with some nice people "
good,I unload trailers of merchandise in the morning. Once we complete that we move the product to the floor.
good,I was a cashier and also worked in customer service. The employees were friendly with each other and towards the customer. 
good,Great  benefits and the discounts are always a plus.  Flex schedule is nice on those days where there just isn't enough work to stay all day.
good,A typical day is helping customers and keep the sales floor organize. I learned patience. Management has alot of things to work as managers. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of my jobs was the unorganized of the management team. The most enjoyable is making the customers happy 
good,I had a wonderful time working at Kohl's and getting to help customers all throughout the day. I love interacting with customers and being a helping hand for them when they needed help. 
good,My experience with Kohl's was very. The people were friendly and it was a great place to help develop both customer skills and communication skill with the management team. I am thankful for all the new things I have learned at Kohl's and hope to apply my newly obtained skills with another great company.
good,Good start out job. Can move up if you work hard and you know someone.
good,"Cool coworkers,decent managers, and ok place to work at. Store needs to be more organized and needs to improve on management."
good,"Conducting operational assessments"
good,"Duties are to clean store, check out customers, help customers find products, and solicit credit."
good,"Putting away clothes, greeting customers, as well as working with other associates."
good,Overall the people (coworkers) are the best part. The job is demanding.
good,Working with large teams to keep a multi million store operation meeting its goals.
good,Had an great time there learned many tasks also meet man different people 
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"•	Managed price change process for E-Sign Program"
good,My job has great management and co workers compared to previous jobs. I am usually working the register and assisting customers everyday.  
good,"LP is fun and exciting, from investigating associates stealing cash to hardened criminals boosting thousands of dollars worth of merchandise, Loss Prevention is an adrenaline rush that can definitely keep you on your toes."
good,I would explain Kohl's as a job that you would want if you were a very expensive shopper because some of their items were way over the average customer's budget. I learned that even through rejection that you can still make it through your day with a smile and with that being said is because I was one of the associate's that had to follow customer's around the store to basically beg them for Kohl's charge cards. Management there was to me very uncomfortable because I felt when it came to certain things they would treat people of a different race in a different matter.
good,Come in at around 6 a.m. and start unloading the truck. once done with that we would sort items to a U boat. Then place those items on the sales floor for our customers. After that I would go help smash all the boxes in the warehouse. Finally I would help in any department that needed it until my shift had ended.
good,"You cant be reliable for a company that is not reliable for you the employee. To much work very little pay, mangaement slow with advancement."
good,Very stressful! Can almost never get required tasks done. Pay was decent. Management is terrible. Will not learn procedures quickly.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers find the products they need and providing them with information regarding upcoming products, sales, and store discounts. I have learned how to interact with various types of customers. This interaction gave me a greater insight in how to meet the demands of various individuals and personalities. I was also trained in multiple departments of the store. "
good,"Running from the minute you start your day. Never enough staffing, so extremely difficult to get the store to look to my standards."
good,"I worked an on-call job, so I didn't have a constant work schedule. The days when I did work, though, were fairly busy. My co-workers were really neat, cooperative, and easy to talk to. "
good,Working at Kohl's is both exciting and challenging. Kohl's is great at involving its associates in activity and plans for the company. 
good,"It is always a busy day at Kohl's, I learned to keep patience with difficult people and I learned a lot about retail. all my managers are very nice, easy to work with and very helpful. My co-workers are fun to work with and helps when help is needed. The hardest part of my job is nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work.!"
good,It's a friendly place to work.  They work around the schedules of busy college students.
good,I would get hours based off of how many kohl's credit cards I would sell and not based off of my hard work or customer service. Co-Workers were rude. My bosses belittled me and made me feel bad.
good,Very flexible with hours. Great for someone who has another job or going to school.
good,"I would work mornings or nights and clean up the kids dept and at times when needed be a cashier or be in cutomer service for returns. I learned to work in a fast pace environment and how to set up e-signs. Managment was not the best, alot of favoritism. My co-workers were great. They always worked hard and if i had to work at my other job, at the time with kohls, they would be there and help take over my shift so i would do the same if needed for them. The hardest part of working at kohls was having to run to the cashiers to help then back to my dept and pic up for recovery as fast as i could. The most enjoyable part was seeing my co-workers and having a few laughs on our breaks."
good,"Compare merchandise invoices to items actually received to ensure that shipments are correct. Receive, open, unpack and issue sales floor merchandise. Stock shelves, racks, cases, bins, and tables with new merchandise.Take inventory or examine merchandise to identify items to be reordered or replenished. Resolve problems concerning damaged goods, incorrect shipments and returned goods Cashier."
good,Worked with multi cultrual and diverse co workers all striving with the common goal to exceed company expectations.
good,All around horrible experience. I don't recommend if you are looking for a welcoming environment 
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's. The employees I worked with became friends and I enjoyed going to work. However, as the company began to become more popular, clicks started to form and I felt as though management showed favorites in employees."
good,"Fast paced environment, good management team, hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fitting rooms"
good,"Operated cash register and helped costumers throughout the day. Also, organized clothes. Tried to keep myself very busy but there wasn't always a lot to do."
good,"It's great....until they lie to you! It's a typical retail environment. And if they're hurting for employees they're not gonna do anything about the ones that are creating a hostile environment...no matter how mean they are or how much you complain."
good,Kohl's is a great company that allows a lot of room to move around within management positions. They take care of their employees very well and are focused on excellent customer service!
good,i enjoyed working at kohl's. positive people. could have used more hours and better pay. wish it turned into something other than seasonal.
good,"I was in Misses, Juniors, and Men's (aka Softlines) part time during a summer. There wasn't much that differentiated one work day from the next, mostly folding clothes and getting them back in their place.  The thing I liked best about working for Kohl's was 1) the discounts and 2) the people: co-workers who made pleasant small talk at the least, and told you great stories and gave you advice.  I also learned a thing or two about men's fashion, which has proved useful since."
good,"I usually got to class from Monday thru Thursday. I sometimes work Thursday evenings thru Sunday at Kohl's I am mainly evening shift but occasionally get a day shift. Kohl's is my first retail job so i learned a lot, but was very familiar with the register and caught on quickly to the other things."
good,"Managaement and staff we enjoyable to work with, it was the low pay and the low hours that wasn't enjoyable."
good,"Too much gossip. Very sterile environment. A high turnover rate due to conflicting policies and too many promotions, coupons, and not enough payroll to properly train associates."
good,Working with different people and having fun at work. Management good.
good,Its a job that pays. If that's all your looking for in employment then this is it.
good,good place to work friendly people and flexibility with schedule
good,"Kohls, where you can always expect great things. That only applies when you are a customer. As an employee, kohl's believes you should build a city in two hours by yourself. The amount of work for the amount of pay is terrible."
good,"no room for advancement, minimal pay, the most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to talk and meet new people on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was being left alone on registers and the lack of management support when being called."
good,every day was a full day for me my work load was bigger then the day worked off a work load calendar .them some. a lot was self learned.co-workers were great always willing to help each outher out
good,"Everybody I worked with was amazingly helpful and really friendly. It's a nice place to work. The only problems I had were the amount of hours and that I was lied to. When I was offered the job, I was told it was going to be a permanent position but it only turned out to be seasonal."
good,"I would open register ,"
good,"monitoring the store via CCTV ( closed circut television ), case reports, apprehending shoplifters, working with the management team and associates"
good,put cases away all day and replenish and help out other departments
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working for kohls was great getting to help people find the right clothes and under garments helping people with the matching of clothing. management was always walking around if you needed someone there was a good chance you would see one. i loved rearranging the clothes and getting the attention of customers with the bold choices that i would make with the clothing we got in. found that if you have the bright and bold anywhere within eyesight theres a good chance people will see what you want them to see.
good,Management for first shift is fairly poor but other than that only complaint would be how hot it tends to get within the building in the summer
good,"its retail not too much different than any other retail. compensation is great some years you may or may not get a raise, current management with the exception of a few are tools. theres little advancement. a ok work/life"
good,nice hours nice people learn how to keep self occupied and how to manege time also learn how to relate to employees on site and off
good,Its a good first job. But a lot of unnecessary drama. Managers would try to talk to the kids that worked there which almost everyone there were in school expect for the manages which were adults.
good,Being my first retail job it was beneficial to mu career and personal life.
good,"Kohl's was usually very busy. However the employees were able to get the customers in and out quickly. I learned how to operate a cash register, operate a kiosk machine, maintain a clean work area, and maintain organization of displays. The hardest part was closing. There was always a lot to do and you never had an exact time you would get home. The most enjoyable part was that most employees were very friendly and willing to help you."
good,They have a very professional store no complaints here also the management was very far also.
good,"Ability to move up if you are so inclined, lots of contact with customers and coworkers,"
good,"The managers at this particular store push the employees. It's very high volume. The sales associates work well together, willing to help out when needed. Management is really bad about praising a job well done. There was very little thank you's, or you did a good job."
good,I would run the cash register ringing up peoples purchases before they left the store. I would help customers with the things they need to make sure they had a wonderful experience and would come back. I learned that no matter what kind of mood people are in if you are friendly and give them a good experience you can change their day. The hardest part would be getting people to sign up for the kohls credit card with how the economy is.
good,The customers love the deals and discounts!
good,A typical day was fun except for special sale days. Sales events were hectic but productive and fun. I learned that I enjoyed supervising and my staff appreciated the fact that I was the supervisor. Management was very fair and understanding. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people.
good,On a typical day you just have to maintain i friendly attitude. i learned how to sale. management did their job very well. my co-workers became my friends outside of work. i loved my customers.
good,-freight
good,"moderate pace, go through out department redo all apperal."
good,"Kohl's in itself has a great future, though with the management team there it comes with great sacrifice. Plan on working really long hours, 12 hours per day at least during holiday time and before visits. It gets really difficult in balancing your life outside of work and you really make a home in the store. Other than that, you do get to build relationships within the store and with others stores. Great internship and MIT programs. It would be a great experience if they were more open with advancement areas and work/life balance."
good,Not enough hours they hire tons of people and that cuts everyones hours down
good,"I would work 25-32 hours a week, and I typically had one long 8 hour day and a couple 6 hour shifts and a 4 hour shift. I would have liked more of a set schedule instead of being all over the place, but I was seasonal so I just went with it. Managers were always encouraging and going above and beyond to keep customers satisfied. I learned alot about retail since I've never worked in retail before, and I feel like I developed my communication skills and overall ability to work to the customers needs. The hardest part of the job was self control whenever an unpleasant customer would check out or need helped because it just felt like no matter what you did for them it wasn't good enough. Definitely learned to grow patient with people. Most enjoyable part of the job was successfully finding items for customers and how grateful they were. I also enjoyed the people in the departments I worked in."
good,"A normal day was fast-paced which I loved, I learned different fabrics, styles, and how to speak face to face with customers. I received this job my senior year of high school. I worked part-time and was only getting like 15hrs per week. Once I graduated I thought it was going to improve, they cut my hours wat more than when I was in high school"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Although the work environment was great because of working with great people the cutting of the hours are what made it not so fun.
good,"long days & long nights, took forever"
good,"The culture at this particular Kohl's is very laid back. This retail environment itself is more hectic than other places I've worked in, but I like the fast pace and there are always things to be done."
good,"when i work there it was a new store and new people. you have your normal issues, such as favorite picks, some people in wrong positions. their point system for call outs and tardiness is not well like by most. overall it was not a bad place to work."
good,"Get on talk to all of staff, I learned a lot there a lot of working roots started there, like how to delegate, how to get very one to work together as a team & how to do every part of your job in a uplifting manor. Management was always very informing with every situations past, present or up coming. Co-workers was a joy to work with, the hardest part about my job is pushing out all of the product and I enjoy every part about my job it was all a great learning experience."
good,my typical day at work is running the register
good,"The staff was friendly, which was a pleasant environment to work in. I had learned to provide excellent customer service and further my knowledge of handling different types of payment."
good,was fun very good training people cared bout you great work place
good,As the day started we would clock in and group up for the afternoon stretch and task announcement. We would then be told what task was ours and either operate machinery or work the floor picking inventory for shipping. My co-workers would either do the the same job or continue a previous task to improve company productivity. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow and there was not enough task to go around so we would have an early day. The most enjoyable part of the day was during peak season where it was fast paced and continuous work flow.
good,i love the people i deal with. Just not enough hours. i work 6 hours a week
good,"My typical day working at kohls was amazing when i first started i was a sales floor associate helping with customers face to face interacting with them and making sure they were highly satisfied with our business . I started to want to do something different as time went on to learn something new so i changed to cashier and enjoyed it i loved handling cash and being the last smiling face people saw before they left store. As time went on i learned everything i needed to know , they even had me in the customer service center for a while so i could really have experience in everything . My most enjoyable part of the day was everytime i helped someone and put a smile on their face."
good,Pretty much everything was great.
good,A typical day at work included cleaning out fitting rooms and returning clothes to their proper location. I learned about figuring things out on my own and working in a fast paced environment. It could be stressful at times because the way they train employees was not very effective.
good,"I didn't mind working with the people but if they had to drop hours, you would get 4 hour shifts for the whole week. It's okay for extra money on the side but not for a full time job."
good,This was a typical retail job. Pay starts at min. wage. Holiday Seasons where never fun.
good,The hardest thing about working at Kohl's is that I would have to manage to get all the new merchandise onto the floors and making places for it. I learned how to be very organized and using my time very wisely. I enjoy being at Kohl's because everybody get along and being very friendly.
good,great co-workers.
good,"Not a lot of hours given, management and coworkers were not personable or approachable."
good,Every day is a great day working at Kohl's. Everybody is nice and helpful. The store is so well kept it motivates you to do your part.
good,"Great company - they really empower their associates. However, being a manager there is no work/life balance at all, which takes its toll. The hours of operation are pretty bad as well."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I learned to get alone with my co-workers and learned how to have fun on the job. The hardest part about the job is when the season come around and everything has to be set up in different orders.
good,"fun place to work, good for socializing to different ethnicity, okay pay rate, and okay management"
good,everything at this job was on till i had a manage talk to me like i was no one! other then that the job was great helpin people find wat they needed in the store was a great experance for me
good,"Work overnight unloading hundreds of boxes from trucks. Remove products from the boxes.Sort products by item, style, size, color, and vendor.Input price changes.Place products on a roll-rail in preparation for stocking on the store floor."
good,Running the cash register
good,The best years of my working life has been with this company. The only reason I left is to focus on my education.
good,Kohl's was my getting back into the workforce job. Learned customer relation skills.
good,"Koh'l offers many Benefits, however the pay is horrible. Kohl's standards keep going up on Customer Service and Getting Charge Card Customers, but number of staff on floor keeps going down."
good,This company has a lot to offer.. Its a great place to start at..
good,"Typically, we began the day with a morning meeting to discuss sales and objectives. After that, we would go to our individual departments to assist customers, perform visual merchandising, and manage incoming shipments. The management was effective for the most part. The most and least enjoyable parts of this place of employment was essentially the same as JC Penney's."
good,"Opportunity to advance quickly. Responsible for accounting for money from registers, making sure, employees have tools for their job and receive breaks/lunches."
good,"I worked as a cashier. Time went by very fast but, during the holidays they keep you there until about 2 or 3 am some nights and I was going to school at the time so it did not work with my schedule."
good,"A typical day is running around non-stop. Floor plan-o-grams, strike-point evaluations, recovering sales floor, helping customers."
good,Interacting with different people daily basis.
good,Stocked product in warehouse facility for distribution to store chain. Fast paced work environment with enjoyable co-workers
good,"Entry level position in which I worked my way up jewelry associate and customer service representative. I also trained front end specialist which entailed mathematical and further customer service skills. Various positions in the company have allowed me to not only develop interpersonal skills, but also time management, leadership and problem solving abilities."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind getting dirty and being either hot or cold. They have hours to give
good,This is a big chain and your treated like a big chain employee.
good,"A day consists of helping customers, assisting on the registers, cleaning fitting rooms, organizing and folding clothes and returning them to the proper locations in the store."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,a lot of hands one in the work place and nice people you meet from diffrent backgrounds
good,I am good at selling things and Kohl's really helped me understand that.
good,Kohl's Corporation provided me the opportunity to manage a group of 10-14 people. The on the job training that I received with the company has increased my skill set and qualifications. The firm demonstrated high levels of professionalism and a great company to work for.
good,Okay place to work.
good,"Typical day was walking in to unorganized area from previous employer, projects were always behind, never knew what manager was on duty or which one to listen to."
good,I gained beneficial work experience working at Kohl's. I gained retail experience and how to effectively help customers. I also learned types of management style and which ones work for me.
good,The manager that now works the queen creek store could learn to understand the fundamentals of people before trying to run a store. The job was not hard by any means but was mental distressing to deal with half of the staff.
good,Several goals to meet daily
good,"A typical day would depend on what shift I was working. I could be unloading trucks, stocking sheleves, working point of sale, clearing out the fitting rooms, and cleaning duties. Seeing all the different people and the things that they would like to buy lead this job to be very interesting."
good,As a customer I thought they were the best company to work for but when you are an employee you see the things first hand that they don't show their customers would i work for this company again...NO!!! not organized at all and their management is very rude and disrespectful....
good,"always clothes to fold, dressing rooms to be cleaned, or help needed in some area of the store. Was a good job to keep busy at."
good,"Time mangement, productivity, team work, diversity, coworkers are helpful"
good,From Cash office to customer service it was a team. if you ever needed help someone was always there to guide you to make sure the job was getting done the right way
good,Great way to build interpersonal skills.
good,Managers covered breaks. Nice. Overall good experience. Very busy store.
good,Work 16 hours a week. Same thing everyday. There is nothing more that i can say about the company.
good,"kohls was very well managed, but a lot of expectations for the amount of money you get."
good,Learned A Lot On The Job. Great With Teamwork. Loved Working Here And Got To Work And Learn Many Positions In The Store. Great Experience.
good,"being a cashier - it was fun meeting all the new people. At Christmas time, the store was very busy, it made time go by really fast."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This is not a position that allowes for growth and does not have a great work enviroment.
good,"Strict, managers are all on different pages, not very willing to work with your schedule, makes promises they do not keep"
good,i could be there for 4 hours putting and taking down signs the job was very slow and you rarley got any hours
good,"Managed large team of employees with a wide variety of skill sets. I worked in freight flow, human resources, and merchandising of sales floor."
good,"Kohls was an experience builder for me, don't really have anything great to say about it, but also don't have anything bad to say. overall I am grateful for the experience"
good,"A typical day consists of setting up for the incoming shipment. Once everything has been set up, unload the shipment of appliances and merchandise. Fast pace job. ""Continuous flow"" is the motto for the company. Each area has specific job, the truck unloaders, cutters, sorters, processors. As long as you put forth effort to get job accomplished everyone benefits. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part of job is staying awake, since its night shift. Would recommend job to those just starting in the work field."
good,great co-workers. Took a long time to get excutive management together. Customers are rude and messy but not all of the just the majority.
good,A typical day at work is very busy. I am a stocker and I also work in the shoe department. I learn that everyday is a challenge that Im willing to face. I love interacting with the customers and making them just as happy as they made me with their compliments. I have very team oriented co-workers I think thats the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part is when we are short on staff and still have to meet a deadline.
good,I worked part time to earn extra money. Co Workers were friendly. The store was brand new so I think they still had alot of things to figure out.
good,"Worked in the customer service department. I was highly skilled in the Kohl's philosophy of 'yes we can.' And made many customers happy keeping a great personal record for customer satisfaction. However, the hours & the lack of sustainable schedule...never the same time or the same day was very demanding of our home schedule."
good,Kohl's was a nice and easy place to work but did not give good hours and did not provide pathways to advancement or promotion.
good,Kohl's was a seasonal employment held while pursuing a permanent position. I was a sales person at the Jewerly Counter.
good,Employees great and a great job working overnight and in winter gets a little cold the truck while unloading but otherwise good pay
good,pays the bills of a college student and flexible for classes/exams.
good,I always find happiness in satisfying people and thats what i did on a normal day. My customer service skills have gotten better. I love my co workers work would have been the same without them. The best of the the job was making the customers smile.
good,"Have you ever wanted to know how Kohl's manages to keep their prices so low? They take your savings out of the pocket out of their employees. After working there a year I only received one raise (because that is all corporate will allow per year unless you're promoted) and it was 0.06, that's because they prorate your raise based on the time you've been there. After being recognized week after week for excellent work ethic you can expect to make slightly over minimum wage and to get passed up for promotions because of seniority not productivity. The only upside is that your managers are fun and caring people (they just don't have the ability to make any changes.) The only reason I stayed as long as I did is because I loved my managers and supervisors and did not want to ""leave them empty handed ""."
good,"A typical day at Kohls consists of assisting customers, operating a cash register, fold/ hang clothes, assist with carry outs, gathering carts, and locating merchandise. I learned time management is a key skill in retail. The Management was poor. They simply give orders and directions without providing any assistance and the company is quite sexist. The co-workers were great, Kohls emphasizes a fun, friendly, and helpful atmosphere for their employees. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a clean environment while juggling all other responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing your help made someones day."
good,good advancement career program and volunteer program. Currently floor sales associate for children and home care dept. Recovery work and backup cashier as needed.
good,Great place to land your first job if your in school. Works very well with your hours. Kohl's has very stylish products.
good,"fast pace work environment, very flexible with work hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,They do not treat seasonal employees very well. I had the feeling they didn't care one way or the other since I wouldn't be there very long
good,Working for kohls was fair. Able to grow as an individual and also in the company.
good,The people are nice enough but i prefer smaller buisinesses
good,"Kohl's has excellent customer service, but when it comes to their employees, they leave no room for advancement opportunities and making sure their employees feel like they're appreciated."
good,"I enjoyed working here because I kept busy at all times. It was a good job, and I received EXCELLENT training for many areas in store."
good,worked as cash register what they call point of sale. responsable for all sales transaction during the shift
good,"Kohl's is a company focused on development and people though you work on a slim staff. You must be able to multi-task, be results driven, and be able to work under pressure."
good,This job is only applicable to people who want to be doing this for the rest of their lives. The hours are flexible and the pay is good. The management priority is only to the customers not the employees.
good,They were good and bad things when working for the company. The good things were the diverse ethnicity amongst the employees that made work fun and enjoyable. Great people to work with and talk to. All laughs and smiles with the right people. Now the bad things were how kohl’s operated. Too much work pressured on the associates to get done within their shifts. They tried to game plan on the spot and it was just ridiculous.
good,"It depends on the store you're at. My store right now is the best it has ever been because we have a great head manager, but in the past we have had some pretty bad ones which makes work miserable. We are also always understaffed."
good,"Although the people there were very inclusive and kind, there was never a day where we were not understaffed. The pay is okay, but not worth the amount of work there is to be done."
good,Working there was an experience I won’t forget. Management wasn’t the best but the pay and the workers around me weren’t that bad at all. The breaks could have a better timeframe.
good,"Don’t come here, I’m sick of it and looking for somewhere else to go!! It started out fine and now years later Blah Blah Blah and nobody carries there own weight here"
good,A decent first job for anyone looking for a part time job. The work load wasn't that much even though there was definitely days that you could have got stuck in a situation in which you which you weren't.
good,"easy to learn, 3rd shift stocking, working with all different types of people and managers, learning how to stock and relocate certain items in the back area of the store."
good,"It's a seasonal sales associate job, pretty typical. My store specifically, the management was great for the most part, except for one manager that was always extremely rude. People that used to work at different Kohl's stores told us that our Kohl's was not a good place to work because we were never offered room to grow or improve. Not bad for a seasonal sales job."
good,Kohls is a decent place to work if you're looking for something short term and seasonal. It provides good money and a discount for Christmas which is helpful.
good,It was a good place to work while in school but working in retail is always a struggle. There was no communication within the mangers and hard to keep up with the flow of the store.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Love the people I work with but don't like management. I don't feel that I am treated fairly amongst my coworkers. Expected to do a billion things all at once but never recognized for my efforts. Not paid enough for what I do in Customer Service, compared to others out on the floor who get paid at least a couple dollars more for simply folding and hanging up clothes."
good,Seasonal is full of drama especially during peak season but if you can get past all the mess & ignore people it can be a good side job. The pay is good the people just make it difficult sometimes.
good,"It was a very typical retail environment, very fast paced and stressful although the majority of customers were great people who were easy to talk to and very helpful, cons being that often management would disagree on things or one boss would give one direction while another told you the opposite which doesn't help and often I would be forced to cover the entire left side of store on my own due to co workers not showing up. pluses are that if co workers don't show they usually just gave me their hours which was nice, and a lot of the people are great."
good,I worked as a warehouse associate loading merchandise off of the truck back on the dock. Management was no nonsense but mostly pretty fair. Hours were decent around the holidays but slowed down afterwards. Expect to be cross trained if you stay past holidays.
good,"They didn’t care about who took breaks or who had a second job , treated employees like they were beneath them , didn’t listen to other employees concerns"
good,I think Kohl's is an exciting place to work part-time. I think they could pay more. I love the discounts and the free lunches they provide. I think the worst part of the job is the closing hours during the holidays.
good,"Like any job it can get quite stressful. The push for the cashiers to solicit credit can be extremely overwhelming and overbearing though and even if you request a day off it doesn’t automatically mean you can get it, no matter the amount of time that you gave in advance for the request."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was from the people I worked with, but it can get very busy. There is a bit of a ranking system - if you get guests to sign up for their store credit often, you will work at the first set of registers (where most of the guest traffic is). Holiday season is when it is busiest, and there is potential to work overnight for Black Friday, and the whole week before Christmas they're open 24/7 and close on Christmas Eve."
good,"Overall good place to work for a short term. There is room for advancement, but not often. People are friendly, great work life balance and benefits. Hours vary per season to match retail."
good,"An individual can obtain a versatile work schedule, obtain customer interactions and receive store discounts. Volunteer for additional outdoor activities for promotional events. Work in different areas and departments of the store."
good,It’s a good job but not for me. I’m a high school student that real wants to go to college and is trying to save up but can’t if I only work 8-10 hours a week. The people that work at kohl’s are great but I need more hours and a steady/consistent schedule.
good,There would good days and bad days with kohl’s as their where good and bad experiences. It is pretty easy work if your a cashier or work in a certain department but working the stock truck early in the morning was the most unpleasant experience the only thing it would remind me of is a sweatshop when certain people where working. I couldn’t imagine working here for the long haul. Pay was not good but I only worked partime
good,Great place to work while your in school. They work with availability. Pay is good. They can improve in promoting with in the store before hiring outside the store.
good,"A typical day consists of inventory, helping customers, and making sure the store and all products are neat. The management is friendly but they don't offer nearly enough training and just kind of throw you on the floor expecting you to know exactly what to do."
good,"Must be able to work really fast and be a multitasker. Must be able to work hard and be use to working alone. Sometimes u don't get enough hrs and sometimes it's too much, mostly during the holidays. Must be able to get surveys from customers and must be able to get customers to apply for the Kohl's credit card. The discounts r great for associates."
good,i can't blame the company for everything that happens but because they represent them i have to. The management was decent only 1 of them actually did their job. The main 2 who were caucasian never did anything just walked around and complained when everyone was over exceeding goals for that particular store. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT NUMBERS NOT THEIR EMPLOYEES TRUTHFULLY IF I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM MANAGEMENT POV.
good,"The company itself is good, but in Loss Prevention, it is very reliant on getting stats and numbers, which is fine, but not getting stats is not the answer to reducing overall shortage in the stores. Management is hit or miss, depends on the store."
good,"At Kohl’s the work day is typically very fast part for the most part.  While I was there I learn two different register programs as well as retagging, stocking, and back stocking items we have to much off. The management was good. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the fast pace while."
good,A typical day is preparing the store for opening each day and making sure you are providing customers with any assistance. I learned to have patience when dealing with customer during a long checkout process. The management and the work environment was very relaxing and comfortable. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with sales throughout various departments.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I got hired as seasonal help ONLY so I was only there for 2 1/2 months and they booted me 2 days after Christmas , when I asked if they would still try to keep me on , the manger said no but he did say his team would call me if there was still interested , but never did."
good,"Management could be a little better when it comes to employee needs, but a very productive place to work. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction."
good,Kohl's was the second job I ever had and I kept it for a year. The pay was barely enough to do anything with and I didn't get a raise even though my managers always commended me for my hard work. Most days felt medium paced for the most part and never too much to handle. There was always something to do if you finish your department and would like to help clean other departments early for closing.
good,"It's a good place to start gaining experience. Apply as a seasonal and work your butt off. The pay is good, and if you're productive, they'll keep you. It's a good temporary stable job until better opportunities come your way."
good,"Everyone there is very nice and they train their employees well. For some reason all of the customers there are much more messy than any clothing store i’ve worked at since then. I worked men’s, women’s, juniors department and it always seemed like there was so much to be done. The fitting rooms, clearance racks, and certain tables of folded clothing were always chaotic. If you’re applying here, my advice would be to work in home."
good,"Was very stressed working here, did not felt like I fit in, and felt like I was treating like a child while working there and felt like no one had respect for me or my age."
good,I am always looking for a challenge and something different to do. Kohl's allows me to work in different areas which keeps me challenged and motivated. I like the management and other employee's that I work with.
good,"Management gives costumers whatever they demand, which can be annoying, but it’s an okay job just to get money and go. Each duty is easy but it does require constant standing and walking."
good,Pay is below your worth of work. They have feel good volunteer services and experiences. You do get to gain experience in various departments for future job opportunities.
good,My co- workers always maintained a professional but light personality when dealing with other co-workers and customers alike. They always made it enjoyable during work.
good,Ended up leaving after being passed up for a promotion twice in an area that I already was a supervisor at in a previous store for employees that did not have the experience but had been with that select location longer. The manager that did the schedule did not work with your availability. If you made her mad she might not schedule you that week or only give you 8 hours.
good,"They generally understaff so the sales associates are required to handle far too many tasks at once and end up accomplishing very little, which is why the stores are always in a state of disarray."
good,"I loved the work, the pay, dress code, management, and even my supervisor. What I didn't care for was the way when a situation arose where the customers order was not ready for pickup, the way they treat longer working employees to just freshly hired employees. Very disrespectful."
good,"Great atmosphere, each associate was very nice and willing to train in new areas. Hard for advancing or making more money. Decent hourly schedule."
good,The typical day included all aspects of customer service.  The workplace culture was diverse.  Schedule often changed and did not always fit your availability.
good,I was almost never on the schedule because it was a big work place. Id have to call to get a shift in. They didn't know my name. breaks were only 15 and deserve to be 30
good,"I loved working at Kohls but, I wasn't given many hours. There was no drug test. I was given about 10 hours a week, and that was about the most I got. The customers were the best part."
good,"Working at Khol's was a great chance to improve my work skills , as well as organization , keeps you moving and not worried about the day taking long."
good,"Kohls provides many opportunities to learn and experience new things. They have an excellent volunteer program and the staff there is highly intelligent, informed and hard working."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My retail sales associate position at Kohl's was my introduction into the working world. It definitely wasn't the most ideal place to work, however I am grateful for my experience there. "
good,strong team working environment. One needs to be a team player and show initiative to get things done. this job has many different jobs and opportunities for any given person.
good,"Work at Kohl's if you want a part-time job. Expect to meet the credit goals for the day, be pressure to get it & get call out if you don't meet it. It gets really boring on weekdays"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of a collaborative effort to increase credit card applications, customer service ratings, and sales. I was put into a leadership role, so I would have to motivate my fellow cashiers to achieve our goals for that day. Also, I delegated between mangers on tactics to obtain our goals and boost morale. Kohl's is a big company and relies on precise organization and communication, sometimes associates cannot make it. To manage this it relies good relationships in and outside of work. Having this type of relationship makes for a healthy work environment. When facing an unforeseeable problem and managing it, with a group, gives great satisfaction, and was the most enjoyable part of my work experience at Kohl's."
good,There was both busy and slow days. Had to learn to use different sites for coupon and online promo offers. Management was lacking and conversated mostly and not assist. Friendly coworkers and nice customers. Hardest part was not being fully staffed on certain days with deals and no assistance. I enjoyed meeting new customers and socializing with everyone. Having regular customers was fun and they always remembered me.
good,"The job itself isn't hard at all, mostly assisting customers, recovering the sales floor, and register. However, the management team is unorganized and constantly seem to be working against each other, usually at the employees' expense. Pay is decent for what the job is. Certain managers enjoy playing favorites and shutting other associates out of the department so that was a huge no from me, it didn't feel like a team environment."
good,Barely any hours given if you don't hit credit goal. Routinely pushed off registers to do something else while then getting complained to about not hitting the credit goal.
good,Kohls was a good place to work.  But the direction of the company with the new CEO seemed to be going in the wrong direction.  The company seems to be more concerned with profit and not work life balance for its employees.
good,"Management allowed for schedule flexibility, less or more hours. Culture was pleasant.  Clean environment.  Large overturn so new faces frequently. Additional days for associate shopping discounts were favorable."
good,"Kohls is very highly focused on selling credit. There's not any incentive for the employees, but they rely on us. The staff was all very friendly, it made me enjoy going, but the inability to work with a high school student's schedule was the main reason I dreaded work."
good,"I started at Kohl's as a consultant, working in E-commerce. It was my first ""real"" job after college after a few part-time gigs. The first few months I learned a lot about workplace etiquette in a corporate setting. I did however feel slightly out of place; the majority of my colleagues were 15-20 years older than me and much further in their careers. It offered a great opportunity to learn and quickly mature."
good,"My typical day would start with me typing a daily walk sheet and putting it  out for all associates to see where they would be working that day.I would answer phone calls until the customer service dept. came in.  I would make phone calls to replace any associates who would call out for work for that day.  Sometimes there would be employment gaps in the line up of employees for that day and I would call to try fill those gaps. I would answer any question an associate has with their hours, vacation time, sick time or time edit problems.  I would also order supplies from different vendors."
good,"Kohls is not a job for somebody who wants to be something in life, kohls is a low benefit job for someone who doesnt want to be anything or dont do anything"
good,"Decent to start, but if you plan on settling into a job for a long time, this one isn’t it. Very basic, not much competition. Hours fluctuate often due to store not hitting sales goals. No seniority over associates who are new. Unrealistic credit and sales goals at times. Handles hours well if you need time off or away from work."
good,"The pay was extremely low.  They demanded my availability but didn't provide any compensation or benefits to being available.  I worked 5-7 days per week, but didn't make enough to contribute to the family bills.  I was expected to wear nice clothes and shoes, but didn't make enough to afford to buy any nice clothes or shoes.  I was expected to keep the sales floor clean and organized, but didn't get rewarded when it was done.  The sales floor was always a disaster so keeping it clean and organized was a big job.  The employees didn't help each other out.  Everyone stayed in their own area until after closing.  Then everyone pooled together to straighten out the store so we could leave.  We weren't allowed to leave until the store was clean, even if we were scheduled to leave at a certain time.  If you are scheduled to close, you stay until everything is done not matter what (it was usually an hour or 2 after the doors were locked)."
good,A typical work day is a 6-7 hour shift working Point of Sales. The managers are enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is scheduling issues that occur every few weeks.
good,I would train people but those hired were mostly just too dumb to care about working.  Those that were good workers ended up carrying everyone else.  Not a good situation.  Some supervisors were too busy to listen to those that were good workers and had valid concerns.   Break rooms needed security and not just cameras that were fake or not working most of the time.
good,"Very large typical retail environment.  The workload is huge and seems to be never ending.  Company does take care of it's people with fair rate of pay and more than enough PTO.  However, if you want to do your job well you need to work a minimum of 50 hours a week."
good,Kohl's is a nice workplace..the management is nice they actually care about their employer.you can discount of products in the store a (big help out)..
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It is a simple job, I had no problems. Breaks are dependent on shift duration on average there is a break per 2 hours of work.  I learned how to use the registers and handle money professionally.  The workplace culture is fairly calm and gets a little crazy during the holiday season but it is a retail store so it is expected."
good,"The duties of a material handler are centered on manual work, receiving, inspecting, storing, issuing, and delivering a  variety of materials, equipment, and supplies"
good,"Kohl's has the ability to be a great store to work, what with the great product and the discounts, but management has cut the work force so much that there is not enough time in the day to keep the store looking neat and shoppable.  At the time I left, advancement opportunity was not very high on the list of benefits."
good,"Lots of heavy lifting during truck days, learned to be a team player, communication and customer service. Hardest part was anual raises, they were extremely low. i enjoyed working with a team and friends."
good,"Working at the cash register at Kohls is very fast paced especially on weekends near the holiday season. The managers were nice, they set goals for how many credit accounts we should be opening a day but never really followed up on it."
good,A typical day at work consisted of friendly customers and associates. It wasn't too physically or emotionally draining. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and having a sense of accomplishment.  The hardest part of my job is trying to keep every customer satisfied and getting everyone to work as a team.
good,"People I work with are pleasant, Management are very approachable.  It has been a very steady company to work for the past twenty years.  They try to stay competitive with other companys."
good,Every day presented new and different situations to help customers with their shopping experience. I learned to have a lot of patience and discipline in this work environment.
good,"I started working at Kohl's 3 weeks ago I got two days of training the first week the second week they didn't put me on scheduled at al,l the third week I got one day which was on a Wednesday and this upcoming fourth week I have no hours they didn't schedule me at all. They continue to hire people but they're not working the ones they already have. It's hard for me to learn about the Distribution Center if I don't get any hours. When I try to talk to someone they tell me to talk to someone else. I like the working environment it is a job where you really have to dig deep but it's still a nice environment. And now that the holidays are coming up they claim they need all the workers they can get but they won't schedule you. Can somebody tell me why this is?"
good,"Typical Retail experience.  Laid back atmosphere.  Cashier duties, merchandising, cleaning, and updating sales tags and displays.  Opportunity to work with customers, co-workers, or on your own in helpful ways respectively."
good,"Kohl's is a very relaxed place to work at but the hours you get are very terrible, I was getting 5 hours a week so I received around 50 dollars every friday."
good,"I only worked there seasonally. I loved what I did, I organized the shoe and home departments and restocked the store. I wasn't trained on check-outs because I was only seasonal. I enjoyed the work"
good,"Customer service, point of sale, unload freight from trucks, process merchandise."
good,"the pay rate is excellent but the summer time is slow. They are busy during peak. They have bonus during peak, During peak your break times are longer."
good,"It was a pretty fine place to work at, nothing too harsh for me anyways just recovering floors and the occasional time at the register. But management was always pushing for credit (which I get) but made it annoying with the constant reminders over the radios."
good,"Most of the work is easy and straightforward. The other employees are very kind and helpful. Frequent breaks based on your time worked. Most of your daily tasks revolve around making things smooth and efficient for the store and by extension, the customer. All around a pretty decent place to work, although the pay is a little low."
good,"Great company to work for; fun, energetic and loving people to interact with; work is a competition to meet the requirements daily. "
good,It wasn't exactly the best job but for what it was worth it was decent. I was only a part time member of the staff due to finishing my last year of high school.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"On a typical day i'd arrive to work on time and a manage would let those there into the building as it was before store hours. Some days you'd be late clocking in because the manager on duty was late to open the doors. The culture was as if you were back in high school, you'd have friends, but management would put people in positions to fail. Many of my coworkers and even an assistant manager was treated very badly. I don't think that every store treats its employees like this. When id left you did not receive paid vacation until you've been there 3 or more years depending on when you were hired.  Some good things about working for Kohls in general was that they provided food every now and then,and had massage chairs in the break room along with some paid holidays. Kohl's as a company does a lot of good for charities in and around the communities the stores are located in."
good,"Depending on where the volume was, is where we were flexed out to other departments. I was at Kohl's almost eight years so I was able to  help out in most of departments."
good,"-very fast paced workplace"
good,"Management doesn't try to help out the lower guys on the totem pole. Otherwise, easy job. Reccomend for high schoolers. No pay raises. They'll call you on your days off and expect you to come in and make you feel bad if you say no. Always short staffed or short on pay roll...which doesn't make sense considering how much money the company makes in profit. Big employee discount though."
good,Hours are up to you. it was only a temp position and like any place they make you try to get customers to sign up for rewards cards or a kohls card. The more you got people to sign up the better you were treated.
good,"Not much to do at this job, it was very laid back. You had to stay at your register your whole shift. Your breaks were after every eight hours. Management was average."
good,The company was great at promoting from within. You need to be a multi tasker and a positive person. It is very customer service driven company. For a part time employee the hours vary/
good,"saved a lot while working there. fun workers, free food, discounts, only work 4 hours a week, not enough to pay rent or any bill really. only work here as a second job for fun money. The store always has great sales."
good,"Kohls was a great first time experience in the beginning but after awhile I would want to be positioned somewhere else around the store except in one spot doing one thing, only time management will have me doing different things was when it was around the seasonal time."
good,I've learned how to cashier and do customer service and also how to work on the floor. its a very productive and busy work place the only bad thing about working for kohls is not getting enough hours some weeks I would only get 4 hours and that's was not okay.
good,Kohl's was my first retail job. I was a seasonal sales associate. I felt that for a seasonal job I made good money for myself. The work place was at times relaxed.
good,Most enjoyable part of working there is the assosciates. Majority of them are down to earth and very helpful. New manager is on a power trip and nothing is ever good enough. A lot of co-workers quit because of him. Always talks down to everyone (even in front of customers) He is only nice to customers. Always tries to shove credit down their throats.
good,Fast paced environment. Thorough training. Customer most important aspect. A tremendous amount of opportunity  to earn money  during peak schedule.  Fun place to work.
good,"To get Full Time I had to accept weekends. I worked 12 hrs a day Fri, Sat, and Sun. Its hard to get weekday shift full time. Mandatory overtime during holiday ""peak."" If you like factory work, doing the same every day, you may like it. Its hard to climb the ladder here. They do have some good perks. onsite clinic. They do the point system which i did not like. You get 12 points. There is no I'm sick here is a dr note. A point did not go away until one year from the date you took off. The harder you work the harder they expect you to work."
good,Mostly stocking shelves and folding cloths. Ran register and trained other employ there duty's. I enjoyed helping customers and other employees.  Management was very fair
good,I just would refer anyone there. Its not a place for a young person with a vision. The best thing the job offer is the discount. The discount is not even worth the job.
good,"It was not the best place to work at all. Management didn't do anything, or if there was a problem with a customer or anything related they never showed up or took care of the problem."
good,"Fun seasonal environment, but very boring when things slow down and really low pay to be on your feet all night and late hours. I also got stuck working a lot of holidays, which I did not enjoy, and the extra pay is not that significant."
good,"Fast paced environment at times, competitive in the promotions and customer involvement with email signup as well as charge cards. Working with the team was a plus."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a nice place to work, plus you get extra coupons. The biggest issue I have had is that the management at stores and corporate don't seem to communicate very well, which leads the employees to be confused about policy, rules, etc. It still is a good place, though."
good,"I started out loving the job, but then I realized my status as a student limited me in what I could do and I was penalized for requesting days off or for changing my availability due to school. They seem willing to work with your schedule, but in reality, they just stop giving you hours. Management is pretty good and I loved most managers. They were friendly and helpful and didn't often put the customer first. Working in the shoe department was rigorous and was the hardest part of the store given that you had to do every other job as well."
good,"Associates were forced to run the store on a skeleton crew and do the work of two or three people. Management did not lead by example and were often found goofing off in their offices or gossiping. My fellow associates were mostly hard working and friendly. I learned a bunch about customer service, shoes, small electrics, and shipping and receiving."
good,"High turnover and fluctuating schedule. Option to purchase an additional 2 weeks of vacation time, good benefits. Required to work one day per week and holidays were required as well."
good,"My co-workers are great to work with we always make the best of the time we have. Management on the other hand not as great, the managers are great but the store manager cusses at the employees and jumps at your throat for credits even when we ask every customer."
good,Kohls is a great first job option but with a bad manager in charge staying longer than a few years slowly drives you insane. However with a solid leadership team at the wheel Kohls is actually a fun and relaxed place to work.
good,Working in customer service was always very busy and demanding. There were always different questions to answer and new things to take care of for customers. It was a good environment though.
good,"Productive, Fun, Busy at times, good environment,"
good,"It is a great work place really chill and laid back environment with some cool mangers. Employees are really friendly and helpful, But the pay doesn’t match the amount of work that you will be doing."
good,A typical day at work was the department you were in yesterday did not mean you will be today. The manager would always change you department or moved you back. Even if the scheduled said you are a cashier this week.
good,Fun and a good way to pass the time. But only hires seasonal which is a bummer. Many managers but only 2 were friendly and understanding. Can be stressful especially around Black Friday or Christmas.
good,"Kohl's was a stressful job. The supervisors were helpful in making sure you had an easy first day. There is a dress code, and managers follow it strictly. The managers are okay, they are nice but strict as well. No ripped jeans, no sneakers, it is business casual. Employees are nice but the job requires a lot of time by yourself. You work in one section depending on your department and usually have someone working alongside you. People leave the store a mess, so you're on your feet most of the day. If you work 7 or less hours, you get a 15 minute break. Anything more, you are given a 30 minute break. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I met."
good,Cleaning the store.  Helping the customers find things.  I learned that working in a big department store is harder than working in a smaller store.  The management was friendly.
good,I am work hard and like to finish jobs what boss want me to do before I get off for the day. Doing the truck shipment. fill up the mens basic and men shirts on the floor from backroom. clean up the mess things on mens area. doing clearance men shirts
good,"Hours although flexible are very inconsistent and you do get repercussions if you take off of work, although they will not admit that. Fellow employees really make it worth working there for they are pleasant and willing to help you out."
good,"Youth welcoming, Steady paced, On your feet face to face contact with people serving them customer service. Working overnights was not properly managed but was worth the monetary benefits for the short holiday time period. I would like a more team oriented, organization based work life that is adaptable to a new and exciting career seeking student."
good,its good place to work but compensation is very low.Its a advice to management to kindly raise the compensation also at least give proper training to new joinees
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Complete daily administrative tasks to support the HR processes such as; on-boarding, absence management, promotions, transfers and terminations. "
good,"Company was a great first time experience in retail, not something I would recommend someone doing for the rest of their life but good job to have well going to school."
good,"•	Assist “AD Set” Supervisor accordingly "
good,My review at Kohl's would be that if you enjoy working with a great team its perfect. Kohl's focuses developing everyone in a team. Many people at Kohl's have team meetings to set up for holidays.
good,"Good perks; discounts, benefits"
good,Was a great place to work and advance with hard work. They brought in a new store that was not ready for her role and did not listen or work well with the rest of the managment team. As a company is great to work for
good,It was an okay workplace. I feel the managers can be rude at times. Great discount. Fun place to work at. Very clean and well organized. Great pay and great seasonal deals.
good,"They throw you into departments you have no training in instead of hiring more people, I've been in 4 departments in just one day and didn't know what I was doing, hours are too long on your feet, got an injury at work and the problem solver just lectured me about teamwork while i was crying in pain, they do blackout periods where any absence is unexcused (I was sick), the co workers were amazing, that's the only thing that stuck out as good to me."
good,"The work place is not very diverse however it's a nice place to work at.The managers can be very understanding, But they are inconsistent with work hours sadly."
good,"I have worked for the company for over 20 years and they continue to expect the impossible from hard working individuals.  At times, the less seasoned individuals are treated better."
good,"I loved working there with the customers and competitive people working to get credits, yet if you didn't get your credits you would be put down or hours would get taken away. "
good,"Hours are 2 10 hour days, 2 8 hours days and one 4 hour  day. If the holiday falls on a scheduled work day, we are required to work that day. "
good,Great staff. Friendly environment. Flexible work hours. The pay isn't enough to live off of but its an alright second job or for a teen just starting out.
good,While working at Kohl's I learned how to clean up a retail store with merchandise clothing.  I loved helping customers on the floor find merchandise.  I also learned how to put tags on the merchandise and put it away neatly.
good,"Working part-time here won't get you far, and it's really the only thing you can do. The pay raises are percentage based and aren't very high. You'll go from making $9.00 the first year to $9.15 the second year. They are flexible on scheduling though, but that's not really difficult to achieve when you only work 4 hour shifts."
good,I've come to learn how to deliver exceptional customer service in a fast-paced environment and handle difficult situations under pressure. I also became more familiar with the online ordering process inside and outside of Kohl's.
good,"Worked just about everywhere on the floor, customer service associates should be paid more. Dealing with customers outrageous problems should result in some sort of compensation."
good,"Unless you intend to move up into management with which opportunity it limited, it is not the place to work if you intend to use this as your sole or main source of income. Able to work a flexible schedule, largely due to the maximum hours allowed for a part time employee being low. Good place to be for a second job, students, or those not dependent on work.  Positive work environment with fair management team."
good,"Kohl's is an inclusive place to work which I have always found lovely. They will hire a wide range of age groups as well as genders and ethnicities. I enjoyed the customer interactions, most were very forthcoming and kind as long as the associate extends a genuine smile and greeting. There are down sides to the job too, as with any job. The most frustrating would be how impatient the management can be on any given day when the associates have not accrued enough solicited credit cards. It can be difficult to get customers to open a kohls charge card account but the managers always expect everyone to try harder. In fact, most kohl's stores have a general requirement that associates sign up at least 1 customer per week with a kohls credit card. For associates working the registers, their requirement is 1 customer credit PER SHIFT. That can be slightly stressful especially on a slow day."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Lots of variety in work duties.  Fast paced and your day goes by quickly.  Unfortunately retail hours do not provide for a lot of consistency in hours or stability for family life.  Lots of opportunity to gain customer service experience.
good,"My manager was very nice and helpful."
good,"Kohl's is at times, a fun and fast paced environment, and if you are knowledgeable about the products you can make really good sales that help the customer and you"
good,Typical shifts are 5 hours and you usually never have time to complete the work given. Appreciation is little but you have some personal accomplishment when you actually get the work done. Best part is definitely the people who work there. Most coworkers are good people who are underappreciated.
good,Worked both seasonal and part time at both locations in San Diego & Los Angeles.  Started off great in LA location but got a better job later.  Seasonal was great as well however that was short.  Both times i had discounts which was great.  Excellent job to keep when in school.  Management was poor in LA and consistent in San Diego.
good,"A typical day at work for overnight shift was clocking in and immediately going back to unload the truck, I learned some customer service skills and how to unload a truck as well as stock shelves. When I worked there, management wasn't the best- The main manager of the store was fine, and my initial overnight supervisor was fine as well but it was a revolving door for this particular job so we'd get inconsistent management styles. Workplace culture was fine, but as you can imagine graveyard shift was a bit miserable at times. The hardest part is and always will be the hours. The most enjoyable part was we were allowed to listen to music when doing price change and I made a few great friends here."
good,"The hardest part about working at kohls is dealing with the customers. The management is great  and hours are super flexible. At any time i can schedule days off, plus there are plenty of benefits working for kohls."
good,"typical day is steady"
good,A very productive place to work. The Culture is what you make of it . A typical a day on the job is providing service for  many customers and soliciting credit.
good,"I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a part time job for a short period of time."
good,"Been with the company for 9 years. Have slowly moved up the ladder, but it seem like over the last few years I have been at a stand still. A Promotion would be nice before I hit my 10 Year mark?"
good,"Seasonal work only. It is good for seasonal and helped fill an need during the Christmas season, providing extra cash for the holidays. Helping customers was satisfying."
good,For my first time working in retail I feel Kohl's was a great fit. It was a seasonal position and was exactly what i thought it would be. I'm not into fashion so it wasn't my favorite line of work but for fashion lovers I can possibly see this being a good fit.
good,I put my availability down for tuesday-sunday and they usually only had me work 2 days a week for 4 hours. They're not the best with hours yet they complain they don't have anyone to work.
good,Met some great people and learned quite a bit of task and responsibilities. It gave me many skills I will need in my future jobs and I loved working with customers.
good,"Fast paced environment, lack of on the job training. stockroom very organized and easy to navigate. computer systems outdated and unreliable.Schedule not constant and hours cut regularly."
good,"It is definitely a fast-paced place to work and no 2 days are a like. It can be difficult at times, as the scope and breadth of my position continues to get bigger as new innovations (Buy Online Pick Up in Store, etc) gain popularity. The people piece of the job is the best, you have the ability to make a positive impact and develop a diverse group of associates."
good,"They are a fine place to work it you like retail. You have to clean up the sales floor-zoning to get the store back in its proper state.  Management is nice and helpful, the people are nice as well.  The job itself is not hard, just can be very stressful at times."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The best thing about working at Kohl's Distribution Center had to be the work schedule. First shift started at 6 am and ended at 2 pm. We got two 20 min breaks. We worked M-F. When out shift ended we had the whole rest of the day to enjoy ourselves and our family. To me this was great because I felt like work was just a part of my life, but I didn't spend my whole life working."
good,"There was one supervisor that was always very rude. Other than her, everybody was very nice and I enjoyed working there. The pay could of been a little better though."
good,Kohl's overall was a fun place to work with all the laid back management. The hours were unbearable you would get 6/hrs a week if you were lucky to even get a day out of the week.
good,"My biggest issue here was after receiving a promotion, my hours were cut down to eight hours or less per week. Also I was taken out of my position(while keeping the pay, but losing significant hours) and working something lower than what I was promised. Aside from that it was a great place to get job experience while attending college."
good,I enjoyed my time at Kohls as the company has great morals.The problem with the Frisco Kohls is the management and how they treat employee's. Some are nice and some are mean and some just hate their job and makes everyone else hate their job as well.
good,"a typical day at work involves folding clothes & cleaning the store . management is okay , but they barely promote anyone to the next level . you really stay to your self"
good,The people are great to work with. Part-time be prepared to work 4 hours one week and 20 the next. No longer any benefits for part-time except employee discount. Very few if any full time positions.
good,"Worked for the company for about 14 years. Started out good, then had milti district changes over and over. Created a dead end job at dead end pay. Location eviorment was poor, lot of gossip and inter store personality problems. Not a very positive place to work. District manager then cut out any over time, if you got over time you then had to cut your hours on the next shifts to reduce payroll and take away your o/t pay."
good,"Kohl's has some great people to work with! Including the management. However, the corporation has its own issues. They make it very difficult to get enough hours and almost impossible to get a secondary job because of the ever shifting schedules. Still decent pay and benefits and worked well for a first job or some temporary income, but may not be the best place for long term commitments. You may be committed to them, but they will not make a commitment to you."
good,They are a good place to work don't get me wrong but when it comes to it they do not care about you personal. The people are very nice and helpful always but the hours can be long into the night
good,"A typical day at work would be meeting with my supervisor and making a goal for the day, how fast we would clean all the clothing departments before the work day is over. The management was average, it was not bad and it was not good either but I'm not taking anything personally its only professionally. Everyone was so hardworking and each had something to teach you. The hardest part of the job was the late night shifts but I don't mind, I will get the work done if I have to no matter how late. The most enjoyable part was learning new things everyday about business management and learning to incorporate them into any kind of job."
good,"I feel like this is a great part time job to have but not one that is good if you're trying to afford to move out on your own because  their is limited hours there  and there is only   hours there around  christmas season. "
good,Hours worked a week can very by the individual. Working on the truck team requires getting to work around 5 a.m once or twice a week. Work hours typically increase as the holiday season approaches.
good,Loved most people that worked there  can be some improvement with the management. Great for going to school and working because of the flexible schedule.
good,Managers aren't trustworthy very selfish behind the scene. But do your job and play the role and you can advance and make good money. Just don't take anything personal.
good,each day varies. But the benefits were great. Customers were challenging. You never really finished things per se within a day. Teamwork is a must. You have to value one another
good,Its the typical retail store job nothing fun or exciting you just work there because you need to pay bills. Try to stuff as much work for little pay and little hours. Not the best place to work.
good,"The company as a whole was great, management was unorganized which brought down company morale. I learn a lot about warehouse operations and management and would love to pursue a career in this field."
good,Overall it was a nice place to work. Very flexible with working with school and life schedules. Some managers were more friendly than others and everyone was friendly.
good,"I took a variety of calls from customers and store associates.  I learned about credit reports, credit increases and how to take payments from customers.  How to waive late fees and encourage customers to take the suvreys.  Management was good but not as connected as should be.  Teams were the groups we worked in and there were some good team building encouragements.  Hardest part of the job was back to back calls and mandatory over time during holidays (business driven)  Most enjoyable part would being with people I really like and building those personal relationships."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Very Routine. Home Dept was easy because things were hardly ever out of place but then again that's coming from someone who worked Kids as well. Kids was always busy and could never stay in order no matter how hard you try because kids love toys and hiding in the clothes.
good,"They really work with your schedule. "
good,"The staff at Kohl's was full of wonderful people. The most common problem people such as myself, is selling the Kohl's credit card. If you do not sell enough you receive no hours."
good,"It was only seasonal help I also work as a cashier when it was needed from management. At times I come in a over night to do over stock the store help keep the store clean,"
good,"It was a very nice job to have, especially for a seasonal one."
good,I worked there for 7 years. I got a long great with the managers and my immediate supervisor. Over all was a great job. I enjoyed working there. If I could have my assistant supervisor position back I would go back.
good,"A usual day at work involves unloading the merchandise from the truck and processing it all in a quick manner. I learned a lot more about organization and efficiency from this. The rapport between co-workers is good, and we work well together even when someone new works with us. The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours we recieve,  which means our paychecks do little to support us. The most enjoyable part is mostly the teamwork with our friends/co-workers."
good,The job wasn't difficult but there was no way to discipline the associates due to the fact that most things were handled off site. This made it difficult to successfully change negative cultures.
good,The management is lacking. Though theres excellent managers even they're not recognized. It's definitely a job to get you by but management can drive you a bit on the edge.
good,"I've learned how to manage my time"
good,Kohl's is not a hard place to work as long as you do what is expected of you and doing so correctly. Most of the job includes assisting customers and preparing the sales floor. From my time there i learned a lot about retail and how it works. The best part of the job was helping customers find exactly what they need and giving them an excellent shopping experience.
good,a day at work was busy during the day but always on my feet and doing something. i learned to multitask and get things done properly in a manner of time where i can get more done. management was ok they never really showed much appreciation to workers never really said thank you to us but some were nice. workplace was overall busy all the time. hardest part was the busiest time we would be handling many costumers at a time. most enjoyable was doing online orders for people and helping costumers who came out satisfyed with my help
good,typical day is helping the customer to get what they are looking for. Helping them to them know about the discounts what we are having through the month and making their experiances great
good,"Overall, this is a pretty flexible part-time retail job that is great for students, this was a very relaxed job when it wasn't a holiday. There were a lot of friendly employees and very easy job to keep up with."
good,"Best part of the job was the people you work with. I've built friendships that will last a lifetime. Learned a lot about customer service, especially during the holidays!"
good,Working at Kohl's was fun. The workers there were excellent to work with always willing to help someone. The manager is also great to work with she also gets on the floor to help out with the customer's. The customer's also have a good sense of humor also easy for me to work with and to find and get what they want. The hardest part of this job is the holiday's people are all in a rush to get what they came for. It can be frustrating but learning how to control motion is my specialty in order to get the work done.
good,"My location had one of Lowest pay in US"
good,"Working for Kohl's was pleasant. They are willing to work with you and your schedule so you can work as many hours as you like. However, as a seasonal worker, they did not respect me. I was supposed to stay on staff through January, then it changed to part of January, then I got let go 2 days in to January. I am a college student, so I arranged to be home all through the month to work and I was no pleased that they did this to me."
good,It was an okay job for a college student or for a part-time job. I wouldn't have wanted to work there for a long time. It was a very demanding job for the minimum wage I earned.
good,Seasonal employment opportunity I would have liked it to be a lot longer . I was told the position would last until January 2017 but it ended 12/10/16.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Ive learned about all the different types of products and brand names, where they go and how to properly stock and make the items look appealing and nice so the customer will want to purchase it."
good,I didn't like working with Kohl's because of the idea that they (manager) did not offer enough days to work and time for the seasonal employee. Management hired to many people during the holidays.
good,"You do a lot of independent work. You have the chance to learn a lot about all aspects of a job. However, the pay doesn't match some of the work that you can end up doing. There is a chance to earn more hours and they work with your schedule. They keep the environment fun there are plenty of opportunites to volunteer for community work."
good,"A typical day can be a number of things from unloading a truck to running freight, fulfillment or merchandise to the floor, and completing online orders. It really depends on what you are scheduled for.  Have learned how to use a palm/bluebird to scan and view information on merchandise, and online orders.  The management team is a very skilled and experienced with having employee know the best way to get jobs done. They are always available if you need help and are easy to get along with. Co workers are great to get along with and always show team efforts to complete daily tasks."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company and a great place to be a apart of the retail world. You get a look at all aspects such as shoes, home decor, kitchen essentials, clothes, makeup and beauty products, kids toys and clothes, etc. Its a place where your going to learn your job and get to know a wide range of products."
good,Hired during the seasonal period of the year. Good company to work for. Good co workers. Opportunity of a retail career with company. Enjoyable place.
good,It is a fun place to work at through high-school. There are always new projects to work on and new goals to meet. It is definitely a fast paced environment but it has been an enjoyable one.
good,"A typical day is busy with no room for boredom. I've learned incredible customer service skills from working for a company where customer service is such a strong focus. Management is typically very responsive and always there to help, although their primary focus is teaching associates to be independent. Being able to help customers leave happy, especially when they came in unhappy, is a great feeling. I love being able to find what they came in looking for and making sure they leave highly satisfied. The job is physically demanding and can really tire me out some days, but most days it just feels good to leave after a productive day."
good,"Open the building and start prepping for opening. Hold a morning huddle where I let team know of any updates or information such as sales and coupons available for the customer. Once open, stay at the front of the store supervising lanes and walk to fitting rooms to make sure they are being kept clear. Help with any problems that might arise with customers and check registers in case they need change or advances. Check all departments to see if they are being properly maintained."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kohls, i learned a lot about merchandising and product placement. When new merchandise came in and we had to set the floor according to the corporation guidelines its was exciting and fun, you always could count on your co-workers to help you and give you opinions."
good,it was OK place to work at needed better managers working  there the staff got along really well whit each other overall it was ok
good,"When I had first started working at Kohl's my overall experience was great. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the managers were friendly. As time went on my hours got reduced severely after speaking with managers saying if I can get more hours, my hours seemed to be reduced even more. I was working one day a week for only 4 hours. When there was over time I tried my best to take every shift. Even though there were some complications with the hours I had overall I thought the environment was good."
good,I was hired as a early morning fulfillment. Interviewed for a regular position but during orientation was told told I would be let go in January of 2016. I was told that if I was a cashier I could of worked more hours. I barely had 18 hours a week. I worked about 4 hours a day. Some of the female managers were stuck up and full of themselves. There were a few catty old ladies. But overall I liked working for kohls. I quit before Christmas.
good,"Poor management, mismanaged employees, employees are heavily dependent on external vendors/offshore for solutions."
good,"Cleaned up changing rooms, organized department we were assigned, answered incoming calls, and helped customers with any questions. I learned to look at my department in a different perspective based on what customers would ask. I learned about the information that i lacked and had to learn about to better do my job. Hardest part of the job was standing for long hours. The most enjoyable part was socializing with the coworkers during breaks."
good,"Nice environment to work at, the mangers and workers are very nice and respectful. Its usually pretty fast pace so time fly's by."
good,"Kohl's was a fun place to work, although keeping up with all tasks could be difficult if you got off task during the day. You must be willing to work nights and weekends in every position at Kohl's. Altogether the employees and managers made this a good place to work."
good,I loved working for this company. The only reason I'm leaving is because of the hours. I'm stuck on the late shift. I like the culture. They are always trying to make the place fun.
good,I worked there for over three months but it felt like I was there for longer. I loved who I worked with but the shifts were stressful. Closing is the hardest. The store closes at a certain hour but you wont leave until hours later. I closed 99% of the time and I was exhausted.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical work day includes coming in for a closing shift, that entails running the cash register, customer servicing, and putting away merchandise."
good,"i worked on truck team so i worked very early in the morning which was the hardest part, the managers the coworkers and job were not bad at all very few will see this as little more than a starting job once a year they automatically look at employee performance and decide how much of a raise they are eligible for"
good,"Starting out, Kohls was a decent workplace for students and retirees. The hours were adequate, the co-workers were very enjoyable. The customers could be better, however ""the customer is always right"" and employees were trained to respect the customers and to provide a helping hand anywhere possible. Towards the end of my stay, even though I had been requesting hours for weeks, by the time I left for College (again) they sent a letter for termination because of the little amount of hours worked. Very unprofessional to rob a student of his job when they were not at fault. Many other former co-workers have had similar experiences with this."
good,"Days are always busy"
good,"Very busy store during weekends. I learned to give the best customer service, because that's what Kohl's is known for. I enjoyed meeting new people every time."
good,"Working at Kohl's I gained a lot of experience working with customers and answering phone calls. I also learned how to change the signs on the racks when different hours of deals were going on. I had to keep the fitting room clean at all times. Kohl's was my first job where I started gaining great communication skills towards other people such as customers, co-workers, and management."
good,"Pros"
good,There is always something new to learn that will require you to put on your thinking cap.  Having a team support as well as individual knowledge to contribute is a plus in resolving new issues that may arise. The hardest part of a my job is when a process fails and you have to revisit something that you though was working! What I enjoy most able my job is when customer a satisfied with the service I provided.
good,A lot of work for one person for a little bit of money. Most managers are great. Nice co-workers but a few will not be so helpful.
good,It was a good place to work. A lot of times breaks were missed and your feet were hurting but it was fun. I really enjoyed the holiday times.
good,Kohl's is a company that should find its way to a better placement of positions and people to fill said positions with proper qualifications to do so as to perform as a whole.
good,Working at kohls was good at first because you got a lot of hours for a month straight. Their dress code is business casual unless its a special day like jersey day or college day. Sometimes they will call you to see if you can come in for extra hours and those shifts seem to go by faster than the shifts you are scheduled for. Some of the unsatisfying parts of that job is having to change your availability constantly to get more hours and they also play the same music. Literally the same music and if your shift is long enough you'll here the same song twice. Your co-workers are cool to work with especially if they have more experience with you. Most days are long days especially when its not during the holidays. Every 6-12 months every one will get a raise all at once like from $7.25-$9.00.
good,"Working retail in general is very exhausting. Very glad I got to learn key factors to work hard in order to promote within. Long hours, worked holidays but didn't feel they compensated in salary enough. Loved training new employees and loved the friendships I made along the way."
good,"My favorite part of the job is truck day. I LOVE truck day, new merchandise means new merchandising. i enjoy moving things around, reorganizing and making the merchandise presentable. I really enjoy my co-workers, management isn't the best, but the people I work next to make it all worth while."
good,"It was the same thing every single day, you put away clothes, helped customers. Around the holidays it was very busy and that's when the hours kicked up"
good,"A lot of interchanging parts within the company. Different managers have different styles of being effective but all have the same goal and that's providing the best way to be efficient so the numbers can correlate that to corporate. Co-workers are easy going and helpful. A typical day starts off by getting the numbers and tasks for my position and conferring with a manager on my report on what and how this will be done. After a few hours of work, a manger will chicck in again to see how much progress has been made."
good,"Pay was not worth the labor involved to complete tasks. Fast paced, but generally not enough hours to sustain off of. "
good,"A typical day at work would be long, even on a short day. Not saying it was always bad, there were definitely more good days than so. Working at Kohl's, I learned a lot about how we, as customers, shop. When generalizing, we all shop like a kid in a toy store; stuffs unorganized, things get mess, even sticky. But, the customer-employee relationship that you have is why the customer wants to come back and why you go to work the next day. Though the management has unique ideal for the customers, the employees are the ones who are truly cared for. Though sometimes employee training/orientation can be handled differently, it doesn't take awway that the hardest part of the job would be going home when your shift is over."
good,"Great clean work environment. Positive people in the work place. Fun workplace with workers who understand teamwork, Short breaks or no breaks at all became a little frustrating, but we also received a lunch break.This job allowed me to grow and develop more customer service skills, Did not like having to sign out before you leave a shift."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"it was a nice and slow environment, very easy job, cleaning fitting rooms and straightening up clothes. Helping cutomers find what they want."
good,The great thing about working at kohl's is that they usually have positions available. The reason they usually have jobs available is because they regularly lose workers(in my time there anyway). The environment can be pretty fun depending on who you work with. The work load tens to be too much because of the lack of associates so you wind up doing more than you were hired for. The upside to that is you can add that to your work experience when you find a better job inevitably.
good,"IT was an okay place to work, not too bad, not too spectacular. Kohl's offers health insurance, which i don't use but i wanted to throw that out there anyway. Also, even if you are an employee, that does not guarantee you will get accepted for a kohls charge card. It's the same chances as if you were a normal customer."
good,"It is a good place to work, the pay is decent. It is definitely a great job for someone who is just entering the work field. There is a lot of walking and standing involved & a lot of physical work."
good,I have been at kohl's for 9 years I must say I enjoy working there part time. This job is great with going around anybody schedule. This is a place to work if a person needs a second job. They will do special things for their workers during out the year.
good,"Challenging role responsible for delivering QA services across 200+ IT projects across Kohl's enterprise. Responsible for transformational initiatives to drive down cost, increase speed and qusality"
good,poor hours but will work around school. treats customers much better than the associates. manager to associate communication could be better.
good,"It has been fun working with this company, the work environment is fun and fast paced and I always am able to stay busy. The discounts are great and the customers are always friendly."
good,"one of the most flexible warehouses by far. "
good,"Being an american company, the ability to earn a living wage was next to impossible.  Starting with above the federal minimum wage in my state, it was still hard to earn any kind of money to help pay off bills.  However, the other employees were amazing and very supportive.  The atmosphere was great to work in as well."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's for the most part, although the comments we got from managers in soliciting credit was constant. As soon as you start your shift, you get into a huddle with those clocking in as well. Managers (E3's) will give you a summary of what is to be done that day, sales goals, along with credit goals. For point of sales associates, credit is a big portion in determining the amount of hours that you get the following week. Overall, this was a great job, with potential for growth as a supervisor."
good,Its an alright place to work if its your first job. But its definitely not long term. Every day is different. You never know if you day will be slow or fast paced.
good,"worked for a seasonal position, it can be very fun but hectic on holidays. Good job for gaining retail experience. The managers are nice, and always happy."
good,"A typical day runs about 8-10 hours starting at 6am and from that point on you are constantly busy, I learned a lot about the equipment I operated and how to use the scan guns. The management could of been better, I didn't really connect with them because there were so many different supervisors and they really never got real close to us. The co-workers weren't bad, they just wanted to get their shift done and leave. The hardest part for me was being pregnant while working there which was why I had to resign. I enjoyed driving the equipment around and the pay was very good."
good,Don't get enough hours sometimes. Store manager not a good manager. Communication between administration and managers terrible.
good,"I worked here a year and it was just like any other retail job. Help customers and clean the store. Overall, it was a fun job. The employees were awesome and the managers were easy to get along with."
good,This was my first job and a wonderfull learning experience. The work enviorment was was very friendly and the employee discounts were great. The hours and pay were low.
good,"normally your day would start 6am or 9 am walking the floor preparing for your shift, their was much to learn including plan o grams for each section of store. this was a new store so all management was also new to this business so we learn together.the hardest part at the time was managing 96 employee for  two months preparing for grand opening, but learn how to deal with so many different personalities was great experience."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Honestly, working at Kohl's part time makes me want to pull my hair out. They are constantly changing policies which ends up shorting associates hours. However, it can be an okay place to work part time. They are extremely flexible with your schedule."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work at all really, if you are well liked you will be rewarded. Advancement opportunities can take a long time to get where you really want to be."
good,"This job was good for someone in high school just starting out in the work force, it really isn't for people looking for full time work and good money."
good,"Typical day is stocking department, moving product to follow corporate directives, management is decent, co workers are nice and most customers are too, and that is the most enjoyable aspect. Nothing is hard mentally but it can be physically demanding."
good,Overall the goal is to make all of the merchandise presentable to the customer. Regardless of which department you work in.
good,"For the most part, Kohl's follows they typical retail environment you'd might expect. The hours are extremely flexible and can be scheduled around other priorities such as school and other places of employment.  "
good,"Good benefits. If you're full time they pay a good chunk of medical, eye, and dental. Life insurance and disability insurance are paid in full by the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, however certain management wasn't fair. there was a lot of favoritism. My fellow co workers were very friendly and helped out when needed."
good,"Kohl's does a lot of volunteer work with children & Kohl's would donate money to children's charities. To work at Kohl's you have to be customer service oriented, be willing to sell the Kohl's charge card to every customer you come in contact with, & pretty much be able to do whatever is asked of you."
good,"As a cashier the responsibilities were straight forward, provide a positive experience for the customer. When there was no line for the cashiers, it was typical to help fold and tidy up some tables. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, they were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for long periods of time."
good,The job was good but felt taken advantage of for all the work put in at times. The people were good and everyone had great customer servic with customers.
good,"My store was phenomenal with scheduling. They requested at least five hours available for all seven days a week, and obviously the more hours you were open, the more hours you get. They would schedule you anywhere from four to thirty-two hours a week based on your posted availability. I never once worked outside my availability. "
good,"Barely any hours, easy work though, clean environment, some friendly co-workers but the rest were clique-ish, I learned a lot, worked my first black friday and it was hectic, easy to learn, enjoyed working there. I liked the fact I was working 6am until 10am, but need more hours throughout the week."
good,"Straight forward retail job. It is simply a job. "
good,Kohls is a good job to work for. Only if your full time. Part time and seasonal workers are often treated bad. The work hours are not consistent unless your full time. They also hire anybody and fire anybody they do not care. I worked so hard for Kohls for over a year I havent turned full time and got fired by someone I just met for being late. Would never work their again
good,"Working at Kohl's had its advantages and disadvantages. In the beginning, over a year ago, working there was so much fun. I looked forward to going to work everything. I enjoyed the hours I was being given, and I enjoyed the work I was doing. But, as time went on, my hours were becoming less and less, and the work was nothing like it was in the beginning. In the beginning we would hold events to promote a specific line of make up. We would offer free make overs to customers shopping to get them in to purchase something. A year later and we stopped doing fun things like that to make work fun and to get the sales up. I applied there to do make up and to do something I enjoyed. Over time, my enjoyment of working there went down and down. Honestly I'm happy to no longer be employed there, now I can find a new place of employment doing what I love to do and that's hair and make up."
good,"The schedule can be very inconsistent.  Some weeks you would work for six hours and other works you might work 36 hours.  Most of the people are nice, but it can be stressful."
good,"Typical day at work was getting into Kohls before opening and changing the e-sign toppers. After that was done I went up front and was cashier for a couple of hours before I went home. Some times I managed the women's intimate section. (pick up and organize clearance racks.)"
good,A good job that keeps you busy their is always something to do.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at Kohl's for a couple of years.  "
good,Fast pace environment which forces you to grow and learn fast which is good.
good,"As with any retail position this one includes odd hours and low pay. On occasion you will be asked to do an overnight shift along with your regular shifts during the week. After a while this will really mess up your sleep schedule. Its technically voluntary but if other people decide they don't want to come, management may ask a few times. They do pay you an extra dollar for every hour you work overnight."
good,"You never know what you would do when you get there. You get scheduled for one area and without hesitation, they move you."
good,i loved my job. i enjoyed the people i worked with and some of the management. i would either be in customer service(favorite place to be)or ringing on registers. helping people get their returns and exchanges done in a quick and friendly manner. the hardest part of the job was when i couldnt do anythi ng to help my customers and management had to be called. i enjoy helping people.making everyones life easier is the best part.
good,"Good sense of community between the coworkers and management. Very employee oriented corporation, however, the individual stores handle the employees differently."
good,Kohls suffered from over expanding too quickly. They have great technology and most of the management was surprisingly down to earth.
good,Meet lots of good people and make plenty of connections. customers ara bit rude. management seems to blow smoke to get you to do what they want you to do.
good,I worked as a cashier and assisted in helping the customers with their various needs. There were days in which I would also work the floor and those days were extremely long. I enjoyed assisting the customers. The management was okay. My co-workers were more of  associates that I worked with.
good,"The coworkers were great. But as soon as they got a promotion to management, their behavior changed. Management held unrealistic expectations of the floor associates, and our hard work was always discredited. They took advantage of the harder workers by pulling them in so many different directions, and yelling at them for not being in one of the four places. There was simply no pleasing them. The other sales associates were awesome, though. There was a strong sense of team work among us. We worked with each other and helped out as much as we could."
good,"Very laid back place to work, people were nice. it was an enjoyable company to work for."
good,"Easy going supervisors, fast pace environment, co-workers and I are a team that works together. The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours."
good,"A typical day at kohls is constant customer interaction and fair time managed work loads. I have learned many things from following company policies and corporate's way of merchandising. Overall, management is fair. My co-workers have became like family. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what project to do first. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the customer is 100% satisfied and remains loyal."
good,I enjoy working at this company. I also enjoyed my co-workers and the management team. This position strongly strengthened my customer service expirence and helped me better understand the daily responsibilities that it takes to successfully operate a Kohl's store.
good,"I work several different shifts and various positions within the store."
good,"Overall, love working for Kohl's,  Benefits for everyone, even part timers after one year.  Vacation time and holiday pay for everyone who is a permanent employee."
good,Everyone is really friendly. They work with your school schedule. Simply its a great place to work besides the pay. The only reason I want to leave the company is because I need higher wages.
good,"I just come in clock in and go to my register. Only at night would i have to put back and fold clothes so that everyone could leave on time. From Kohl's I learned about Door busters and more. The co-workers were very nice, sweet and helpful at all times. The hardest part of the job was catching thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving back kohl's cash for the customers."
good,"Kohl's is a great company and very friendly. However, the pay is not worth the drive. After taxes come out, you will average about $13 a shift and spend more in gas. It really isn't worth it when you are spending more in gas than what you are making."
good,"Kohl's is a very fun interactive place to work. The job is very easy and pretty enjoyable. The particular store I worked at always had associate ""food days"" we would have nachos, pizza, baked goods etc set up in the break room all the time especially around christmas. However after the holidays hours went from 25+ (part time) to one 4hour shift a week and it became very inconvenient for me."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was very difficult to continue to work there while going to college. When I tried to come back on breaks and weekends, I was met with hostility and people not recognizing me. I ended up quitting after a year and a half because no one was helping me get hours."
good,"The hardest part about this job was trying to juggle it with school. On a regular basis, the managers would keep the associates overtime until nearly 2 in the morning. There was only an annual pay raise, which never raised the pay more than a few cents. The co-workers were the best part about the job. They were both friendly and helpful and worked in a team environment. Management, however, was disconnected with what was going on on the floor and the most efficient ways to get things done."
good,Working at kohl's wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. If you wanted you could work a lot of hours. The only problems with the job were that it was a seasonal job and they do lay offs. Also not all the people who work there do their jobs like they should. A lot of people are very lazy.
good,Kohl's had a stable work environment. You stayed in your department for the most part and everyone helped on the register to get customers taken care of. There was always something to be doing or working on and co-workers took good care of each other. You could really feel part of the team. My complaint is that when it came to the store managers and policies then it felt like big business. All your good work would easily be thrown out the window. It's almost as there are two groups running the store.
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's.  They offer a good work life balance and good environment.  I don't like that I can't get more than 24 hours a week and sometimes it's less.  I need 40 hours.
good,"There were not very many people there who would want to chat for a bit before the shift started. You could tell people were there just to get a day's worth in and get out."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers. I learned just how much time an energy, from everyone, is required to maintaining a large department store."
good,"stocking, receiving, assisting customers, register, answering phone calls. management is sometimes friendly but usually very strict."
good,A typical day included working the register and straightening up the sales floor. I learned how to work a cash register since this was my first job and I also learned how to multi-task. We had several managers and they were good at making sure we kept up with the floor and communicated with each other if we needed help. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the clothes and make sure they were always neat. The most enjoyable part was getting great discounts.
good,If a manager or they will do whatever they can to replace you no matter how good of a worker you are.
good,I got bored a lot. The job was easy and the management was good. The company was flexible with my hours. Pay was not the greatest.
good,"The job it self is quite lacking...the technology I am supposed to use on a daily basis constantly fails, resulting in me not being able to finish my job...Since I cannot finish due to faulty tech, I get yelled  at. Seems like a constant up hill battle between bad management and poor tools. All in all my work day tends to be very boring, unless there is a customer who actually needs help or something along those lines. Otherwise the job is something I do not look forward to doing."
good,"I worked in the kids department area of the store. That can get a little messy with customers coming in and out. A typical day is straitening the clothes that are hung on a hanger, refolding clothes and clearing out the dressing rooms every chance you get. My co-workers work great and we worked as a family. My management showed favoritism to some of the workers and barely spoke to the other unless he had to. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the management. The most enjoyable part about this job was meeting need people and making new friends for life."
good,"Under staffed and underpaid. Lots of favoritism shown, everybody wont move up. The company as a whole is a good company if your sitting up high. Schedule is unpredictable from week to week. You train yourself by' trial and error. Its not the worst place to work but the only reason you stay is because you have no other place to go."
good,"There is always a list of accomplishments you have going on for the day. You must learn how to balance and use effective time management to succeed in a manager position. Customer service is a very important attribute to have, as their policies and greatest expectations is making ""her"" experience a happy one!"
good,"Kohl's was a great company to work for when I first started. But as the company grew, our values grew apart."
good,"Clock in, look at work chart to see where you were for your shift."
good,"I started out the day typically by starting on recovery from the day before. Then I would check to see if there was nay product that needed to go out from the previous truck, or replenishment. I would then check with my manager to see if I was needed to give breaks to Customer service, POS, or Jewelry. I had incredible co workers that tried very hard to meet my expectations.Most of the time I worked in my department alone, but once a week we had our truck day and I was able to give instructions and mentor new employees."
good,"No matter what your position is, you'll likely find yourself operating a cash register for a decent portion of your shift. As a department supervisor I was required to attend to all customers in my department and help them find sizes/colors not displayed on the sales floor, locate merchandise available at other area stores."
good,"Workmanship needed. Taking care of the Intimate Department, is a detailed job that requires a least 30 -35 hours a week; sometimes , I just work 20 hours, and most of the times , I'm by myself and the job get accumulated, and I feel frustrated, because I like to have everything done, because the kind of department that it's needs that."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Everyone in the company knows everyone else. Nobody is left out.
good,"This is an alright place to work. I personally don't get enough hours to support myself, and I am looking for something that gives me more stable hours, even if the pay is less. They base hours on your ability to solicit the Kohl's Charge Card, and not on overall performance"
good,"I would go back to work at Khol's Greet customers as they walk in, and answer questions about items they may be looking for. Ring up items on computerizes cash register, open store credit cards, handle returns and do even exchanges, show the customer's how to place online orders if item is not available in store."
good,"I enjoyed the people and liked to make the customers happy.  I learned that I can do anything.  Management was very laxed,  and a lot of ignoring wants and needs of employees. Dressing rooms,  I loved the customers. "
good,"First thing I do is clock into work. Then I'll check to see what area i'm working then I check to see if I have recovery in customer service and then I proceed to my area. I check my fitting rooms to clean them out , once I've gotten everything out I find the proper place where the merchandise belongs and put it back. If I'm backup on a register i'll go assist there.  After I have got my fitting rooms caught up I'll pick up the floors and fold. By the time I start all that it's time for us to close and I go help in other areas mostly misses to pick up and fold until it's time for us to go home. "
good,Not many hours to work for part timers. Co-workers were friendly but always gossiping about one another. Management was organized. The hardest part of the job was through the holidays.
good,Working at Kohls is fast paced and a good place for a first or part time job. The environment is friendly. The hours are good if you've been there for awhile but if you are just starting off there they don't give you many and are likely to continue hiring people and giving new people hours instead of the already hired employees. 
good,it is hard working job. extremely under paid and have horrible managers
good,"Its been a ver good experience working with Kohls, I had leart many things from there. The ambience and the entire staff is freindly & very co operative. "
good,"fun and fun"
good,"-No streamlined systems make for repetitive work"
good,Overall ok place to work if all you need is part time hrs Must be able to work all hrs to get anything over 20 hrs per week Manarement seems to think that some employees are sitting around the phone waiting to be called in
good,The head manager was wonderful the rest not so much.so of my coworker were good some not.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and checking the schedule to see which area I would be working in. Logging into my register and begin to check out customers. I learned more about customer service from this job, and how to be persuasive and sell different products to customers. Management is okay. They don't watch over you at the register like a hawk, but they do give out lots of directions, which is okay. My co-workers are nice to work with as well. The hardest part I would say is standing up all day at the same register, and also having to close so late and sometimes not leaving until 12 AM. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid every week."
good,ive been there for 5 yrs about and they just dont give me a chance. i try talking to my manger and they dont listen. they said i will be able to more stuff when i got hired in im still waiting. guys get hired to work the truck not floor. only good part you get 20% discount at verizon which is the only reason im staying. theres no hours
good,"Kohl's was a nice place to work at because of the people. The management was not as good as i would have liked it to be but, were not the worst. I had great co-workers and thats one of the things that made my time at kohls easier to deal with. Our nightly duties were to throw a certain amount of boxes a night but, the problem came in when you reached your quota and still didn't reach your goal...When this happens and managers can't explain it to you there is really nothing you can do."
good,Kohl's is very good at training it's employees. Manager's are not afraid to roll up their sleeves and help. They know how to do every job.
good,co-workers are very nice & helpful. Have alot of fun being there but the pay is not enough for someone of my age
good,"I do really like Kohls for the experience that it has provided me, but to be honest I won't go far if I stay there."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Stocked merchandise
good,"I only had a 3-6 hour shift usually and usually 10 hours or less a week. I learned how to deal with far more difficult customers than i had previously worked with. Management had a couple good people but mostly fake and uncomfortable. Never and security or advancement. The hardest part of the job was the little amount of hours and stagnation of the position. The most enjoyable part was making customers happy, meeting and exceeding credit and email goals, and my when I actually got to work the sales floor."
good,the work life balance was great my husband is military so it helped my mother-in law lived with me and she was disabled and they worked with me on the days i needed off.
good,As a cashier you basically were to yourself unless you needed a manager. Hardly needed to interact with co-workers. Managers made it clear what was expected of you on a daily basis. Give feedback when needed.
good,A typical day at work was making outbound calls to customers who have not paid their bill. I would make 60-100 calls a day and try to collect payment or put them on a hardship program.
good,"No matter what department you're working in, you must be able to complete your tasks at an amazing speed. Kohl's gets shopped at a high volume regardless of what day of the week it is and at times it can be extremely difficult to keep fitting rooms cleared of merchandise and the sales floor looking presentable. In that case, there's really no time to slow down to relax real quick. But this type of environment is enjoyable in the sense that it keeps you active and alert, and you rarely get bored because there's always something to do. Most the co-workers are awesome and easy to get along with, and management is great as well. They're very good at working around a busy schedule. I have worked there while working at another job and being a full time student and Kohl's was still able to give me a decent amount of hours based on my availability. This is a great first job for students or anyone interested in retail."
good,"A typical day, is clocking in, go to your area, do assigned job and go home. I learned how to understand people better, I had great coworkers,. The hardest part was when someone didnt show up to work or getting multiple customers when you only one at cash registers and customers have no patience and wanting you to work faster. I enjoyed the co-workers and incentives,"
good,I started working with this past August(2012) and I have really enjoy working there. The management is very friendly and the quality of the service is exceptional. The problem is with the ups and downs of the economy translates into very little hours for the store.
good,I have found that working at Kohl's provides an excellent opportunity to gain experience in management and customer service. I also find that it's a great place to learn about merchandising and customer satisifaction.
good,"great place to work for , loved it durning the holidays stayed busy"
good,Fast pace retail that requires a tremendous amount of patience & excellent customer service skills.
good,Stocking
good,Kohls was great. i didnt like the fact that my hours where based on credits. just trying to get credits was hard
good,Fast paced environment with no down time. Fun atmosphere with coworkers. Customer service based at all times. Its always about HER.
good,"A day at Kohl's consisted of cleaning out the fitting rooms and clearing the racks of unwanted clothing. I briefly would cashier when someone needed assistance and pushed to get people to sign up for a Kohl's card. Management was okay, but there were a couple of managers who were over the top and quite rude, to be honest. My co-workers were great, it was fun to get to work with other people. The hardest part of the job was trying to clear the rack of clothing left outside of the fitting room. I had a hard time finding where everything went."
good,"Worked on sales floor, fitting rooms, registers or any other areas as needed"
good,Good place to work for a night and weekend availability.
good,"When you get to work first you put all of your stuff in your locker and then you clock in.Then my job was to go either Misses',Men's,or Juniors' and clean out the fitting rooms.Then if their was a lot of clothes to be put away you would grab a z rail and organize the clothes by brand and then you would wheel the z rail out and put the clothes away.If needed you may also be called to the register.Periodically throughout the day I would fix all of the folds on the fold tables.All of my co-workers were nice and friendly.The hardest part of the job was finding where all of the Apt 9 clothes go because most of the other brands are further organized into collections but Apt 9 is not and Apt 9 takes up the most space out of any of the brands.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping all of the customers find what they were looking for.Management would talk to you but a lot of times they will come up with reasons as to why you couldn't pick up someone else's shift.Your schedule would be different every week and a lot of times they will only give you 4-8 hours a week.I learned how to run a cash register,organize the clothes,how to do ad set and ad take down,and fold clothes neatly."
good,"its a great store for those who shop by the means of the middle class, but the managment could be a lot better"
good,This was my first retail job and gave me an opportunity to learn the retail business first hand.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"High volume call center. On a typical day at work take about 200 incoming calls reguarding customers Kohl's charge accounts. It can range from changing addresses, to removing late fees. The hardest part of the job was not becoming bored with constantly repeating yourself for eight hours a day. I learned to try to come up with new approaches to avoid that. Coworkers were great, I made some good friends."
good,A typical day at work I am always busy which is a plus. I enjoy being able to stay busy especially if it's a long day and I'm scheduled to work eight hours.
good,"I felt like I was right at home when I got hired. Unfortunately over time, I began getting harassed by not one- not two- but THREE of my supervisors and it got so bad that I had to leave."
good,I have enjoyed working there.Alot of helpful People and Teamwork is really good there.
good,"It's a good job to have for someone who is in school or college looking for part time work and flexible hours. The co-workers are awesome to work with, for the most part all my co-workers are easy to work with and the supervisors are willing to train you to work in their dept"
good,I didnt get the proper training needed to adjust to the work place in other areas of my position discription.
good,More money to keep people to stay. Pay raises are ridiculous. If a customer leaves you a tip you have to turn it in and you never get it back. Lack of communication
good,"Friendly colleagues each shift , willingness to work with individuals that had other jobs, classes or even workers who needed “mothers’ hours”. Managers worked extremely close together to create a calm and flexible environment."
good,"It is nice to work with very enjoyable fellow employees and to meet customers most of the time. The hours can be very flexible it you want"
good,"As a member of the operations team responsibilities consist of accountability for meeting both in store and online Customer requirements, increasing customer loyalty, uploading and processing all incoming freight, unloading the truck, replenishing merchandise on the sales floor, sign and price changes, attention to detail, ensuring the customer receive excellent service by accurately and efficiently processing both instore and online orders by prioritizing as needed, knowledge in each department, assisting in a friendly, courteous manner effectively resolving customers questions and request."
good,It is a great place to work for. But need to be flexible more with the supervisors. Meaning if they only can work 730 to 5 that shouldn’t be a problem and closed on the weekends.
good,"While the job may seem like it may be a good experience, I've come to learn that Kohl's does not care about its employees as much as it cares about their credit. This job is completely based on how much credit you can sale, but the workers seem neglected."
good,"It’s a great job smiles good personalities, happy people and encouragement, there wasn’t any bad that I notice, honestly very good facility for all people"
good,It's a pretty easy place to work at if you have enough people on staff. You'll often find yourself pulled from your department to assist at the register.
good,"Kohl's is a company that is driven by results, production, and ultimate customer satisfaction. The call-in system is used way more often than it should be. You might end up working a whole department by yourself due to coworkers calling in or poor scheduling,"
good,No matter how hard you work for a seasonal company they will mostly likely not keep you. I work over 40 hours including overnight. Its still isn’t enough for them.
good,Do expect much of them it's better if you're just starting to go into the retail field......................................................... Only good thing the pay weekly basis
good,"I’ve learned that you have to be on task during work and don’t let other distract you . The manager was so unfairly with others , their wasn’t a hard part about the job it was easy , the most enjoyable thing Barbour the job is working hard for time to go by fast"
good,"This is a good part-time job for folks younger than retirees. While the work isn't difficult,  it is strenuous on the body. Customer encounters will challenge all your personalities. Never a dull moment!"
good,"I assisted in the review and care of customers credit bureau history and provide necessary adjustments while ensuring accuracy of company policies. Flexible work schedules, the hardest part was being assessed on everything you do. Management was good, The workplace was fine. The hardest part of the job was being assessed on everything you do. The most enjoyable part  was some of the extra events they did."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,They need to catch up to other retailers with the pay. They need to have more employee incentives. They also need to restructure the stores based on volume and sales
good,Had a few stressful moments and moments of discouragement from customers but we always made up for it with customer services and assistance at any opportunity.
good,"Wonderful place to work. Does not allow you to go overtime. Pay is bad.Good staff, very friendly. Busy on holidays good work that time after that they hardly call for work."
good,"its a good atmosphere but some of the managers weren't that good but the atmosphere is good, they try there best to communicate with customers and help them whenever they need it"
good,Manager showed favoritism alot. The Employees were very NICE. The store was VERY clean. Enjoyed the employee discounts. Sometimes very very under paid for the amount of work load.
good,"Excellent business management opportunity, will develop highly transferable skills to any industry. Extremely hard work mentally emotionally and physically. Challenging number of tasks to constantly juggle, with priorities shifting quickly. Holiday season is spent living in the store, frustratingly high turnover with hourly employees because company is not generally competitive with other retailers. Opportunities to advance are there if you are willing to put in the work and develop your team."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's. I love the discounts however the pay is below average among the retail industry. The management is very kind yet you are lucky to get hours. It is not the kind of job you can earn a steady paycheck unless you are in management.
good,"Worked around school, I loved my bosses and coworkers. That being said the company was annoying. Kept tracking employee speed/ productivity with technology that froze and malfunctioned (which slows you down). Also the pay literally couldn’t have legally been any lower. It was a good first job and helped me get through school."
good,Kohl's was a great company to work for in some aspects but not so great in others. They don't give you the recognition needed and that seems unfair. They always ask so much of their employees and never properly thank them.
good,"Worked as a cashier and there would be times where there are no customers in the store and the atmosphere was not actively alive. Where customers are there in the store, the place becomes alive."
good,If you’re looking for a job with not much advancement of your position then this job is for you. They are a company that strictly focuses on their “goals”
good,"Will be trained in every department and expected to hold more responsibility with no increase in pay. If on registers, credit is heavily pushed. Morning trucks can be fun depending on who your co-workers are however can be very unorganized at times. Mangers and supervisors will often argue over how something should be done resulting in a lot of wasted time and effort. Would often change something in the store and then would have to move it back within 2 weeks."
good,"A lot of multitasking is required, and transitioning your thoughts from one task to another is important. Though this can be stressful, one will never get bored."
good,"You need to be self-motivated."
good,"kohl's is a straight-up average minimum-wage job. i work the sales floor and it's exactly what you'd expect, just putting clothes back on the racks. the people are overall great to work with, so that is a big plus for sure! raises are rare and we had to work understaffed on the floor for months so it can get stressful. this is a solid job for high school/college students and they're pretty good about working with your schedule and almost always approve requests off, as long as it's not a black-out date and you submit on time."
good,"I went into this job thinking I would get an abundance of hours but within the first two weeks of me working there, I got none. Then from then on, it was shaky whether or not I would get hours."
good,"Most of the employees and management working at Kohl’s are great people who make Kohl’s a lovely place to work, however one bad manager can ruin things for you. The biggest thing there is to keep you there though is the ways Kohl’s allows associates to leverage their discounts, it has made a huge difference in retention."
good,How much u like this job will depend on your managers. Had 2 great ones so the fact that it was work was made better. Next store manager was the reason i quit.
good,"There is nothing to surprise here. Typical entry level type job or good for part time and retirees. Potential for upward mobility, but limited. Mostly part time with limited benefits jobs."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"working there is good it’s a really good job for learning easy things, a great first job, but also a good part time job just to make some extra cash. all you have to remember is that customers will be mean and you can’t let it get to you! other than that it’s a great place to work"
good,"I love working at kohls but I hate my store. They expect so much from you, in the 4 hours they schedule you. I'm part time and I only get about 12 hours a week if I'm lucky. I literally get about $100 a week. How am I suppose to pay bills?!. My point being, it's not worth working here unless you're full time"
good,Kohl's Distribution Center is a good starter place for anyone who want to stick there foot in the DC world. Great pay and benefits was a key to keeping me at work.
good,"If you work registers, you will be forced to sell credit cards. These will make or break your raises. After about a year I asked to transfer to a different department. This is when I began to enjoy my work. All the coworkers made this experience great."
good,I absolutely love my job at Kohl's. The only negatives is that they pay at minimum wage and most associates are very lazy. It's hard working somewhere where you run circles around everyone else. You could be working so hard your sweating while other employees are standing around.
good,Typical retail job gives very little hours (lucky if you get 20 a week) unless it is during the holidays. If working closing shift you must stay until the entire store is clean. I typically worked the closing shifts. The store would close 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays (the busiest days) and  closers would be scheduled to stay til 11:30pm but most of the time would not leave until 12-12:30am. The company does have a great volunteer program and does often have parties and offer other perks to employees.
good,Its a really nice and bright environment. a lot of people have worked there for years because they have benefits. None of the managers are on the same page tho.
good,Not a lot to see there were fun times and there were hard times. It’s a lot how you would expect a store would be runned. They had great perks for the shoppers
good,"I really like that  Kohl's promote from within. There are a lot of different departments to move to. The work environment was ok. They have a ""say yes to your style"" policy. I also really like that you can buy up to two weeks of vacation time!"
good,Overall my experience at Kohl's was a good experience. It taught me more about how to help out customers to make sure they were satisfied with Kohl's.
good,As long as you don't have a family and like to work alot this is the place for you. Alot of advancement but gave up alot of family time for it. THis was 15 years ago though
good,"This is a basic first time jobs for 16 year olds and up. Great if you wanna move up. I learned a lot in my short time working there. Eventhough it was seasonal, i felt overworked as i go to school full time. Good experience. Id go back if they offer and with a raise."
good,"it was a great place to work the staff was really nice, the managers were very understanding. I made a few friends along the way, and I am able to walk into the store today and everyone still greats me the same."
good,Most management was very responsive in terms of training and guiding new employees. Didn't provide enough hours to seasonals. The work environment is usually very good.
good,"The work and people are great and to be quite honest it is a little hard to actually leave..."
good,"retail can be extremely stressful and the pay does not compensate for the mess you have to put with between customers, management, and physical demand."
good,"The people that work at Kohl’s are very kind and sweet. You do have to figure a lot out by yourself, but the people you work with are willing to help you out. Some of the managers are nice and very helping, but others are more focused on the end goal, which is fine, but sometimes you get a little lost in what you’re doing. If it hadn’t been for the crew, I probably wouldn’t have liked working here, but everyone is very friendly."
good,Very calm and comfortable atmosphere. I just wish more hours were available and the pay was better. There is no way for me to move up and it's easy to get stuck in one position for long periods of time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Over work all there employees, department leaders don't receive enough help to complete the exhausting tasks they are given each day. they don't staff the fitting rooms with enough workers which leads to department leads to take care of and there work doesn't get done, which trickles up the ladder of leadership leaving jobs done half par, or not at all. Policies for customers are outrageous and ridiculous leaving management to deal with  societies best everyday. ITS EXHAUSTING!!! I feel for every employee that works in each and every store."
good,"Was paid 9.25 an hour, which for a highschooler was perfect. Made many friends who I am still close with to this day. Managment was great and never cared if you called off for a good reason."
good,Learned to stay more organized. Manage time better. Workplace culture was mostly teenagers and elderly women. Got along with everyone although the male to female ratio caused some drama with the younger associates. Not very big on training employees well. Learned mostly everything by myself and other associates but definitely not from the managers.
good,"The people  I've worked with stays positive, always keeping the business going. The key to it is teamwork. I have learned to communicate more and collaborate with people."
good,The job is fast paced and requires a lot of work. The pay is ok but definitely not a living wage. There is room for advancement if you work hard. Merchandising is fun and leaves room for creativity.
good,"It was fun at first but it’s unfair & they are not flexible but the people are great, they did not let you request off if you really needed off. It felt like they have favorites employee wise."
good,While short. I enjoyed my time working there. It wasn't a hard job. I wish I could of stayed on longer but it was a seasonal job no more no less. Good job if you can get it.
good,"One of the best jobs I’ve ever had even with the issues that I encountered with the company. As far as the building, all buildings have issues. It kept you and your crew busy. During the peak retail season, just forget about sleeping. It’s busy. Non stop busy. Unfortunate issues caused my departure but still wish I worked there. My team was the best, and they knew it."
good,"I enjoyed what and did and loved the associates i worked with, The constant pressure from above management sometimes made the job/days less enjoyable."
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. The management was great and the scheduling was flexible as long as you stuck to your availability and communicated any changes in advance. The employees created a good work environment and were willing to help each other out when needed. That being said, the compensation you earn for your job is really poor. Don't expect to earn much over minimum wage. Great first job but not a long-term job."
good,"Great management, great people, we’re like a family! Plenty of opportunities for advancement. Fast paced work environment, with flexible hours."
good,It could be better.. the pay is most likely for people that is just looking for pocket change. If you’re not working during the holidays don’t expect that many hours a week . Less than 20 to be specific
good,"It was a great experience working at Kohl's. I learned a lot about the retail market. I had flexible shifts. Friendly environment.Short breaks."
good,"Kohls favors consultants over full time associates, unless you are management.   I find work there very uninteresting.  Since the main business is retail, IT is second class. Good for  2-year engagement, then get out as fast as you can."
good,"Management was very good at communicating. Coworkers were nice. Required breaks.easy job for the most part. No very strict rules, very small dress code."
good,"It was fun working there, but not enough hours, and shifts are not set, you could work any shift, the discount the employee's receive is awesome, the store manager was easy to work for"
good,for the time being at Kohl I'm  glad it taught me a lot in retailing and such . the things i didn't like how there was so much you'd do  just to get paid so little and i just thought it wasn't fair.
good,"Working in the warehouse unloading trucks with a forklift, material handler.  I drove hour to work so the average pay became a little inconvenient.  Good coworkers"
good,With this job I continued to work with customers but this was mainly a stocking job in which I folded and organized the clothes sections. The hardest part of the job was the amount of messed that were made but you were able to organize sections at your own pace as long as you did not slack off.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This location is a good place to work as a part-time, secondary income. Hours as VERY weak.  Everyone is not on the same page.  Employees hours are guaranteed based on quilifying customer credit apps."
good,"Great Job for teenagers, very face paced, no time to be bored, great team member, i loved being apart of the team, great discounts. The clothes are to die for"
good,"Fun place to work with great people.  But the starting pay is all the same, experience or not!  Annual pay raise at best is .25.  Not a lot of chance for advancement.  And you are required to push their credit cards on customers."
good,"was a fun experience, it all depends who you work with. management was great, coworkers were mostly burnt out. fast paced, you learn on your own. its a great temporary job, with a decent discount."
good,I got the chance to learn many things at khols but i also learned that everyone was out for thereselves. But they were willing to teach what you wanted to do.
good,"Was a great place to work, my manager was an excellent woman with a wonderful personality and positive attitude. Made my work experience great even when I had negative customers."
good,If you are looking for a part time job while in school this is the place for you. The dress code is more relaxed than the previous fast food jobs that I had. My managers were really considerate when I had family emergencies with call outs. You will be working with a lot of people and make a lot of friends. If you are a high school or college student looking for a part time job I highly recommend Kohls. During holiday season expect to get a lot of hours compared to the summer/ spring months.
good,"You were forced to hire a 150 employees.  This left many people with 4 hours a week. Tried speaking with my district manager and"
good,My job consisted of changing signage of sales and prices. I would scan an article of clothing or merchandise using a scanner and select the next week's sales tags to be printed. I would than  go in the back of store grab the appropriate signs after grabbing the printed sales signs from the workroom printer. Then I would go replace the price tags and put up tomorrows or next weeks sales signs in order of date.
good,Kohls has a very inciting enviorment. The managers were always very nice and a bunch of times they would buy food for us. The hardest part of the job was the 8 hour shift days. Where I would stand at my cashier for 8 hours and turn into auto pilot.
good,Working at khols is kind of confusing we come into work not knowing if there will be anything to do so alot of vto is offered. Management is kind of poor and its very slow paced.
good,This job gives you the opportunity to make many friends and get to be involved in a diverse company. The leadership is very strong and you are held to a high standard.
good,"I was sorting, organizing clothes at intimate department. I was part time. I quit because I took the job full time at Nesco Company. It was a good experience because the job was related to my sewing experiences."
good,"There was some opportunity for advancement. i was a warehouse associate with no experience and they trained me in all depts during peak, which allowed me to stay on board."
good,"A typical day ends up just being merchandising the sales floor, running up to do P.O.S. when it's requested on the P.A. system. "
good,"Its a ok place to work, there is a good work life balance. You get great discounts. They teach you great customer service skills. Its a well rounded company"
good,"worked in Men's department setting fixtures, running up to register if needed, answering phones, helping customers on floor, picking orders for customers and packaging up merchandise.  I started off on truck and moved up to men's supervisor.  Learning to help customers find merchandise, finding orders with blue bird or RF.  Manager liked to give you 20 things to do at once but I handled it.  Love the people, still hang out with many of them.  Hardest part of job trying to get everything done and boy did I try.  Most enjoyable part was helping people find things.  Loved to see their faces once we did find what they needed. I was one of the best finding products for customers being sent out.  Co workers would always come to me for help. I tried my hardest to locate items for that customer and when I did made me feel good and the customer."
good,I worked in the backroom so I worked early and strenuously. There were instances where I was working by myself but I had decent managers that did their best.
good,"Friendly managers and customers, regular employee luncheons,  student scholarship. This job Seems like it  is for army wives, not very steady hours. The women here are very cheerful and happy with small shifts"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Although working as a cashier/ department associate may seem easy, it was not. You had to constantly jump around and be ready to hop on a register and help out if a cashier was needed."
good,"can be fun but often stressful, fast paced, normally understaffed, management has unrealistic expectations for being so understaffed but the employees are still relatively friendly"
good,"I didn't really learn too much from this job. I believe that, there wasn't  any room for growth within this job. Also not enough floor coverage. Everyone was really nice and friendly."
good,"The only redeemable thing about working at Kohl's, at least at the location I worked at, were the co-workers and decent managers. Being a shirt folder/Sales Associate is dull, dull work. You do the same exact thing every day, folding and hanging shirts and slacks and cleaning up the mess left by the customers."
good,I used to like working there but your hours get cut whether they don't like you or if you're a slacker and use it as a form of retaliation poor managing
good,What you would expect from a retail job. Not the best pay but the work isn't to terrible either. Management is decent when i worked there. There is opportunity to advance if you work hard but this isn't necessarily a career job.
good,"Work life balance was phenomenal."
good,"Well I indeed was inspired and empowered to live a fulfilled life, by getting out of Dodge! Sure, it helped me gain a view of things, I learned a bit about me there but gave up a ton doing it."
good,Kohls is a sales job. On a daily basis you process customer transactions and up sell products . It was a good job because I got to learn how to communicate well with customers.
good,Some managers were friendly but it seemed they were not always on the same page. Great coworkers to work with. Managers will give recognition when one is doing a good job.
good,"A typical day at khol's was unloading trucks, merchandising and then cleaning up. The hardest part of the job is the continuous motion. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is simple to learn."
good,"Is a great company overall with great effort shown by management and their appreciation for their associates whenever possible, while also managing challenging situations per business needs."
good,Fun energetic place to be at. Good pay and hours. Downside its very hard to get a longterm position. Great Job but do not stop looking for employment.
good,Kohl's is a nice place to work your allowed to listen to music while you work the pay is good and everyone works as a team to to provide  high quality customer service.
good,Employees are like family. Everyone helps one another and aids in giving the customer a great experience. Flexible hours and a friendly management team make this a good place to work.
good,"A typical day includes being on a weekly schudule i which if I was not scheduled to work, then there would be no LP. The store was routinely aware of theft but did nothing to prevent this. I implimented several programs that reduced shrink and theft significantly. The hardest part of the job was shoplifting teams and also kohls policies and procedures. I enjoyed the job as the pay was good and I led the district in apprehensions and court appearences."
good,"I personally love retail, so I really liked this job. The management was very fair to me about hours, but I know that is not always the case. I hated the fitting room mess.....!"
good,"Kohl's expects you to do much more for less. They pay minimum wage in most locations while their competitors all pay at least $9 an hour. Feet will start to cramp from standing stationary at a register and they will not allow you to sit because it looks ""unprofessional""."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees. They were pretty friendly and helpful
good,I worked during the holiday season and it was very busy! I learned how to memorize brands and move quickly to have customers in and out smoothly. The hardest part was the fast paced environment but it kept you busy and focused. The issues I constantly had with this job was that my manager didn't respect my school schedule- she had me on schedule to work on the day of my final when I had given almost 2 weeks notice in advance. It was a constant pain.
good,Honestly Kohls was a great place when I started but then I started to see all the cracks. Some of the managers were extremely disrespectful towards some employees and quite a few even bad mouthed customers on the floor. There was lots of dramas between female employees and overall it was not a peaceful work environment. I didn't like being lied to about my job position and being pushed around all the time. There is never enough hours offered. My suggestion is to only work at Kohls if you really only need a part time job. Don't get close to employees.
good,My department met before every shift to discuss our work from the night before and to tell us our goal for the night of. I had the chance to work in different departments to better my knowledge. I believe I handled my 12hr shifts very well. I enjoyed the appreciation from management.
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I learned to always have integrity and to stay on top of my work. The hardest part was cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable part about it was helping the customers.
good,Night times are stressful but working during the day was fun. Not many customers and very staffed unlike at night when you had to close with just yourself
good,A typical day in the retail work place is always interesting. Its busy and keeps you on your toes.  The management team is understandable and works around your schedule.
good,"Loving co workers"
good,"Kohl's was a fun work place environment where I met every customers needs. I would work in the customer service area. Returns and exchanges on items, kohl s cash when a purchase was made. Ordering items for customers through other Kohl's stores. Answering phone calls, making sure the till of the cash register was correct. Cleaning my area. Helping other co-workers with markdowns on sales and clearance items. Overall a good experience."
good,"I manage the operations of the workforce ensure that all employees strive to surpass company standards and objectives. I'm very proud of the safety culture I help create. Through hold associates accountable by coaching and counseling, I help infuse the best practices and procedures. I enjoy the family oriented environment, theirs an open door policy and associates feel comfortable in sharing. The job is not hard at all, but communication between management could be better. One thing I really enjoy is engaging with the associates, helping them develop and grow is rewarding and beneficial for all."
good,I did not like the store manager at the store that I worked at. He played favorites with the employees. Also the stock room in the back was not keep closed and unobstructed.
good,Great working environment. Nice people. Good benefits. For the most part its a well put together environment. Friendly customers that love Kohls as well.
good,THe second manager that took over after the store first opened it's doors wasn't nice nor approachable. There was balance in my life from work.
good,Management listens to you and they have an open door to talk to all of them. I learned a new position and I have gained a lot of knowledge in this new position.I enjoy working there.
good,Great environment. Love the people I work with. Minimal hours with the exception during the holidays. Team work is very important.
good,"purchases"
good,A typical day at work included keeping a sales floor clean and soliciting credit cards to customers. I learned how to master a point of sale. The management was adequate and didn't provide employees with the right knowledge to best assist the costumers. They also pushed the credit to far. I believe that you should always strive to meet goals but I do not believe that you should solicit to all of your employees and constantly pester them to apply for a credit card. The hardest part of the job was not being informed about new sales and promotions ahead of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the laid back atmosphere that was the right mix of fun and work.
good,"It was ok I never work in a store so it was a great experience "
good,Not enough volume at times. But over all the incentives make it work while if you don't working.Plenty of ladies for the guys to look at.And plenty of guys for the ladies to look at.
good,"Just unorganized need help with their management , & work place. Things and people need to get in order . They need to treat people how they need and want to be treated. I love working there and I love what I do there. They also need to focus on the company and the individual and how that person can benefit the job"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work consisted of mostly recovery in every department of the store. I learned how to multi-task and to work under pressure. This job worked in a very competitive environment that pushed credit. Everyone had a specific task that was assigned to them and worked in their own departments. We all knew what was expected of us. The hardest part of this job was pushing credit. The most enjoyable part of this job was staying busy.
good,I really did en joy my time working at Khols. But when someone says that they do under stand family first and then when my grandfather was dying and it was taken its toll on me. I still had to hear about the store and me calling off. So either you are family oriented or it is only business.
good,Company provides benefits and paid time off and cares about the employees. Kohl's participates in community volunteer work
good,"It was a good job but the staff was drab, no one really had fun. Not the place for younger people it seemed, the staff was all at least 5 years older than me."
good,Love the company but the pay is terrible for a lp job. But it's very competitive and you need great numbers or you'll be put on a performance write up and if your numbers still suck they'll fire you. Upland PD was amazing to work with and probably one of my favorite parts of the job that I'll miss. I loved my store team and working with my sup. But the pay isn't enough when you deal with crazy people and dangerous situations and you're not a LEO.🙄
good,The other employees and the work environment were great.. Made going to work each day and dealing with the daily retail setting a lot easier.
good,Kohl's has an interesting culture in the retail market and is providing enough change in it's strategy to stay amongst the top retailers in the country.
good,It was a good place to work to go to school and balance everything out but the hours was never great.  The scheduling was always random too so you never really had a set schedule.
good,"Great service "
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's in high school. The team I worked with was always positive and friendly. I started the day off cleaning my register and organizing the area around my register. I learned how to encourage customers to sign up for the Kohl's Card and the Kohl's Reward Card. The hardest part of the job was getting hours based of off how many people you had apply for a Kohl's Card.
good,"A typical day of work starts at the crack of dawn, before shoppers are even allowed into the store. First, I must rally the associates, provide insight on marketing techniques, and open the store for business. Through my time as a Manager at "
good,"Good starting job, employees treated very well, flexible hours, no benefits, VERY limited full time positions, inconsistent hours, positive work place"
good,To be honest working at kohl's is great but lack of hours. little hours is given. not enough people on the sale floor. kohl's is not flexible with scheduling people to work. availability to work always a problem with managers.
good,fun fast place environment. kohl's also adds value and customer enrichment. kohl's has the knowledge to manage high volume work in sales and clerical oriented environment. Well organized skill and competitive knowledge.
good,Senior Leadership is trying to find a balance between eCommerce and brick / mortar and is struggling to find it.  They are currently seeing double digit drops in foot traffic and are restructuring and laying off while they retool.
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff, they're great people."
good,Overall a decent job with plenty of room for growth and advancement. Very clean and friendly environment as well as good management.
good,I would start my day by checking my email and touch base with my co workers and see what tasks they were doing and I would help them first that and start working on freight. Hardest part of the job would be making sure some of the associates were doing there job. Most enjoyable was working in the back on the receiving dock
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers after resolving a very escalated issue for them. Each day was different but enjoyable!
good,"Overall Kohl's is a great place to work. The managers care about their employees, and will try to resolve any conflicts that they are made aware of. However, hours fluctuate wildly and coupled with the subpar pay you probably won't make Kohl's a career."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's for a sales associate will include the following tasks:"
good,Overnights stocking and truck unloading was one of the best jobs I've ever had!  It was so laid back.  Everyone had fun but still got their work done.
good,The job was fast paced especially during the peak season. A typical day at work consisted on onboarding several hundred candidates in the Applicant Tracking System. The management staff was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing jobs for applicants. I loved most my co-workers. We always worked as team.
good,Do more with less which is typical of retail. No work/life balance although they claim to be all about family. Managers are required to run both a retail store and a fulfillment center out of a building designed to be only a retail store.
good,A decent place to work and good people to work with. I for the most part enjoyed my time there and made good relationships with my coworkers. All in all I would give my time there a 7 out of 10 if I had to rate it.
good,It is a supportive Management team. The Store Manager is very well trained. They never push like other companies. It is like a family environment. The coworkers work hard everyday to make sales goals. Closing shifts are always done correctly. There isn't really a hard part of the job. Working retail is fairly easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. The different kinds of people that come make Kohls great.
good,"I worked here for 2 years its a great place to work yes! Would I recommend working there sure. With all the discounts on the merchandise how could you not? I did like working at kohls I mean it was fun with the food they provided on the weekends for special events/promotions, and the fun games we would play to get the staff motivated to get do better at work. Although I will say that it could be better on the management side of things, the distance between Management and associates are so far spaced that sometimes we all don't see eye to eye. As well as the Management team should work better with each other since usually there is two mangers on at one shift they should communicate more on how to improve efficiency, if that happened then the associates would feel as if we weren't doing all the brute work or to not have a huge confusion. Thats the only down side,but was not the reason why I left. The reason why I left was due to the wages and hours not being enough to provide for standard living."
good,"Coworkers weren't the brightest, but they also didn't have higher education. Tasks which were delighted were often times in conflict with what another supervisor would express to focus on."
good,A great store to work with because the management team really comes together to help each other out. The most enjoyable part is catching a shoplifter stealing and also apprehending them with the help of my staff.
good,"Great place to shop and work. When there are sales going on they will price match if you have the ad. They have a saying at this store ""yes we can"" They try to stick to it."
good,"A typical day is providing excellent customer service, driving credit and teaching and developing associates."
good,a day at work i can be in many different departments. it can bea really busy or slow but ill keep myself busy. i work truck and customer service and shoes
good,Management at Kohl's is very stressful and there is absolutely no work life balance. If you are a work-a-holic it is a perfect job. However it does have it's perks. Kohl's does a lot of volunteering events and gives a lot back to their community.
good,A typical day at work is hectic and you don't get much help or support on the floor. My co-workers are out-going and easy to get along with.
good,"Loading and unloading the trucks to replenish stock every time the trucks came in. hanging clothes up, folding clothes, and putting clothes on display. I met some really good people and are still friends with some of them."
good,"For the most part, I did enjoy my time working for the Kohl's Distribution Center. I had the opportunity to learn how to operate and function in a warehouse environment, as well as how to work as a team and an individual. The job is very physical, and it's not for one who is afraid of physical labor, but the work day goes pretty quick, as 95% of the time, there is something for everybody to do. The hardest part of my day was waking up at 4 AM to be there by 5:30 AM. The days are 10 hour days, which take up a lot of time, but it is a good balance between working and weekends. You have three day weekends most of the time, and that helps with extra time off and resting up for the week ahead. My favorite part of the job was the people involved in my everyday job at Kohls. The environment your peers create there is great. It is an overall decent place to work."
good,"Currently have 5 day work weeks. 45 Hours per week. "
good,"Great place to work if you are a student, Great people to work with, and a good store to shop at. Get to meet a lot of amazing people working at the cash register."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Processed cash and credit card transactions and store credit card applications"
good,"I worked in picking, selecting, palletizing and storing goods in warehouse also I have excellent communication skills that allowed me to work independently or part of a team and follow standardized work instructions."
good,"A typical day at work for me is spending 8 hours on the register ringing people out.  I have learned that you must have extreme patience working in retail.  My coworkers are great and fun to be around.  The hardest part of my job is keeping unsatisfied customers happy.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the employee discounts that we receive, and that it is like a family and everyone gets along."
good,It was an really large Warehouse and the most I liked about the job because as you working you working with your music and the work was really easy. I had made top performance 3 times and they highly award you.
good,"Kohl's is an excellent company. A typical day at work involves time management, educating associates, creating and maintaining schedules, and doing store walks to improve store operations. I have learned many things, such as shortage implications in retail, as well as managing and coaching people. I have managed up to my boss and managed my peers, as well as my own team. Management at Kohl's is dependent on each building."
good,"A typical day at work seemed long and kind of dreadful after a while. I learned how to operate on different computer systems and different work equipment. My managers were what made my job easier everyday. They understand, or try their best to understand, about your life at home. The hardest part of my job was everyone's attitude about working there because of the long hours. What I enjoyed about my job the most was being able to lift everyone up and being paid weekly."
good,"Hired for seasonal part time for the holidays only.  I took this job because jobs are hard to find in Maryland and this was available immediately. "
good,Product Developer for one of the contemporary RTW private label brands. Worked there for roughly 4years and learned a lot from the experience.
good,"The intense work regime and the low wage make this job difficult. The change in work load is fun and the discounts are nice so I give Kohls a medium rating. They also lead me to believe I may work there permanently, but I found out recently that I never had a chance to be permanent due to the position they trained me on. This company or the managers in it are strictly business and do not back up their word but merely fill a need."
good,Management is lacking. They act more like high school kids then actual business people. They pick favorites and mistreat the rest of their workers. They change the schedule last minute and expect you to be ok with it. They don't even tell you it changed you have to check it every day. I enjoyed working with customers. I hated dealing with the people I actually had to work with. No one did things the way the company wanted it done so when you are on your own doing it the right way it gets tiresome.
good,During my time working with Kohls Corperation I was able to gain the professional experience required to expand my skillset. Combining web and graphic design I interacted and applied changes to the Kohls.com web page. My experience was both demanding and rewarding.
good,Making sure customer know that I am available to assist them and any product the store carried. Having a positive attitude outlook makes you seem more approachable. There really is only one thing that I would want to change in this work place that is the manager because he didn't treat every employee equally and was concerned about financial productive over all. Many of my co-workers had shared my feelings towards the management and they were nice to work with. And we agree on being responsible for  managing how your productivity time was spent was the best part of this job.
good,it was a fun productive place that's was crazy at times due to the high volume of freight that was unloaded an shipped out
good,"Great people to work with, friendly and personable"
good,different people I helped and interacted with on a everyday basis they co workers were all like family TEAM WORK
good,During the work day it was very fast paced unloading merchandise to be stocked. While the music played my coworkers and I worked at a steady and productive pace. The easiest part of the day was when the truck was unloaded and everything was stocked. The hardest part of the day was finding out who I would have to work with in the sense of who was or was not at work that day.
good,"I was starting college at the time that I was working there, so even though I wasn't given a lot of hours (except for the busy seasons like Christmas), I had more time to study and do homework. When I moved, I did the transferring process correctly, but they didn't really keep up with the paperwork, so I was left two weeks without work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great company. Lots of perks including employee discounts.
good,I have learned a lot about facilities and general operations concepts in running an EFC and a DC.
good,"I would recommend this job to someone who is in school and can only work part time and lives at home with their family. They are very flexible with scheduling. If you are older and need this job as a means of income for your family I would not recommend, the main complaint that all my coworkers had were the lack of hours and pay. They hire many people and they have their busy AND slow seasons. The only people that seem to get good hours are the managers and supervisors. Other than that the managers are very motivated, and coworkers were great."
good,"Assisting customers, enjoy working with your coworkers and your mangers."
good,"Working at this company has taught me a lot about different things like Sales and Costumer. I appreciate all these months I spent there and It's been fun, l really liked my job but I had to leave."
good,I enjoy working the the early morning hours as a freight associate.
good,already did.. so im not gonna go into this summary again. i wouldnt recommend choosing kohls as an employer
good,"Was a typical retail environment. Was able to have home and work schedule as needed, for being a part time job."
good,"Responsible for unpacking store merchandise from truck to"
good,"This job included goals for credit apps and rewards enrollment. "
good,"I clock-in, say ""hello"" to everyone I see, get to my appointed place and greet customers and scan their items. When I would leave my spot, I would clean it off before the next person comes. Working at Kohls is a great job but I couldn't keep asking the customers if they wanted a Kohls card and they have already told me ""NO""."
good,At first it was a good job for a student. Never get certain holidays off. Hours aren't really good. (meaning open to close) Let customers get away with to much.
good,"Strong emphasis on ""team effort"" which usually was beneficial, but often was detrimental. Not a good environment for someone who prefers to work alone and doesn't believe in solicitation."
good,"Kohl's definitely has many smart and experienced people who work there, but the majority get lost in the corporate politics. Very laid back atmosphere, but don't forget that it's still corporate and has a very rigid structure that rarely accepts change."
good,at least you knew when the good sales were and it came in handy when using your discount.
good,A fun work environment that let me balance work and school. I would stock merchandise from the backroom out onto the floor with the help of co-workers. Management gave me guidance on how to do my work properly and more efficiently.
good,"Great place to work just with a poor work/life balance"
good,Kohl's had an excellent staff who cares about customers and employees. Training was somewhat limited to POS and it was difficult to obtain 25 hours or more a week. I learned how to deal with difficult customers and provide excellent customer service. I frequently obtained new store credit accounts. I had to the chance to volunteer for projects through Kohl's Cares which includes activites like Bowling with Big Brother Big Sisters and assisting with A kid Again day at King's Island.
good,"At Kohl's, I am able to learn a wide variety of jobs in the store. I have learned how to operate POS systems as well a supervisor, work nearly virtually all departments in the store, and have even learned some management tasks such as closing down registers, cash counts, and team management. My management enjoys my strong work ethic and have allowed me to gain the retail work experience I have today. The one thing I would change is that there is not much room for advancement. After five years of retail experience and applying for every position available, I have not been able to make any movement to a higher position."
good,Typically seasonal retail job. Management not always available. Hours whenever never the same each week.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Monitored Unix servers for errors. My co-workers were hard working and easy to get along with. NCR management knew what they were doing
good,i only worked there for a couple months because i was seasonal but during that time i was a cashier and help put the store back together after a holiday season. my managers were nice.
good,great place to work great team work with co workers the most enjoyable par of the job was working with my co worker there where no hard parts  I learned more about teamwork and new skills
good,It was a busy place to work at and a nice place to be as well helping different customer wit there needs 
good,"Young corporate culture, with high expectations.  Typical work week was 55+ hours.  Management empowered employees to make decisions."
good,"I learned a lot about myself at Kohl's.  As I grew into the workplace and advanced positions and responsibilities, I flourished into a leader. I became outspoken and a better decision maker.  I learned how to deal with difficult co-workers and customers.  I can now turn angry customers into happy ones. I can earn the respect of the people around me because I respect myself and my own work ethic.  Kohl's has helped me learn how to multitask on a daily basis--new co-workers seeking my help for answers, while I'm working separately on projects and focusing on meeting company standards, and at the same time being fully aware of the customers and making them my first priority. Multitasking is probably the hardest part of the job, but being able to develop great efficiency and quality work makes it very enjoyable."
good,"If you love retail, sales,  and value. Great place to work. Many benefits and co-workers are great."
good,seeking part time this is a good place to start. flexible hours 
good,I have enjoyed working for Kohl's. They have allowed me to move up within the company and taught me how to be a stronger leader. They have also taught me how to effectively manage people. 
good,"Flexible hours, but lack of compensation. Short staff on busy weekends and not enough hours per week. "
good,"I woked 4 to 8 hrs a day. I worked pos register, help depatments with filling in merchandise and keeping departments clean. It all times help the custumers with any problems they have. Management works with you, and help when can. All co-workers works together to get the job done. The hole job is enjoyable."
good,Kohl's has excellent understanding that families come first but the salary...
good,"A typical day at work at Kohl's for me would be checking out customers at the registers. I've learned that I am a very patient POS associate.Management at the Kohl's I'm located at is fantastic!! They always brighten my day when I come in for work, co-workers included. The hardest part of working at Kohl's would probably be soliciting credit and the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be having the opportunity to connect with Kohl's customers on an everyday basis!"
good,I unload freight than mechandise it onto the sales floor. The work enviorment is great and fun. Everyone gets alone and enjoy working with each other.
good,"Kohl's was ok to work for, I didn't have a problem with the company itself, though I didn't always agree with management actions. Working in the clothing departments was something I found disheartening, you work for hours to clear a fitting room and the rack just to go back an hour later and it's like you were never even there. However, after I transferred to the home department and worked with boxes instead of hangars, I enjoyed my job much more."
good,I was unemployed for almost a year so I was lucky to be hired at Kohl's and keep the job for a year and a half. It gets hectic during the holiday season and whenever there is a sale but when there isn't the hours are very scarce. Getting one or two days a week is not enough for someone to live off of at all. I think this a good job for someone who wants to get their foot in the door. Not a career. Overall the money I saved from working here helped me get back into college so its not all bad.
good,Overall a good place to work. They really work with your work/life balance as well as always worked with my school schedule while I was still in college
good,"kohl's is a comfortable work environment, the associates are very helpful and friendly. Work keeps you busy, so time passes by pretty fast. You learn patience dealing with the general public. and i would say thats the hardest part of the job. but i personally enjoy helping people, so i have fun helping customers find oufits for themselves or others."
good,"ok workplace, the schedule is good but the benefits arnt competitive with other companies and have got worse this year. The vacation buy program is good"
good,"I would start my shift by seeing if there is any daily plans needed to be done. If not, help customer's with concerns or service. I would provide assistance to other departments if needed. I learn that we keep a good inventory of shoes. The management I find in this environment are very helpful and understanding if work can't be done. Co-workers are friendly and approachable in helping teacher in a team manner. Sometime, in crucial circumstances I find some jobs just can't be done alone but with the collaboration of another co worker. The best thing about this kind of job is that it can boost your confidence competitively and positively."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"good company to work for, job advancement is bad if you dont have a collage degree you cant be a manager they have no retail experience or common sense to deal with different issues"
good,"After a couple days of training, I was put on the floor and expected to know everything. The work itself is not too demanding, helping customers is enjoyable... but expectations from management are too high for such short hours. Management, depending on the person, could be very demanding and easily aggravated, or demanding but still appreciative. I was never quite clear on work-flow and wasn't comfortable working on my own even after a month, mainly because management never gave a list of specific jobs."
good,"Overnight freight associates like myself are typically responsible for preparing the dock area for subsequent freight processing, as well as recovering the dock at the end of the night. The entire process does take a full 8 hours and we often do not move quickly enough as a whole to accomplish our goals in the prescribed amount of time. Co-workers are friendly people, for the most part, as long as the stress of the job does not get in the way. In this line of work, the most fun one can have probably comes from trying to hurl empty cardboard boxes into the compactor. What is most frustrating must be the standards which we are expected to maintain given the limits of physical building space and time allowed to accomplish a task. Personally, I believe that management simply cracks the whip, often without knowing exactly what it is they are asking their employees to do."
good,Scheduling could be difficult since you didn't know your schedule very far in advance.
good,it has its busy and slow times
good,great for advancemnt.people orieented job. annual pay raises are very minimal.small schedule availability
good,work is good
good,"A typical day at Kohls was hectic i worked mostly in the misses fitting room. and it would be just kaotic. And, i worked the afternoon to closing shift and, at night some nights got out of work past 12 am and was not a holiday. I learned to do inventory, and markdowns there. My co-workers were great and most stuck together and worked as a team. Management were un organized and some where unprofessional. Just did not work hard enough to make there employees happy in the work environment and we worked hard keeping the store running, and clean. The hardest part of the job was putting away the clothes that were in customer service, the fitting room, folding tables, and trying to keep things running and organized while the customers just throw everything all over the place. The most part enjoyable part was meeting new people, and excelling in Customer Service and being recognized for my hard work that customers gave me."
good,"Working at Kohl's taught me people skills. It really drew me out of my shell. I now work in Customer Service, which sometimes means that I have to deal with very unhappy customers. If I can help them to walk away with a smile, then I know I have done my job."
good,job has been eliminated by digital advertisements for sales purposes. Your job was to reprint signs for upcoming advertisements and switch out old signs when they had a sale.
good,"Once arriving I find out what kind of sale is being applied to the following day. I am then assigned several sections in which I scan each type of merchandise within those sections. If noted, I leave the sale sign up, take it down and replace if needed. If there is an error in the system that will not display a pre-made sign for a product, I will use templates in Microsoft Excel to create a custom sign for the product."
good,It was a good place to work. A typical day at work was never boring there was always some thing to do or going on. Management was nice but they would rarely come on the floor. The hardest part of my job was having some nasty customers calling you names. The most enjoyable part of my job was my job and my co-workers.
good,"This company will help you manage your personal life, as long as your manager follows the work/life balance ways."
good,Compensation is extremely low for the work that is expected.
good,Does not give there employess chance to grow within the store. Does not pay enough should be paid bi-weekly.
good,"This store has its pros and cons. Overall, not a bad place to work for."
good,"Any day at Kohls is great. I've learned how to properly run and organize a cash register. The hardest part of the job is gaining credits. Our hours are based on the number of credits we gain on a work day. The most enjoyable part of working at kohls are my customers. I enjoy talking and helping them with anything they need. the managers are reliable, fair and understanding. i enjoy working for Kohls."
good,Kohl's Department store has great fashion clothing for all ages. It is also a team work environment.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Good place to work, very helpful staff. I typically worked in the warehouse preparing clothing and other merchandise to be place out on the floor. Nothing about this job was challenging or hard. The most enjoyable part of this job was how fair the hours i worked were."
good,Was payed minimum wage/ was employed there on two occassions and wasnt hired the third time when applied.
good,The pay and hours are not the best.. crazy hours and  pay scale is well below the standards. Benefits are not the best . Associates are payed well below the  minimum wage.
good,"I found it to be a good workplace for seasonal employment. "
good,This job really brought me out of my comfort zone and helped with my social skills. It helped me learn how to easily talk to people and have great social skills.
good,Was a fun decent place to work. They work around schedules and give extra hours if you ask during the season. that being said when I got hired I was told they always kept a lot of seasonal employees and was even told they'd keep me after the season only to be let go and find out they kept one employee.
good,Overall retail can be frustrating but working with kohls was over all fun. Being able to help shoppers and your colleagues out on the floors. They give you many opportunities to grow within the company. They evaluate you pretty often their for they are strict on attention.
good,"The position I was hired for was a seasonal position. I did my training on a computer but didn't shadow anyone on the floor. Instead I did practice on a register before engaging in actual sale transactions with customers. Only worked a week, no shifts were given after that. Management implyed I should've contacted someone earlier than I had about not being scheduled"
good,I received a offer the day I interviewed. It was a 2nd job so the pay was OK to be temporary. The location was 5 minutes from home and that was another bonus. Over all the people were nice. I worked in OMNI and loved it. Packing and shipping out orders. At times I pulled orders for pick up in store. I enjoyed that as well-very time sensitive more times than not. Floor Store Manager and Assistant store Manager were great and very accommodating. Hours for me were perfect. They were very busy for maybe 6 weeks and then it slowed down drastically. Mid November to January is the key for the seasonal. I was offered to stay but the pay is not worth the work expectation. The perks were so nice during the Black Friday event and Christmas event. I saved a lot of money for so many items.
good,"Easy retail job, just seems like the days can drag on sometimes, but friendly co-worker. They also have holiday pay for days, like Thanksgiving and Black Friday."
good,"When I work at kohl’s, I mostly enjoy my work, however for all we do and how much we contribute  to sales and customer service, we are not payed enough. Even people who have been working for years and are supervising entire departments full time are only making 1-2 dollars above minimum wage. There is also workplace drama and overall unrealistic expectations for the time we are gives to do things. Would be a great first job or a job for a teenager, but not one to support you."
good,The device for bopis was not set up properly. It would start you out at the stock room; send you off shopping in the store to pickup items then after you delivered them to the drop off point for customer pickup it would send you back to the stock room rather than let you pick up more items to bring back to the stock room to process
good,"It's a good starter job for high school and college students as well as those who are retired. I wouldn't suggest this as a long-term career, unless you're a manager or so. They give you opportunities for promotions and you won't be penalized if you're sick or have an emergency and need to take the day off (can't say this about other employers). The pay isn't that great but then again it is retail. Management is ok, but could be better."
good,Didn't always get a lot of support from management when having a dispute with a customer when trying to follow store policy. Flexible with schedule. Raises were small and infrequent. Hard work was rewarded with better job assignments and cross training into other departments.
good,"My typical day at Kohl's would be to stock shelves, assist in customer service, count registers at the end of the night, and answer questions for customers. The management was okay. I had a good relationship with a few but not all. The workplace culture is very relaxed. The hardest part of the job would be working Black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job would be causing a customer to leave the store happy."
good,Could have been trained a little more.  Overall enjoyed my time as a sales associate at Kohls.  Hours could get crazy sometimes and all over the place.
good,"I worked on sales florr PT for 1 yr, job isn't bad, store manager had favs, good workers seem to get treated poorly while lazy ones get excuses made and praise. Then promoted to Loss Prevention Supervisor..like the job and the district manager. BUT, the  cameras are always down, system always down. All the care about is if u make quota, doesn't matter if ur working hard and doing all of your duties, they only care about meeting shoplifters apprehension quota and will fire u if u don't.  Policy makes it hard to make apps you can do nothing all day as long as u catch shoplifters your good..the other duties like safety Inspections,  audits, etc don't seem to matter for them, they dont seem to care about employees"
good,Upper management tends to look the other way when it comes time for reviews. Score cards are more of a scare tactic than a useful tool. Plus the score card doesn’t reflect the employees real potential and contributions to Kohl’s. It was always a detriment as an employee you felt as it was an obstacle instead of a positive. It has the potential to create a negative attitude/ motivation !!!
good,"This job was one of the best jobs I have ever had when I started.  It was for phone support for company credit card.  Training was poor but it was paid training and the trainers were great. Over four years the job was variable. It was really good, then bad, then good again. The last year was terrible and then they closed our site. Severance was amazing so all in all it was a wash except for the four years of advancement and time lost. They should have closed one of their off shore sites but that is business in the US today."
good,You can definitely learn a lot of transferable skills for hospitality and factory work depending on your position and its roles. You learn as you go type job. My location did expect a lot from its employees in terms of availability.  Most of us were students and people with a primary job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The workplace is really nice as they gave you various deals and discounts and had parties for birthdays and other celebrations. However, the pay was not helpful for my living situation."
good,"It was a good experience, but a lot of workers were dropped after the season, which is normal, but the ones that stayed were majority of family members. People with almost zero experience were chosen over those who put in a lot of hours, and actually trained those individuals. Just know that its going to be hard to get on or stay unless you are family or are really close to someone."
good,"Kohls was an enjoyable place to work depending on the management. Benefits where great, work life balance was also a good thing with a lot of different schedules."
good,It was a cool place to work but the management was very harse. A typical day at work was very decent depending on the truck load of merchandise. Cashiering was the hardest part.
good,"Comfortable environment fast pace sometimes, ok pay. You are required to try promote and sign up as many customers as you can to sign up for Kohl's credit card."
good,Great location. Great department store products and services.Offered great part-time hours. Many perks for customer satisfaction. Great team culture to work with.
good,My time at the distribution center I was set too start off on the assembly line pulling orders and making packages too be sent off. I then was moved around in the building too various locations where I learned different packaging skills each location different from the last.
good,"*made sure area was up to date"
good,"I learned a lot working here, but you are expected to do a lot with very little resources.  As time went on the expectations got higher, and payroll was constantly cut."
good,"Coming in as a minor I didn't know what to expect as this was my first job, but was pleasantly surprised at the warm embrace I received from my associates and the experience I gathered there was really great."
good,The work environment at Kohls is one of the best work environments. There are so many employees that you will have a lot of close friends. Working at Kohls means you get another family.
good,"they basically pay you good if you're a full time/part time employee. they don't care if you have any kind of emergency, if you accumulate four or five occurrences you will be fired."
good,I liked the co workers and enjoyed working there for the most part I didn't think they communicated as well as they could have it became very stressful at times needed more management on duty
good,"Full time positions are hard to come by, but if you get one the benefits are great. Hours are seriously unpredictable if you're P/T. Managers are pretty understanding and encouraging."
good,"If you are looking for a part time job, than this is a good opportunity but if you are looking for a full time job I would look somewhere else as you do not get very many hours unless it is the holidays."
good,"With all the different managers there, each having their own agendas, it makes it hard to accomplish anything because each manager wants their tasks completed yesterday. The benefits are excellent, the pay is good but there comes a time when you ask yourself is all the headache and stress put upon you by management worth it."
good,"I believe this is job is good for people who are just starting to get into the work force, especially high schoolers. Can't work any longer than 3 years in my opinion, slowly the company started not having enough people in their work force, making it harder to keep all departments clean."
good,Title says it all. I have not worked for this company in a long time. The fact that this website is making me review it is a waste of my time. After 3 years I am sure a lot of the cons have changed.
good,Kohls is a good place to work if you like dealing with customers. I just didn't feel like I ever had a say in what I wanted to do while at the job. It is a good job to do while in college and they do try to work around your class schedule as best they can.
good,its a good place for high school students college students and retired persons to work at. management is nice. you can learn a lot etc. etc. etc. ........
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,If you don't do your job right you will not have one for to long.But all and all I do love working there. Because I can move up and I love helping people with their job.
good,"As a Kohl's associate, some of my responsibilities were to clean out the fitting rooms, help customers find items that fit their style, and work at point-of-sale. Some of the management seemed a little like babysitting in that they were checking up on employees more than necessary. I did enjoy getting to merchandise clothing on the sales floor."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's for the most part. Was a little disappointed in some of their lack of understanding when it came to some work and family life balance. The scheduling was hard to maintain a set routine. The pay was hard to get by on.
good,come in to work grab all the go backs that everyone returned; usually no one does them so we get backed up and its horrible. There always understaffed.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, as a retailer, they have a wonderful selection of brand name products including their own. They offer customers significant savings both in regular sales and coupons. Kohl's also offers superior customer service and a no hassle return policy."
good,Kohl s i a great place to work and they are willing to work with you. the environment is great. people willing o help. they promote within. Hardest part are the back to back calls sometimes you feel like you cant get a break.
good,"Most days consist of the same things, but at the same time, every day is different. I do things from unloading stock trucks to watching elderly ladies' carts for them to getting yelled at by customers because I don't know every single product we have in the store. Let's just say, I learned where everything was generally located very quickly. My fellow employees differed, teenagers like me, retired people looking for some extra income and people who have made a career out of working in retail. All the teenagers got along well and enjoyed joking around as well as any free food we could get. I got along with the people older than me, but some people didn't get along like all workplaces. The hardest part for me was showing up for my 8-hour shifts, but when I got there, the hardest part was not reacting poorly when customers angered me. But it was nice to be making money."
good,I am not sure what to say about this place. I mean it was good for a job when you are younger and have some time to kill go work at khols for the summer and your good.
good,"my main job was direct the customers in their preferred section of the store. i kept the clothes folded and looking presentable at all times, and when we got busy i would take on a register to hep get the customers cashed out and on their way home"
good,A typical day at work is coming in and restocking and getting a minimum of customers not that much. You get enough customers to rerack your section. The Hardest part is being switched section to section and customers not cleaning up behind themselves in the dressing room.
good,This is a great place to work if you have the need to keep busy. I enjoyed the level of physical labor and developed stronger merchandising skills. Company is stable.
good,Hasn't lived up to committed promises or expectations. OK if you're looking for a cashier position. Prefer more merchandising; end up primarily cashier and fitting room duties.
good,"they give you very few hours and always start at seasonal with a chance of becoming permit, yes the manger is nice and the break room was nice but the hours and pay was not enough and having to pick up shifts in order to get hours"
good,The job is okay just a little unorganized they have to do better at scheduling and hiring. The Hr department is not in order with the warehouse they don’t have a good communicator
good,"Unless you have a tolerance for people don't bother. Pretty sure I liked my kohls is because the managers cared. Also, you do a lot of the same things over and over like folding jeans. Downtime is way too boring."
good,"A lot of work required for minimal pay. Communication issues among management leads to unhappy associates at times. "
good,"Marketing and Advertising drive a dynamic work environment fueled by reaction to business, evolving strategy, and competitive pressures. The Marketing team lives that reality daily with no two days being the same, and last minute change being a constant. "
good,Cool place to work always busy great with your schedule really flexible great first job always gives you more hours if you need them very very busyyyy
good,"I had a wonderful time working for this company and I wish I didn't have to leave, I did have some issues with one of the managers who worked during a couple of my shifts."
good,Fast paced. Good co-workers. Good management. Enjoyed working with customers. Not for everyone. Some disorganization. Enjoy working with clothes. Overall enjoy working for them.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls is a great family store which provides great discounts to all.  Its a very fast paced work place which needs to focus on simplifying store process.
good,Overall good place to work while in high school or college except during holidays. Meet lots of people from various backgrounds some have made kohls a lifetime career. They were the most helpful for new employees.
good,Nice people to work with. Problem was pay was low and time to come to work at 4:00 am wasn't worth the pay. It's good for college students. Job does give you the opportunity to learn new positions on the job. The discount was the best thing and the people I worked with on the freight team.
good,When I worked at Kohl's our management worked to have all employees be quick and productive. Furthermore we were very friendly with customers and always working to make them happy.
good,Great place to work but limited room for advancement. Profitable compamy....flexible schedule...great training for executives. Great benefits with competitive compensation
good,Always gave them my best and was given certificate to award my hard work. The only problem was changing schedule without notification which lead to issues. Also when they changed direct supervisor issues arose for some reason when work output was the same. It seemed she played favorites made it too stressful.
good,Retail job where you had to work different shifts.  Was cross trained in other departments. I worked part time so the pay wasn't very good and not enough hours.
good,Not long days at the desk. Always had yummy food in the backroom for everyone to take. The hardest part was dealing with the angry people trying to return stuff at the customer service desk/ Bot very few difficult people ever came.
good,"Wait on customers, Bag their merchandise, offer any discounts going on in the store.  Ask the customer if they would like to sign up for the Kohl's Credit Card for more discounts and email.  Use any discounts that are approved by management and allow the guest to use them. Thank all Guests for shopping in the store and also help them with all their shopping needs.. Suggestive sell the items your management team had for you to do the day of your work."
good,"Always busy and something to do. Even if it looks like we don't have a lot of customers, we still have freight or sets we need to work on. Prepare to work and multitask!"
good,"retail can be stressful, but my coworkers and the management always make the job a little more enjoyable. i have learned a lot of professional skills during my time at Kohl's."
good,"Depending on the culture, you have to have effective communication with the people, outside & in the store. My management team were very helpful in regards to translating Spanish-speaking customers and explaining promotions, sales, and other miscellaneous issues. It can be discouraging when a customer did not have good shopping in whatever circumstance. You may not have the perfect answer in a given problem but try to resolve to the best of your abilities. My coworkers were willing to help out whenever needed. Overall, not a bad job to earn a little money."
good,A typical day at Kohl's will be a fast pace environment. You will always be on your feet completing a task or helping a customer. Customer service skills are well needed to deliver excellence.
good,"very fast paced environment, required to obtain credit card accounts required to get alot done in a short amount of hours,have to volunteer you time for  the community ,"
good,I loved working as a receiving associate up until management decided to pick on me saying that I wasn't working up to the company standards. Idk how because I was emptying 1 or 2 trailers a night. If you are going to work for this company be sure to have thick skin.
good,Great for college students or those choosing to work part time. Very few full time positions. Supervisors have a lot of responsibility with lack of time and resources to feel requirements are accurately being accomplished.
good,"A typical work day will vary depending on what projects/assignments are asked for including but not limited to; scheduling, overseeing payroll, monitoring metrics, hiring, terminations, reviews, planning, organizing tasks, and delegating projects. Being a young college graduate thrust in to a management role has taught me a lot about management. These range from preparing a contingency plan to understand that different associates have to be dealt with varying degrees of detail in their follow up. The workplace culture had a large sense of urgency in the office as there are always deadlines to meet in the office, because of this missing work is viewed as completely unacceptable. The hardest part of the job is fixing broken processes or 'putting out fires' once they have occurred. For these situations there is often no one quick fix but rather a systematic issue that must be completely restructured. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the results of a successful project or venture."
good,Kohl's has helped me grow in every aspect!!!! The environment is friendly and welcoming. Mangers give you endless opportunity to grow.  The hardest part of this job is the customer but this helps you learn to control you're emotions in a professional environment
good,"Start work at 9 AM with going over what needs to be done."
good,"Great managers, very hard work and you are required to move fast especially when there is or an upcoming holiday. Pays above minimum wage as friendly workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"loved working with the customers and helping them select items & finding the best deals with coupons.  loved working on the OMNI team picking, packing, & processing orders to ship from store."
good,"awesome work environment, variety of brands and selection for customers as well as employees, chances for advancement and hours were flexible, managers were also helpful and friendly"
good,"As a Sales Floor associate your main focus is making sure that the fitting rooms are cleared out and that you provide great customer service. a typical day is running around putting clothes back, helping customers, and answering phone calls (this job is very fast paced). Working here you gain things like phone adequate, customer service, and the ability to multitask. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone. Management want you to think that they care about but they only really care about reaching the credit goal and customer service score. The only thing I like about working here, is the flexibility. Kohl's is willing to work with your school schedule."
good,"Its like any other retail job. If you show up and do your job you will be fine. Hours vary based on sales. If the company's sales are down, hours get cut. High demand placed on obtaining credit applications."
good,"I made many friends working at Kohls, it was a very fun and relaxed environment, the managers were very nice and open to talk to everyone. The job was very easy to understand."
good,"I am proud to have worked for Kohl’s, and I appreciate the time and patience I was shown in my training since I was there. I learned a lot about team building, dealing with others, and better time management; these skills will serve me well in my career."
good,"friendly staff, quiet location but always things that can be done, flexible hours, on the job learning, great team members, team leaders were great at handling their team"
good,"During the holidays it was very busy and so they were giving a lot of hours. But after that it got very slow and it was super boring. The managers were okay, sometimes felt like they were trying hard to be cool but at least they weren't super mean or anything. They had food and other little things in the break room so that was nice."
good,I learned too work with other team members too reach company goals. A typical day at work would be checking the cash register for  the right amount of change before starting shift. Management was was aware our achievements and gave us praise for them.
good,"Kohl's was a very clean and well organized store. Most of the customers came in happy, and very talkative. The management was very helpful. The coworkers are also very energetic and happy."
good,I loved kohls it was only seasonal. The management was good and they got us working as fast as they could. The environment was amazing as well as the people you worked with were outstanding.
good,"Overall the job was not bad, just mundane. The pay made the long days of standing and organzing the store worth it. Although my job was being a cashier, I often had to complete other tasks to help the store run efficiently. The store is always a mess."
good,"Khols was my 1st experience working in a public place.It was veey unsual when i started but khols an the employees made me fell right at home.They taught me how to be patient with customers, Also taught me about team work"
good,"it was fun and busy. the management was very helpful in training and give you good hours and they work with your availability, whether its morning or night shifts"
good,"They give you really good and consistent hours. However, the people that I worked with were quite rude and the managers were a little crazy with expectations."
good,"I so very much loved working here. (even when I had to deal with mean customers).  If was physical work at times and late hours at times, which I loved.  But it was only part time and they dropped the vacation...had to leave for a full time.  pay was horribly low"
good,"Working with jewelry, this could be everything from setting displays, selling to customers, taking counts, price changing, doing recalls"
good,I loved working at kohls. You get to meet a lot of new people. My managers were pretty decent. Hardest part of the job was trying to sell credits
good,Great environment with great people to work with while looking for PT  hours. If looking for FT hours and a cool energetic atmosphere then this is the place for you.
good,the people you work with are great. the schedules are very flexible especially for college students. i began as a cashier and got paid minimum wage. after i became department supervisor i got a raise and then after i became visual merchandiser i did not get a raise. And their raises are very low.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"So kohls distribution in Monroe Ohio just let me go cause they said I didn't check I work here before. Will that's a lie cause I work there two seasons ago since 2014. Every since they went up on pay they been on some bull****, but this will be my last year apply for seasonal because I know I check I work there but that was a reason they said to let me go during peak week 😢"
good,"Typical day of work is easy stuff. If you like being on your feet all day, its easy. The management are a nice group of people, coworkers all get along pretty well. Most people only work part time or seasonal, but they expect you to treat it like its your full time career. They'll respect the time sheet you fill out most of the time, but they'll give you a hard time about it. Except for on the weekends. they used to schedule me up to 2 hours earlier than i was available. I didnt complain, but i had stuff i was supposed to get stuff done those mornings. and almost every weekend they would do."
good,It was very unorganized at time but i did enjoy my job. we helped people. it gets extremely busy especially during holidays. coworkers were okay. most enjoyable part to me is when i did the store displays.
good,In Good standing it great company to work for they change a lot benefit sent I start there in 2008 part time have benefit but they took away part time health ins. It great store to work for.
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of cleaning out rooms hanging clearance, price changing, doing call backs, repacking things, answering customer phone calls, running register, answering  customer questions in the store, helping or picking online orders and setting new merchandise. I also sometimes will have to train new associates or monitor new associates who need help. I learned a lot about how a store is ran and what it takes to make everything come together, it is definitely not as easy as it looks on the outside it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. The hardest part of the job is trying to do the work of 30 people when you are only one person. the most enjoyable part was setting merchandise and seeing it all come together once you are finished."
good,"very heavy work load and very, very fast pace.  I learned a lot from my store manager. I left because I was burnt out. Payroll for workload is not realistic. I like the fact I was not apart of the schedule on a regular basis. I likes how the payroll was managed, by dollars. I would go back to work for the company."
good,"Essential job that teaches good fundamentals in customer service. Daily store goals included opening a certain amount of store credits, maintaining a clean work environment, and consistent interaction with customers."
good,"There pretty nice when it comes to you calling off and stuff. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of greeting customers and making sure that the store is safe and clean for a great shopping experience. I learned that customer service is a great skill to learn. Management and my coworkers are awesome, they are very productive, good teachers and quick learners. The hardest part of my job is cleaning out more than two fitting rooms. However, the best part is helping customers find outfits that suit them."
good,Great job but during regular season there is work no available. Love Peak season! Plenty of work during peak season but when peak season is over then suddenly there is no work at all which means VTO.
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work with. A typical day would just be checking and keeping your department nice and clean, checking and assisting out the customers. The hardest part of the job would definitely be not able to finish all the task due to the short staff. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to help out the customers, helping with their needs, and being able to represent a great company."
good,"Kohls have a good environment but low hours. Management is pretty good, but the job is really boring. meeting new people is the most exciting thing about this job"
good,"always had a very flexible schedule, everyone for the most part was nice, good employee discounts, fun work environment for anyone."
good,Kohl's was interesting job and if I could have stayed  But overall management was amazing the calls were pretty straight forward. Downside system crashes.
good,"Love working retail and the experience of working at Kohls has help develop me. They have a different way of doing price changes and how they schedule associates, even though it works for the company, they could be more productive if the scheduled and assigned positions more according to the needs of the customer and each department."
good,I like the fact we didn't have to really interact with others we could listen to music to help time fly for those long hours.
good,"A typical day at work for my seasonal position as a beauty associate consisted of organizing, providing quality customer service, taking occasional inventory, suggesting products for various customers needs, and keeping the beauty department clean. "
good,"It's a job, but it's very flexible, it's hands on big time and I get a great work out.  They really do care about the employees and the customers.  "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Somewhat flexible with schedule changes. Employees are only scheduled part time therefore, no medical or other benefits offered."
good,I organized the juniors and mens section. I folded the clothes and put it away in the right shelves. I also did cashier and greeted the customers.
good,Great working environment for all the people that work there. Work was good and was Manageable. The pay was good and you have to work hard and it will pay off and also has good Benefits.
good,"start the day off going though security always safety. start up meeting job chores and stretches. find your job cause it changed everyday and get to work, make sure sign out equipment."
good,I loved working for kohls I loved interacting with customer and I love my job position. i worked very hard on keeping my station clean and organized and i loved that the manager never really bothered me unless i ness them to fix a transaction. i loved my potion but can not say the dame about their position in the store i did not like fitting rooms and i really hated having to clean the shoes department.
good,"Working at Kohl's started out great, such as everyone would welcome me on a daily basis. I enjoyed their food. Everyone makes minimum or 10-75 cents above. It was a great for a busy and active person in the community like myself."
good,"A lot to learn in different areas of business and degrees.  Opportunity's for travel and advanced training."
good,"A typical day is usually dictated by the needs of whatever department you are in, what time of the month it is, sales, or corporate visits. It's usually fast paced and the people are friendly to work with. Management can vary. Some can give you the freedom you need while others will micro-manage you. My co-workers and the balance I have between home and work are the best parts of the job."
good,"A  typical day at work I come in about ten minutes early before I start , double check what department I work in and look at my schedule for the next few days , then I get ready to punch in for work and begin putting things away in there place if I am on the floor ,or ask customers if they need help with anything ."
good,A cashiers day was typically scanning and  bagging customer's merchandise.  Also straightening the area around the register.  The management was good.  I got along well with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was getting people to apply for a Kohl's charge.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers about their purchases and making sure they were getting the correct price.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with. I loved that they were understanding and they all loved what they did. The staff at Kohls helped me break out of my shell and make friends. My maid of honor is a co-worker I met at Kohls. The hardest part of the job would be a tie between standing long periods of time or getting people to sign up for Kohls cards. I loved most of my managers, some of them were goofy and silly like me and some seemed to be out to get me."
good,"Working for Khols was not such a good experience. A typical day at work for khols was very busy for me becaquse I was part of the Replenishment team. Working for replenishment i learned how to price change clothes and how to restock items for the store. The store management was good because managers would help the employees anytime. The co-workers were not really good with each other. A lot of problems between the co-workers. "
good,"My personnel experience working at Kohl's I enjoyed my supervisors and my coworkers. It was a fun environment. I was challenged to learn new and different skills often. I was treated with kindness and respect. I worked in the Mens, Misses, and Junior department as a Sales Associate where I assisted customers and put back merchandise from the fitting rooms. I greeted and checked customers out and notified them of our sales. I was able to choose my own schedule which was nice because I was in school at the time. However you are not guaranteed hours, I had to work holidays, and a lot of evenings. I often would get out of work between 10:00 p.m.-1:30 a.m. Again, I enjoy those I work with, however the work itself was not enjoyable."
good,"Kohl's was an exciting place to gather more knowledge about sales and understanding customer interaction, I learned many skills on how to understand the customer and organization of the work place."
good,"Worked early mornings (before store opening) making sure that all sale signs were up & correct. I also was responsible for maintaining & upkeep of all signs, which were electronic. Not only making sure,that they were functioning, but that they were correct (matching up to the displayed merchandise) & were placed correctly. I also was on the price change team, & the truck team."
good,Pulling orders for customers and processing them to be shipped to them by scanning merchandise and making sure they are the correct items. Also had to restock merchandise when they got low or gone. Had to clean our areas and restock or items we use to work with.
good,It was a very fun place to work. It was very busy and I had great co-workers and management
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Typical day at work included signing in, grabbing a walkie-talkie, entering the sales floor, grabbing my 500s from customer service, communicating with my co-workers in my assigned section, organizing the racks of clothes, and keeping the fitting rooms empty and organized. I learned more communication skills, how to work as a team, and gained work experience. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was my second day I worked a section by myself and at the end of the night I had forgotten to empty my fitting rooms and my manager had to help me."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The only thing that made me go was the pay. They would talk about safety but work you like a slave. They would rush you and only one person per trailer.
good,Kohls is fun to work with and the people are nice. there are many issues. its more like a credit card company that sells clothes and they only give the most hours to those that get the most credits. Management is okay but with constant disagreements if I do something one manager told me the other would get mad at me. Sporadic hours gets annoying quick. you can have 36 hours one week then have 10 the next.
good,Mostly loved working at kohls.  Management seemed to really listen and care about issues.  Pay is not great.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was sometimes challenging. Some customers can be very demanding, however those experiences helped me learn how to deal with different types of personalities/views. My co-workers were really helpful in times of need. Management was wonderful. The only stressful part was getting people to sign up for store credit cards, which was a main target for us as employees."
good,Great associates and management with an exception of a few. Very flexible hours. Great core values.
good,"go in find out assignments"
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's. The hours are flexible and the communication between hourly employees and store management is great. The store I work at in particular works around the schedule of it's employees because many have other jobs or are in school. However, the staff support on the weekends is not great. Many call offs and overall not enough people scheduled. The night team is usually stuck with the mess created by the day shift. Which means that we do not leave until a hour after closing. Overall, I enjoy working at Kohl's, but the weekend schedules need to be adjusted to reflect the weekend traffic."
good,"its a good place to work, I like pretty much everything, the sad thing, they only offer part flex. which means just on call."
good,"Great training programs"
good,"It's an okay place to work. Everyone works in a team. A typical day for me would be unloading and loading trucks. 2 30-minute breaks. 10 hours is kinda too long for me though. My feet are terribly sore even before I get off. I tried different shoes and insoles. My first week we worked 8 hours. I really liked it. Now its just a job until I can find something new. If the hours weren't so long, this would be a great place to work."
good,"Kohl's Warehouse is a fun place to work, able to meet new people and get a good knowledge of warehouse duties. The typical day would consist of going to your designated department and staying there working for every 3 hours and then going on two, 20 minute break if you were only working 8 hours. The management was very strict, but for good reason. There would be theft amongst coworkers and products of kohl's. My coworkers were very calm and relaxed, always ready to do their job and go home to their family or where ever they wished. The most enjoyable part of Kohl's would be the hours."
good,Working at Kohl's there was always something to do which was one of the benifits about working retial. You always want to keep busy on the sales floor. Most of the employee's there were great to work with when they werent understaffed. They work really well with scheduling becuase I had just started school when I got the job and they worked around my classes. The pay was terrible for the work they wanted you to do! But they employed all different people from all different background and cultures which made the workplace even better.
good,"some head cashiers and supervisors were more worried about standing around and gossiping, instead of ringing up customers. a lot of drama and tattle taling there. it was very draining and made the work enviroment very unpleasant at times."
good,good place to work. good job if you have a lot of patience to deal with customers all day long as well as actively being on your feet all day.
good,This type of job is okay if you don't have any kids and also an open schedule. If you have smaller children and a working spouse then the hours may become conflicting. The days scheduled to work was fine until they start non-gotiable 12 hour shifts and if you are unable to work the solution will be wait to be terminated or resign.
good,I found a lot of empty promises made while working there. As a man of my word I was very disappointed to see that. I loved meeting new people and having the opportunity to train and lead people as well as the benefits they offered. The hardest part of the job is to not get bored with the monotony of the same work for mandatory 12 hours. Co-Workers were the best part of the job. Managers needed some guidance themselves with Managing and Talking to people to achieve goals and results. It seems as if they wanted their workers to just stay as entry level workers and not advance within the company.
good,"A typical day working for Kohls was always a busy day.  It would include cleaning out fitting rooms, helping customers with questions or finding things, checking them out at registers, and keeping the store neat and tidy. I learned a lot when it comes to merchandising and restocking the floor and having to follow a planogram for new merchandise. Co-workers was the most fun part of the job. Met a lot of great friends working for Kohls, everyone was nice and friendly. Management was nice and fair and helpful when needed. The most enjoyable part was working with different people everyday, and the hardest part was keeping up with fitting rooms and trying to keep it clear for customers."
good,"retail is a very interesting place to work and meet new and exciting people,i believe it is an all- out exciting field to work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Khol's customer service and sales associate position, I enjoyed. A typical day required lots of energy and understanding of customers needs. Khol's has a variety of product for all age and gender. One thing l learned from khols is rather your the manager or working in the surrounding  positions, all a customer wants is your attention and your best intentions to service their needs. You will find me to have the ability to work with people with diverse levels and backgrounds throughout the day. The store presents and variety of product which makes working there fun as well, the hard but more challenging  part in the position is to help position product and marketing strategy. Khol's hires a team of individuals who are ready to service customers and represent its brand."
good,I enjoyed being a POS Associate because I love working with people and helping them.
good,A typical day of work consists of cleaning the department which included folding towels or clothes and returning items that were in the wrong place. Also during a standard day you may have to call other Kohl's stores to find a particular item(s) for a customer. Everyone is also required to learn the register. Some associates work at the register only while others are only at the register in times of need. 
good,A typical day at work would consist of standing at my station. We try to get customers to sign up for our credit card program. I learned how to unload shipment trucks as well as stock the store. The management overall was bad because of power trips and they could not communicate with each other well. I honestly liked the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was unpacking trucks. I liked the employees most though because it was almost like a family.
good,Good with scheduling and the people that worked there were great. Downsides were the pay and it gets kind of boring when there is nobody in the store.
good,"During nearly a decade at Kohl's I was on the ground floor during their drive to build their private label brands. It was an exciting place to work as we had multi-faceted job responsibilities and influence during a time we took low private label brand penetration to astronomical increase. This experience over the years, although required adaptability, creativity, many long hours and a relentless work ethic, has made me extremely broad based from all product development areas from technical design to sourcing."
good,It was a good Wholesome atmosphere and the people were real nice.
good,"A typical day at work is about acheiving goals and satisfying customers with their needs. The management team provides advice to those who may find it more difficult to work on the goals our company sets. Although there are several different departments, everyone works as a team at the end of the day."
good,Fun place to work
good,Fast paced environment busy
good,This was my first job starting when I was 17 years old. I worked hard to perform efficiently and to accomplish the task at hand. My managers were extremely fair and did their best to provide a comfortable work environment.
good,"Basically all we did was keep the store clean and walk around and answer questions for about 6 hours a shift. I love customer service, but this just isn't the best way I would prefer. The hardest part of the job was really keeping busy, there wasn't much to do."
good,A typical day at work was usually busy so I had to learn to work under pressure in a fast paced environment. The job taught me how to prioritize on what needed to be done and yet initiate friendliness and communication with the customers.
good,"With so many people coming in and out of Kohl's, it's hard to feel valued as a worker. Throughout my time there I had multiple managers, some of which I never got to meet while working. Many would call me by the incorrect name."
good,"A typical day at work coming in with a smile on my face as well as being greeted by my co-workers with a smile on their faces. Working behind the customer service desk, taking car of customer returns, questions and needs."
good,Making sure the sales floor was in tact for customer to shop with less hassle as possible.
good,"Kohl's is a good place to start out in. You learn to answer customer calls, and help the customers, with whatever their wish is. My co-workers are very nice and friendly. The hardest part is to not get tired of it quickly, listening to the same music everyday was horrible; and getting your schedule fixed right was difficult. The management was very nice, but actually showing they appreciate and care for the employees seemed like a hard task for them."
good,* Fast pace working environment during the holiday season.
good,"A typical work day would be clock-in, head to customer service to do returns, than go to the fitting rooms to put items back on the floor, fold clothes and pick up clothes, all while helping customers that needed help. I also was cashier whenever they were short cashiers and the lines were long. While at Kohl's, I earned my experience in customer service, time management, cleanliness, and organization. I got along well with my managers as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers, the most enjoyable part was when a customer says that I do a great job at my work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls can be a stressful place as customers make it quite messy and we are tasked with putting it back together. There are often challenges with finding the right place for things or getting it all done in time. There simply isn't enough time to put things away and clean the departments as well. This is largely due to shortened hours and being short staffed. However, the coworkers and managers are pretty great. "
good,A typical day was going in at 6 am and unloading truck until 8 then taking a 15 minute break. after which you would go merchandise the rest of the day until 12 or 3. i learned many things about working retail including how to use a device called a bluebird and its functions. probably the hardest part of the job was merchandising while customers are around. The most enjoyable part was seeing how happy people were when you helped them.
good,"Kohl’s is a great place to work at, most of the time the workers are happy and determined to do their work. It was a job that always had me on my feet"
good,Kohls was a great part time job for those who are in school. Help's employee's develop communication and customer service skills. Offer's a variety of different jobs within one job.
good,"I worked in the shoe department so it was pretty easy. All you really have to do is organize the merchandise, help the customers, and fulfill orders over the phone. Since the shoe department was close to the register, you might have to work the register if they need help. The only thing I did not enjoy was the customers leaving shoes everywhere."
good,"Awesome place to work"
good,"It was a decent paying job and a lax mantra with good workers and a somewhat decent management. The sad thing was it seasonal, so it got slow a lot and there'd be nothing much else to do But sit around and wait."
good,"Being able to multitask a lot, have customer service experience, work with a nice attitude, and help out with everything no matter what or when it is."
good,Great company if you enjoy a young ever changing culture. Large campus. Decent benefits. If you can follow well you will move right on up. Don't get caught drinking the Kool aid
good,"Point of Sale, selling the Kohl's credit card, taking and processing returns, organizing P.O.S. stations, counting drawers for the beginning and end of a shift, motivating the team. I  like what Kohl's aspires to be, but corporate and management didn't live up to expectations or their own mission statement.  I feel that Kohl's is one of those companies that pays the higher-ups in management very well, but the lower managers make nothing!  It's only $1 raise to go from an associate to a manager, yet the responsibilities are triple!!"
good,I would recommend Kohl's as a great place to start your retail career. There is plenty of opportunity to advance your career in even if you decide to change career paths.
good,"Working at Kohl’s was nice and calming for me. There was no room for me to cross train in different departments. Despite me having experience with apparel and shoes, they still didn’t offer me that chance to improve my chances of picking up more hours. They worked extremely well with my college schedule and was understanding. Staff was super nice and always helpful, but of course you had drama, it’s nothing new in retail."
good,Fun place to work for seasonal . But apparently not so fun after holidays hours get cut short to almost just 4 hours A WEEK which is horrible for someone who wanted to stay and helped! I’m
good,"I like the people I work with. Good work environment. The customers are nice, which makes it easier to help them when they can’t find what they’re looking for, whether it’s a clothing piece or a section in any of the departments. Management is fair."
good,I have no clue why but I literally could not get more than 2 maybe 3 days on the schedule to work. Pay was good but couldn't get that many hours a week. I asked for more almost every other day but they wouldn't budge. Could've been a good job but scheduling is terrible..at least at this location
good,"Kohls will work with your schedule and lenient with switching schedules or requesting days off."
good,"Tis job is overall good. You get to make your own schedule no direct supervisor and you get your own office. The pay is average for loss prevention standards. The company is goal driven when it comes to making external apprehensions, this means there is allot of pressure for you to make apprehensions every week and this gets really stressfull. You most likely will be working alone and this also makes it harder to make apprehensions. Kohl's has some shady business practices that allot of other retailers don't do. If you are in loss prevention they don't really effect you but except for the quota they have. There is almost no advancement in the company what so ever. The job does get extremely boring due to the low customer volume."
good,"It was an okay job, the pay was minimum wage and i didnt get many hours. It was laid back and the managers were nice all except for the store manager."
good,"I worked for Kohls over the holidays while I was doing school. I loved the management, but your days seem really long and repetitive. It was a decent place if you are looking for a job part time."
good,the daily work was never just a same day to day type of work. When working the floor it could end up you being the only one on the floor besides managers because of a call in.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Perfect for a side job and extra spending money. Some coworkers gossip and worry about the wrong thing but I think that's at every job. Other than that the environment was wonderful.
good,great company to work for because the enviroment is friendly and other employees are as well. pay was poor you cant live off of $9 a hour. The company is very competitive with other stores in their reegion and fast pace enviroment when on the truck team unloading the trucks and merchanising
good,The management was really good to work for very polite and kind. The management was always willing to help you with your schedule and learning new things around the store. Usually sometimes you get various hours a week sometimes I would work only 17 or less hours a week. The only time you really get hours is in the holidays or to pick up shifts. This job would be good for college students. They don't give you a lot of hours but you get your paycheck every week.
good,"I worked for Kohls for 5 years. I worked hard and was promoted fairly. I worked with some great people. They became my kohls family. I had to leave Kohls in June when my husband was diagnosed with cancer. The love and support from the associates was overwhelming. "
good,"Loved being a 'cheerleader' getting the associates motivated for each day. The people and customers were the most enjoyable part of the job. Holidays were expecially exciting, as Store Manager I was responsible for keeping the lines at the registers moving and talking to customers."
good,"I am one of the Sales Floor Supervisors and there is a very small training period for new employees until they are put onto the floor by themselves so it can be an overwhelming environment. "
good,Atypical day at work was relaxed and slow paced unless it was near a holiday. Management was always very understanding and friendly . The managers were always open to train and answer and questions we had.
good,"handling boxes between 30 to 100 lbs, building walls to fill multiple trailers up in a decent amount of time. forklift/sitdown operated, receiving, unloading trucks while being aware of your surroundings,picking and auditing certain merchandise in a timely manner"
good,Most of the job is just following after waves of customers to reorganize the departments that get trashed.
good,"fulfil online orders"
good,"It's retail. Any of the pros and cons you'd come across at any other retail store, you'll come across here. I really don't have much to say about working at Kohl's other than it's just another corporation. If you can handle customer service, you can handle Kohl's."
good,"Advanced with Technology, No work life balance, Management is friendly, but no job security. Lot to learn but no one to help with providing information."
good,"The culture was ok, Very busy understaffed Must be able to sell credit applications, Must be able to work any shifts and be on call a moments notice..."
good,"If you show up on time, do your best, and treat customers exceptionally, you are safe to find your own way. There is a high degree of supervision from mangement which is good and bad. The co worker culture is great and you are sure to have friends."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. Good environment and the management is easy to get along with. The only problem is that they aren't family friendly. You lose a day you get an occurance and you're only allowed 12 a year. Other than that it is a great place to work and you meet some of the nicest people willing to work together
good,I normally would work at night. you had to be fast pace to keep up with the clothes not being all over the place. Management was okay. The work place was family friendly.
good,"This is a good first job for high school students looking for a year of experience in retail with good employee discounts. Not good for long term because of the stressful environment (customer/manager complaints, fast pace at times)/, low pay, little hours, no advancement."
good,"It only pays minimum wage. Only a limited number of hours are assigned weekly. The cashier role is fun and interactive. You learn about all of the promotions Kohl's offers and how to use the discounts appropriately. Its a low-stress, part-time job."
good,"I started out as a seasonal member. The first week i got my full hours, but starting my second week in after that my hours got cut short. I was only getting 1-2 days a week to work. There was one week where i was not scheduled at all! First of all i understand that its not peak season yet (i started working the last week of Sept) but its not fair to keep hiring people when you dont even give your employees the hours they need to pay their bills. Overall the pay is good and worth the aching feet (i worked as a picker) but they need to be honest when they first hire you that you wont be getting enough hours before peak season. My advice is if you’re gonna apply, make sure its during their final interviews because peak is near and you’ll definitely get your hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Corporate Management does the best they can to make Kohl's a great place to work.  The numbers are very important and sometimes great people with a lot of integrity may get lost.
good,The job was a very fun environment everybody was so happy and fun living but again the hours wasn't good for me and they hiring too many people when other could work
good,"Assist customers with merchandise, take care of any concerns and problems. Set planograms to company standard. Work with associates on how to solicit credit and rewards"
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, We have hard workers and great managers, E3 consist of being manager on duty, by this time its all hands on deck, taking care of the front of the store to insure that all guest leaves very satisfy. My role consist of training the team making sure everything is going well. Merchandising and making sure the floor pad is to book, and meets company demands."
good,Assisted customers in finding what they needed. Management was friendly and professional. Co-workers were fun to be around. Hardest part of job was being on my feet for 6 - 8 hours a day. I enjoyed having a flexible schedule.
good,"Kohl's is a great job to get retail experience, the discount is nice, and culture is great makes you feel close. Sometimes people do not do their job like supposed to and are there just to collect a pay check. Gaining more retail experience made me learn how to cooperate with people and to drive sales. The hardest part of the job I would say is to open credit. A couple managers are understanding and know how hard it could be sometimes but there are some that will drive it down your throat and make you question about your job. Most likely 80% of the people that shop at Kohl's all have a charge card. What I liked about the job is that it isn't too much of a hardworking job. Although there can be too many sales sometimes which gets annoying and everyone is in the store making it unorganized and a mess. No job is perfect but its a great overall job. The only thing that causes you not to stay is the pay. The pay is not good, straight minimum wage but you have to start somewhere sometimes."
good,Enied job it was seasonal wish i could have staied longer.Hled many people.Holiday job.
good,"Must be on time and able to work in a fast paced environment, you cannot have an opinion of your own, but if you stay to yourself, you're golden. Management will seem to be your friend, but will not defend you when you need them to, it's business! Just like any other place, people will talk, so if you don't want anyone knowing your business, don't tell anyone anything or it'll spread like wildfire. There are a lot of older people within the facility who feel that they own Kohl's and that they're owed something in return, so they're hard to present anything new to. Some of the coworkers make it all worth while, no matter what's going on, I'll miss them dearly!"
good,Very fast paced. You retain a lot of people skills. Volunteer opportunities threw Kohl's Cares.
good,"Cashier and Sales floor "
good,"I loved working for Kohl's. Even though they were not a high-paying job, they worked really hard to address the concerns brought to them by the associates. As an employee, you felt that your opinion and input really mattered. With their Kohl's Cares for Kids program, they worked hard in their community to give back to programs centered around kids' growth. When they want to promote someone, they make it an open option for everyone who wants to to apply for the job; and every employee who wants to be interviewed for the open position will be interviewed."
good,Job offers plenty of discounts to the customers and employees!
good,"I went to work knowing what I was going to deal with. Such as customers, improving customer service, communication, and  improving sale. I have learned plenty from this job. I've learned how to communicate with others with a clear voice, how to listen and understand, answering phone calls and getting the customers what they are looking for, working with different types of people and being able to work as a team. My co-workers were all great. But there is always people where you might not always got along with, but I still managed to keep things professional and mature. I never had any difficulties with the job. I'm a fast learner so I caught up on a fast pace really quick. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers out with exactly what they needed help on and giving a good word about to my managers about me with a smile on their faces."
good,The work environment is vibrant and fun. I enjoyed my employment with kohl's.
good,"In a typical work day I would first find out what cash register I am assigned to, then I would clear it from all clothing and hangers that might be in my work area. Work the cash register while trying to get customers to sign up for Kohl's credit or encourage customers to use their cards. Unload truck if we had to do so and put merchandise in there proper areas. Re-arrange some merchandise and put together things to put merchandise on. Put prices on specific items or change them according to the specific sale that was going on at the moment."
good,"Typical day was steady always something to do there even if its not busy you can always find something that needs work."
good,If you are looking for a job to make a little extra cash on the side this is a great job but if you are looking for long term work this is not the job you want.
good,"A typical day at work , I would interact with at least 20 different people. Meeting new people opened the doors for opportunity. I enjoyed the diversity of the staff Kohl's offered. We engaged in several fun events amongst the staff to encourage positive energy."
good,"greeted customers, assisted them locating items such as clothing and answered phone calls, cashier the day after Thanksgiving sales."
good,Each store is individually managed and handled differently. The store manager is not always a respectful person but for the most part it is a decent place to work. Most of the employees are great people. Management could use some improvements. The pay is on the higher end of the retail choices starting at $8.50hr. Overall if you need a steady job to hold you over this is a great choice but it's not a good fit for a career.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working at khols was good learning experience as far as retail jobs were concerned
good,Loved the people that I worked with and a very fast enviorment. 
good,"The management team made everyone feel very welcome to work each day. Most of the management team was pretty cheerful each day."
good,"Very fast paced business. Learn to be jack of all trades, love interacting with customers not so much being pulled by in 100 different directions. "
good,"Usually a steady workload, there's always something changing"
good,Management at kohl's was great helpful co-workers.
good,Kohl's is a place that is fun to be at. Everyone treats one another as if they are family which is something I really enjoy. Customers are usually the highlight of my day with them being so excited about their coupons and how much they saved in total. There are the occasional few customers who take their frustrations out on cashiers for prices or the process of opening a Kohl's card but it's to be expected. The hardest part of the job would be having to reach the credit goal considering most our customers already have the card. Another thing is the scheduling. Sometimes a person is scheduled to work one one day a week with at least 6 hours which in my case is only good for a tank of gas.
good,"Working at POS is a very simple job: tend to the customers, do simple transactions, get customers to sign up for charge cards, keep a neat station, and stay busy during slow business hours. I learned many interpersonal, customer service, and communication skills from working at Kohl's. The majority of my co-workers were very pleasant to be around (you'll always get placed with people that just aren't mr. or ms. personality). The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for the credit cards and the most enjoyable part was getting to speak with customers and interacting with others. Most of my managers were very helpful and understanding, but some were very rude and only seemed to care for you if you could meet your charge card goal for the day."
good,No day was typical it was fasted paced and I multitasked daily. I learned to train various positions and great customer service and management skills. Most of the co workers worked very hard and performed many different jobs. The hardest part of the job was that there was not enough employees scheduled to help every customer all of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers go home happy and watching my employees grow with the company.
good,"It was an nice experience my time there, co-workers were nice to work with. What I didn't like was getting paid every week. I like getting paid every two weeks"
good,It is a good work environment. The only thing I don't like is the scheduling. They don't schedule enough hours EACH week for many of their employees. It's a good job for those in school or who just want spending money. But not for someone trying to pay the bills each month.
good,kohls is a great place to work. The company is giving the opportunity to better my self.
good,"helped customers find items. organized clothing on racks, and arranged clothing on display tables."
good,"Kohl's was a nice work place but they just wanted the cashiers/ point of sale's people to get as many credits they can possible. The managers didn't mind that a few workers would dismiss policy of cell phone usage in the workplace while working. Discriminated against what workers can wear to work, some of the women would wear leggings as their pants to work which is inappropriate. I learned how to use their registers it was my first time working in retail. My co-workers were really nice, one of the managers wouldn't do much but the others would help out customers. Basically all i really enjoyed about the job was my co-workers."
good,It's unfortunate that the hours here at Kohls are so limited. I would consider this the perfect job for an high school student. I wouldn't suggest this job to someone who has additional responsibilities such as children or other dependents.
good,Working at Kohl's was a great experience of being back on the sales floor and working with customers.
good,"It’s an ok place to work. The people were nice and it was fun helping people out. The managers made it great, for a good work environment and taught us how everything worked."
good,Being my first job and still attending high school it was very difficult for me but it also helped a lot because i knew going forward what to expect. It has helped me a great deal with where I work and going to school today. It made me learn that balance and now I am a assistant manager at my current job.
good,Kohl’s is a great company to work for I love the strive and energy of a fast paced work environment the supervisor and co workers are great it’s many great departments to choose from
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,fast paced enviroment with room to grow and ability to learn other areas of the store so youre never bored. the management team is excellent and is willing to work with you with your schedule and your preferences for the area you work in
good,Things you would like to have for your place and clothes that you may want to wear for everyday or a special occasion.  The store is friendly and neat.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kohl's but they expect a lot of work from their employees. Too much work and not enough money. Management is fair and do not get angry but doing your job is expected of you and anything less is very bad.
good,Kohl's warehouse is a great job to have because the pays great and hours are good. They would do bonuses during the holiday and its also double pay during the holidays.
good,working here as a cashier and sales floor associate really improved my skills and helps advanced. Management is fair and listens but they're usually under a lot of stress
good,"Disclaimer: all opinions are my own, and your experience will differ between locations."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and got along with most of them very well. I felt appreciated doing my job and got along with management very well. On average I closed usually working an 8 hour shift. I learned a lot about diversity and customer service as well as sales.
good,Good place to work my manager and store manager was great! Discounts were awesome! Only cons was Black Friday because it got super crazy and stressful. And they made us stay late past closing to fold clothes in the store. But otherwise great job my position was seasonal only but enjoyed working there. Love shopping at kohl’s. Great products and great prices.
good,It made me have more work experince with people around me like team work always doing my task on time co workers start msking me feel like a family helping each other out with our task .
good,Kohl’s was fun to work with but some days were really hard to handle. Some of the costumers were extremely rude and just threw stuff on the ground so it was really hard to manage. The management wasn’t all that great. They would expect us to know stuff even though they didn’t take the time to train us.
good,on somedays we unload truck put clothes on racks ... for each department.... then i maybe be ask to do the online ordering...you walk around and fine the item the customer requested... managers are kool... very international culture on your feet for most of your shift... the discount and the people you work with
good,"Give customers good customer service. Have to meet credit goals, and reward programs goals every day so the store doesn’t fall behind at the end of the year."
good,"It was just the right pace. You had responsibilities so you were never bored. Hardest part was the hours, and the lack of organization there was, and after Christmas, it was very hard to actually find what to do, and you'd receive no hours."
good,High turn over rate
good,"Overall its a healthy place to work if you show up on time, do your job, and leave. My role is catching shoplifters, dishonest associates and develop action plans to create less loss for the company. You don't get any time off  until you have been there for a year. No sick days until you have been there for a year. Great benefits but I need something different."
good,"Typical work day was routine, but enjoyable. I learned many skills such as cash register and customer service. Management was fair. The workplace was relaxed. The hardest part of my job was going out of my comfort zone and embodying excellent customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,"Relax environment, depending on where you live. The customers are usually older. Customers are nice. Depending on who you work with time flys by. Just wished the paid would go up to 10 instead of 9."
good,Associates become like a family to you and you learn something new every single day. Very fast pace environment where you constantly have to adapt to changes.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked as a temp for the Christmas holidays, back as ad-set  before the switch to machines. It was a great starter job for me as I was starting college. Looking back at it now I would say the pay could have been better but my at the time manager was very patient and worked with my coworkers and I to make sure we got the job done right and at a reasonable time."
good,"easy call flow"
good,"Kohl's is definitely a relaxed work environment and fun place to work, especially for anyone in high school. There are many high schoolers and college students working there."
good,Kohl's was an exceptional employer to work for.  The company is outstanding when it comes to training.  This company ensures their employees offer stellar service.  Not only that they offer stellar training to employees to promote into other roles.
good,I love my job as a MJM assistant the crew is amazing and so are the customers. It's a easy job but may be tough if you are paying bills not enough hours
good,nice coworkers and fun environment to work in. management was nice and willing to work with scheduling issues. would come back if given the chance to move back to the area.
good,Working the floor is always busy do to under staffing mostly. Customer service is paramount but the double duty of floor and register can be exhausting.
good,"Good experience while was there. Learned different thing within the store ,didn't have any management problems. Very clean environment, meet some great people.."
good,Kohl's is a good company but not really for me. I'm not a big fan of retail and the customer can sometimes be really difficult so you have to be a people person for this job
good,"Pros: Weekly pay"
good,A typical work day was filled with happy people who were helpful an understanding. The working place was filled with peace and hard working with a great team that were like family.
good,It's hard to stay consistent with the amount of changes that are made with QA and the company. They will not work with you when they cause errors. Over all they do treat you like family to an extent.
good,"The people that work there are okay, the customers are absolutely horrible. They want everything for free and will curse or scream at you to get their way. You have to ask off at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want a day off, and they don't always follow your availability. But they have days where they have food for employees and there are massage chairs and a tv in the break room. It's very hard to get fired, unless you have a lot of no call-no shows or steal from the company. You can move up if you want to work full time, or you can stay at part time and get yearly $0.30 raises to almost cover inflation. Overall, it's just an okay job."
good,They allow you to work in different areas to find out more about the operation from the ground level daily. The supervisors are friendly and assist you along the way to learn.
good,Great job for part-time workers. Flexible hours for anyone. You get great retail experience. The benefits are good. Goes fast if busy.
good,There are many wonderful things about Kohls. I loved the people that I worked with. They were all hard working individuals who cared about the customers and took pride in creating an environment that was pleasant for customer and coworker alike. The management was dedicated to making sure the associate was trained and could handle the job that was assigned to them. The company as a whole was outstanding with its Associates In Action initiative that brought workers outside of the stores and into the communities helping groups by volunteering to work events and donate to causes. The most difficult part of the job was the high turn-over and low pay. The environment and people were great but without higher incentives to stay you have a greater tendency for turn-over and over-working those who are dedicated to staying.
good,"Fast paced environment, friendly atmosphere, great mangers, co-workers are very friendly. good hours and opportunity to move up"
good,"Great way to earn a little money. The scheduling was a hassle sometimes, but overall, it was a really good place to work. Everyone I worked with was friendly and we really enjoyed working together. Management team did a great job, despite the bad hand that was dealt sometimes. They were willing to help when the sales floor was understaffed."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I put clothing in is proper placement as per company guidelines. I got to assist people with their clothing needs which was fun. I enjoyed working with my immediate management team. I enjoyed supervising three to five people at a time. I did not enjoy such a fast paced environment during peak times.
good,"great place to work but the pay raises are not good,they give away a lot of rewards,and the head of the building is a good person"
good,"Always have something to do, love my coworkers they are great team members. Sometimes the day is very busy but you always put the customer first."
good,"My typical day was like any other cashiers. Long lines , lots of customers, returns, smiling and being friendly, helping as much as possible etc. I learned how to control my emotions , how to work proficently with others, how to interact and do what was required. My co-workers made the day go by faster.It was nice working with them and sharing the same experiences. The hardest part of the job was achieving the goal of getting a certain amout of people to sign up for credit cards. some had bad credit or didnt want that responsiblity and im not one to push sonmeone past their limit. NO means NO. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy and satified with how their money was being spent."
good,I didn't recieve any training and I didn't get my own locker. I really didn't even feel like part of the team at all. Most days I would show up to work and would just be sent off to fold clothes somewhere and that was it.
good,"There's good and bad in every job.  I love the majority of people I work with. We have become like family and work together very well, helping each other out when needed.  Everyone who has pride in their job and works hard always wants better for the store, in which sometimes it doesn't get. Always changing, with the new seasons and such and there is always something to be done in the store which is a positive for me."
good,"Kohl's Loss Prevention is a very busy but rewarding job. A typical day involves watching cameras and looking for shoplifters but that is not the only thing the job consists of. Loss Prevention is a business where you have to have good communication skills, partner up with the store side of the company, and be able to make quick and professional decisions on your own."
good,Lovely atmosphere great team to be apart of and new things to learn from each and everyday!
good,fun workplace very polite nice environment good benefits good co workers good team leader productive place to work very professional manager and staff
good,Good place to work for part time positions or if in school. Taught me to use the cashier and many other skills.
good,My typical day at work would be to clock in and go to the assign register. I would scan product up for the customer and tried to have small talk to get to know them. My job was very focus on customer service. Making sure the customer was satisfy when they left KOHL'S. I learned to enhance my customer service skills. Management were always supportive and there to help if I needed any type of assistance. My co-worker were very friendly and helpful. My hardest part about working at KOHL'S it was only seasonal. I enjoy working with people and interacting with them through conversation. I enjoy making a customer happy with my service.
good,"My favorite part of this job was my co-workers. I had never made so many friends working in one place, and I believe it's because it's a large store. The managers are stressed and therefore short sometimes. The hardest part is not buying everything after your shift."
good,"Kohl's was and is a great place to work, The management treated me so well and with great respect. I learned so much not only from the management but from the senior employees. Amazing place to be employed."
good,great co-workers and team cooperation. There is always plenty of hours if thats what you need as well as the company is generally good if you have to call off
good,"Kohls gave workers independant jobs and dependability on personal projects and gave different responsibilities and job opportunities to employers. The easy part was staying busy and the hard part was compensating for other workers that  could not handle the workload.i enjoyed working with a company that took pride in customer service. Some co workers were fit for the job and some were not. Management gave many responsibilities to different employees, but were not spread equal among all employees. Also, pay rate was not fair considering capabilities and job performances. ."
good,"it's a good place to work Management is very good everyone is a team player, made alot of good friends there, if i would i would work there once a month."
good,Restocking the sales floor and cleaning the sales floor and fitting rooms. Answering customers questions and phone calls.
good,"Kohl's is very a team oriented company with a fun management crew. Everyone is helpful to each other and has the same goal, which is making sure the customer is satisfied at all times and achieving the store's goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the customers and getting them to love the store. I'm able to inform them on new sales and coupons available, which puts a huge smile on their face. "
good,I enjoyed meeting and interacting with the customers. I got along with all my coworkers and had no conflicts.
good,At Kohl's I was an active member of the freight team as well as the sales department. The managers were very professional and efficient. My co-workers were very focused. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,great place to work but hours aren't to great. hardest part would be waking up at 5am every morning to unload the truck. i learned alot of customer care.
good,utilize my skills and experince improve operations increase profitabllty and enhance growth this job was very fast past in fun having excellent problem solving skills help me a long way i made sure that every customer was very satisfiled with my service.
good,"My time as Kohl's wasn't that of a good time. The management does not stay on the floor associates about keeping their areas clean and maintained through out the day so when the closing shift comes in, the store in trashed and we end up staying 2-3 hours after closing the store to get it picked back up to cleanliness."
good,Friendly work environment. Good management team. Good hours. Very low salary increments . Great benefits 401k. Great associates discounts. Good location (Oviedo) . Very good selection of merchandise for the entire family and home
good,"As long as you don't look too deeply into their questionable business practices, Kohl's is a great place for a first job. It is fairly easy to move up to a new position if you actually put in the effort required to do so, and as a general rule, associates are required to do everything around the store, so you won't just be behind a register all day every day."
good,If you are wanting just part time work this is a great job. I enjoyed my co-workers. Setting plano grams is fun. It was challenging getting freight out especially during 4th quarter. The employee discounts are amazing!
good,I don’t have a review. Just apply and see what u can make of it. Relaxed dress code. Pay weekly. Select schedule. Okay environment. Go apply soon and see
good,"I have worked for this company for 6 years and the reason why I stay is because I love the work life balance it has to offer. Additionally, the benefits it offers are very competitive with other companies that don't offer as much as Kohls does. There are definitely opportunities in changing the policies referencing to employee engagement and growth opportunities."
good,"My time at Kohl's was an average sales life. It's a big box store, but the management and other people I worked with really made the job. Collaborative efforts and team morale really drove me to do better and work harder."
good,Everyone is very friendly and always smiling. Full time associates work just about everyday and part Tim work 3-4 times a week. Paid weekly every Friday.
good,"During the peak of the holiday season it was very busy but after black friday everything dies down and it becomes so dead. I liked it at the beginning but if you're the type of person that likes a kind of fast pace job, this isn't the one for you. It became very boring and I would struggle to find things to work on when there were no customers. Great temporary job though."
good,"When the store has customers the day would go by fast, but when it was an early workday, the store would be slow and it would make the shift very boring."
good,"You was always busy, but the managers showed favoritism towards employers. The people that they was friends with got the hours and the people they wasn't friends with just got the days that their ""favorite"" person did not want to work."
good,"The job was good and there were a lot of good people and good pay, but I was given one or two days a week at 8 hours a night(overnight) which didn’t earn much money"
good,"I organized shoes and did cashiering."
good,"It was great experience, working with others and receiving checks weekly. I would go back to work for this company. Thank you"
good,Good work environment ...i just did not like the schedule .... pay was compatible... managers were very nice they made the long work hours fun. Everyone  a the  company were friendly
good,Loved the people i worked with. But disliked that i went from 40hrs a week to 20 and they dont even explain why. They attend to keep you busy and also learned alot.
good,"easy going environment, everyone works as a team, flexible schedule, fast paced job at times but not overwhelming, register system is easy to use"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Usually when I come to work it is morning and it starts off boring. Around noon it starts to get busy. The managers and my co-workers are all friendly and it's fun working with them. Everyone works as a team and that's what makes working here enjoyable.
good,"outbound calls for collections on Kohl's credit card, I really don't do collections but it was fun everyone helps each other. Management ia very help full always willing to help. the hardest part about the job was I don't do collections, I'm more of let me help you and I count help other than collect. I miss my co workers."
good,it was great improved my interpersonal skills there and my team work skills. co workers help you the best they can and you are able to move up quickly depending on how hard you.
good,I am a former employee. I was available to work every single day out of the week but I generally only got scheduled for 4 out of the 20 hours I would be allowed (part-time). Almost no reason to go in the first place if you're only spending your paycheck on gas to go there. I was hired for replenishment but mainly did register
good,"I had a great time working for Kohls. It is a great job if you are looking to find your first job (I Wasn't). They like to meet credit goals, so if you are a cashier be ready to have a store wide credit application goal every day."
good,"You walk in and get right to work from Greeting  customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs, also helping with caring out merchandise , Compute sales prices, total purchases and receive and process cash or credit payment. Answer questions regarding the store and its merchandise. Prepare sales slips or sales contracts. "
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I love how they acknowledge those workers that are doing a great job. I was one of the top card sellers and it made me feel go. I loved the atmosphere and the customers were always nice.
good,Very good place to work as a college student. I've been able balance school and work because of the great management Kohl's has.
good,"Nice variety in this department store, and a great place to help customers to get what they want, when they want."
good,"I had the duty of cashering/organizing the clothes when they got unruly. Management was okay, no one seemed to want to do the time schedules which lead to many missed shifts and too many people showing up for a shift. My co-workers were good people, around my age. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting close to my co-workers."
good,"Kohl's was a typical retail environment.  Sales and merchandising, soliciting credit accts.  The best way to solicit credit accts..  Management was not always there when they were needed.  Co-workers were very helpful.  The was nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable were my hours."
good,The best part of the company is the employees and the customers most of them are really nice people however there were some rude but thats okay you deal with them just as easy always be polite and smile no matter what they dish out.
good,The customers were a challenge in every way which was interesting. The employees and management onsite were AWESOME! Working under the company it's self was not so awesome. They needed to do more research before they made technical decisions that would through the entire call center into disarray!
good,A decent place to work. Flexible hours. Good managers. Able to move within the company. This is a job where you can feel right at home. The people who work at Kohl's represent a diverse background of all people from transgender and all different races.
good,The job is fairly simple and can be a lot of fun. Sometimes the customers can be rude but management typically deals with it. The pay is the only downfall of the position.
good,it was a good job and it had the benefits of me meeting new people. I got to learn new skills and was able to learn how to do things differently. it was fun.
good,Working at Kohl's was an okay experience. I was on Omni and walked the store for items that were relative to the online orders. When it would get busy I would get on register. I learned how to cashier at Kohl's. The workplace was relaxed. The most difficult thing was finding an item that wasn't on the floor or in either backrooms. The most enjoyable part was packing out the order because it just you and boxes in the back with the music playing.
good,"This was my third seasonal position and third location.  The other two, wonderful experience.  This last time in Pickerington, two managers were friendly and helpful, the other 2 or 3, not so fun to work with."
good,I had a great time working at kohls its a very nice environment to work at management make sure the store is being ran good and workers are working hard
good,"While working at kohl's...I had to fold clothes, Hang clothes, Welcome customers into the store, handle customers complaints, check customers out at the cash register, and handle poor management."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They expected too much & management wasn't good. If everyone isn't working on the same pace, nothing gets done . there were massage chairs & a cafeteria."
good,Works with you on any issues your concerned with. Helps the day run smoothly with answers to any of your questions. And Makes sure everyone gets there breaks so no one gets worn out.
good,very vey very fun place to work being able to put a smile on a child's face is the best feeling ever I really enjoyed working al positions at this employer
good,"I made sure i counted the money when the customer handed it to me and i bagged their items and made sure they got what they wanted i gave them their receipts made sure i said have a nice day or fill out kohls survey i counted the money or asked for help when needed to close the register before i got to my register i would always sign in."
good,"Everyday at Kohl's is different, which is what I enjoy most about my job. Every day of the week I am in charge of taking care of something different. Mondays are an office day, where I catch up on projects and plan my workload for the week. Thursdays are truck days, so I spend my time on the sales floor training my associates on company standards. Every other day I take care of my core duties as a manager; These are making sure we are following the company's ""best practices"" from an operational standpoint. I have trained almost all my employees on all procedures. I hold meetings, coach and develop, and I also hire and fire people. From being in retail for the past 4 years, I have really realized that I can do anything. In the beginning, I was overwhelmed and thought I would not be able to get all my tasks done in the time allocated, but over time, I have learned it is all about planning right and using your time very wisely. I am very proud to have ended the 2012 year being ranked #2 in the company. There is only one other assistant store manager, whom I work great with. She is in charge of the stockroom, truck, home, shoes and kids. I am the manager of the misses, mens, juniors, intimates, jewelry, and accessories department. My store manager oversees the two of us; so essentially there are 3 managers that run the store. The hardest part about my job is getting everything done that I want, but not having the payroll to spend. We are one of the lowest volume stores, so we get the least amount of payroll to get the same job done across the board. I have learned over the years,"
good,It's a good place to work but they only give you a little hours. Witch may not work for students that have to pay college or mothers that expect a big check.
good,"I worked as a seasonal sales associate and performed tasks such as clearing out fitting rooms, and restocking shelves with various items. Also provided customer service to guests throughout my time at Kohl's. I learned how to multitask, time management, and how to handle stress well. This position always kept me busy with something to do."
good,"i came to work at 7 am and left at 5pm , 10 hours 5 days a week , work was fun some days , i packed packages in a auto bagger most of the day , it was a machine that closed and sealed the packages . i got two 30 minute breaks ."
good,"Typical day working at kohl's can be very busy, never ending problem solving. Helping customers is a must and being able to compromise with shoppers. Also being able to multitask is a must with this company. During holiday times it can be very challenging, due to the high amount of customers, the amount of items people need help finding/ purchasing."
good,great place to work I just wish they paid more. other than that its ok. I don't know what else to write about this job. I said all I could say.
good,"I love working with my co workers.. their all about teamwork and thats what i like about a company. I also like being a cashier! not only am i an expert at it, but u can also earn more money by pushing for sales of credit!"
good,"Fast paced, had to be organized, friendly and work well with others."
good,"An ok job if it weren't for the lack of hours. Managers are very professional, the most professional I have seen in retail."
good,A typical work day would be cleaning fitting rooms or cashing people out on registers. I will say the fittings rooms need extra Tender Love and Care. There should be at least 2 people on them because sometimes they are so backed up you won't even make a dent. Best thing to do is organize by brand yourself and have another put that stuff away. This way you both are working hard and will make more of a dent with only one person. The other issue is breaks. Depending on how many hours you work you will get specified breaks. But when people do get to go on break they need coverage (usually up at registers). There is never enough people on register so that means additional cashiers doing other projects have to go up and cover. Taking time out of the project you need to get done. this is probably the most difficult thing about the job. The most enjoyable is working with the great people there.
good,Great company willing to work with school hours and are very flexible and staff are enjoyable to be around. I personally don't like to solicit credit. And soliciting credit is number one to them.
good,this was my first job. i moved from seasonal to supervisor in one year. really had to bust my butt for the job. only for them to take full advantage of me. i wouldn't recommend working here.
good,"The Upside Of Working For The Company Is Getting Paid Weekly And Coupons Could Be Combined With Employee Discount.Barely Wanted To Give Breaks,No Such Thing As Work And Life Balance.Management was Ok..Overall Great And Experience From My First Store Manager"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I loved the discounts but it was seasonal and the wages were nothing to live on. To many works not enough hours. Wasn't to bad but no money or advancing.
good,Location of shop was slow pace until afternoons and holiday sale days. There was way too many managers and now way of knowing who was a manager and who wasn't. But they were friendly enough.
good,they get your hope up about moving up then you don't get the job you thought you was going to get
good,Only took application for customers wishing to apply for Kohl's credit card. Answered basic store questions. helped fold clothes and keep store tighty.
good,Having knowledge with the products sold helps customers know they are shopping in a place where the employees know their products
good,This place allowed me to go to school and work at the same time. There were issues with scheduling and horribly management. Co-workers are very nice and easy to get along with.
good,I enjoyed making new friends but management was not very kind. I learned about merchandising and recovery as well as signing things. The hardest part of the job is the drama.
good,"I was terminated from kohl’s unfairly. We had a new manager come on board and she put me in a 90 day probation immediately. She fired me on the 90th day. I asked her for my reviews for the previous 3 years to show her that i was always told that i was doing well at my job and they “disappeared” from my file. I didn’t fight for my job because it was apparent that they did not"
good,"Employees steal / mark down items for other co workers , friends and family members. Employees will keep promotion cash instead of giving to customers. They have their own little group. Favortism. Don't bother going through all the hassle of application and questions."
good,"if you were a male at kohl's they make you do all the dirty work and tell you its because you are a guy. like say there is a box that weights roughly 20 pounds, they will tell a female to put it down and call a male over to pick it up when they are trying to make sure that their floor is up to par. another reason is how a ""guy can't fold. right "" I was told that multiple times while I worked there too."
good,I would not mind working there if it wasn't so competitive and stressful.  Love working my fellow associates and the customers . I worked there 2 years before I got a raise.
good,Check customers out at the register. I work during the Christmas season and ended up staying on with them to make extra money.  It was a nice place to work at part time.
good,They never really keep people after the holiday season.so it's really not a good place to work if you are look for a full time job.but if you need to make a little money it just might be the job for you
good,Working at kohls can be fun but the manager is very bi polar so it all depends on her. The other workers and managers are very helpful and friendly and things go very smooth here.
good,"A typical day on this job was relatively easy. I learned how to set up displays that appealed to each customer and increase sales. The management was helpful and made sure that the new employees had proper training. The hardest part of the job was when a customer was in a hurry and wanted to get checked out quickly, while still having to go through all the steps to make sure everything was done correctly and thoroughly to the manager's expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was making conversation with the customers and getting great feedback from them in return."
good,"There was a lot of people that were great to work with. Also, I felt there was no room for movement in the jobs. Also, when they say part time work don't be surprise to be working more than 25 hours."
good,love this place nice people to work with.like to stay busy can always find somethindg to do.
good,A typical day is based on business needs on what they need done. They'll train you on equipment if they like you. The management has went downhill and will continue to do so unless you kiss up and suck up to them. The people you work with are great and was like family to me.
good,"The communcation at the Oswego,IL Kohls is horrible. When i used to work there I didnt feel like I could talk to any of the managers. They were always yelling at us and making us feel like we were nothing in the company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Hours have dropped down to 2 days a week because it's a seasonal job. And not many hour. Somedays I work six hours and some days I work four hours. Still a nice place to work.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. I think they should pay more but over all love my job.                              "
good,"Kohl's is a decent place to work if you want a slow-paced setting.  I personally prefer a fast-paced setting, because it leaves less time for standing around and getting distracted."
good,"I loved working at Kohls when I lived in a different city that’s why I wanted to transfer after moving to another city.  Managements were so very different. No communication, management didn’t speak to you unless they were with someone from upper management.  Very stressful to get credit applications."
good,I don't have much to say about this place. Some of the managers are cool but for the most part they expect way too much of you. no wonder so many people quit after such a short time.
good,It’s nice place to work at a lot of nice people but some managers have to be careful cause some are picky and play favorites it’s a big store they change everything in store customer always right no matter what
good,"Great place to work if you feel like looking over your shoulder everyday. They are the most untrusted people I have ever worked with. Will literally look you in the face a lie then tell the truth just a few days later. Always up to something, always changing some with in the company to make it harder to be great at your job but help them save money."
good,"It was a first job, and it taught me everything it could have possibly done. Don't expect anything perfect, but know that you'll learn the skills needed to work pretty much anywhere."
good,"This store has huge potential, if the Store Manager would resign.  Employees are all sad and feel bullied by the Store Manager.  There is zero comradery."
good,I worked there so long ago I really do not remember too much.
good,"Associates are expected to do basically everything all at once. When something isn't done, management complains rather than praising what has been done. Managers are never happy with work done. Managers never take responsibility, but rather blame one another for negative things that happen. Low pay for the amount of work asked of associates."
good,"It was one of the best [laces I worked. Then they cut you hours  so much you have to get a second job to survive, Management needs a lot of help. They are not very fair toward fellow employees. The employees are the best treat you like family always willing to help each other. I loved interacting with customers. They tend to come back and shop when you interact with them. I loved helping people and this job lets you do that."
good,I wished that i could get full time hours at Kohl's i enjoyed the job but it was not going anywhere. I really didnt see myself advancing workinf there
good,A typical day at work is filled with many customers looking for the best products and experience they can have find in our store. We provide a pleasant environment and employees that will go out of our way to help our customers.
good,"A typical day working with kohl's as a cashier was greeting customers, performing transactions and soliciting Kohl's specific credit cards to customers, explaining our policies, and most importantly providing great customer service. I loved my co-workers, everyone was extremely polite and helpful. As for the managers, very understanding with your personal life and loved to help; such as needing the day off or working around your school schedule. The only down side with working for kohl's was the pay and raises, all the associates worked hard, but your pay doesn't resembles that. But overall it's great for a first time job especially when you're in high school or college and most importantly to learn great customer service skills."
good,"I liked helping customers every day."
good,"Working at Kohls was just ok. They treated everyone the same but if an employee of a ""certain race"" needed something, the management was on top of it. I wasn't comfortable working there."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"-10 hours days 51 hours per week"
good,This job is fast paced. Work on your own a lot with little supervision. Helping other departments besides your own. Helping customers in every aspect you can think. Not a bad employer just the pay is not very good for the customers that you deal with.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,My experince on this job was more of meeting and greeting people which i enjoy the most cause i am a people person.
good,The job was great until we got a new head manager. Luckily she no longer works there. She fired me because missing work for my moms chemo treatment wasn't a good excuse.
good,"The communication could have been better with the scheduling, but other than that...."
good,"During my employement at Kohl's, my job was a point of sale associate. I greeted customers coming or going from the store, maintained a clean and professional work environment for my self, other employees, as well as customers. I also finalized each sale and capitalized and informed customers about charge cards that give them even more dicounts and savings. I thoroughly enjoyed the job but was not getting enough hours a week to support my family and I."
good,"The overall work environment is amazing, the only downfall is the poor management and lack of staffing. Management tends to give employees the worst attitude possible and they may not realise it but it does affect the attitude towards workers wanting to go to work or how their day will go."
good,"*Nice place to work if only looking for a part time job for extra income!! "
good,"Fast paced, the expectations are unrealistic, for the wage they offer.  There are other jobs out there with a higher starting pay.  Store discount is ok, some manufactures are excluded.  They don't give much positive reinforcement for a job well done."
good,"Kohl's pays well and has a nice pace work environment. However, the manager that currently is taking place of the manager that left has left many employees without hours. If the season is not busy they will not give you hours when needed. Most people working at Kohl's get a second job or already have a second job."
good,"i learned how to manage the money in the register, the hardest part of the job was during the Holiday seasons, it was very busy almost never got a break"
good,When first emplyed was working anywhere from 30 to 40 hours a week. After the hoildays worked only 4 hours a week. Left to seek emplyment elsewhere. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and also looking at all the new arrivals that came into the store.
good,"The floor manager at the time was rude, loud, obnoxious, and made you feel uncomfortable. I hated being a cashier because there were a lot of rude customers, especially when the lines got really long, and backup didn't get there quickly. Also, the policy was even if the customer found the item on the clearance rack, you had to honor what they said, whether it was true or not."
good,Some days were really long shifts. The days wen by really slow and there wasn't things to do to help pass the time. I spent most of days just standing at the register doing nothing.
good,it was ok wasn't interested but the pay was good I hated picking because you had to walk all over the building just to get the order ready for shippment
good,It was a good learning experience. Opportunities to move departments around if interest shown. Management was hard to communicate. More people needed to keep the Jewelry and Customer Service Departments going.
good,This was a good company to work for during the Christmas season.  I stayed on with them to make extra money.  I was a cashier and would help do inventory also.
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee during the 2016 holiday season.  I knew it was a temporary job.  The pace was hectic and lots of pressure to ask customers to open credit accounts.  Manager was non existent, however, the front line supervisors were top notch and always helpful and kind.  This year I applied for seasonal employment and the workplace culture was totally different.  All the supervisors had left the store for other jobs and few of the employees I worked with were still employed there.  This year I will be applying at other retail store."
good,Its a fun / relax place to work  everyone gets along with one another. They'll help one another if you are stuck on doing something or if your behind your duties.
good,"Started seasonal, then stayed on as part-time.  No benefits, no availability to move up to full-time.  Paid minimum wage.  According to others who worked there for 10 plus years, getting a raise is rare.  One woman had been there for 7 years and barely had a $.70 raise over her entire time working for them.  That was when I knew I needed to start looking elsewhere.  Most hours were weekend evenings and spent cleaning up after customers."
good,I always liked the appearance of this store. every time I went it was clean. management were great with me. although the fitting rooms are always busy putting back merchandise.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I was pregnant while working here. I did not get many bathroom breaks. I had one manager tell me I couldn't go to the bathroom. They didn't care about my health when I had to go to the ER due to my son not moving or something else wrong. The manager was rude and the store was never kept up or clean
good,"I loved working at Kohl's, however I wish there would have been some sort of job security or even knowing if I was still going to have my job after seasonal was over. There was no communication or even recognition of some employees that did excellent."
good,"Typical work day included, greeting customers up front registers. I learned if you do not ask questions you will be in the dark about alot of things within the store. Management was ok, but there was no advancement. Coworkers were nice, the hardest part of the job was climbing ladders. Most enjoyable part of the job was....?"
good,great company but doesnt accept doctors notes for absences and that is totally unfair.they dont carry enough coverage and push their enployees so hard and dont pay enough.
good,"a usual day consists of me helping people check out and mainly just making sure customers are finding everything, and if they have any questions those questions will be answered. the management was good just they need more to help with training i noticed i had a real lack of training. the co workers were great all really nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with a lot of customers when i would be the only on working."
good,Rude and unprofessional. They did not want to answer anyone's questions and did not want to provide us with proper info about the job.
good,"I liked working @ Kohl's, they management treated to fair & fun environment."
good,I loved the supervisor and employees at Khols . The pay scale Is too low for what I need to provide for myself and son. I recently moved here from Ga I am grateful to be hired but I need more hours at a higher pay rate
good,I loved this place the customers were great and so was the atmosphere.
good,"I liked working here, it just was not for me. I liked my coworkers and what i did. The management was horrible and they treated all employees cruelly and worked us too much and never honored a day off or vacations."
good,"Easy job, fun people to work with but you don't get alot of hours you're lucky if you get more than one day a week. Management acts as if he's not a manager and helps work and talks to employees as if he's on the same level as them."
good,your job depends on how much the store manager likes you no matter how hard you work at getting them there daily numbers
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced,very productive.People were very friendly.The hardest part of the day was unloading the trucks."
good,"There was always something to do.  You learn alot about customer service. The managment doesnt always communicate with each other, but are usually lenient with emergency family situations.  "
good,"Worked overnight. Set ads for sales, unloaded truck/freight. Set floor according to planograms. Enjoyed working but found it extreamly difficult to work overnight hours and get children to school the next morning."
good,Not very many hours
good,use RF gun and sign in
good,"This job has taught me a lot... not only about myself and my work ethic, but also how to interact with people in general. This job has helped me come out of my shell and become more sociable and more confident. The pay is no where near ideal and much lower than other retail stores in the area. There isn't much room for advancement and it's only part time unless you're upper management. There are no benefits for PT associates and it isn't an ideal place for a career. But with all of that, there are so many of my co-workers that I have grown to love and build friendships with over the years. For the most part it can be a fun, stress free environment that I do enjoy working at... but there are a lot of ways the company can and should improve upon. For the amount of things I know how to do and accomplish daily, I wish it paid more. Great employee discount though."
good,Plenty of work during holidays. Flexible on availability to fit your schedule however hours are scarse and only 19 hours a week are common after the busy season. Do not recommend for fulltime employment. Do not expect any raises or promotions.
good,"Caddy co-workers.  Management and response when needed is seriously lacking!  Customers get frustrated with the lines, and there are a lot of workers that call out and leave us short handed.  I have stayed late most days, or been assigned to work when they know that I am not available.  I do like it though, and the discounts are insane!!!!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When i first started I I was extremely unaware of absolutely anything that was expected of me."
good,"Over all it's a good company to work for unfortunately for me I had a supervisor who wasn't great.  She was never present or available. She didn't know the job so we pretty much had to find someone else to help us. She came and complained about how much work she had to do and not having enough time for lunch. She complained about her family issues. All this during the time (coaching) where she should be helping us improve to get better QA. She made the job Miserable. They have a selective process to move up, I'm not sure how she made it through."
good,"its a ok place to work, benefits are not that good, it can be a good place to grow, schedule is not flexible at least in the store where I worked, not enough hours if you are not a full time associate"
good,It will be a good first job. Unless you are looking to become higher management. There is not much room for growth in job and pay. Full time has decent benefits.
good,I enjoyed working at kohl’s in the jewelry center. The manager were very good with helping me when I needed assistance. I liked the easy going workplace and the people I worked with.
good,"clock in, run 500s help customers. ask my managers if there are any specific tasks they need my help in fulfilling for that particular day. help customers get the best over all experience"
good,"Typical day at work would include keeping clothes stocked and neat, maintain dressing rooms. Meeting sales quota for credit cards. The hardest part of working at Kohls was keeping clothes neat at all times."
good,It has the potential to be a great place to work. management  and Scheduling is inconsistent. Open availability is demanded otherwise you wont be scheduled.30 hours one week and only 10 the next. if you have real bills you'll need a second job to survive.
good,"Management has gone down over the last several years. The show favoritism really bad, they also promote only within the store rather than outside it. All about customer service."
good,was a good job. only got 4 hours a week sometimes. I hated have to push kohls charges on people. watched manager make an old lady cry trying to get her to open a charge card when she didn't want to. also you have to deal with customers who think they are right about coupons but aren't and they will ask for a manager
good,"The days were typical, depending on the store you were at could completely change the work environment. On the floor it was fast passed for the most part. They do have a tendency to move you around so you really don't know what you are getting into till you show up."
good,"Work was grindy. That much is guaranteed. However, the managers made it somewhat fun where I worked and would frequently buy us food, snacks, and drinks throughout the week. It was a laid back Job for the most part. The hardest part of the job is how trivial it felt. The best part was the culture that a good portion of managers created."
good,"Most of the managers were friendly and helpful, a few were rude and not very patient.  Be careful with how many hours you tell them you can work, around the holidays you'll always get over-scheduled, whether the hours are within your availability or not."
good,"Kohl's was a great temporary job. Packing was as easy as wrapping a gift. The hardest part of the job is dealing with no sleep during PEAK but the pay was worth. I recommend lots of coffee and Monster, just to stay up."
good,"Working at this job I learned that there are very easy days and there are very hard days yet either way I feel that on any day we care over worked and under paid given the cost of living these days, then to not really be able to depend on the money every week because every week there may be a different amount of hours given to you, making it difficult to make and save money."
good,I recommend this be a second job for you instead of a main job. They have a lot of employees so many people don’t get as much hours as they want. Other than that it’s a very nice work place with a nice discount and nice merchandise.
good,"I worked at kohl""s for the holiday season. they only pay 7,00 an hour but you get to see the sales before they start and they have great discoints during the holiday season."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Starting pay is barely minimum wage.  After two years, I had received only $.35 raise when I advanced from sales associate to department manager.  Being the Housewares Department Manager was very physically demanding job...so much so that I lost 30 plus pounds in a years time.  There is a constant change in Plan-o-gram going on depending on the season.  I had no assistance to help me maintain this department as well as bed/bath , electronics, seasonal, and home decor. There is no reward here for hard work unless you are a twenty-something pert and perky young thing in the store I was working. The younger girls would get by with everything and the ones who actually did most of the work were unappreciated. I felt very taken advantage of and taken for granted."
good,Find a store with a great manger and you will love working at Kohls. It is a great job with opportunities to be cross-trained. It is  wonderful as a part time  job or for college students /mothers. They try hard to accommodate your schedule.
good,Kohls is a very fast past environment. It is an ongoing job and there is always something to do. Its a great environment and helps create many great friendships.
good,"Working day and night shifts were both fun. Also, fast paced  job. My manager was great for the most part; however, the environment was competitive, and the management was horrible."
good,"My review of Kohl's is:  The do a good job at trying to make the employees feel like a team.  They do public service to many schools in the area.  Promotions to get credit, they push a little too hard on that respect.  If you don't get a number of credit sold to customers you do not get hours to work.  They also are inappropriate over the internal head set and say things to you that everyone hears.  Other than that it has been a great experience.  This was my first retail job and it was different from my career expertise as Administrative work, which I really enjoy."
good,"I Loved my job!!! I didn't like that upper management would not hold the employees accountable for dress code and call ins.My typical day started by checking the scheduensuring I was fully staffed if not  I called people to cover call ins. I also checked to see who who met goals for ""yes we can"" . The hardest part was compliance issues."
good,Very encouraging management team. Provided vending and coffee on breaks. Lots a water stations which kept you hydrated. And allowed you to listed to music witch kept you fat moving
good,This happens to be one of the most diverse working environment I ever worked. There are young and old worker also people with different ethic background. The coworkers where friendly and they were willing to help you whenever you needed assistance. You work in the front with the cashiers to set up the merchandiser fir the customers.
good,"coworkers are great, everyone is so friendly. holiday hours are very long and late at night but that is the only drawback. Always food in the break room!"
good,"Only assigned one day per week.  Seasonal position while exploring other, full-time opportunities.  Don't need to say anymore."
good,"I liked working with most of the staff. I wasn't there long enough to receive any type of benefits and some of the expectations were a little unrealistic, but I really enjoyed my job there and literally cried when I was let go. The group interview was fun and informative but not getting the position I applied for was very annoying and should not be allowed in my opinion. I suggest all employers place potential employees in positions that enhance their strengths and not showcase their weaknesses."
good,Good starter job with many perks. A lot of positive changes to improve work life. Big team player type company. A lot of great people to work with as well.
good,Working at Kohls is like attending a pep Rally.  Everyone is excited and happy to serve and help one another.  It was intriguing to learn about gemstones and how to display product.  My favorite part was helping the customers choose the perfect gift.  It was uncomfortable for me to be in my 50's working like a teenager.
good,If you're a student just looking to make a little extra money without long hours; this is definitely the place to work.  They will work around your class schedule and try to give you the hours you want.
good,"This was a part time job and didn't offer any permanent employment.  Liked to work with the customers and help them out.  The warehouse was a fun place to work because it was always busy, I worked during the holiday season.  The co-workers were part timers so didn't really get a lot of education."
good,"I was able to excel in my first assigned tasks that within a few weeks I was recruited to a different department with more challenges and experiences. Within that time frame I was even requested to train other employees at, below, and even above my level of experience. Seasonal employment was a good opportunity to earn additional money in a time when I was unable to find anything immediate. Worked well with my school schedule."
good,"Nice company, pleasant work colleagues.  Hours erratic and pay was minimum.  Some weeks had hours and others none.  As soon as the season was over, there were no hours available for part time or full time employment."
good,It was a good work environment all the management was friendly and easy to work with. They would recognize their employees for hard work
good,"Maintained fast, friendly service, assist customers to help them find what they needed, processed monetary transactions with cash, check, credit card as well as encourage opening accounts.  Sales floor upkeep including displays, organizing and stocking merchandise.  "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They were a seasonal employer.  Yes they knew I had vision issues before they hired me, however they did not realize that their register system was terrible - I had a very hard time seeing the menus... so to free up those who could make speedy transactions I would clean up other departments. I was fine with that but some of the people that shop at Kohls are down right selfish and rude.    I had very little contact with co-workers or management other than the training sessions and introduction to the section. The one woman I worked with in housewares was very sweet and calm while explaining what was expected."
good,I really enjoyed working for Kohl's. I learned a lot about cash handling as well as what good customer service is.
good,"At first we had plenty of hours, but after a couple weeks most of our hours dropped to four hours a week. On a typical day we'd have plenty of customers, the vast majority of which were completely satisfied with our store. There were a few complaints, but all were handled greatly. My co-workers and I were all very friendly with each other and helped each other with anything they needed help with. Management was mostly great, with the exception of an attitude with one of the managers. I learned how to improve my customer service skills for customer satisfaction and handling their inquiries."
good,"If unloading the truck, the day started at five am. I took boxes out of the truck, arranged them by department, some went on carts and the clothing is hung on racks, merchandising I just unpacked the boxes and restocked the shelves or hung clothing up on the sales floor. I was also back up cashier. I would then check customers out."
good,"Morning hour will start off slow but then slowly start to speed."
good,"Holiday hours are a bust,  but it is retail. "
good,This job involved a great deal of time management and organizational skills.
good,"If you can sale credit cards, this is the job for you. Kohl's is a nice place to work if you can do that. If you can't do that and do 3 other jobs at the same time don't even apply, because that's all they want you to do.They don't care about what you do in your actual department, that is if you even get to stay in it."
good,Kohls is an overall good place to work I have learned team work and merchandizing and the importance of planograms.
good,"My job here was to recover the sales floor and help at the registers if needed. The hardest part was, they didn't seem to understand that I am diabetic and would not work with me on that, which I understand to be illegal. However, I did enjoy working there and my co-workers and I worked together to get things done, even though we were responsible for our own areas."
good,It was very fun they ordered food for us sometimes the only issue is the management was bad. I learned how to deal with customers who were Africa fed and my breaks were very rushed.
good,"The work enviornment was very organized and fast. As a customer Service representative  I did many things at once, there was never time for pauses because each day something would change, youd be faced with a new challenge you were not faced with yesterday."
good,Kohl's is overall a good company to work for. Individual stores operate diffferently so there can be an adjustment period when trnasferring between stores.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work at as a first job for young workers. Lots of areas to gain retail/customer service experience from the sales floor to the stockroom working on the truck to the cashier/customer service desk.
good,I had to be customer oriented have accurate with transactions and straighten the area by the register and later at night out in the departments.  The management was there to help with questions. The hardest part of the job was driving 45 minutes one way to only work only part of a day.  The economy was poor at the time.  The most enjoyable part was most of the people I worked with and the customers I met.  I loved the products they had and their sales.  It is a great part time job if you do not need more income.
good,"I loved my duties and co worker they made it pleasant but,the customers were the best which at times,they showed their appreciation to me by a kind word and a smile and believe you me,a smile can make anyones day more pleasurable."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's.  The holiday season was extremely busy which was exhilarating and made the time go quickly.  There's something about that time of year that makes most people very festive and pleasant!
good,"Working at Kohl’s helped me develop and build great working and communication skills as well. I believe what I learned at Kohl’s, I will be able to use it in my future jobs."
good,"My boss knew enough to let me do my job, and not hover. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish everything that was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working the night shift was very face paced and physically demanding. As a part time worker there were no benefits or any paid time off. However you did get a lot of discounts all the time.
good,"If this is your first job, or you need something on the side then kohl’s is pretty good. My store manager is okay but the assistant managers are the best. The pay is very low for the area however."
good,"First job so didn't know what to expect. I believed they were good, howevere, being there for a while I was able to see some flaws with management. Ok."
good,"Since working at Kohls i've learned a lot about the retail industry and how to manage/stock everything in the store. Very clean and nice environment to work in, plus my co workers are very kind and hard working."
good,A typical day would be random for me because I was skilled in many parts of the store. It just depends on what department I was working in and what day of the week it was. The start of the week would be very busy because of new freight and the store needing cleaned and stocked. Towards the end of the week the pace would still be quick but the work load not as time consuming. I learned many valuable skills while working at Kohl's but most importantly I learned self endurance both physically and mentally. The hardest part about this job for me was wanting to improve and help change the store for the better but management would continuously listen and forget. The most enjoyable part of the job would be finishing tasks with other associates and managers.
good,If you were a cashier they really push on credit card sales. I was a seasonal employee. Management seemed to care. Usually slow pace. It was whatever.
good,Workers don’t get paid enough for the amount of work they do. They can be there for more than they scheduled hours and not get the recognition they deserve.
good,"Weekend work required and very minimum opportunities of advancement. Culture is great and working holiday peak season is mandatory. While I enjoyed working for Kohl's in my first 3 years, lots of changes in management have made it difficult to sustain improvements and developing employees to a better level."
good,"Kohls is a very easy, passive job. Great for anyone looking for part time that doesn't ask too much physically or mentally. This is one of the few places in which you can get paid as high as kohls pays and work as little as you can imagine. Great staff, high turnover, and management overall is helpful. The single hardest part of this job is dealing with boredom."
good,The job was very easy no experience was needed. My first warehouse job and I would recommend it highly. The only bad thing was the commute because I live so far away.
good,"My experience is not the typical experience working for Kohl's. I was in a unique position where I knew how to do everything in the store and was able to come in any shift that I worked and no one would bother me because I knew what I had to do. I knew what was expected of me and what my managers and supervisors wanted because I was able to read them very well. I learned so much working there about many parts of the retail business. Customer service, merchandising, visual presentation and especially what went on behind the scenes because that was a large part of my job. I only ever had three issues with managers the entire time that I worked there (3+ years). My advice to anyone that works at Kohl's or is going to is to make sure that you have clear instructions from the supervisor in your department. Working there, you effectively have 6-7 people above you that can delegate what you do. Luckily they're not all usually there at the same time. What I'm getting at is that the supervisors and managers aren't always in sync because they all have different priorities. Watch out for that. In fact, that is one of the hardest parts of the job; dealing with the managers. One wants you to do one thing, another needs you to do another. That one over there says you need to be done with what you're doing in ten minutes even though you know it will take twenty. Just kindly check them and let them know it will be longer than that. They expect too much in too little time, which is something very common in the industry but hey, it is what it is. It's chaos, and that is the most enjoyable part"
good,This is the place to work at if you're looking for lots of work hours. As well as endless hours on your feet. Although the pay could be better for the amount of work that is done.
good,I don't really have anything to say other that the discount was the only perk. Employees changed more often then not. Overall it's an average place to work. They are involved in the community and give back so for that they get a thumbs up.
good,Learned a lot while working at Kohl's. OK company to work for. Not enough advancement opportunities. Part time associates don't get any benefits and the pay is low on average compare to other retailers.
good,"They people I worked with was amazing the company itself sucked though, it is a revolving door of people coming and going. Few are still there that I worked with because of the company itself."
good,"I enjoyed working for Khol's, but when I asked off with advanced notice to go to my 94 year old grandmothers birthday they refused despite never asking off before in over 8 months of work. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. My schedule was very limited in hours so my income was extremely low. Over hiring at holidays causes a lot of lost hours."
good,"Although the pay is generally low, as with many entry-level jobs in America, the environment is good. Many other employees are helpful. The management can sometimes fail to understand the troubles of new associates, but this quickly dissipates once they know."
good,"It's a nice work place but the don't pay much. You  get a seven cent rise after one year. ( Yea, you hear me seven cent )...You will get hired to work in one department but end up working in ever department."
good,If you need a part time job with easy money this is a good place to go. I worked a lot of hours during the weeks that had holidays but it eventually slows down.
good,"10 hour day"
good,The people I work with are excellent and very supportive. They don't hesitate to help out wherever needed. However the priorities of the management and supervisors often conflict leaving the associates confused or caught in-between. Overall a nice place to work and I am learning a lot.
good,This is a fast paced environment. The customers are great and frequent often. You get to know most by name. The managers are nice but could use customer service training on how to talk and respect the employees. A nice place to work if you are flexible.
good,My request to work 20 hours a week or more was promised. Not many of us were given enough hours. I did enjoy the other employees. I appreciated the time some employees gave when I had questions.
good,"Place had a funny smell and was kind of dirty, there were mouse traps in the break room.  Employees were nice for the most part, however some felt a sense of authority that they didn’t have. Overall it was a nice place to work though, those were the only problems I had."
good,"A typical day (or night) usually started in the Cafeteria where the assignments were given out.   Then we would all go to our assigned areas to work,   There were Breaks a couple of times during a shift or half shift."
good,"Uptight coworkers constantly rude, jealous of pay rate and drama every day amongst adults. typical office job with none of the benefits. Would not recommend"
good,I was a cashier @ sometimes they had me working on the floor by putting items away.The hardest thing was when people tried to use expired coupons.I liked my co-workers.
good,"A very busy place to work, always on the move, always busy. We have a yes we can attitude, trying meet the customers needs. Management is very accomodating and helpful."
good,I loved my job up until the last year. The management team picks favorites and makes it well known by cutting hours and just overall treatment of the employees.
good,"I worked at Kohls in customer service and as a cashier while I was in college. It was an okay part-time job, I enjoyed helping people in customer service."
good,Kohls was a nice place to work but the training could have been better and so could the communication between management and employees.  Too stressful at times and too much favoritism shown to some employees.
good,"I got to learn more than just customer service.  I was able to learn freight, change e-signs, handle cash drawers, help other employees with any questions when it came to problems with customers."
good,"I worked a very brief time in the store, but my time spent there was well deserved. I learned a lot about retail and business but found it difficult to move up since employees are similar to a rotating door."
good,always something to work on. Unloaded truck. put freight out. moved shelves.  We did online orders. Made sure the store was clean and the tables were nice and neat.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Before I had my baby, I loved working at Kohl's when I came back to work I had long ago made my decision to breast feed which would mean pumping while away from the baby. When I came back after breastfeeding and them realizing it was an inconvenience they cut my hours and continually made me feel uncomfortable about asking to be allowed to take my breaks. One manager even had the audacity to make a big deal about it loudly in front of other associates and customers."
good,"Enjoyed the fast pace and the opportunity to advance in the managerial aspect. Unfortunately, due to the constant changes in style and fashion, a retail business that is understaffed can cause difficulty when trying to balance work and family."
good,"Straight forward instructions, attention to details when handling money for each register. A typical day at work feels like a long day because there never appeared to have sufficient coverage for what was necessary to achieve. Each associate is is expected to do their job well and efficiently, however there is not much chance for advancement. My coworkers are always willing to take on more tasks but are not always given the opportunity to do so."
good,"It was fun and energetic, just at times it got very hectic. A typical day at work was extraneous. Although at times this job was hard, i learned that with constant hard work I can achieve a desirable goal."
good,"Was hired as a seasonal cashier, which I was fully accepting of and happy to have. However, training is minimal. Information regarding requirements and expectations is not given clearly. I was trained by a cashier who had less than one year of experience and she did not give me any of the information regarding store credit card expectations, breaks, what to do during slow times, etc. There were some really great people who worked there and some that were very difficult to get a long with. I was thankful to have the job at the time and did enjoy working for the most part, but I felt lost a lot of the time. You weren't even notified if they would like to keep you on, you just stopped being on the schedule. I would have liked to have been notified that such and such was my last day. But no. More organization would have been nice and training."
good,Received good hours and discount on purchases. Thought i was put on register too soon for black friday.good company to work for.
good,It was a small crew but everyone got along and the time went by fast.  It was satisfying to get the job done.  Sometimes after we had a big truck the following time we worked we would have a free lunch.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls. It's a perfect place for students or people who needs to make extra money. No stress working there. Most of the employees were very friendly. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Not for everyone. Truly a rough work day. It was a nice environment but not for me. No cellular service in building, not enough people working at once to help everyone."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's. I only work part-time and wish I had more hours and more pay. Co-workers usually mind there own business. Managers are helpful when needed. I am a people person so this is a great experience for me. I don't really like the rotating hours but this is retail. Great discounts for employees.
good,"Lacks a true management organization and the company lacks any direction in how to compete with other companies in the same line of business, millions wasted at each store for a cheap remodel and stores do not meet ADA shopper needs."
good,"Kohl's has great benefits and overall was a great company to work for.  They would promote a healthy work/life balance, but I found it was difficult to take any time off due to lack of coverage in the department."
good,"this job is great if you are looking to work early mornings as a second job, not really much hours available. They don't really give a lot of opportunity to grow"
good,khols was based on commission. how much khols cash cards you can sale was very difficult. i did learn how to process clothing as in folding and how to hang
good,"Working at Kohls was a fun place to work, interacting with customers,  co-workers would get together outside of work, management was very pleasant.  The hardest part about the job was leaving because the pay was minimum wage and I was trying to support a family of four."
good,everyday starts the same. stocking the back room and filling the sales floor. learning how to open a store from the ground up. management is fair. my co-workers help everyone. the hardest part is to keep the store clean. the most I enjoy of this job is the people I worked with.
good,"It is a good place to work, but unfortunately its not a permanent job, nor do they offer that for anyone except management"
good,"This was my first PT position, so it took some time getting used to not getting a regular schedule. Shortly after I was there I really appreciated the teamwork between all the staff members."
good,"i loved working at Alsco,my job consisted of making sure all linen that came into my station was clean properly cleaned.id run linen into dry feeder to be pressed and folded.co workers all got along with onr another and managment seemed to care about workers."
good,Great management truly cared for employees. Upper Management is involved with associates lives and career aspirations
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I went to work at Kohls during the Christmas season,  It was very busy which i enjoyed but the standing killed me.  Wasn't used to it.  After Christmas I only received maybe 5-6 hrs a week.  Needed more money."
good,"Good hourly wage, easy to transfer, learned a lot. Unfortunately, a good wage means little if you work 4.75 hours a week. Dedication and  doing a good job for Kohls means nothing. Fellow associates are great, however, management  needs improvement."
good,"Kohls was my first job once I turned 16, and as far as jobs go, a good first job to start at. It was a customer service job, one that dealt heavily with customers as they shopped, which was a good fit for me. I enjoyed speaking with the customers as they shopped, and helping them out as much as I could."
good,Teamwork was great. People are fun to be around. There are advancement opportunities that are difficult to get.
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting every customer that comes into our store and processing their purchases accurately, efficiently,  and in the least time possible. As a cashier at Kohl's I learn something new everyday. I learn new skills to deliver excellent customer service to our customers. I enjoy working with my management team and co-workers everyone is very friendly and willing to help each other to get the job done."
good,Replenishment was a pretty much simple job. It's all about stocking all the boxes that came down the converter on all floor levels of the floor on a timely matter. Everyone was respectful of each other. It became difficult with the 11 hours of standing and working seven days in a row. It wasn't something enjoyable for me it was work.
good,"Not too bad to work for, if you don't need to live on your wages."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for as they helped me with balancing my classes and my work hours. At Kohl's I have been able to learn most of the departments from all the floor areas to customer service to price changes and ad sets. Retail work has good and bad times depending on the customers but my managers and co-workers make it worth all the negative customers. My favorite part of the job is making customers happy.
good,Productive and fun. Kohl's gives out Yes You Did papers which are pieces of paper you get when a associate or management see you doing a  good job.
good,Kohl's was a productive job and through my time there I learned a lot about sales and where I wanted to grow in my future career.
good,"A typical day at work was organizing merchandise, and interacting with customers. I excelled in customer sales."
good,"unloaded the truck and put the merchandise away"
good,"Assembly work, very repetitive, overall enjoyable job."
good,"The average day at Kohl's as loss prevention consisted of using CCTV along with floor surveillance to spot possible theft. From working at Kohl's I learned skills in working in coordination with floor associates to sweep fitting rooms for missing merchandise and/or removed security tags. The management at Kohl's was supportive, but when attempting to work on personal development within the company the support was gone. The hardest part of the job was relaying on floor associates to accurately inspect fitting-rooms once a subject exits while maintain surveillance on subject through CCTV, along with the lack of support. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new techniques in retail loss prevention."
good,I enjoyed the responsibility and challenges to climb the ladder.
good,I was a seasonal employee . It was an Ok company to work for but not alot of room to move up .
good,I clocked in and made sure there was no shelves bare. I learned how to look at floor plans. We helped each other out the employees. The managers  trained you to work registers and stock shelves to help out. The hardest part of the job was the stock room learning were everything was. I enjoyed how the managers showed their employees how much they care by always providing lunch for us.
good,I worked with some really great people but most of the mangement team were hard to work with. The HR was great and a very hard worker but the chance of advancement was not as easy as it could be.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Retail work is difficult because of standing alot and picking up after customers.
good,Kohls is a good place to work. My co workers were nice as well as supervisors. Overall its a very good work environment.
good,Love the co-workers and my managers! A typical day is busy but fun your never bored (:
good,loved working as a team player;an had wonderful friendships
good,"I love working at the store i worked at, except that management was always so stressed out and grumpy. It was easy to see and easy to feel because the way orders were given were usually rude. there's hardly any appreciation. aside from that, we had one of the best teams in the district. everyone cared about their jobs and was hard working. we were all like family which made it easy to come in and work. training people and passing on my knowledge was one of my favorite things to do. anything with my name on it has to be great and has to have 150% of my effort. I Love my job, but it's becoming a mindless job. i've done everything there is to do. Time for something new."
good,I had a sense of honor working for Kohl's I helped build up the store. Then I helped ran it. I enjoyed it at plenty of times and had bad days. But it felt like my first true job. My biggest complaint was it didn't really value me enough to try to keep me. I needed more money and a meager retail pay wasn't going to cut it anymore once I found my worth.
good,"It is a great place to work, people are friendly and the company really works with your schedule. There are not many advancement opportunities. Too many expectations."
good,"Enjoyed working here, just wish it was more organized. Everyone had a title as MANAGER, or at least acted as if they were. The people who were managers, should have taken more classes on respect for fellow employees, and friendliness."
good,Working at kohl’s helped me get my foot into customer service but the management wasn’t very understanding in difficult situations and had me working till 1:30 AM on school nights.
good,This is great for team effort in the workplace. Low pay but able to pickup shifts when needed. A lot of work for 9-10$ an hr but is a great cleanly and friendly environment.
good,"I enjoyed working here very much once I learned the basics of the job. Unfortunately there is no training period to speak of and for seasonal employees especially I found that to be the general opinion. I was expected to work on Thanksgiving and Black Friday as my first days on the job with so little training that I am afraid the customers suffered as much as I did. It turned out to be a learn-as-you-go kind of thing and really was trained by other employees as I went. Not a great way to start, since there was so much to learn and a VERY BUSY season where you really needed to be on your toes at all times. By the time I felt confident working alone it was almost over! I hope other seasonal help has a better experience than I did."
good,I worked on the shipping department. Specifically the jackpot area. Where we had to fix any orders that’s was not out in the system correctly. The good things about the company they offer great benefits. The bad thing about the company it was to unorganized the workers was unprofessional.
good,Your day starts with a group stretch. They have a strong belief in team work. Most things you’ll do on your own but you always have a good back up help. Management was very helpful with questions and tips on how to improve your skills and performance. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Kohl's is a very nice place to work, however I feel there is no room for advancement unless maybe after 5 or more years of employment. Very thankful for the opportunity it has provided me. I was able to learn a few things which will allow me to grow into the next stage of my career."
good,"It is a learning experience, stressful at times, I work with the consumer directly which can be the most difficult part. Work load at times is overwhelming and unrealistic but I do my best to complete the task at hand. I maintain a clean and appropriate department. Vendors often comment how nice my department is compared to other stores."
good,"Very young atmosphere, boopy lazy teenagers with disrespectful behavior towards management. Slow paced always folding clothes. Great for a part time job just looking to get out of the house or a older person either retired or who just needs 10-15 hours."
good,Kohl's works well around student schedules and is very accommodating to those looking to take on extra shifts throughout a week. Being paid weekly was nice.
good,Kohl’s is a place where you can learn customer service and get familiar with handling situations for customers. It is a good experience for someone who hasn’t worked somewhere and is looking for a good place to start!
good,I was able to pay off my bills. I received a lot of experience.  I enjoyed management.  We were able to accommodate members with their wishes.  A lot of good sales
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The hardest part about the job is needing to stay past store closing time which can be up to 3 hours putting all the recovery away. Which means that if the store closes at 10pm and on kronos it says your shift ends at 10:30, on weekend days expect to still be working till almost 1:30 am. This is dangerous for people who take public transportation home. "
good,"Thankful for the opportunity to work and gain experience, i had been unemployed for months. I was given the opportunity to work as cash office clerk and gained valuable experience."
good,"One should be appreciated for their tenure and dedication; but NOT!"
good,"The customers that come in are interesting most are nice but dang do some take their discounts seriously. "
good,"Great management, low pay minimum wage, ideal place for college student or high school student. Low hours. Not a career place to go to. What was enjoyable was helping customers everyday."
good,I worked on the freight team which was okay if you only needed a little household income. They received about one to two trucks in a week and I never worked past 8 hours a day. The start pay as of July 2018 is $9 an hour.
good,"the store was often understaffed, which made your job very stressful especially when the store got busy and there was no one around to help move people through the line in a timely manner.  You had to push the store credit application on customers, which I hated doing because you can't force a customer to have a credit card they do not really want.  If you did not get many credits, you were often criticized and belittled and asked why you didn't get them.  If you called of sick, you are yelled at and made to feel guilty even if you are an employee who is dependable and never skips work unless they have a legitimate reason.  When you had a day off, you were often called to come into work and cover someone else's shift."
good,If you are in need of a quick and easy job just to get you on your feet then Kohl's is it. If not be aware it is really hard to advance and they are constantly hiring which cuts your hours.
good,"employees are friendly and easy to get along with."
good,"Coworkers are great and a lot of team work. Never enough on staff so always busy. Little to no recognition from management unless you open credit cards. More emphasis is put on meeting goals that make management look good than setting realist expectations. Flexible scheduling for people with other jobs or in school, but weekend availability is typically required to be even considered for hiring. AMAZING employee discounts and sales"
good,My experience working at Kohl's went well overall. The environment was usually fast-paced and there was always something to do whether in your assigned department or somewhere else. Management was helpful and supportive.
good,The schedule was all over the place and i was not given enough hours. I dont know who has the ablility to work such different and few hours and can live on that little bit of money
good,"Most of the coworkers were wonderful to work with. The environment was nice. Many of the customers were frustrating, but it was enjoyable overall. The season was hard and fairly stressful."
good,"Great company to work for, very flexible with scheduling, and are always willing to work with school schedule and life schedule. Great work environment with encouraging coworkers."
good,Kohls is great job for anyone interested in customer service. Offers great training for any new process that is coming out. Kohl's has great leadership and promotion opportunities. Friendly environment where management is always making their presence known.
good,Not too bad for a starter job - nice discounts and they do seem to care about their employees. I will say that their hours were not the best and they frequently changed managers when I was there.
good,"Don't expect much but work, work, and more work.  All you do is work and witness others trying not to work hard.  Working hard was a great distraction."
good,It was nearly impossible to get decent hours. they were always hiring people and never giving hours to people who had been there awhile. the only people who ever got full time hours were managers.
good,Getting to know the people there is really great. But seasonal hires only receive on average less than 10 or 15 hours a week.---------------------------
good,A very fast pace environment and stressful place to work at. A great store to shop at and many valuable skills to learn. Enjoyed the discounts aspect of the job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was good. Kinda sucked sometimes, but overall good. They gave lots of breaks in the beginning but then got lazy with it after a while. Pay is okay."
good,Would go into work had fixed tasks was able to learn more assignments on top of what assignment I was already trained for. The management was great made sure everyone stayed working and no one was under too much pressure.
good,Kohls is a great job with great people unfortunately they do not pay more than minimum wage and there is no room for advancement at all. I'd love to stay there but the pay is terrible
good,"nothing special. It was just a seasonal position as a little vacuum basically. I was just putting clothes back on the racks, and helping people in the fitting room."
good,"start at 6am to 4pm never knew what job I was going to be doing or on for that day. management was good and nice. it was just fast pace job, order had to be out on time."
good,The management is horrible! I wold never try to go back to work there for as long as the current manager is there. The job is great for people who are still in school.
good,Through the years I had LOVED my job. Everyone I worked with was willing to go above and beyond and beat any expectations that we had. The company does a great job cross training its employees to set them up with the skills they will need to either develop with the company or attain another job in the future.
good,The most enjoyable time with the job is meeting nice new people and work friendly.  I learn easily and adapt well when working in a different area learning new job tasks . I keep myself busy when a work day is slow..
good,I love working there!. We weren't allowed to cover for any department but our own. It was a good schedule to follow. The management sometimes were micromanaging our department when they haven't got a clue what they were talking about sometimes. It was kind of weird. It was like them telling you how to take care of your own child.
good,"Pay was bad, for a company that size, company worries more about selling to the customer at any cost, then it does about taking care of its employees. I was able to branch out into different areas, which meant that I could offer more to the company, however the managers I had at the time didnt work that way. It was very high school click kind of work environment. Which unless you are in high school or college doesnt really work in the work field. I feel that you should move up in a company by what you can offer that company not who your best friend is."
good,fun and exciting place to work if your looking for something part time and not to work a lot but if you have bills it not a great place to work the pay was not that good and couldn't make ends meet
good,"The managers worked with my class schedule every semester which helped me in college. I had the honor of working with a lot of interesting individualizes in both management and associates. hardest part of the job was they were usually under staffed due to hour cuts and because they helped with the everyone's busy schedule, most people had set shifts."
good,Great management internship. Learned a lot and very hands on. Was able to take over a certain department and then come up with a plane to grow sales. By the end of the internship looked through financial statements to see the success of the business plan unfold.
good,its a decent environment and has potential to be even better. the people are mostly friendly. time flies because we are allowed to listen to music while we work.
good,"Overall, not a bad experience; however, the lack of communication and accountability within the executive level management made the job impossible. "
good,Kohl's is a very friendly place to work. The workers always have a bright face and they are very welcoming. It is a very well-kept store and it is a good environment to be in. It is kid-friendly and family-oriented. Customers are usually satified with our work and we try our best to keep them happy. Our bosses treat us fairly and equally and they make us feel like family. Working hours are not too stressful and the pace is balanced.
good,"The employees that are in that store are expected to pick up the slack left by the void of employees. This means working in unplanned areas of the store or working in parts of the store that an associate may not have been fully trained in. This does, however, give you a chance to show off your abilities and other strengths that the managers may not have been aware of beforehand."
good,"In my time here, I spent a lot of the slow days getting to know the other associates, and the way each of them interact. In a typical day at work, you rely on these established relationships to have a cohesive and efficient work day. Management, while strict, is always there to help you achieve your daily goals. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the markdowns and the inventory changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with such great personalities."
good,"I loved the people i worked with and i liked having different departments to work in and itvwas always clean. But It was i only got one raise in two years,it wad only ten cents andbI knew how to do everything in the store."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"You are promised far more hours than you get. Employees also become manager favorites and it becomes problematic. When you work with who you like, your work days are great. Employees form cliques with each other. You will enjoy your job here, it is not awful. Cutomers are usually pretty friendly."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's is very slow, but can become entertaining. The culture of the work place isn't mixed or well rounded at all. Kohls needs you to get credit which depended on how many hours they will give you. Many people do not want to sign up because they are scared."
good,"Kohls is a great place with great discounts,unfortunately I didnt get enough hours to stay, I worked there for 8 months and our manager Diane was sad to see me leave"
good,"i liked this job, i worked here when i was in high school so i wasnt able to work very much with school and everything, but they always let me pick up hours if i needed to and they were a great to work for"
good,"I started working at Kohls in a seasonal position. I really liked it because the hours were great. They kept me past seasonal and I was grateful for that, but my hours were cut and I needed more. Overall the management team was great and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Was good at first then the management started to switch up and things went downhill from there. Once we got the new manager, they changed everything up and had power issues."
good,I met a lot of great customers. Coworkers were friendly and work was decent. Management lacked in communicating to one another and definitely chose favorites.
good,There is to many people telling you different things that should be just the manager.  When asked to train in other areas you are not really   given the chance.  The supervisors are allowed to acted to much in a managers position and that makes it hard to work for the company.
good,Made over 100 hundred apprehensions in the 6 months I worked there. It was a great opportunity to work in a team setting using the Cameras to monitor people stealing. We used Radios and cellphones to communicate important information and make apprehensions. We also worked with the Portland Police.
good,"kohls is a great place to work under the right management. The holidays are a great time to work, lots of available hours. Once that time period ends, they are VERY stingey on hours. Raises are a joke. $0.03 raise at my one year mark. Never late, and positive customer reviews constantly... and I was worth $0.03."
good,I appreciated the department store showing me how to use a cash register but I was disappointed they could not keep me after season ended.
good,It was a friendly environment to work work for and great customer service. I really enjoyed our team and the team work that took place at the time of employment.
good,Kohl's department stores is a great place to work and you will meet so many great people. A typical day includes providing great customer service to everyone encountered. We all go the extra mile to make sure all our customers feel excited about Kohl's retail products! The most difficult part of my job at Kohl's is keeping the store organized with so many people shopping. My co-workers are outstanding to work with as a team overall.
good,"Kohl's is a standard first job, nothing special about it but there's also nothing really wrong with it. The coworkers and management were nice but dealing with the holiday crowd, particularly on black friday, usually left you feeling exhausted and irritated at the end of the day."
good,"Pro's: ability to advance quickly, friendly coworkers"
good,"Never know what to expect, each day brings something different.  I learned the importance of setting goals and sticking to a plan. The managers are helpful with completing tasks. The hardest part of the is covering the entire store alone. The best part of the job are A.I.A events, volunteering trips."
good,"kohls is great place to work and the management is awesome!  working with a great team make, make the job easier. everyday is a new day to learned about the changes of the company."
good,"An overall excellent first step into the working field.  I started when I was young and out of high school, and they have served me well for my years there. Like any job, there is often management trouble, but nothing patience can't overcome. There is opportunity for in-store advancement, but a glass ceiling is reached quickly, with less compensation then is deserved for the responsibilities."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was, they worked with my schedule. I enjoyed working with the wide variety of customers to ensure a pleasure shopping experience at our store."
good,I love working at Kohl's and the people I work with. But it's impossible to make a living with the amount of hours they offer.
good,"Coworkers are great make the day go by extremely quick, customers are usually awesome and have very few dramatic problems."
good,"Working for Kohl's was a very good opportunity for me, I learned quite a bit while I was there. I learned how to communicate with customers and I learned how to help them achieve satisfaction while shopping at the store."
good,very place to work the environment was very good. the customers and the management team was also great. I would work with them again. the pay was not that great
good,I work with a great group of people. They are always there to help out as a team working together. The best part of the job is working together as a team.
good,"Kohls Is generally a ok place to work. However there is little room for advancement. Management is pushy with credit, but so is every other store that solicits credit."
good,Great. Flexible schedule. Routine day. Learned to be more accepting of differences. Management was ok. Co-workers were interesting. The hardest part of the job was dealing with immature co-workers. The most enjoyable part was the discounts.
good,"I am a a cashier at Kohl's. My typical day at work involves checking out customers, explaining our policies, offering them a discount, providing great customer service, always being polite as well as friendly and having a warm/welcoming attitude. I absolutely love working at Kohl's, since the bosses are very flexible with hours and also understanding about your personal life. Working during the holidays are exciting and can really give you an adrenaline rush, especially when your surrounded by happy go lucky coworkers and sometimes even the customers. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the pay and raises, all of the associates work very hard, but our pay doesn't resemble that. Also hours are not evenly distributed between all associates."
good,Worked as a cashier.  Worked with customers to check out the product they wanted or helped them find the product that they want.  management helped when cashier had questions or needed a code keyed in.  Co-workers were fun to work with.  Kept busy with customer by greeting them or checking them out.  During down time kept busy with cleaning up store around the register.  The hardest thing about this job is when a customer becomes frustrated about uncontrollable problems. Such as if they couldn't find something in the store that they wanted.  The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and getting to listen to how there day was going.
good,"The company doesn't really respect their associates in the store. The cutting of hours and sudden hikes in hours are insane and hard to keep up with. They advertise in the store over the intercom that it's a fun, fast paced work environment with flexible hours. I was a full time and part time student during my time with Kohls and never have I ever been so surprised by how false an advertisement was. They didn't want to work with my schedule. They asked for my availability. Approved of my available hours and said that they would do those hours when I was hired. They completely disregarded them and either stacked the hours on above my availability or cut them so low I couldn't make rent for the month. I ended up quitting school because I needed the money with my job. Yet still, they never worked with my hours. "
good,Very simple job and enjoyable yet new people are constantly being brought in. I would continue working here 2 days a week specifically for the discounts. although the company is very disorganized
good,It was a nice place to work and also a nice discount.  I made lifelong friends there not just with coworkers but with customers too.
good,"-fast paced "
good,"Very friendly staff and management who actually treat you like a human being, not like a faceless worker. Good volunteer program; a very generous company that's all about the community"
good,The Kohl's I worked in was a brand new store that opened up.  It was a beautiful location with great people but a solid base had not been established within the time I spent there to make the store a success at that time
good,"This was a great job if you were good at it.  Some people it takes longer to learn.  For those that take longer to learn you were chastised and scolded.  Many employees are let go for being too slow in their job.  I loved working at Kohl's because it was easy for me to do what they asked of me.  However, the long shifts on some days, and closing so late was not enjoyable."
good,I was a seasonal worker at Kohl's in Modesto. The supervisors were always yelling and pushing that we get credits. Some of the coworker were helpful but a huge majority slacked and made others pick up their work.I found out that I was no longer a employee because my discount card stopped working. No one gave a warning that the seasonal workers time would be up soon. I worked for a month and a half only.I love the company but honestly the management could improve.
good,"customers were awesome, employee's have lack of communication, but somehow the job gets done, but there's still a lot of go backs in one area."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,typical day at work is cleaning and making sure thing departments are clean and well organized also checking out customer with there purchases also helping customers with an undesired opinions about what clothing to buy management were very flexible and always helped out my co-workers were a bit lazy but not bad people the hardest part of the job was pleasing the customer the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on my customers face when they left the store.
good,"co wrks are great to be around. asked to wrk in departments that you have no training in. teach yourself at register , unfriendly vibe from some managers, learn on ur own didnt give much training. angry customers. a lot to remember. ok pay, stand all 8 hrs,"
good,Sometime we would go hours with out work but there then that it was a good place to work.
good,"It's been a good place to work and I learned a lot.  I would recommend this type of job to others."
good,"I enjoyed working in my department, but the retail hours finally got to me, and the holiday hours were long and stressful. My manager was awesome and was a great help. Employee discount was good."
good,"nice people, high turnover rate resulting in poor training"
good,"I learned how to expertly operate the point of sale system implemented by the department store. My customer service skills were perfected in this environment and I even received bonuses for attaining customer loyalty. My co-workers, managers, and I got along great, but the drive   and pay proved not to be worth it. My favorite part of working here was when I was allowed to market merchandise and use my eye for design."
good,It was a retail seasonal job. recovering the sales floor at the christmas holiday season.
good,Management sucks they didn't care about the employees and the pay is horrible for the hours and work you put in.
good,I was responsible for delivering excellent customer service and assisting customers with anything they needed. I helped market and promote specials and sales that we had going on in stores. I also have a lot of cash handling skills as well.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls as a second job. They were flexible with my schedule for the most part and I liked the Kohls-Cares volunteer program. "
good,its was good while it lasted only a couple mounths during peek then let go due to being to slow
good,"Very Customer Service oriented. Works well for college students for scheduling. Management is nice, they absolutely back you up when you're right, but will also concede to an angry customer."
good,I love that the company does do community volunteer.There are reprocautions if you ask for time off.
good,"It was nice only they hire alot for seasonal positions, but you stay busy...... kohls bucks!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Work consists of training, implementing new procedures, and supervising of Loss Prevention Officers. In this position I have learned a lot on the logistical side of Operations, Transportation, and Loss Prevention. I have been able to help train in areas outside of department based on the knowledge that I have gathered throughout the years. The best part of my job is having interaction with all of the employees,"
good,"I spent almost 9 years with this company, and they do offer health benefits, 401k/stock options, discounts, and personal/vacation time. However, the management always treats the employee like cattle. There is a serious disconnect in leadership and employee appreciation. This is not only limited to one individual store, but the poor leadership goes up the ladder of executives. Everyone puts the business first, and the people last. Whereas the company prides itself in being there for its employees, and wanting to aid in furthering people's careers, they prove that they could truly care less. "
good,"Cashier/Sales Associate, stocking and organizing sales floor, assisting customer around store and advising customers products in store."
good,Best job I've had in 20 years. I actually enjoy getting up and going to work every day there.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"On a typical day I would sort inventory, organize and return to sales floor. I also help customers with sales and products as well as the promotion of our in store and online promotions."
good,"The company has good customer service values, but little to no room for advancement. The pay is not great nor the benefits."
good,Was able to go to college and work part time. Worked on the floor in the kids department and keeping it clean. Had great co-workers.
good,"dressing room, cashier,how to use there computer,customer service,"
good,"Good training, advacement, organize, good teamwork atomsphere,"
good,A typical day at work is a customer first job.
good,"As a whole, Kohl's is a wonderful corporation, valuing diversity, environment and community."
good,Unloading truck is fun fast paced work..Co-workers were fun to work with. Most enjoyable part of job was the teamwork that is involved with unloading and merchandising truck. Knowing that co-workers goals were to work efficiently and effectively together was great.
good,If your seasonal they make you work every single holiday even if you cry to the manager and request off weeks in advance. Even though they only said black friday was only day you couldnt take off. You have to work every single weekend also. Other than that I loved working there.
good,will comply orders from the floor manager and will direct the team on the fllor on what to do. weekends were a must. Job culture is varied depending on shift.
good,"Like most big companies, especially from October to December! Peak-Time!"
good,"Its an okay place to work. I needed a quick job, and that exactly what this was. I would say, If you aren't the type of person that can stand for almost 10 -12 hrs, then don't waste your time. This is a job that requires you to move constantly, so stretching is key."
good,Kohl's is a good place to work when starting off in retail. You can work and grow there. Wonderful working environment and friendly employees. Fast paced work.
good,This department store has great management they are extremely helpful and friendly however they require an impossible amount of credit card sales in a store where 90% of shoppers already have a credit card for the store. Working Hours are based on how many credit cards you are selling and they hire on more people then they can provide hours for. hours are often cut extremely short for the week.
good,"In two years in only got a raise of ,34 cents. Job environment is great. I had great co workers that I felt like my family. I had fun working at kohl’s but the payment is very disappointing"
good,"It was often a busy, fast paced environment. You constantly interacted with the public serving them with any need they had. It was a wonderful experience to learn different aspects of the job. I gained many more skills than I previously had. I enjoyed it immensely."
good,Being a cashier was great 👍 but couldn’t say much about it because I didn’t stay very long. Overrall good pay and great team work. Everyone treated me fairly and anytime I needed help someone would be available.
good,"I really enjoyed it, except the fact that I worked there as a seasonal associate during Christmas time. I was never introduced to a manager to ask for help and I was taught something the same day and was left alone to do it by myself. I would definitely go back, just not seasonally."
good,"Very little training and no one willing to show you anything, at least in the department I was in. The 'regulars'  seemed to get all the credit for doing the least amount of work."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Very friendly people and definitely room for advancement. Everyone is very professional and Kohls is very cultural diverse. The training team is one of of a kind.
good,"Working at Kohl's in Hoover was a great experience. I loved all of my coworkers and managers, every one was so welcoming and friendly. The only difficult part of working here is being on your feet all day and dealing with some unbearable customers. Sometimes you could find yourself stretched too thin with all that goes on in store but overall, a great experience and would definitely recommend this as a first job."
good,"Management is ok - scheduler was bad "
good,"IT invested heavily in a ""cloud transformation"" strategy.  This has driven all thought processes at Kohl's, sometimes to the point of silliness.   Outsourcing (India) is the prevalent method of achieving these goals.  This means little actual development work in the MKE offices, and less and less knowledge of how systems actually work remaining in MKE.  As the outsourced teams move on to other projects, Kohl's is left with systems that are expensive to maintain as little local knowledge is left.  This expense is causing management to eliminate relatively expensive local jobs, further causing loss of knowledge.  Bottom line for employees at Kohll's is a fragmented, confused, development team, strategically befuddled, with little local knowledge-base form which to work.  That said, work life balance is very good, pay is decent, and senior management is approachable."
good,"Working for Kohl's for many years I saw many sides of the company.  There are great management teams if you find the right store, but corporate pushes small budgets to the stores to maximize profit meaning employees are sometimes overworked and undervalued."
good,"It was a good part time job for me because it offered flexible schedules as competitive pay. Management was not too involved so whenever you had an issue with something, you were pretty much on your own."
good,Work-life balance is available in some areas. Too many upper-level positions and not a lot of room to advance. Lower paid employees have no chance of promotion unless they are will to move around.
good,Alot Of People most likely wont get hired on full time good job for the holidays though. I was a Equpiment operator. Stock picker i liked it and you can stay 12 hours if u choose
good,"Poor management, never felt completely accepted by all. You had to be liked by all upper manrement and possibly you had a chance there. No one cared about you as a person."
good,"Cashier, and merchandise handler. Offered great customer service and maintained a professional and safe environment. Helped customers find specific items and fulfilled online orders"
good,Flexible hours. Minimum pay. Good employee discounts. If you are looking for a place to work as a side job or don't need much hours kohl's is perfect. They usually work well with school schedules and such. If you need guaranteed hours this is not the place for you.
good,I loved my job at Kohl's except for the management at the time i left. It was super chill even on Black Friday! Everyone is super friendly but there is gossip like at every job. The management was very cliquey and if they didn't like you your hours were cut by a lot. I was on their good side for awhile but some stuff happened and ended up on their bad side. So my hours went from at least 24 a week to maybe 8 a month! So needless to say I had to find something else. I really miss the chill work environment and the cool people i worked with oh and the 15% discount.
good,"Manager needs to write down what a meeting is about. Cuz I am deaf. It’s important for me to know....."
good,"Worked at kohl's seasonal, great way to learn how to speak to customers along with learning how to keep your cool when customer is angry. Also learned how to keep the store organized."
good,"I had never worked in retail before, and this job showed me the ups and down perfectly. Although I did like my managers, the pressure to get customers to sign up for Kohl’s Charges was a bit overwhelming at times. The longer shifts can get extremely boring. If you follow directions well, you can work out a pretty nice schedule for yourself, at least you could at my location. I often gave myself a job, and stuck to it, usually that consisted folding and just tidying up."
good,They give additional discounts to employees which is nice only you make almost nothing. Definitely not a place for adults who have bills to pay or children.
good,Kohl’s was a fun working environment it had great employees to make friends with and had a great atmosphere. But when managers came around it was bad no one liked them because they treated us different they acted like they were better then everyone
good,"A company that does not promote from within,  not very good at training employees.  Most employees are self trained.  New hires are lost in their job description.  They are just thrown to the wolves, making it very hard to serve customers effectively"
good,Kohl's is alot of walking climbing stairs lifting bending pulling you are working around all types of different cultures different attitudes heated areas
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's retail, the customers are the hardest thing to deal with, the management is friendly. They pay is low if you need to survive off of it but its fine for students."
good,The management was fair. Co workers were ready to help you out if needed. Nice break rooms with vending machines. LP is always in the store which gives a sense of security
good,"Everything you could ever ask for with a job besides the pay and consistent hours provided. People are nice, hours are flexible, breakroom is cozy, but the pay is not a livable wage and an employee is NEVER given more than 36 hours per week. Great second job, and discounts."
good,"I worked there for over a year. I like my co-workers, but my managers do leave communication skills to be desired. That's what was most frustrating when you're waiting on them to at least acknowledge you when you're at any of the service counters and are with a customers. the workplace is friendly for the most part, as like all jobs, there's bound to be someone who bothers you."
good,Kohl's Warehouse is a good place to work if you can work well on your own and keep yourself paced. The hours was a little bit long but they did pay well for the work you did for them.
good,At the Kohl's I work at the management team is nice and helpful and lets each associate do their job without micro managing them.  They are also easily approachable when you have a question.
good,"This was my first job and most days were doing my job conintuusly. Keeping busy made the hours fly by and the pay was pretty good. Associates only got 15% off but during the holidays we got extra coupons. At the cash register, had to meet goals of having people sign up for credit cards."
good,I worked there for a short period of time because I was only a seasonal worker and they were over staffed. I liked the few people I got to talk to and enjoyed the work environment.
good,The pay is very low compared to other jobs around the area. Hours vary week to week. They do work with class and family schedules. The job at times can be stressful and fast paced.
good,"Mangers were friendly and understanding. It wasn't over crowded or stressful. loved working register made day go by faster, being on the floor kinda made the day drag on."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl during the holiday. It was fun and the people that I work with were always a team player. Everyone always came in with a positive attitude and made sure our customers were being assisted and helped.
good,"Everyday there was a start up meeting in your particular department.  Then you start working, it was warehouse work so it was hot during the summer and cold in the winter.  You were able to dress accordingly."
good,"Working at the service desk it gets hectic, with customers coming to me with their problems from purchases or online orders. I have learned so much about how retail sales work and the main retail skills plus extra skills from working back at the desk. Assisting customers with their bills and any questions they have regarding that, if i can't help them, i make sure they have the credit center's phone number that can help them with any problems that I don't have any control over. Ordering items for customers and assisting them get the products they need, checking other stores and online for available items. The hardest part about working at kohls is the holiday season, with black friday sales and customers adjusting their receipts before the craziness of the holidays. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping customers leave happy and with a smile on their face, knowing i did the best i could to assist them, and they appreciate it."
good,Kohls is a good place to work but the management can be iffy. Some coworkers are rude and most of the customers will be if they don’t get their way. Overall it’s an okay job.
good,"I got to work as a customer service representative.  I helped check people out, complete returns, and help with issues.  I have no complaints except for the games the management would have the workers play to increase sales and whatnot.  It felt like we were treated like children. I just wanted to do the best I could do to make the customer feel welcome and appreciated, but knowing there were competitions and things made it less enjoyable."
good,"The majority of my time was working with the public.  It was a fun place to work, was fast paced and has good management.  We all had a set department to work, mine was the shoe department although it was very important to be flexible due to not knowing what department was going to need additional help. After working there for a couple of months I spent most of my time as a cashier.  The manager felt that due to my customer service skills I was better suited to that position. Unfortunately the pay wasn't very good and they didn't offer any benefits."
good,"The person who was scheduling my hours didn't do a good job of scheduling during the first month but otherwise, it was a fun place to work. My coworkers were friendly and so were the managers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning out all of the fitting rooms and putting the clothes away, and going up to the registers and being a cashier if needed. I would also go to the misses, men's, and women's section of the store and organize that in a neatly manner."
good,"Kohls was my first job ever. i learned a lot about retail and how to deal with the public. i learned about returns, sales stock on items and how many retailers seem to market their products. I started in the mens department before moving to customer service. I would usually perform returns for customers and exchanges. After the constant headache of expired Kohls Cash (which to some people, its worth more than gold or actual money) i began working in the back and doing what kohls calls ""Omni"". I would pick and pack all of the in store pick up orders that were sent to the store."
good,Always required to sign someone up for a credit card if you're working the register. Too many managers. The holiday's are a mad house and are opened for 24 hours
good,"In the 6+ years that I have been affiliated with Kohl's Corp., I have seen many changes. However, I have found that communication is key to success with this company."
good,"It is a great place to work, honestly, the managers I had were great. But, the two male managers I had were by far some of the worst I have ever had. The store manager, he actually called me an idiot for missing work after my father got into a car accident. I loved most of it, but in the end, the few bad apples just spoiled the batch."
good,"I enjoyed working here because of the nice employees and everyone was very willing to help if needed. Not much room for improvement within the company, leaving because they hired many new people and cut hours overall."
good,Compensation and benefits are good. Kohl's tries to use a work life balance schedule and it doesn't always work. Have to work nights and weekends in the call center.
good,"This place depending on your position, you need to dress to impress. Warehouse workers not so much floor personnel totally. Management can be cool just depends on the day of the week."
good,Took this job as a seasonal employee.  I also like Kohl's for shopping.  The working atmosphere is fine.  You are pressured to get customers to sign up for the Kohl's credit card and they will hound you the whole time you work.  They even call you out by name if you haven't gotten any credits by the time your shift is over.  They do have regular treats and incentives in the break room.
good,"Super flexible hours, but management could be better. Accommodating to personal life agendas. Hours also vary weekly which can be inconvenient. Very inconsistent."
good,my experience wasn't bad. it is a good store and workplace. it wasn't enough hours being scheduled and the checks wasnt enough to live off of.i made the best out of it while i could but its not for me
good,A typical day at work could easily change if a scheduled associate called out.  As a service desk employee you would have to also cashier as well as service customers with returns and order pick ups.  I thought that was a great way to make sure that no matter what the shortage or situation with staff there was already a process in place so that customers were still provided with the highest level of service.
good,"Nice place to work for. Staff and management are very welcoming and caring. Working at Kohl's, you will become part of a family that will never leave you even after your time of employment is over."
good,I worked here years ago and have nothing bad to say. I enjoyed my job whether early in the morning or late until the morning. Everyone was very friendly from co-workers to customers. Depending on your dept. it can be physically demanding or hard to stay awake. All in all zero complaints.
good,"enjoyed working with the public, high turnover in staff.. The hardest part was putting out merchandise while assisting customers with limited staff. typical day never went as planned."
good,"Great Place To Work For High Schoolers Or Retired Individuals. Slow-paced, Relaxed environment that doesn't demand much. A bit hard on the body at times."
good,"Managers don’t really have work to be done that isn’t repetitive. Theft is high in this store. Managers don’t"
good,Kohl's is a good place to start for a first job. You get customer service experience as well as some cash handling. You have to work as a team as well.
good,"God Job, Good people, Good Money But They Don't Keep to many people long Due to their Lack of Business and Hours when The holidays and season work is gone...."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Very well family oriented company that helped me become a better sales associate and customer service provider the work isn’t the easiest at times but your tea is there to help
good,it is a good place to work it was very simple to learn and the'
good,"A typical work day at Kohls was pretty busy. Everyone I worked with there was friendly for the most part with the exception of a couple of managers. The cashier who trained me was awesome, she's great at what she does and loved by everyone there! The hardesatt part of working at Kohls was they ever changing schedule and hours. The most enjoyable part of working at Kohls was the customers. Getting to know the regular customers by name and being able to have friendly conversations with them was the best!"
good,I've worked there for almost a year know as a cashier. It's a very easy job and they're usually good about working with a school schedule. The pay wage is not enough for the amount of work you do.
good,I really liked working at Kohl's and received opportunities to work there 2 separate times. I really like working as a cashier and I also worked in the jewelry department.
good,"I worked for Kohls during the Holiday Season, hours were great, discounts were great. I loved working for the company. Unfortunately I was not available for hours they required I work."
good,"Fun place to work. Discounts are good.  Much pressure is placed on the management to solicit credit cards, though.  The more successful you are, the more hours you will be scheduled."
good,"I have worked at Kohl's for eight years at three different locations. Employees never receive the proper training needed to do the job properly or efficiently. Payroll is always an issue, with the exception of the week of Thanksgiving, the week of Christmas, and back to school-other than that hours are slim picking."
good,Working customer service was an easy job.  Working the truck was physically demanding. Some of the mid-level managers were great to work with but the upper-level store management was very poor.
good,It was a fun fast passed environment with a competitive side. You were expected to get several people to sign up for credit cards every day. Managers would often compare cashier's with one another.
good,It was fun to work at Kohl's but I was only part-time for the seasonal and they let me go after they said that they were going to hire me on part-time so I had to move along and I seen you guys are hiring so I would love to give it a try thank you
good,"Working for Kohl's was a wonderful opportunity. I learned a lot about customer service from a retail perspective and it also gave me hindsight on the life of someone in retail on a day to day spectrum. I definitely would recommend working for Kohl's, however, if you are not a fan of working during the holiday season then this job would not be a great fit for you."
good,"Working at Kohls was great. I was in between jobs and they hired me right away. Downfall was inconsistent hours (having to close the night before, and open the next day). Management was pushy to meet quotas for people opening credit card accounts."
good,This is a nice place to work but only if you're single with no kids. It's more for college students. Seasonal is the best time there is a lot of over time and shift exchanges.
good,"if someone is not pulling their weight it makes the job harder for the whole team everything flows like an assembly line. A typical night on 3rd shift would include clocking in and finding the manager on staff to see if its a freight night, price scan night, or overstock back stock night. everything moves fluently and the staff are all down to earth good people."
good,"I worked part time at Kohl's while taking care of my ill, elderly parents.  It worked for the time being.  I left after my dad passed away.  But the people I worked with were friendly and hard working."
good,"Cashiering merchandise to the public. "
good,"Really enjoyed the position at first and when I was able to learn other positions besides cashier, it was nice to learn customer service for returns then front end closer. Hours were cut drastically from 20 hrs + per week to 4 hrs (1 shift)."
good,I had great co workers and enjoyed my time at Kohls. It was very fast paced and I liked being busy.  Enjoyed working with customers and helping them find products.
good,"A typical day at work is putting out freight."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working in Jewelry dept., the customer are great and I get to interact with and help them make fashion decisions. In the beauty dept. we assist the customer in making beauty and health decisions."
good,The store is clean and it can be very busy. I like the morning huddles that management organize to motivate the employees. The pay is not good so I had to leave.
good,Very fast paced - production atmosphere. Hard working co-workers who were interested in each other. Very hard and strenuous work at times. Early morning hours were great!
good,"Nice people, need more training.  Was too far for me to drive for the number of hours I got and I would have rather they scheduled me on my days off from my primary job instead of on the same days."
good,It was a seasonal job but I love Kohls so I enjoyed my time there while it lasted. I might go back if I need to but it would be full time this time. Loved the discounts
good,"Kohl's is a fast paced environment most days."
good,Kohls is easy and fast pace work and I also enjoy working with my co workers. But I feel we don't get paid well enough for all of the work that we do.
good,"A great place to work, meeting new people, every day different, not the same thing everyday.  I learned strong customer service skills and have used those skills at all jobs I have worked."
good,"A typical day would be to hurry and start cleaning and rebooting hand guns early in the morning. Then you would have to go around exchanging batteries around the stations."
good,The employees were really kind and considerate and the management was okay; it just wasn't a very efficient workplace. I put in my two week notice and they called me a month later to ask if I was coming in for my shift.
good,Pleasant place to work. Management worked with me on my schedule because this was my second job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and customers were mostly cooperative.
good,Kohl's is a good company to work for. It is a family oriented business which allows a flexible schedule. The perks of working here are of course the amazing discounts.
good,"I like working At Kohl's, but the work is very easy.  I wouldn't say that I'm very challenged,which makes the day repetitive and a little boring. On the positive side, my coworkers are incredibly nice! I don't think I'll be staying at this job long though"
good,"as a disabled person, it is very hard to find a job that is understanding. I was first told that I would not be mistreated, but that was a lie. Because of having hearing loss as a disability, I lost all chances of working into management. Which I didn't know until i had applied and was rejected."
good,"It's a great place to work for a while but after a while the whole thing gets a little old. It's fast past and there is always something to do but the shifts can get weird like closing one night and opening the next. Also some weeks you get scheduled max hours and the next it's only ten. Management really depends on the store but in mine they were great but my training was horrible and was basically left to me and other employees to train me. They have employee appreciation weeks which can be fun but the only thing that they really care about is if you bet credits and are consistently bugging you if you didn't get a lot that week.    "
good,Consist changes. High pace work  environment.  Company always offering new and innovative merchandise to attract more customer. Great benefits offered to all card members.
good,"Cashier's are the important people of the stire, even though everyone was important. They was made to give out Kohl's credit cards that let the company sell things for lower price."
good,It was a great company to work for the culture and management was enjoyable to work with and I learned a lot of new skills. I enjoyed the discounts and working with the staff members.
good,All of the managers are very nice and caring. However there seems to be a lack of communication amongst management at times. There is an inconsistency in weekly hours and they don't always post the schedule in a timely manner. All of the workers (including management) seem to truly care about everyone and it feels like a giant family when you're working there.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Never really gave much opportunity for promotion. Favoritism played a big part. Hours diminished over time making it harder. Did accommodate to disabilities and was an easy job over all.
good,I love that face that Kohl's Corporation is one of the very few remaining companies that still pay every week. This is amazing because if your working another job you always are getting paid every week.
good,I understand that cleaning is part of my work responsibilities however I feel that every customer needs to spend one day in retail just like jury duty to understand and appreciate how much we do for them.
good,"On average, I have much to organize and put out on the floor.  I have learned the steps to push all merchandise out onto the floor as well as communicate with other on what the next step is in satisfying our customers.  Most of the other employees are very kind and hard working.  We all look after each other and make sure that we finish what needs to be done.  The hardest part of the job is making sure that as a team we get everything done in the order that our manager wants us to and in an efficient way.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others that care just as much about their job as I do about mine.  This ensures we will finish everything we need to, correctly."
good,This was a great place to work. You can start from one position and work your way up. You always have the opportunity to move up in the company. My store closed unfortunately.
good,I enjoyed working at kohl's because I learned how to deal with customers and how to be organized while working at your assigned department. Management was helpful but sometimes it was difficult to locate any member of management when certain issues emerged.
good,"Check in write down what you wearing and if you bring your own lunch "
good,"It wasn't a bad job but it wasn't an amazing job either. The work was what you would expect, hanging clothes and dealing with customers etc. Managers were really nice and helpful."
good,"·	Provide information about products and services, take orders, respond to customer complaints, and process returns."
good,"This was a very high volume call center."
good,"Normally was under scheduled for the misses, mens, and juniors departments; this caused closing the store to be hectic due to only 2 people max cleaning the three largest departments in the store. Management didn't seem to care about my focus on school at all, just the hours I could work. They would schedule me for times I said I couldn't come in which also caused me to fall behind in my schooling a little bit. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with keeping the fitting rooms cleaned out and clothes put away. The best part of the job was working with the other employees. They always kept everyone smiling and would help out when it was needed."
good,Most of the enployers and employees where helpful if you needed help with anything. And  a lot of friendly people. Just make sure you call in if you can't  work a day or two.
good,The great culture that Kohl's has is different from any other call center. The benefits are great and the pay is good. Overtime is available through out the year and opportunities for a bonus. Work life balance is practiced at times but overall a decent place to work.
good,"Kohl's has a great store culture and it is always easy to work hard when working with good people and friends. However, a lack of communication between manager and associate makes it difficult to do your job. There are too many different messages from different managers, and when asking for clarification, the supervisors always say to ask our store manager, who gives attitude and just says to ask whoever the floor manager is. Overall, it makes it very frustrating to work there because you never know what the direction will be that day. Also, it feels like the managers have no problem stepping over associates to please a customer and I understand our first priority is the customer, but we can still provide great service without feeling like we are mindless robots. On the plus side, their is always recognition when you complete a task or drive results successfully and I received several awards for this. The hardest part of my job was trying to solicit credit applications to customers, especially when they get frustrated but my supervisor would still want me to push until they say yes."
good,"I had a great time working for kohls, i loved my team of management, i really enjoyed my time here. I took great pride in my ability to merchandise really well."
good,"My co-workers were the most fabulous I' ve ever worked with. I will miss them dearly."
good,"I worked in 3 different locations.  "
good,"A typical day was that there was not a typical day. The hours and work schedules varied. I learned to take applications for charge cards, payments for charge cards, and quickly ringing up the customers purchases on the computer cash register. Management was positive and supportive of successes each cashier attained. My co-workers were supportive and positive to work with. The hardest part of the job was not getting the hours I needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"They did a lot of cross training on the job you never knew where where actually going to work when you clocked in. "
good,"I only work for them around Christmas, the money is great the overtime was a lot that time of year. I worked 12 hour shifts 5 days in a row. Co-workers are great."
good,Receiving inbound calls from customers who are trying to track their orders as well as trying to check their credit card balances
good,"Working at Kohls was fun, The people are very nice and accomodative and understanding. "
good,"This job was a nice job to start into. I loved the positive people who I worked with. However if credit goals were not met, the hours would go down. Management seemed more focused on the goals. and less on their employers who were doing everything in their power and job to make those goals."
good,"Open store, count the cash drawers, greet customers, keep track of co-workers breaks and lunches, answer questions and directed people where needed to be. Management was always willing to answer questions to help. Co-workes were always a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job, was not being able to help a customer find what they need or know they would leave dissatisfied. the most enjoyable was just learning the skills to help further future choices, and work a family like environment."
good,working for Kohls wasn't that bad but at times the management was rude and not helpful. The coworkers were great and I loved the environment but our store was a bit messy
good,I would assist in any way possible from unloading trucks to setting store modulars. I learned how to deal with a fast paced work environment. Management knew I could be counted on in every situation. Coworkers were nice and enjoyable. The hardest part was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was making an impact in different situations.
good,"Too much emphasis on obtaining email addresses and getting credit card solicitations. More times than not, the customers were already credit card holders. "
good,Each day consisted of cash handling and processing returns. Co-workers became family over the last year and half. Management could use some work personalizing with the staff and showing more appreciation occasionally. I learned a lot of different ways to make a customer happy and how to handle upset customers as well. Over some time I developed a team leader vibe and some of the co-workers enjoyed my leadership skills.
good,"Kohls was a great first job. I cleaned out fitting rooms and recovered merchandise, and worked the cash machine, also price changes, and truck, most importantly I interacted with costumers. Management is fine lots of changes going on when I left but I think it was a wonderful place to start out."
good,I work days and nights at Kohl's. Cashier during the day  and unloaded trucks and stocking at night. Had a great crew morning or the night crew.
good,"I worked in retail for almost six years, mainly because it was the only thing i was good at. That and being a people person, after years and years of working there management made a turn for the worst and i was beginning to feel unsatisfied and unappreciated in the work place. I need to find something bigger and better, The best part of that job was the people i met both my co workers and some of my regular customers. They made my job enjoyable."
good,"Unless you are a student or teenager who lives at home, it is hard to make a living when you aren't full time.  Store in general is upbeat and great at making new hires feel welcome.  You need to have totally open availability to move up, but once you reach full time, the benefits are great and definitely worth while.  At my store, we love to cross train, so you can normally work multiple departments a week if you aren't a fan of sticking to one area."
good,If you can deal with the changes and are a people person its a good place to work. The company is run well and has grown a lot so there is apportunity there.
good,"-Highly charged pace"
good,Kohls was a good part time job. I learned a lot about jewelry. I spent most of my time merchandising and setting adds. Kohls was a fun place to work. The management team were very supportive.
good,"The company is very progressive and compensation was ok.  The hours were a little tough, but it was overall a good place to work.  The lack of good upper management created a stress that was not necessary, but the corporate level was fine."
good,"It was a pleasure working there."
good,I loved working for the company until intimidation tactics were used.Then I felt as though I had to walk on egg shells without breaking them.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The people there were very nice. I felt that they had a habit of hiring an excess of people to the point where there wasn't enough hours for everyone. Management would usually teach you to do something in a rush and then left you to figure the rest out on your own. The hardest part for me was soliciting credit cards. I found helping customers finding clothing that fits to be the most enjoyable part of the job for me.
good,Always be fare and honest to all the employees and encourage all employees to be successful in the job duties they have that they can be promoted as well and to always work hard and give 110 % to their duties.
good,"I mostly just changed ad signs and helped clean and organize dressing rooms on the sales floor. I helped customers find anything they needed, if we had it. I enjoyed the people I worked with and met. The job was not hard and I enjoyed the overnight shifts, which were the ad set shifts. Management seemed kind of hectic, but it was a very fast paced environment. I never made it to a management position due to them getting rid of the ad set team. Once I was part of the floor team my hours dropped."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was ensuring that customer service was the most essential task being carried out. I learned how to successfully operate and manage a store. The management team was very professional at all times and we all got along very well. The most challenging part about that job was the balancing of work and school during that time but the most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday,"
good,"A typical day at work would involve opening the registers and cleaning up the area, selling kohl's cards, and helping customers.  I learned how to improve my people skills as well as my selling skills.  "
good,"I have worked at Kohls since the holiday rush in December. I find it to be an easy place to work for an individual that is a self starter. I had no problem learning what I needed to know for my position and then some. The downfall of Kohls is the noncompetitive pay. I can take my skills elsewhere and get paid a lot more. The pay is not desirable even at a supervisory level position. I do enjoy my co-workers, the free food Tuesdays and the easy going atmosphere. Overall though Kohls is only a temporary job kind of place. I cannot see how anyone is able to live off a Kohls salary. Lack of pay makes for lots of job turnover which in turn hurts Kohl's in the amount of training that always needs to take place."
good,Most coworkers are nice and some of the management. Its a pretty decent job minus the long hours and being stuck in men or women's side by yourself.
good,The manager is amazing! She knows her job inside out and seems to know everyone else's as we;;. The issue comes from not being able to get enough hours to make a living. Also the hours are all over the place. It would be wonderful to have a set amount of hours per week and also set hours of the day that you worked. Example: If you could work 9am to 3 monday. through friday.  Just an example. I have worked there 4 years and cannot get full time. The above would allow me to earn enough to live on and still remain part-time status. This is a team environment and I really enjoy the way we pitch in to help each other when one area is overwhelmed. Each day is as different as it is similar. You have a routine to follow and each person is given responsibilities. The most important one being Customer Service. We always take care of the customer. What I find difficult is new programs set up without the technology to back them up working properly. I would think it would be in the best interest of all to work the bugs out first. There are constantly changes. Make up your mind what you want to do and stick with it. Please! This is an amazing store with amazing people. Listen to the ones who work with the customers daily and you will see that each area operates differently. Let us help YOU!
good,A typical day overall started off in most case scenarios with quite an easy flow to it then would either switch into extremely hectic. This was because of the work load from peak season along with how many employees either had the day off or how many just took the day off.
good,"The most enjoyable part of job is my co workers and interacting with each other, being a team. I love resolving issues that come up with customers. I've worked in a Call Center environment for a very long time, this is my first time working retail, I just want to work as a customer service representative where I really feel the job has more meaning and handle real issues. Kohls can be a good place to work at, but retail is not for me."
good,"loved my job at kohls simply because i never had the same tasks to do on a daily basis, it was a constant variety of tasks to conclude an overall job as a sales associate here"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kohls but always felt that I was just one of many and could be replaced easily.  The work was fairly easy, but never got the hours that I wanted to entice me to stay."
good,"This position is responsible for creating the fun, energetic and inviting environment of the Cosmetics & Fragrance department, building rapport with customers, consulting with customers on their needs and recommending product solutions that help customers look and feel their best. This position employs strong selling techniques and deep product knowledge to appeal to each customer's unique style and needs to create a positive customer experience and a loyal customer base."
good,"Basically you show up and do your job. "
good,Great place to work but the company does not have enough people working on the floor.
good,"My day started with sometimes going to a meeting to see how much work there was left, and who was working at what position. I worked one day at the chutes which was a sorter, the products would come into the chute , and I would put them in a tote. Some of these orders were short, so I would have to put them in a tote designated for a short item. I also did packing, I would scan each item with a RF gun , and would pack the orders in a box , according to the size of the orders. Some orders were so small , they would have to be put in a tote to go to the automatic bagger. There was a survey posted a couple of weeks before the assignment ended, I did OK with the survey, but when I got to the part of where I had the most experience, I would type where my experience was, but the  website was saying I was using the wrong format. I ended up not finishing the survey because of this roadblock, if I could have finished this survey I would have had the chance to be on part-time flex at Kohl's but I found out what to do after the deadline to finish the survey had come. My coworkers were very nice and easy to work with, my supervisors were helpful as well. I learned how to use an RF gun, which I had never used before. I guess the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the cute toys, that I was getting ready to box up and send them to shipping. The hardest part of the job was the long 10 hour shift. I came to work in the dark,and I left after the sun had gone down. I have a very busy schedule with , school, taking care of my wife who had a stroke over three years ago, paying the monthly"
good,"Good seasonal job to start off with. It gets very busy during the holidays but the pay bumps up so. Signing people up for the Kohl's charge is a bit difficult and may be your secure seat in the job but they teach you to push, push, push."
good,Many varying opinions that were not enforced consistently.  Favoritism made this a terrible place to work.  I believe that there has been a change in culture in this store. Hope that is will lead to a better work environment.
good,"It was an easy going very helpful work environment there. If you ever needed help someone was alway's there to help whether it be at the cash register's or out on the sales floor. I mainly was a floor associate always helping get new merchandise out, prepare for clearance merchandise as well as clean out the fitting room's and help the lead's on their own project's."
good,"It was a good first retail job. Learned about customer service and how to best supply it. A typical day included keeping areas clean and working on ""recovery"" which includes putting clothes away after customers tried them on. I did more recovery work than actual customer service. I could spend my entire 8 hour shift in one fitting room and be exhausted by the end of it after trying really hard to keep up with all the clothes that pile up."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Help customers find products on the floor. Replenish Items. Constantly cleaning fitting rooms
good,"I love my Kohl's family. Day to day is always fun and busy, which I love because the day goes by fast. I've learned to make friends very easily, and how to become more professional. I love the management at Kohl's of course their could be some minor tweaks but overall their great people. My co-workers are my friends, enough said. The hardest part of my job is it being retail. I have to sacrifice a lot of family time just to work and I'm a family oriented girl, they mean everything to me. What I enjoy at work is my co-workers, there's always someone to make me laugh and smile. I can joke around with out worrying about me getting in trouble."
good,"This is a nice place to work as far as jobs of its type go...if someone wanted a retail job, I would definitely recommend it! I just feel that an office type setting is more for me."
good,The coworkers were great to work with. They were friendly and we all worked well in a team. The hardest part of the job was the management team not knowing how to work together to get things done and didn't clearly communicate with other associates. They also lack training new associates or when an associate gains a promotion.
good,alot of walking. long hours. fun people to work with. short breaks
good,Since I am disabled and the company allows me to choose my availability its fine for me sometimes the physical gets too much but it is okay. I get along well with management and coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and fellow employees  like I said the hardest part is physical for me.
good,"My early morning before the Manager open the store we need to count the register, clean up any item do not belong to the register, then have ready the credit- form applications after that waiting for customers and greet every one, smile, at the same time answer any coming call or assist a customer to obtain merchandise, let the customer know about the promotions in the store."
good,Kohls was my first job and helped me learn how to handle customers and was my first experience with cash handling procedures. It was a nice laid back place to work and I wish I could have stayed there permanently but I was hired for seasonal work. I enjoyed talking to the different people who would come through my line and also getting to know the other cashiers.
good,"Take rails of clothing out of the back and put where it belongs on the floor from returns.go to the register when there is a line or being called,fold clothes when you get to it after you clean out clothes from dressing rooms and sign it every hour, clean off the dressing room rack and run it where it has to go, make sure it is clean. then run to the register if need back up. or stay at the register if your the only one.The hardest part of the job is running around to the front and back room all day doing 110 things at once. The easiest slightly hardest is consistant line for register when it gets busy. The management sometimes gets moody if you go and pick something up from the floor or check on the dressing room and signing it cleaned; that's not in your assigned area."
good,"My days here included, receiving a bunch of orders to pull, pack, and process for shipping. I also had to make sure I logged all items in or out of inventory."
good,My review was nice . I really enjoy what I did at khol's . I dint have many problems at this job site. The reason I left from there was because of transportation back and forward to work. But the manager and co workers fine and cool to hang around and work together. Their wasnt really an hard part at the job it was all easy and laid back.
good,"Non stop action. Great management. Fast paced work, time flies."
good,"Loved the job, but not enough hours given as requested. Pushed and pushed to get credit cards."
good,good job that is very relaxed with their employees. Easy physical work.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for just a part-time job. Great people love meeting new customers and having them return for the great service.
good,"As long as you follow the rules, do the job to the best of your ability, plan around your work schedule, and have NO LIFE EMERGENCIES happen you'll be just fine."
good,"Once I'm at work its always, do my job, and I focus on that. I'm probably one of the few that can handle and maintain 2 fitting rooms and keep them maintained and my managers know that, that's why they put that on me. My managers are good, but some are better at management. I think the hardest part of the job for me is that I work to my best ability and I do a lot compared to my co-workers. When the store closes I think is the best part of the day."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of rearranging and organizing the sales floor, and interacting and assisting customers looking for specific merchandise. My co-workers were rather friendly, although there was not too much interaction with them due to the large section of the store I was responsible for keeping neat and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the consumers and giving my advice on different looks and pieces of clothing, and the hardest part of the job was the poor management and lack of enthusiasm the managers and higher employees than I had in their everyday operations, as well as being on my feet for several hours at a time."
good,Typical day at work included cleaning out at least two departments fitting rooms and covering breaks or filling in where necessary.  The most challenging part was the keeping up with the fitting rooms on the really busy days. The most enjoyable was most costumers were happy and friendly.
good,The job is long and can be tiring. You stand for long hours or have to move merchandise that can be heavy. But the people are nice and easy to work with. They are often willing to teach or help instruct in any job you ware working to learn. Training is relatively easy and constantly being updated.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I folded, put away lots and lots of clothing in all departments of the store, I also aiding customers throughout the day as needed, also worked as a cashier when needed"
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Typical Mourning early meeting stretches "
good,"Very fast pace being the holiday season."
good,They reward there employees. I hear they have good benefits.
good,Easy work and easy going work place. Everybody is laid back and easy to get a long with. The boss is very understandable about timing and other peoples lives and is very lenient.
good,fun workplace. I enjoyed working there. great hours. Co- workers as well as managers were dependable.
good,"Close to home, friendly associates and managers.  Great merchandise to sell and buy."
good,"Great people, fun times. was my first supervisor position."
good,"The majority of the day is cleaning up the store, and making it look presentable for the next day. Folding the clothes on the tables and picking up clothes off of the floor are very essential for this. Also throughout the day you will receive phone calls for the department your working in. I have learned so much from the short amount of time that I've worked there. I have done inventory prep, over night price changing, merchandising, and got a way better idea of what retail is and how to work it. The management there does its best and what it can for the store, but doesn't reach my expectations. My co-workers are very friendly and always willing to help, and are just as busy with their departments like I am. The hardest part of the job is the extreme multi-tasking that this job requires. More often than not, I look after two large portions of the store, and that is very hard to keep up with. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always something to do. The duties for a floor associate are very easy, its just sometimes I feel like the management of the store makes it harder."
good,"A typical day could start out very slow and then be very busy later on in the day, or the complete opposite. I have learned working for this company you need to make ""her"" feel happy that she is shopping at your store and will return in the future to do more shopping. Give ""her"" an excellent shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is when there is a lot of returns and it is very busy you can not get the returns done because you need to tend to the customers' needs. I like meeting different types of people; I am a people person."
good,Work on the truck unload the truck process all the product. how to manage people to get work done. How to get work done under a set time.The management was good they were more your friends then your boss. Co-workers  work good they got there job done and they finished on time. The hardest part was unloading a tuck and processing the product. was going to an environment that was easy going and their to work it made work go by fast and not  dreadful
good,"the typical day at work was arriving at 5 o'clock in the am to receive the trucks carrying the inventory and merchandise for the day and occasionally the week. The next few hours was spent unloading and organizing the merchandise. Then it was my duty to stock the shelves with the inventory while at the same time recognizing  what merchandise we needed order from corporate, basically inventory for the store. The hardest part of the job was the lack of management. I always kept busy and completed tasks but there never was any guidance as to what the store in particular needed. The most enjoyable job was I knew everything a customer bought or handled came directly from me."
good,This job was a very hard job. There was a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of time consuming things to do. It sometimes was hard to finish tasks due to another area needing thigs done. I like to finish things as needed and not have to go back to them. I enjoyed the one on one with customers and being able to help them when needed.
good,"This company has a very specific and cookie-cutter structured feel to it.  Not that that's a bad thing, it's just kind of monogamous."
good,"The normal work day for this company is dealing with customers while maintaining the store. In my time there, I've learned that patience is the key to growing inside the company while also growing yourself. Patience means knowing when to allow customers to vent their frustrations at you because they didn't understand things the proper way, but also patience when you really do think you're ready to ascend to become a leader of a team. The best thing about working in a place like this also working with a team of people who all want to do as much as they can to make the workplace as effective as possible for everyone and not just themselves. "
good,"There was always something to do whether it would be helping a customer, running the cash register or put clothes away. "
good,It was great to work with many talented photographers. I really enjoyed working with the people there. The management staff was easy to work for. As long as you did your work well and all time everything was kept fun and enjoyable. 
good,"I love working here unfortunately they keep hiring more people and cutting hours, so I have to look for full time work."
good,"I worked at Kohl's during my years in college at Northern Arizona University. The pay wasn't the greatest, and raises were slow. But there's plenty opportunity to grow and transfer to different stores if you don't like the area in which you worked. I'd work for Kohl's again."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical evening for me is recovery of a department that is delegated to me by the E 3. I communicate to my co workers what is the goal for the night and we set out to achieve it. Recovery of the floor is utmost as well as customer satisfaction. Overall, working at Kohl s is enjoyable yet fast paced so one has to keep up . It is all team work."
good,"Although I enjoy working at kohl's, the compensation isn't what I'm looking for. I work really hard so I feel like I deserve a higher salary."
good,"Worked with customers, worked register as well..fun work place."
good,"Kohls empolyees treat you with respect and are very kind towards customers. I certainly learned a lot how big businesses work and it helped me mature a lot. Most of my co-workers were nice and hard working, but then there were a hand full that I thought shouldn't be working there. I also thought that management should have punished some employes when it was nessesary, but didn't. I, and the rest of my co-workers hated the music selection played. It would be better to have random music played, mix it up a little to keep employees happy and motivated. Management is ok, could deffinitly do better with task management and store decisions. Overall good place to work."
good,"Kohl's EFC is the easiest position one could ask for to call work. Although, during peak you are at work more than you are home, the reward at the end of each week is a fair exchange. Overall an excellent company to work for."
good,"team atmosphere, flexible schedule, some rude customers but the management and co-workers were happy to assist"
good,"seasonal position was a good experience, I worked with fun people, and enjoyed being a part of their team the short time I was there. I would help guests find items, stock shelves,organize and help out on cashier when needed"
good,"long hours good pay to start , big break room, non stop never boring"
good,"It was a good experience, and I would definitely repeat it. Their Worker appreciation days were always nice."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and those that I supervised. We as a team where the best at getting people to sign up for credit cards in our distric.
good,"working at Kohl's wasn an experience. I like the solociting credit and receiving commission. There were guidelines that lead directly to point of getting things done in the store. If you learned fast then you could unload trucks, 27/become a area supervisor, count inventory, purify,and work on the floor."
good,Kohls is a fun work place its easy going i mean a typical day would be go to your department do what they ask for that day and go home.
good,"A typical work day can range on the time of day, mornings are usually slow untill 12pm then it becomes crazy till 6pm dies down then about 7pm it picks up agian till the store closes. Sales determine the flow of customers in the store. Management is good it needs to be strenghtened a little. As far as co-workers no complaints what so ever. The hardest part of working at Kohls is routines and policies are always changing causing upset customers and associates. These changes are causing customers to be angry,confused or both. Which puts stress on the associate, which in some cases cause management to step in and then it makes the associate to look bad, from the managers point of veiw. Yet on the other hand that co-work relationship we as floor associates make makes that issue little plus other customers go up to that associate and say "" Don't worry about it you handled it very well."" thats what i lke about working there is because you may have a nasty customer or management is a bad mood. You always have friendly associates and friendly customers to make you feel better."
good,"Very flexible hours, worked with customers to help find products and check prices, also rang customers up at the register. Management was great, with the exception of one supervisor who didn't like that I kept getting sick at work due to my pregnency, which is why I left. My co-workers were great, everyone worked so well together."
good,"Kohl's is a very clean and calm atmosphere to work in. Purchase and returns were the daily routine. I gained my supervisory skills in two different departments. Management was a bit rough due to alot of turnover in that department which affected team member throughout the store. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of my job was when associates called off, that made department fall behind schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was recognition by shoppers, and seeing the faces frequently."
good,"They have good costumer service. They are always making sure that their costumers are getting what they need, when they need it and making sure they leave happy and with a positive attitude"
good,"I worked in the children's department (hardest) for a little over a year. I come in to keep the department looking its best throughout the day. Recovering merchandise from the dressing rooms, cash registers and customer service is my first task. After all the items are put in their proper areas, going through the clothing racks and making sure that nothing is out of place and everything matches by name brand for easy access for customers. Folding tables are folded as often as possible to prevent any undesirable views to the customers and management. I've learned to be more efficient by working there. The longer I worked there, the better I became at my job and it increased the trust worthiness of the managers to give me more hours and to expand the departments I worked in. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful to even the most rudest customers. The hardest part of the job is having to stand there and apologize to a customer that is clearly in the wrong. But as we all know, the customer is always right, so we did abide by that rule. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move around the store withou being confined to one area the whole shift worked. The managers were replaced a lot and most were too busy being their coworkers friends instead of the boss."
good,"• Management team, key holder, run the store during manager on duty shift, open and close, deal with customer problems, safety team member, cash office, data entry, excel spread sheets for truck unload, accounts receivable for Kohls charge cards, inventory, e-mail corporate office, train new employees, manager training through Kohls, daily team building meetings.."
good,"When you work at Kohl's I learned that they favor those who have been there the longest. It's extremely hard for new people to show they deserve some type of job security. They pay you every Friday which is why the checks are so small and once you get past the overall ""new person"" feeling you realize that some of the people who work there are nice/nasty and talk to you in a way that most people talk to their dogs when they want them to do a command."
good,"I am a sales floor associate so I make sure fitting rooms are clean, I do recovery so I have to go through every fixture and make sure all clothing is folded nice and do rack integrity for the hanging fixtures, pick up any strays, I also do Customer Service so I'm dealing with returns and sometimes sales also if a customer has a complaint about something we make sure to take care of the issue and make sure they leave the store happy and wanting to come back, as well as answering the phones. I also help out the administrator by writing the schedule line ups and doing call back and I help out the managers by doing re-wrap, and getting ready for audits or corporate walks."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I learned a lot about retail management at this compnay as well as scheduling, payroll, and the hiring process. I started as a cashier and left as an area manager."
good,Very good employees. They are hard-working and dedicated to the customers.
good,Working at Kohls is okay. They work around your school schedule. Sometimes getting enough hours is a problem. I like that you get paid vacation time.
good,Great company where you work mainly independently and get to supervise other employees work
good,Co-workers were great with assisting and teaching new hirees the job that was required. Would still work at this position if they required more than a seasonal worker. I would return to work for them if they needed.
good,"Each day we have different goals we want to achieve and how efficiently we have to work to achieve said goals. We have to make sure we are satisfying the customers and their needs, on top of the store's needs. We have to make daily goals of sales and credit. If it is a truck day, we have to work efficiently and fast to get all of the new product out and make sure it looks presentable for the customers to shop. We have to work as a team and help each other out. If we fail to make our goals, we hurt as a team and have to push harder the next day. Open communication is key not only to our managers but to each other as well so we can stay on the same page, which can be difficult at times. At the end of the day, it is our customer's satisfaction that is the main priority."
good,"I learned a lot at Kohls and there were a ton of kind people willing to help you, however, I learned almost everything from having to ask questions because they did not train me on how to do most of my assignments."
good,The scheduling allows for ample family time. They are also a very pro associate company. They offer plenty of time off and vacation days and leadership is very good at working with associates
good,Jobs at Kohl’s vary so just depends on what your looking for. Setting up for the interview takes a couple weeks to do the whole process and then interviews take place. Then they decide if your skills and availability matches with what they need.  Retail is not for everyone but if you want to learn and start with a company Kohl’s is one to be with.
good,"While the job is fun, the pay is absolutely horrible. I am a ""dept lead"" and am cross trained throughout the store. And DO NOT get paid for all I do for thrm"
good,"Working at kohl’s was a good high school job. It’s hours weren’t terrible, later than I preferred and since it was a seasonal the pay was decent. They would often bring in food and treats for the break room."
good,Trabajar para Kohl’s fue una experiencia muy agradable
good,"Friendly staff, regular customers, upbeat work environment. Management is very friendly and very helpful. Staff is very also friendly and helpful and welcoming."
good,It was fun to part of the team behind the seine an to assist in the implementation of an ideal of product services. Each day i played a part in the contributions of services to increase the viability of joy to the customer
good,Your typical retail job. Hard work but good people. They treat their employees well and never had an issue with management. Tough hours but you'll get that with any retail job
good,"Good job for a college student, but not for someone who wants a career. Typical day was about a 4-5 shift, and the management was relatively nice and worked with me on my 2nd job. Most enjoyable part was helping people."
good,"Working there was a bit stressful. People didn't really bother with me much, but the pay was good and it was a fairly easy job. The managers were pretty laid back."
good,Usual shift was either cashier or personal shopper and unloading the delivery truck. Learned how to unload truck and check in products to inventory. Work environment was welcoming but management could use improvement.
good,At work you will be helping guest nonstop from start to end of your shift. When not busy you go out on the floor and help fold and hang items. You will be responsible for running five hundreds (items guest brought up and didn't want) as long as you have two or more people on your side registers.
good,"Working at kohls was a fun experience I learned how to break down shipment in depth, Also learned no matter what the customer is always right. This is a job that will keep you busy!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Coworkers are easy to get along with. Schedule is non-traditional but works out with personal schedule. Pay is acceptable. All around ok place to work.
good,You get out what you put in with company. Plenty of opportunity for promotion and room to grow within the store you just have to be willing to go the extra mile.
good,"Only flaws were constant hour cuts, but other than that best job I've ever had. My work never went unnoticed. Management was always open to any suggestions in improvement for employees/customers. I ended up being promoted to a floor lead after a few months after proving my worth. It was nice to be in a work environment where everyone respected and helped each other."
good,"the job is fine, you should only be on the sales floor if you can be on your feet for a really long time. the managers at the Culpeper store don't communicate very well."
good,While working at Kohl's overall was a fun environment to work in. The customers was really sweet. During my short experience working there I only came across one rude customer but I was still able to assist that customer and also got great feedback from my customers that was in line to make a purchase.
good,"Kohl's is a friendly, welcoming work environment dedicated to the happiness of its customers and the sustainability of the environment. Kohl's provides flexible hours, especially for students."
good,Co workers were ok and customers were sociable. Hours were flexible. Discounts were beyond great.  Location was good for me and travel wasn't a hastle
good,Good Environment to work in. Very neat and clean store. Responsible team workers with a friendly environment. Management on top of task. The company is a great company to work in.
good,Kohl's department store is a good job for those just starting to work. you learn communication skills as well as customer service. You interact with all different kinds of people and learn a lot too.
good,"lots of discounts and coupons for employees to use."
good,"It has been a wonderful experience working for kohl's , helped me learn a lot of skills, including customer service and it increased my confidence around people and they also pay weekly which is a great thing."
good,"The managers and other employees are good, and the training is adequate. There are a lot of different departments, so you can find one that is best suited to you. They're good about flexibility regarding hours and seasonal work. It is understaffed, so you'll always be busy."
good,"My work at kohl's was very easy and the day went by very fast. I learned how to scan boxes during unloading and how to replenish items to and from the stock room, onto the floor. I had very little contact with management but they did seem to be there when they were really needed. The hardest part of the job was standing in the truck during freight freezing but the most enjoyable part for me was stocking items."
good,This is a great place to start if needing a first job. There are good co workers and various tasks. It can be fast-paced and there are many different hours available.
good,Kohls is a fun place to work and gain retail experience. Feels like a family. Very flexible with outside work activities. Only downside is the pay....
good,A typical day at Kohl's is usually with me helping customers and making sure I am doing everything in my power to make sure they are happy . Sometimes that does not happen but most of the time I am successful and the people I work with are successful as well.
good,Overall it was a nice job I have no complaints. Good people who work really well together . They helped me learn what I needed to learn fast enough to get me going .
good,"I enjoyed my time a Kohl's! Management was great, staff was all supportive and nice. However, I didn't feel they compensated their employees enough with pay to motivate employees to achieve the company goals. Inconsistent scheduling. However, it was an enjoyable place to work."
good,I was happy but felt they could have given a little more floor support manager did not give me what I needed to do my job daily. I had no support in the department but was expected to support all other departments.
good,I enjoyed picking orders and packaging them.  Their technology is unreliable and that often made it difficult to do my job. I got a lot of hours during the holiday season.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The discounts were great too.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Due to a car accident, I chose to quit and not keep calling off and have my employment be terminated by the company. But it was a nice experience and other associates made it tremendously easy to continue working there."
good,I enjoyed working here and would recommend or refer other people to work here. It was very easy to apply and recieve employment. Job duties and requirements were easy to learn.
good,I loved working here. Very peaceful jobs I liked the interaction with others. I loved the discounts they gave us . Sometimes 55% off on a entire purchase.
good,Kohls is a popular retail store.  It's very busy with shoppers of various attitudes and moods.  I loved my fellow employees.  Did not like having to work on Thanksgiving.
good,Kohl’s is a great job i love helping customers. I like communicating with the customers. I love teamwork and helping my coworkers anytime they need my help
good,"I like working at kohl’s because of the positive environment, and the coworkers are nice as well. The work isn’t overwhelming and they also do a good job of showing employees how to complete their task before putting them on their own."
good,I have enjoyed a long tenure at Kohl's which has afforded me wonderful experiences and progressive over the past 18 years.  Overall this continues to be a good company to work for.  I simply desire a change and a new challenge.
good,"Great discounts, flexible schedule and always busy. Weekly pay. Very diverse environment. Hours are fair, especially during the holidays. The pay is really low."
good,"I worked as a seasonal cashier, I enjoyed working for Kohls, but often felt some employees were not working in a team manner. Managment was great often did team groups before your work started."
good,Great company. Low pay for bay area residents. Fun and fast paced. A lot of in store politics. Great for a part time job. They also make returns easy for customers
good,This job taught me a lot about retail and provided me with a variety of tools to continue on working in different retail positions. A good pace and  a good management team helped us focus on driving sales.
good,Was passed over for a promotion in my area for someone who didn’t know the job but was great with customers. The department’s were falling behind nothing  was done on time or completed. Managers were not helping they mostly sat in the office!!!  That’s not team work
good,Working at Kohls has taught me how to manage my time better. It can be a high stress work environment. It is a good starter job and will work with your school schedule.
good,Manger does not know how to address  things.makes things up about people.there was a manger after employees to get people fired. Always smoking.i liked working there but manger does not deal with things let her do what she wants.i am not the only one in there but they need there job. Thanks I am a worker not a screw off.
good,"I like working at Kohls,  I just hate working nights and weekends.  No fault of Kohl's. I like the people I have met and work with. If it came down to it, I would certainly consider a full time position with Kohl's Corporate."
good,Kohl's was a very good job to work out if you need flexibility such as if you're a student or a parent. The downside to working at Kohl's was the turnover rate and the management never had good communication with the other managers.
good,"It was good for flexible hours,but managers were not always helpful and appreciate your work, customer's were crabby alot of the time and always think they are right,"
good,"Some of the training wasn't sufficient for a new employee. The overnight crew was not organized. Needed for management on duty during overnight. Overall,  this was a seasonal job."
good,It's a good place to start a new job or get your resume started. This place hires almost everyone during the holidays so if you can't find a job it's a good place to go and start a career.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Some times are harder than others for example when there is new stock there will be a lot of rearranging the whole department. Some times are fun for example when you volunteer with your coworkers.
good,"Most managers are really friendly, and understanding. Loss Prevention staff are very personable. Even when it gets busy the environment can be quite focusing, if you’re a cashier."
good,"I will say that I enjoyed my time at Kohl's.Management and lack of growth and opportunities in the company was the real issue, there's no moving up there, and after a while they can't really hide that anymore. The pay was decent but that might have been because of my experience before I signed on. All-in-all there really isn't any opportunity for growth"
good,The culture at Kohl's is great and I have gained amazing friends and a family through my job. The work-life balance could be improved and the pay could be better but overall it's a great job for college students and short term.
good,"I had a seasonal position last year.  As you can imagine, it was very fast paced.  My first day was on Black Friday!  It was a nice atmosphere, and pizza was brought in ocasionally."
good,good place definetly would go back especialy during peek season for the holidays ..........fast paced good breaks nice people good pay right by the bus line
good,"Overall working at kohl's is a great job. The management is pretty good. Associate's are awesome. Tons of team work, everyone is typically willing to help. The down fall are there aren't many opportunities to advance in the company and obtain a full time position. They pay minimum wage and I feel that makes it harder for them to find and KEEP good employees. There are no opportunities for overtime and if you go above a certain amount of hours they cut your hours. IF they have extra payroll they will call in more staff."
good,"pays well, has good benefits, nice on site cafeteria with a large variety of food choices, which is great considering the traffic in the surrounding areas is absolutely horrible."
good,"Pros: Great environment , Has some good mangers especially on the 2nd floor where customer service is"
good,Working at Kohls was a very fast paced heavy lifting everyday sometimes very stressful hot in t h e summer and cold in the winter it's designed for young people
good,"Great coworkers, but not my passion and not sustainable (for me) in any sense. Great part time job though for those in between full-time positions. If you work hard you'll progress to full-time with benefits, but it's hard work."
good,"I liked working here, the pay was fair and I felt most of the time hours were reasonable. The management team was super nice and always was there to help problem solve whenever you needed. Not a bad work environment."
good,"It'e retail so schedule changed weekly. Every holiday, every weekend. It's a fun place to work as long as management isn't terrible. Don't expect good pay or decent raises."
good,"Its a great pt time job. But they have cut back on the amount of employees so far, that its hard to cover all areas."
good,"Kohl's was my first job, and it was a great introduction to the world of retail. Kohl's' policy is basically ""whatever the customer wants, the customer gets,"" which made cashiering a lot easier. I had the opportunity to learn other departments and stay with the departments I liked the most. Only downside (besides the standard retail downsides) is the low pay: you get hired at 5 cents above minimum wage and get 20 cent raises per year. If they paid better I probably would've stayed there longer."
good,"A typical day at work is just a normal day in retail, which can get overwhelming at times. Kohl's as a workplace I would rate as overall positive as the fellow employees are all pleasant to work with and the work load is the standard workload of straightening out folds and racks, checking customers out at the registers, and the occasional moving of freight. It has been an educational experience on the ups and downs of retail."
good,"Very friendly employees, very nice. Made sure that everything was in the right place and customers were taken care of. They were very flexible if something happened or if you ended up sick."
good,"Kohl’s is a great company to work for, they have great team work and great employees. The way the store manager leads the way is amazing. They do need to raise their pay though"
good,It's a fun place with a lot going on. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is when I can't find an item for my order and I have to search high and low all over the store for it.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My typical day was putting away clothes and putting clothes on the cart and sorting them and then put them where they belong & cleaning out the fitting rooms, I learned to be productive and stay focused and keep me busy & the management wasn't to bad it was they never gave me enough hours, the most enjoyable was just cleaning and helping others, putting the clothes away"
good,"Great atmosphere "
good,I loved doing the jobs this did and helping customer's they enjoyed my help also I had received a customer service award pin for doing a great job in helping the customer
good,"This is your average retail job. I worked here during the Christmas holiday. Very busy store. Great discounts, very good with employee breaks. Clean and friendly environment."
good,"It is true that Kohls prefers to promote/hire from within. If you want an upper scale job, you have to put in the time. I started as a cashier and ended at a jewelry supervisor position. Im sure if i stayed longer, I would've been a manager by now. The only downside is if you re apply you probably would have to start from scratch. I met a girl who was a department supervisor and decided to leave. When she decided to work there again, she was a floor associate. The best part were the people. Im still friends with lots of them to this day. Management could be fun from time to time but it was the customers that really made work tough. I gave four stars because I rarely had those situations but when they did come around, I hated them. (I also had a role in customer service before i was the jewelry supervisor). Kohl's still has a place in my heart. I worked with many genuine hardworking people. I gotta say though, the pay was horrible."
good,"The store is very organized and clean. It the easiest job but you got to asked for more hours to work. The co-workers is super friendly and very positives, make you laugh whenever you feel down or upset. They more like a second home which you can call family."
good,"When I started working at Kohls I started with doing replenishment. After a year the employee that was doing ad set was going to quit her job and refereed me to take her position. I accepted and I have been doing ad set for the past year and 9 months. I also do price changes, recovery, merchandise sets, and so much more"
good,"All the managers  I've worked for are great people, they really look out for the employees."
good,"Customer service and selling credit is the main task of point of sale cashiers. Management was good and well organized, wasn't hard to get help when needed."
good,I start the day cleaning around the registers and ringing up people that were ready to check out. I would ask them if they wanted a Koh'ls charge card and let them know about the discounts that they would get in the mail or through their emails. Management was nice and very accommodating as far as working with your schedule and time off requests. The best part of the job is talking to the customers and the coworkers that work there. We all have to communicate to make the customers experience enjoyable and the work environment pleasant.
good,"Kohl's has a best practice for most all operational and daily work assignments for the day for example the morning truck delivered twice to five times a week based the season would be about a 15 to 25 ft trailor. The truck had a time line to be unloaded and then processed to the selling floor. Monthly floor moves as well as monthly markdowns which had been scheduled overnight.  "
good,"Since I was just a cashier, a typical work day for me would be cashiering all day and if there was any down time, I would put misplaced items back in their correct places. The particular store I worked at was usually very busy with lines."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. However, there are a few problems I have with the store. The managers harp on us to open credit cards. They make the credit goals unrealistic. For example, when it's not a holiday, on Saturdays we are expected to open 20-30 credit cards. Another problem I have is that hours are cut significantly. I told management that I could work 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, which is normal because I'm a part time worker. They cut my hours to where I'm only working one day a week. IT would be okay, sort of, if they weren't continuously trying to hire people. My problem is they are trying to hire new people, but they won't schedule the people they already have."
good,"Relaxed environment (fast-paced on days with big savings for customers) with great supervisors. However, if you're seeking a job with consistent hours every week as a part-time, this is not the best choice. Some weeks you will get 20-30 hours and the following week 8-12 hours."
good,"Fast paced with both easy and challenging jobs. Workers are easy to get along with and very friendly. Work days normally go by very quickly because there is always something to be done, constantly busy. But overall very fun workplace"
good,"Worked during the holiday season on the overnight team.  Had a great time while accomplishing the nightly goals of the store.  Not difficult work, but is somewhat physical."
good,You go in and you are immediately sucked into cleaning up the store and trying your hardest to clean your department quickly and efficiently. Managers are kind and try their best to get you out on time. They continually show you how to manage rude customers and better help your people skills.
good,I had a temporary part-time job to help fund my college. I worked about 8-12 hours per week. Kohls provided me an opportunity for my first job. Learned some basic tasks like being a cashier and doing displays and resolving customer conflicts
good,I worked at Kohl's as a seasonal associate during the winter season and really enjoyed myself. It was a fast paced job and that was something I was looking for and ended up having a great time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Typical day at work is standing behind a register, occasionally stepping away when not busy to tidy up and re-fold clothing. The management was very helpful with any needed tasks, and on call with the press of a button when needed at registers. The most enjoyable part of the job is having small competitions between the workers."
good,"Rang up sales, tried to get credit card sales, straighten up the sales floor, closed and opened the cash register, put returns back on the sales floor, and cleaned the register area.  Standing was hard on the legs, the culture of the store was busy and boring at times."
good,even though I'm no longer working there. I was so happy to work there. the hares past about my job is the customers. I work mostly in the fitting room.
good,Enjoyed working for company. On a typical day I was on register. Helping customers check out promote the weekly deals. Promote the Kohls credit card. Give the best customer service I could with a smile.
good,min. pay but def a good work enviroment for first job. the magagers were nice and well organized but it was hard to get a raise if you had little work experience and under 18
good,"It is a good starter job for students going to school. They have flexible schedules. If you want to move up or get better pay, your chances are very slim."
good,"I liked it there but needed a change and only got about 20 hours a week.  Seniority meant nothing there. I didn't like working nights, weekends and holidays, it got too crazy at Christmas."
good,"This was my “real first job” after high school. The position was very flexible, I continued to work throughout college, so I was only a part time employee. I worked at two very different locations, both were ok. I enjoyed being at work, I didn’t mind the shifts I was scheduled. I didn’t have too much to complain about while working for the company or the two properties I got to experience. Sometimes you come across some authority figures who seem.... condescending, but I was young working around a lot of middle aged people, I already had a full year of experience before being around all new management. The company increased the minimum wage while I was employed, presently speaking, it has been the largest pay raise I have had in my working career. Other than that I received two raises over the almost 3 full years I worked for the company only totaling $0.27. I think if you are just looking for something extra, no matter if you’re a high school student or you have a full time career, working for the company is all a breeze. The holiday season is the perfect time to start."
good,"I worked there during the holiday season. It was hectic but not too crazy somehow. I met a lot of nice people who work there, though haven’t talked to them since I stopped working there. On that: I was never informed of being dismissed at the end of the season. I just wasn’t on the schedule."
good,The job is not the worst. They do push apprehension numbers very hard. Management is fairly decent nothing too horrible to say. Did have a falling out once with my boss when he hung up on me mid-conversation because he was mad for something that was out of my control. District tries to be cohesive as a team. In my experience I felt not so connected and More in an individual store basis.
good,"Always a busy place to work.Co-workers very helpful and hard working.I also enjoyed providing the customer experience possible. I overall, enjoyed the retail experience!"
good,Enjoyed working for kohl's.  It's a very friendly place to work at. Customer service was my best talent. I enjoyed very much helping customers.  Management is very flexible with personal time.
good,Kohl’s was basically my first job. Throughout the years I have had a few opportunities to move up in the company. The staff are awesome to work with. They are flexible with my hours and have been understanding of school when I attended.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. It would get stressful at times when we got busy and there was only one register open. We were pushed constantly to ""sell"" the Kohl's credit card. That was stressful because we wouldn't even be busy and management would be on us to sell them."
good,"As the largest and most profitable retail, seems like it's slowly changing downhill like others have. But Kohls does not need to go that direction. Poor raises if any on their best performing year. Excellent place if you come in as management. Starting wage $8.50 to $9 at best. SAD"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kohl's but it has been a while since I worked there. The managers were approachable and listened to you. That says a lot because many places have managers with overwhelming tasks and they have very little time to speak with employees. The benefits weren't great but they offer 401k. Big focus on opening credit cards, which can be ridiculous when many customers already have cards, or it's slow and there's no one to ask to open accounts. Was forced to apply countless times by supervisors just to get their quotas filled - thank god i wasn't eligible and it didn't affect my credit score!!"
good,"Kohl's was fun, because it was easy to make friends. It was easy to cancel a shift, or find coverage because they allowed for people to take a cover other people's shifts. "
good,Overall a nice place to work but don’t expect a raise only way to get a raise is if the whole store as a collective gets one. Paid weekly and many positions are open
good,Nothing personal to the company but I’ve realized that retail was no longer what I wanted to do with my life so I left and continued my journey towards a better career
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Fun place to work and shop people at Kohl’s are so nice and friendly to one another never had a bad day work as a sales associate for kohls department store.
good,"A very fantastic place to work if you are in college and in need of a part time position. Fun, fast paced, and extremely flexible, definitely one of the best places to work in a pinch"
good,"Working at Kohl's was fun but time management did play a role when it came to big sales, of course. But overall, the work environment was good. The store was always organized and clean each day for customer and employee satisfaction."
good,Cool job..I met good ppl working there. I took inventory off the truck to put onto pallots and prepare them for the floor. I found another job paying more
good,I love the employees but management needs work. their lack of communication is bad and not organized. Not very approachable. Hard to ask questions when you feel like you are annoying them.
good,"Working at Kohl's is fun! I love the customers although they can be a bit challenging at times. I love my co workers, because we are like family. I wish the compensation was more, but pay better than most. If you are not a hard worker; this may not be the job for you."
good,"I have been honored to be with my company for three years. In those three years I have learned so much. Working customer service at Kohls you tend to deal with angry and happy customers. With that, I learn to deal with providing and answering all the customers needs."
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Kohl's. However, you will be moved to many different departments, if you are a good worker, with very little pay!"
good,"The positive: Kohls is a good place to start if you've never had a job. They allow ppl with colored hair, body pericings ect. Leave the job on good terms because the stores are all over the US & its fairly easy to get rehired if you need a job later. Managers made sure everyone got a break. Ppl who didn't want to work a shift could post it by the time clock & you can pick up more hours that way."
good,"Kohls as a company, I feel, has changed CEOs to often and just when you get use to one way of doing things, Rules change. I feel like employees are to often utilized in departments other than their own, and cannot give the customers the attention they need and deserve. I’m my opinion, they need to hire more employees so that what you are hired for specifically, you stay in that department. I feel there should have been at least a monthly mandatory meeting to adress the concerns of the employees, to bring up the morale."
good,"It started out as a fun and enjoyable job but there is no room for advancement, management has no communication between themselves or to the employees, and the inconsistent schedule means that some weeks you work 3 days and other times you work 10+ days in a row."
good,Kohls is a quality store for shopping. However they don’t have everything that someone could be possibly looking for. Managers are very ignorant to a certain extent.
good,"I had positions in a few departments, shoes, truck team, visual team, and felt welcome and needed in all of them. The managers could be counted on to be reachable and help with any problems that would pop up. You learned to self motivate to keep the ball rolling. The only bad part was a lack of full time positions so it was hard to move up from part time, and the fact the regional manager seemed to have a problem with every manager the store had since I started there (we'd been through 4 store managers in 6 years.)"
good,"Sometimes I worked home and kids department and sometimes I worked as a cashier.  I learned a lot about retail.  Stocking, recovery and helping customers is what I did on the floor.  You soon find out who is willing to help a new employee.  The job wasn’t hard you just had to learn so much.  I enjoyed meeting the people."
good,Khol's is a good company to work for.  They work with your schedule. Management is friendly and helpful. It is an enjoyable environment to work in. The only drawback is there aren't a lot of full time positions.
good,"Work can be busy, putting away clothes from the fitting rooms or helping out up front with checking people out. I have learned to use their bluebirds to change signs and get price checks for customers. All of the associates are very friendly and helping. The management is good and will always answer your questions."
good,Friendly staff and management. Can be fast pace at times. Typical days are slow. It's fast in the mornings rushing to prepare the store before opening hours.
good,"Kohl's was actually my first retail job. It was an enjoyable experience, somedays. I was in shoes, which was almost always messy. Retail is more or less what you expect. Managers were nice. I've learned that work never ends. The hardest part of the job was probably keeping things tidy. Shoes were always getting flung everywhere."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working here from the bottom up teaches a lot of things. Learning the ins and outs of retail, retail politics, customer service, etc."
good,It could be fun at times but at others it seemed like there wasn't much to do and it would get very boring. The hours tended to be pretty inconsistent.
good,"Working at Kohl’s we truly an experience. The first 3-4 years it was like working with a huge happy family, NO KIDDING! I loved coming to work! It thought me that just because I want it doesn’t mean I’m ready. It developed me to be a true leader. Then some people started to get promoted for supervisory and management posioand everything change. This were people who did not had any leadership skills. People who their only intent and priorities where to make sure higher up management acknowledge them and forgot that their priorities where to take care of their employees."
good,"Not a bad starting job I suppose. The pay is underwhelming and honestly embarrassing. The environment is fun and not too chaotic, but the worst part about it is the god awful Spotify playlist thats always on repeat."
good,"Fun place to work, convenient location, nice staff, nice customers, flexible schedule, merchandise discount, great during holidays, variety of job types available."
good,"Was a seasonal employee. Good training, recognition for great work, and positive managers. Definitely would have stayed if there was a permanent position available."
good,Very competitive and fast-paced work environment. Must be comfortable with people and working on a team. Must be able to work quickly and be able to take direction.
good,only con was that when you needed a shift covered it was like pulling teeth. dress code is much better than most places. nice managers. depending on availability you may get plenty of hours.
good,"I enjoy the people, as a second job its nice to get away from the stress. As a manager at my full time job it was nice to have a break from all the decision making."
good,"Kohl's will give a prospective employee a well-rounded work profile. The position offerings differ all across the department store. Whether you are on stock, cash register, detail crew, or specified to a department. One thing I disagree is management. They rarely feel like they have your back on decisions."
good,"I worked as a cashier and I loved it, the customers and other workers were all so nice except for the managers. Managers always claimed that everything was all about having good customer service but that isn't what they actually cared about. Managers just wanted you to get people to sign up for a Kohl's credit card and any day you didn't get as many people to sign up as they wanted you to, they would take you into their office and yell at you and make you fear you were going to lose your job. They would also bribe workers to get more people to sign up for credit cards by offering them money or food for each customer signed up."
good,"The store I worked for in particular was pretty great. My issues were with corporate. "
good,"Always on your feet, kind of unorganized when it came to scheduling but they're getting better. Most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers and customers every now and then."
good,"My coworkers made it a fun place to work but the managers were very rude to us.  They would become even more mean to those of us that remained when a good worker left for a better, higher paying job."
good,"there are various areas to work and each require different skills and expectations. Overnight is mostly unloading trucks and restocking merchandise. Daytime shifts require working at registers, helping in customer service department and filling in different departments."
good,"I went in before opening, did vacuuming, cleaned the bathrooms, mopped, dusted and got the store clean for opening.  If there was a mess during the day I would clean it up."
good,"Kohl's has given me experience in dealing with cross functional projects. I have been in charge of handling communication and passing on project information throughout product development, design, production design and the photo studio. I have gained knowledge and experience that will be with me throughout my career."
good,"A typical work day check with supervisor walk to trucks make sure the truck get loaded and ready to ship."
good,"I am a seasonal employee at Kohl's, 4-5 hours per day extra income for the holidays.  I enjoy interacting with the staffs and a good workout to get my day started."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The staff room is large and has three vending machines to choose from. you don't get your lunch paid for but sometimes they will have free snacks. they also have a tv you can watch during your brake.
good,"Very fasted pace, leaving because I am still on a 12 hour overnight shift with small children was told I only had to do it for a year. A lot of broken promises."
good,"Kohls is a great job especially for young adults.."
good,"Your hours rotate, days off are not constant and they keep moving you around so that you never get to know any one department. "
good,"It's your typical retaril job, they treat you great but it's a pretty lonely job, i didn't personally feel much unity but you're by yourself folding clothes for 9 hours."
good,"I work in red so I did a lot of different thing like unloading trailer, to setting up the floor for the after thanksgiving sell. To the shipping thing back after the sell went off."
good,It was a great experience working their. I learned a lot about retail. I recommend anyone to work their. It was a very warm place to work and wouldnt  mind working their again. I had a wonderful time and the customers was very nice and understanding to work wit
good,A typical day was making sure all clothes were put back and out of the fitting rooms. I learned about putting out new merchandise. I also learned how to put out displays to make the store more interactive and engaging. The hardest part was working on the logistics team and unloading the truck to put the merchandise onto the sales floor. The most enjoyable was working the beauty department and interactive with customers at the registers.
good,very flexible working hours. works with your availability.low pay but gets paid weekly. friendly environment and good discounts.management is friendly
good,Very fast pace job but not many hours and was laid off after Christmas time. Reapplied later for job but was not called back to work. I never received over 20 hours of work per week.
good,My experience at Kohl's was good.  I learned a lot in the time I was there and would recommend this company as a starting point to many optional career paths.
good,Normal part-time retail job. Room for some advancement in-store if you make a decent reputation for yourself by showing up and not slacking off too much.
good,i have been with kohls for almost 10 years and i love it.  it is the best part time job for a lot of people. discounts are good as well. hours are generally flexible.
good,"I haven't taken a single break since working at Kohl's. Not by own choice, but that it's expected. If you do take the break that you're scheduled for, you're scolded and punished. There is also poor communication on all levels of the corporate structure and managers will consistently contradict one another. There is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company if you so wish, but a lot of that is due to the high turn over rate even among managers!"
good,Nice people always there to help when needed. Clean work place always organized and professional. Not many hours and not benifits. But not a bad job to start at.
good,I liked it here. I'd recommend to anyone considering. The customers are nice and easy to work with and the managers are nice as well. The downside is the rush during the holidays.
good,"I advanced in the company in 3 monthes, but after a while i would work overtime and not be paid, or put in departments my job title wasn't. Management would then chastise me for not being in my department and after a year and a half i could not argue anymore."
good,"I love this job, but its not a job for someone that's not in school or who don't have another job because for me I couldn't pay all my bills working here. at least back then when I was working there they could have changed."
good,I prefer not to answer this question.  I have only worked for Kohl's a short time and do not feel it would be fair to them to give a review therefore I won't.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a very busy establishment. Working here taught me how to meet deadlines, keep the work area organized, and multitask. What makes the job difficult is there constant rotation of store managers."
good,"A Typical Day at work for me was Helping customers find shoes. making sure the shoe department was clean and presentable. Getting shoes from the front of the store and putting them back in the correct location. Pulling new shoes from the stock and putting them in the correct location, Tagging shoes. All in all Kohls is not a bad place to look for employment"
good,"Ok place to work, not much advancement opportunity, pay raises not to good, micro managing is what there good at, plenty of hours at Christmas but not much else the rest of the year"
good,"The company has great values and ideas but it’s hard to maintain those values and ideas when they hire people who don’t respect them, this all of course depends on the manager who hires. They do show a sense of care towards employees and it’s easy to tell that there is a feeling of family culture."
good,"A typical day was taxing on your body, picking up heavy boxes, unloading boxes from truck. Packing and shipping boxes for shipment. Learned the meaning of hard work."
good,"Overall, working at kohls was a building experience. It taught customer service skills and helped me learn to handle long and stressful situations with a smile on my face."
good,While here I learned how to read an inventory placement floor map and set up the children's department using that map.  The staff was great and made Kohl's a fun place to work.
good,Personally working at more than one Kohl's location I can say that the quality of the store depends on the people that work there. I have worked at one store that I despised and another store I loved. The actual job is simple and easy depending on what position you enter.
good,"They have a good and strong team."
good,"management were all very helpful and friendly, providing a great work experience. fellow sales associates were very polite and friendly as well. the job you are working is always made more enjoyable when those around you seem happy."
good,It was a lot of fun working for Kohl's but they had no organization and after constantly covering other people's shifts and working very very hard my hours went to one day a week.
good,Working at Kohls is nice and the discounts are also great. Only thing they could improve on is hours for students and also higher pay. The pay is too low and the hours are no consistent.
good,"You get a lot of hours during the holiday season from Thanksgiving to the New Year. However, after the season is over hours are drastically cut. You do get an awesome discount though."
good,This is a place designed for high school students. The management works with high school schedules and allows time off for important activities such as prom.
good,We need to clock in then we needed to check in what cash register we going to be located .. we then entered in our information and started to work .. For me it was fun I loved being there but I didn’t have enough hours .. I had to call every day because they never gave me a shift.
good,My experience and Kohl's allowed me to work for the most part flexible hours so that I could go to school.  Enjoyed the co-workers met through the years.
good,"I loved Kohls when I first started working here, they have a great and caring company and I was in love with my position as an omni associate. They are tech savy, and appear to be a conscientious company actively encouraging an uplifting, inclusive, and eco-friendly culture. They have amazing employee discounts. The management at my store deteriorated and everything became chaos, people quitting left and right simply to avoid a particular person. People quit bosses, not jobs."
good,"I loved working with the customers, they were always lovely and enjoyed my help and support in the shoes department, but I had a major problem with organization of who should be doing what during each shift so I would come into work and spend hours cleaning and then still have to do all of the tasks that I was asked to do from my manager."
good,"Kohl's is a nice place to work, Management and job culture is good the work/life balance is great. Only complaints are that I'm not receiving enough hours to survive on my salary and there seems to be no room for advancement along with not having compensation or benefits. Hardest part of the job is keeping the floor clean. I really enjoy those I work with. A typical day at work varies from day to day depending on what department I work that day. I have learned better customer service skills. The work place culture is great I enjoy working with my co workers"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls was a nice place to work seasonally. It was fast paced. They kept an up beat pace. Management was always there to help. I even went back to work a second time for the holidays.
good,Kohls is a fun workplace If you are a social person working in the dc there are lots of new people you get to meet working the job very friendly environment
good,"Assisting customer with satisfaction, ordering and replacing of their credit card"
good,"This is a perfect job for Part-time cannidets. It does take a long time to move up, but other than that, everyone is friendly, most of the time your hunting for orders or just folding and helping customers."
good,"It was a great place to work, with great teamwork and communication. They were fleixble with days off that were needed and there was a very positive atmosphere."
good,"working here was straight forward and I found it easy to complete my tasks as a packer, mostly because I got to use my headphones and listen to music."
good,"Clear company direction"
good,The staff at the location that I worked were very polite and welcoming. It was my first time being a point of sales associate but they made sure I knew what I was doing before I was left alone with a register. They were not very informative with the Kohl's credit and how to sign customers up for it but I wasn't there long enough to actually learn. If it were not a seasonal job and I had more hours I would have definitely stayed.
good,"I love working here, the people are great, but I feel we are extremely underpaid for the work we did. Standing for 6+ hours, walking the store constantly, lifting heavy items repetitively, and those who unload the trucks work even harder. Lifting and pulling constantly, then walking the store after to put everything away. I just don't think $9 is sufficient. We are only eligible for raises after working there for a year, and even then it's only maybe a quarter."
good,Great company to work for friendly people good competition and they rated the employees well a lot of benefits for them . The lunch and eating areas very progressive
good,"Greeted and assisted customers in a friendly manner. Very fast pasted. Never boring, always something to do to include back up cashiers. Very flexible schedule."
good,"Fun and engaging place to work. Management and employees are friendly. There is a large workload, but they provide ample training. I would recommend working here."
good,As a seasonal employee I enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. It was a wonderful working experience that had me work closely with not only the other employees but also directly with the customers that came in.
good,My experience with working at Kohls was good. I loved the atmosphere and co workers but some management was awful. You never knew who they was gonna be one day from the next. No I'm not talking about physically I'm talking about personality wise. Its was like working with Dr. Jekhyl and Mr. Hyde. There was a level of cleanliness that the store had to keep and that was great because I hate going into a store that looks destroyed. But over all It was a nice place to work
good,Good place to start to work pay is alittle low back when I started but right now I'm sure of what it is but overall friendly co workers and easy going management if you do what they say
good,"I didn't last very long maybe like 3 weeks. The people for the most part are very nice. No one seemed to mind helping anyone else. I will say that they should spend more time actually training people and allowing them to get used to it before having them learn something else. Everyday I was doing something different so I always felt like I never knew what to do. This store is very big on customer satisfaction and team work. They have no problem changing your availability, they really want you to work when you can. I left because this job didn't pay enough and I didn't like it. Pretty much everyone is part time except a couple mangers."
good,"I enjoy working at Kohls and the company has good values. However, the management always focuses too much on getting credit cards rather than customer service. Additionally, the employees I have worked with often gossip and have a negative attitude towards others."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at Kohls part-time during Highschool and then during College. They were always willing to work with my school schedules. "
good,The employees were great! The work place was low stress and everyone made it fun to be there. Management was always helpful and loved answering questions.
good,replenish socks shoes blankets tshirts underwear cards boxes towels tissue electronics soap candles jewelry tv paper toys ties sheets perfume deodorant
good,"I honestly loved working at Kohl's for the most part. However, it seemed as if my manager at the time played favorites with certain employees and was very demanding about opening new Kohl's Charge Accounts. I started out getting horrible hours, but obviously the more charge accounts you open, the more hours you get. Around October, after working for a few months, my hours increased to about 30-40 hours a week and then suddenly dropped to 4 a week once the second week of January came around. However, ""certain"" employees were still getting their 40 hours. "
good,Worked during school so I was part time. Typically no more than 15 hours a week maybe 25 at the most. Just maintain area and store racks and clothing.
good,You will be fine at this job as long as you are willing to do and learn pretty much everything possible. Don't be surprised if management really pushed selling credit a lot which can make your interaction with customers awkward at time.
good,ITS a good job if ur first starting out cant really complain about it and the hours are flexible and its a very comfortable enviorment the people are eazy to work with
good,"Even though you had to hurry and get the information down, it was easy to get the movement for it. Really fun and help workers there that will make you feel like your family."
good,Kohl's was a great first time job for me as a high school student. Everyone was nice and I was a fast learner. They were able to work around my school schedule and I was happy where I was.
good,"As a sales associate, I would come in for a shift and get my gear, then wal through my designated area and fitting rooms to figure out what to start with. I would start with the messiest areas, folding and hanging clothes and putting them in their correct spots, and I would check the fitting rooms periodically. I would listen on my headset for questions or requests from my supervisor or fellow associates. Customers would come for me with questions about pricing and specific sizes, and I would also take calls from customers looking to place specific items on hold. If I was closing that night, one supervisor in particular would expect us to have every item in the store folded or hung and sized while continuing to help customers, but with so few associates working and the company's refusal to schedule more people at busy times, we couldn’t get it all done and it would be left for the morning shift."
good,"Love that I got to listen to music while working"
good,A good place to work I had to resign without any notice due to a school conflict. I loved the people that i worked with. All very kind and inviting. They will help you with whatever you will need
good,Kohl's is not a bad place to work when looking for a retail job. The atmosphere was always fun and the people were really nice. The customers could be a bit mean but other than that it was good.
good,"I had no problem with working at kohl's as a cashier. It was fun and focused and didn't pay too poorly. My only problem with the job was when I had to work the floor primarily because I didn't see it as my job. Still, it was necessary, so I knew i should do it."
good,"It was a typical retail job, but the managers and associates made a difference to how I felt about the job. Decent employee discount, and a few times a year there would be an additional discount on ""prestige items""."
good,"I have 24+ years experience in working in retail, handling money, price changes, answering phones, assistance with customers, signing customers up for store charges/ rewards cards, unloading truck, merchindicing, & customer service skills. Etc."
good,Kohl's was a fun job.  I love problem solving when it comes to dealing with difficult customers.  I loved stocking the shelves and giving customers deals so that they could enjoy Kohl's products.
good,I liked it everyone was really nice. The pay was good for a high school student. Great work environment in my opinion. Very well managed and good hours.
good,"I loved working for Kohls even though you work long hours they pay u right with continuous bonuses, and possible full time position if your work ethic is right"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great place to work!! Friendly environment and very fast paced. Depending on the availability that was listed when applying is fairly dispersed each week.
good,In the day to day setting you would clock in AND have someone looking for you within  5 mins because we are poorly staffed. I did learn how to work with diversity or cultural stereotyping in the work place. The best thing about my job would be the discount.
good,A typical day at work would be fairly steady. I learned how to use the bailer in the back of store. I enjoyed working here because of my associates mainly. Everyone at my location was very nice and hardworking.
good,"Unless it's Black Friday week or near another holiday, days are pretty relaxed."
good,"The managers are nice, but if you want to be scheduled a certain way you need to really let them know. Working lots of weekends should also be expected. All co-workers are really nice."
good,"I had a lot of fun when I worked here. The pay sucked, but it was great while it lasted. I loved my supervisor. She was an incredible person and I loved every second working with her. I loved all of the people I worked with and made up for the late hours during the holiday season. I would recommend for anyone looking for a fun job with great people to worth with."
good,"I only worked for the holiday season. The job was okay but it wasn't my cup of tea. The management was iffy and my co-workers weren't the friendliest but other than that, it was an okay job."
good,"Not much to say, just a good place to work, managers worked well with me given I was a high school student. Would consider working there again over the summer."
good,"Kohls was never a bad job, I enjoy working there. The people and environment are excellent. I just didn’t see myself growing in the company. That’s all."
good,"Very simple, but fast paced. Stressful around holidays. Was enjoyable because the coworkers made it so. The managers were helpful when needed. Most employees were paid weekly. Was not hard to learn for a new position."
good,I am learning new things every day. Management tries to be accommodating with changes in scheduling. It would be awesome if all the managers told you the same thing.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls. My experience was awesome from the cleanliness of the store to the managers who ran it. Everyone worked as a team to keep the customers satisfied.
good,A day can go quickly if it is busy if it is slow it may seem to drag on. It is great when you can help someone find what they are looking for. Management did a good job.
good,-A typical day can be very different from day to day. Some days may be very slow with slow work. Others are very busy making the work all over the place
good,"Collecting online ordered products for packaging to be distributed to consumers.Scanner used to organize the process. Use of the scanner and practicing organizational skills. Management was helpful in use of scanner and location of various material.Organized, but busy. Remembering scanner functions and product locations. People I worked with."
good,"Too focused on credit applications, scheduling was awful and could've been much better to fit everyone's needs. Hired just about anybody that interviewed."
good,"I worked for Kohl's during the Christmas season.  Some weeks I worked 6 days in a row, which was tiring.  I loved assisting the customers and the excitement in the store. I would definitely recommend working in retail at Christmas-time; it is fun."
good,"I have learned a lot working as a cashier at Kohls but now looking for a job that pays a bit more the employees there are all very nice and helpful"
good,Full-time usually works there days and two closing.  Which can be tolerable but then a price change event comes up and they flip you to 3rd shift for three nights. Once done you're flipped back to first shift. The only thing you can count on are your weekends off twice a month. Since everyone works everywhere as needed.... It's very hard to hold lazy people accountable. They can say that they were on the register too much or had to cover breaks and it kept them from completing their job. Sometimes it happens but it's easy for some to use that as a crutch. Never enough time to make your area top notch. Which is very frustrating when you work hard and strive for perfection. They must do a better job on background checks. Especially their key people like loss prevention.
good,"it was very easy  and laid back but  they really made you push credit cards through Kohl's. Black friday was insane, management is nice and flexible. Hours suck for minors"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"By working at the customer service desk at the Apple Valley store, it was a great experience and my co-workers were amazing. Everyone supported one another, and I made some great friends."
good,"Kohl's is fast paced, and competitive. "
good,"management was very strict on how things were to be done, the co-workers were not very personable and their customer service skills needed work, some of the co-workers were very difficult to work with."
good,"A call center can be very rewarding with the pay, however for some people it may be a struggle to sit down all day. I loved making a lot of money, but did not enjoy the fact going home at eleven pm at night. I would recommend this job to others , but for me i just can' sit down all day."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a great experience, I learned a lot or I wouldn't have been there for over 30 years. It was easy for me because I help open the first Kohl's in Michigan and then went on to other stores.Manager had a lot of confidence in me and I was able train new hires as well as some managers."
good,"I enjoyed working at kohls. days will never be the same with the variety of tasks needing to be completed, management is very supportive and always available to help"
good,Workplace was good paced with something to do as there is always apparel to be organized and cleaned up from customers. Teamwork was good as we were assigned an area to maintain.
good,Kohls was pretty slow pretty much all year except black friday. I worked in the jewelry department which I was allowed to walk more than 5 feet away from. I was constantly looking for things to do and trying to keep myself busy. the discounts were awesome but it was pretty hard to find someone to cover me for breaks and lunches usually.
good,"It was a nice place to work, many opportunities to extend the hours you were given. great discounts. really strong training programs. a nice place to work if willing to work under pressure."
good,"I like work in Kohl's ,if they give me more work hours and better wages .I always work hard and have a good relationship with my coworkers and customers likes me. i am happy work in Kohl's for two years."
good,"Generally they have a relaxed atmosphere, around the holidays it is very busy, and customers can be extremely rude for no reason. they push credit sales a lot."
good,"Kohls prides itself on an image of strict customer-first basis. Most new hires are either older retirees or young college age kids just starting out, first job. Isn't always easy, dealing with the public is stressful, demanding and sometimes downright harrowing in terms of eye opening interactions (not always the best of eye openers). It is rewarding in that you walk away with an ingrained sense of self worth: you are not the job, you're here to gain skills and make money towards the next big thing."
good,There is a blackout period during the holiday. This means you cannot request off during this time period so you either get your shift covered or call out for about 2 months. Otherwise the staff is phenomenal.
good,It was an experience where I learned more about managing other staff. the supervisor position gave me the opportunity to learn how to lead in a fast work environment.
good,Kohls was an amazing first job. My department supervisor always made it clear what she wanted me to do. My coworkers were also amazing with me. Since I am a student they always made sure I would have my days off when needed or only called me in after school.
good,A great place to learn customer service skills and use advance check out systems. As well as working with other team members. Everyone at Kohl's was always super helpful when going through the training process.
good,"Kohl's is a good, fast paced environment. The work is difficult, but engaging. You work together for a single goal, and the sense of accomplishment is very satisfactory."
good,"Kohls was just like being at home cleaning, sorting and folding clothes. Organizing things and keeping everything in order. I went from being a home and kids associate to a cashier"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Everyone that works there is very friendly and I always enjoy who I work with. Everyone is very helpful and willing to do the best they can. The managers are all very nice and willing to do what ever they can to help you succeed at your job.
good,"You will quickly learn how to tend to customers, while maintaining your department and covering registers in times of high volume. However, those that work on the floor with you, make the job a little easier through teamwork."
good,There was no free time at all but it was a way better experience than working at amazon I would say to make sure you have comfortable walking shoes!!!
good,Kohl's is a decent job for anybody looking for part time minimum wage work. I do recommend that one must have another job in order to supplement your income as their hours can fluctuate quite a bit and is not by any means consistent.
good,"Overall a good place to work. Learn a lot of skills, and meet a lot of people. Operate handheld devices, price changes, unload trucks, handle merchandise, clean and sort stock, handle backstock, drive a large truck, etc."
good,"Fun environment with great people. I don't think I was paid for how hard I worked and how much I accomplished. It was a good time though, the manager was amazing."
good,"Perfect job for a college student with flexible hours and decent pay. There were four hour shift, sometimes six. Around the holidays is only time working at kohls became very busy."
good,kohls was up an coming retailer with lots of ideas on how to grow.  They did the right thing of taking care of their associates while expanding.  There were lots of opportunities within the company.
good,Typically i would come in and go directly to the fitting rooms and start my day by putting clothes back. I learned a lot more about retail from working at Kohls. Along with learning new skills on how to manage the cleanliness of the store i also learned more and gained more experience with cashiering.
good,Too many management people changes. In one year our mgmt changed every few month.  No one is trained enough when they start.  Information is not shared.
good,"Although it was a seasonal job, I did enjoy working here, and felt I was paid fairly and given enough hours. Break time could be improved for long shifts, but that is the only true complaint"
good,"For the most part, everyone works very collaboratively. However, it becomes stressful when miscommunication happens. My favorite part is the incentives they offer for when you go above and beyond."
good,They didn’t let you know when your season was over they just stopped scheduling you. But other than that it was an okay job decent hours not 40 hours a week like you supposed to get but decent.
good,I handled customers with their concerns and their questions. I made sure my register side was organized and cleaned. I helped people get rewards and credit in our store to save them more money in the long run.
good,"i worked seasonal and i enjoyed it. management was ok, good perks, and the people i worked with was fun made my day go by pretty fast. i'll recommend this job"
good,"Good for me work part time, clean, open communication, team work, fun learn each other, cooperate, cool shopping there and new things. Straight clothes and clean fitting room, backroom."
good,"It’s a good seasonal job ....................................................if you don’t pick enough you won’t make it 180+ a hour "
good,"Loss Prevention Supervisor:"
good,good job for extra cash on holidays. The only down-side of the company is the follow staff and co-workers. Its filled with an younger crowd which makes it the job accessible to distractions.
good,"managers manage things not people, There is very little training if you're a fast learner or self starter you will do fine. The store has potential but management needs leadership training."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Most fellow employees are pleasant to work with. Management is almost always available when needed. Always something to do to stay busy. Office staff is always very friendly.
good,"it was a good and fun company to work for. fast paced especially during the Christmas, Easter and 4th of July holidays. It could become stressful at time if you worked in customer service returns. but I had good support."
good,"Left for personal reasons.  The hours were varied.  Management was supportive.  Learned how to merchandise products."
good,"It's a nice place to work at with very flexible hours. However, the only complaint is that part time hours are far too few when not in the holiday season, well under standard part time hours."
good,I really did love working for Khols and the beauty department was so much fun. I did run into the issue of constantly being put to work in other departments because I was cross trained. A lot of times this caused me to be behind in my own department.
good,Kohls is open pretty late at night so if you go to school during the day you can still get a good amount of hours in that night. You work close with coworkers and they become great friends.
good,"This is a great first job. There is so much you learn like customer service, time management, and how to work in a team. It's definitely not a career, but a great place for people new to the workforce."
good,The company itself needs to step up. The seasonal employees are making more then the veteran employees. The Discounts and management were great. More hours between Thanksgiving and Christmas but then hours get majorly cut.
good,"Kohl's has a great diverse culture, and  caring co-workers.  A little unorganized at times and constantly changing,  however that should be expected at call centers."
good,Quick paced.  Always have plenty to do.  Great people to work with and a good environment overall.  Kohls really focuses on training and team building within their company and that was great to see from a company.  Would like if they paid a little better and modified their hours...24 hrs is a bit much during the holidays guys...
good,I started at Kohl's temporary seasonal.  I was kept on after the holidays and I really enjoyed working the register up front.  The customers were friendly and so was the staff.
good,Kohl's is a great company to be a part of! Freedom to execute personalized strategies to achieve goals. Team-oriented. Positive reinforcement. Great!!
good,"I enjoyed working with people, so i had to comunicate woth people all the time and that i enjoyed, for that there are alot of diffrent people that you need to know and work with. i had no problem solving their issues and needs. but the manegment wasnt great at all they told me to do something and expected something else."
good,"Fast pace environment, lots of house keeping duties to keep up with such as fitting room, cleaning off the floor and maintaining a reasonable fixture/ folded clothes. Many things to learn from at end of the day, definitely a learning experience."
good,"The training wasn't helpful due to a lot of staff shortage.  Also, never enough sales associates to cover for another employee call outs.  Not really organized within the store nor management.  Departments were always messy and needed much cleaning that would never get to due to coverage within departments."
good,"I enjoyed working at kohl's, especially it was my first job. co workers were friendly . working hours were flexible. we could exchange shifts. I learned to be more patient ."
good,Enjoyable work environment with energetic coworkers. Managers were friendly and very easy to talk to. Overall great seasonal job to be at during christmas.
good,It is usually very busy at Kohl's. I learned how to assist customers with all type of questions and concerns. The supervisors are very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job is selling the store credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public
good,nice place to work.  The pay advanced pretty good in the three years i was working there.  Nice store discounts.  nice coworkers.  easy non stressful environment.
good,I have very much enjoyed my time at Kohls. Great associates and great managers. Also and awesome store discount.Working with the public can be a challenge having great peers always makes it easier!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,started working with Kohl's corporation is a big advantage because they have very good reputation. This is my First job in USA since i have moved here from india. Very good working environment and staff.
good,The company was a very good company to work for. The supervisors and co workers were a lot of fun. You were always busy and the day went by fast. Always running around to do.
good,"My older sister had been working there for several years. I worked as a seasonal (temporary) employee. They take good care of their employees. I was paid minimum wage. Positive atmosphere, good coworkers and management. Would recommend a friend to apply."
good,"Customer service was the foundation of the organization.   A typical working day, the pace is steady and there are individuals willing to help if help is needed."
good,It's a good place to work and increase your customer interaction skills. Excellent team work by both management and staff. Engagement between management and associates is almost always positive.
good,The work I was given seemed more as busy work. The other employees my age worked the floor while the older employees were able to stand at the registers all day. The best part of my day was customer interaction because your never near your employees really.
good,"Kohl's provides their employees with excellent benefits such as different percentages throughout the year on name brand products. Furthermore, the leadership at this store location is wonderful.  They provide the staff with encouragement on a daily basis."
good,"Kohls is one of the best companies I ever worked for. I would defenately recommend it as a job for a young college student, but not for someone supporting a family."
good,I thought that Kohl's was a great place to work but they did not give me enough hours. The managers and the GM were great people and fun to work with and for. I would go back to Kohl's for a season again if I had the chance.
good,"Great people to work with, learned alot from the daily interactions with customers and fellow associates. Would definitely recommend to people to start here."
good,"Working at Kohl's was fun but unfortunately hours were not consistent, was hard to budget a living.  Hours varied from day to day and so did which department you worked in."
good,good place with good hours. I really enjoyed the family element that was brought to the table. Everyone should look for work at this company and enjoy it.
good,"I work as the Misses Manager and enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot and made some great friends. I was responsible for displaying stock, replenishing stock and maintaining the floor as well as the dressing rooms. It was a easy place to work and comfortable environment. The hardest part was difficult customers. The manager was cool and very personable."
good,"this Is a great, normal paced environment. the staff all the way down to the customers if kind and friendly. you got a mandatory 3 brakes if you work 8hr shifts."
good,"Fun environment to begin life in the workforce for younger people and adults alike. Hours can be hectic and a bit stressful, but work is simplistic and you are awarded if you go above and beyond."
good,"depending on the sales that were going on, the day would either be slow or fast paced. If there were no customer, I would be asked to be folding clothes or cleaning out the resgisters spaces and be able to keep in eyesight the registers in case a customer showed up to either shop or pay their credit card bill"
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's, I work in the women.s section which was very busy and demanding at times . I needed to have more hours or full time and was not possible ."
good,"If you enjoy working with customers, this is an excellent job for you. I enjoyed working with the staff and for the customers. There is a lot of interaction with the consumer if you are a cashier. This is a great job for starting out your work career. I had changed from secretarial to customer service and enjoyed this job."
good,Kohls is a fast paced retail. It is also a credit based company meaning your always asking customer if they would like to sign up for a Kohls card. The management is always asking if you ask the customer if they wanted to sign up. The workplace can be a fun place to work if you're nice to the other associates. The hardest part of the job is the customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was relationships that were made while working there.
good,"Kohl's is a great store to work at. I started out seasonal, then moved to permanent, part-time."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls like other brick and mortar retail stores is striving to stay alive. I think they stand a good chance of surviving this difficult situation with a few online changes and other progressive upgrades."
good,"good hours "
good,"Lots of opportunities for hours to work, although not as easy to advance. Plenty of different jobs - stocking, truck days, cashier, various departments, and merchandising, just to name a few. Fun environment, great products, and lots of sales and discounts!"
good,"This review is specifically for working at Kohl's corporate headquarters. As with any corporate place, you need a thick skin and a high tolerance for bullcrap to work here. But there are a ton of great people at Kohl's and a ton of great perks. The pay is kinda meh, but don't discount things like free gym memberships, sweet cafeterias on site and tons of events put on just for associates. Plus, because retail is a fast-moving environment with lots of changes and developments happening all the time in terms of technology, there's always a lot going on to keep you busy and, even when the work sucks (because all work sometimes sucks), you're at least still learning stuff."
good,It's a great place to work for a second job or a first time job. If you are looking for a place to further your career it will take a lot longer there
good,"I spent hours on the register, performed inventory, worked in many different departments because I was flexible enough in my managers' eyes to do so. Worked customer service predominantly because of my fast-paced, friendly service accompanied by fast-learning to help assess certain aspects and problems that would arise within the company"
good,"I only worked as a seasonal sales associate for 4 months. The hours weren't great, but it's a great environment to work in. There's room for advancement and my coworkers were pleasant for the most part. It's a good first job."
good,"Although the atmosphere is good most of the time, the stresses of working with customers on a day to day basis can weigh on the managers and coworkers and create a stressful work environment. Add that in with the lack of advancement opportunities and the poor management."
good,"Working in a busy store can be high stress from the multiple task that are required, but with the employees at the location it'll be fun and feel like a second family. Management is firm but fair and expect a lot to keep the store in tip top shape."
good,It was a unique chance to learn about the Kohls stores. I enjoyed my time at Kohls and learned a lot about retail and just wish that school did not get in the way of this experience.
good,"I worked early morning crew for the holiday season, therefore the job was temporary. I unloaded trucks and sorted product. I enjoyed working with everyone there!"
good,"I didn't work here for long due to school and other jobs, but while I did, it was a decent place to work. Not very fast paced, actually quite boring. You get your breaks pretty much right on time because it's so slow, so you never have to worry about that. There was  A LOT of workplace drama though."
good,coworkers were great. made friends with some. downfall was had to travel farther then expected. was able to find a coworker to carpool with. only a temporally job.
good,"good so far .A very engaging ,dynamic workplace. "
good,"·	Explained local ingredient sources, the importance of sustainability, and product nutritional information with a focus on gluten-free and dairy-free foods."
good,"As a sales associate, a typical day consisted of just floor management. Keeping your area clean and organized for guest."
good,Kohls was very laid back but the issue I had was it interfered with my school. And plus it was a seasonal job so I did not last long there. I felt as if there was a lot of favoritism
good,"Waiting on consumers, taking payments, returns, exchanges, merchandise markdowns., also had to oversee money drawer, and counting on a nightly basis, along with three other registers in that department."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here, great people! The customers are all very friendly and even when you get a customer that isn't the managers will always help out."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The work environment was fun and the people I worked with were nice, I didn't have much experience in this work but it wasn't long to catch on. I worked overnight which made thing a lot nicer."
good,"As with any retail job, you can have between 4-30 hours per week. And they pay was not great. But the people there were fantastic, and I can honestly say I had the best management team ever during my time there."
good,Fun place to work with lots of benefits.  Fun to meet clothing designers. Great lunches and breakfasts in their on-site lunch rooms. Daycare and fitness center on site are awesome.
good,It's a great place to work as long as you enjoy teamwork and a quick pace. Management was amazing and always working to make our jobs more enjoyable. It's also a fun plane to work if you enjoy friendly competition.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet. In my position I learned better customer service skill and the best way to merchandise products to help produce sales.
good,"I've been working at Kohls during the fall season for the past two years. It has really been a great experience you meet lots of great people. The environment is very laid back except during the Black Friday rush; it gets busy busy busy, but its all fun. Everyone seems to have such positive attitudes and are super understanding."
good,"Staff is very talented and results driven, with every level of the organization empowered to do their job and make decisions.  Work hours are long with heavy workload."
good,I love this job most of the time it was busy but it was a learning experience for me it was my first job.. The supervisor was great the breaks was a hour. Excellent work place
good,Great job but my check was messed up from there. But they did make sure it was fix and I can say for that it is a wonderful place to work. The customers was never rude and the managers was always there to help
good,"The in-house fulfillment / online order position was a position for the Holiday season, so it was fast paced.  Work was for the most part alone - you had to shop the store and warehouses for online requests, print labels and package material. I really enjoyed the staff, everyone was very helpful when I first started."
good,The workers are what make the place. It can be fun to work with the public as well. The employee discount is nice to have around the holidays and special occasions.
good,I worked for Kohl's for many years. I enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot. I would work there again if I could. Great people and great management. Like serving customers.
good,"Most days I work at the customer service desk. I process refunds, answer customers questions and concerns, re- ticket items to be returned to store floor, research items for price tags, process online orders."
good,I was hired on during the holiday season things was very fast paced. I would spend most of the day restocking shelves and re organizing the clothes that had been thrown everywhere on the shelves.
good,"If you ever want to feel like your job is never done, work here. If you want to be given multiple tasks at once and confusing directions from management, work here. i have worked at kohls for 3 years, and the new team of administrators has changed everything about the store around. the administrators clearly have not figured out what works for the store, and considering how highly trafficked the store is they continue to change their approaches every few weeks or so, never fully seeing the effects of their old plans."
good,Working at Kohls was a great way to learn customer service skills. The job was also a good way to get some retail experience and is a good place to start out or continue your experience.
good,"I was responsible for the staffing, cash office, registers, etc. I already had a management background so I didn't learn anything new, except about the company. "
good,Kohl's is a great place to work where customer service always comes first. We have a strong team and always work together in order to get things done more efficiently.
good,productive and friendly. was very easy to get along with the staff. made sure the work was done in an affective manner and made all the customers feel welcomed as well
good,"I really enjoyed my time at kohls, my reason for leaving was the pay, and the managers. I was picking up everyone's slack and making minimum wage. The managers micro managed and watched over you as if you couldn't do you're job alone."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great company , friendly hard workers ,great supervisors , an great environment to work & learn more about warehouse & General labor . A very great experience"
good,Only worked there for a few months. I was a seasonal worker. Loved the place. Loved the managers and training was easy. I worked the 6a.m. to 6p.m. shifts on Saturday and Sunday. We got all our breaks on time.
good,"Folding clothes can be a boring job, but if you work with friends or fun people it isnt too much of a drag. They always give you breaks and occasionally order food for everyone."
good,"There is a staff meeting before every shift so you know what you should be doing every time you go in. Management was very willing to work with you and assist if need be. The hardest part of the job would be lifting heavy objects. As a packer you are grabbing items from shelves and the weight of the items adds up fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work alone. I got my assignment at the beginning of my shift and then i was alone, packing, for 6 hours."
good,I enjoyed working there but one thing that was pushed upon employees was to get people to SIGN UP FOR KOHLS CREDIT...we aren't salespeople here. Bottom line is that you are working with a bunch of high schoolers and they call in all the time.
good,"The management here is very helpful and understanding. If you had a question on how to do this or how to do that, they would take the time to help you out. Also, the employees there are friendly and quick in service."
good,"Loved the people and customers I worked with. Dealt with good products that do what they are supposed to do. Only problem I had with the job was management. During interview they said I'd get 22 hours a week, then they cut it down to 8 hours and told me that the only way to get more hours is to work outside of my department (beauty) Made the job really unstable. I did like the upbeat, happy environment though."
good,"Kohl's helped me learn what it meant to be apart of a collective team. There is responsibility at each level, and each person helped forward the positive culture of the company."
good,"•	Organize and clean the shoe department by gender, style, and size"
good,"The front end was where I was located, point of purchase where customers would finalize their purchase after shopping.  Being able to open John's charges was one criteria that I would have to meet, atleast 3 a shift. Working with customer service was always interesting due to the fact that the customer was always right. Being able to put a smile on their face was always the key to end each interaction with a customer. Working in the public always made the time go by rather quickly along with cleaning the register and setting up new product's and matching P.Os."
good,"great people to work with"
good,"The team was incredible. Everyone is super helpful, and welcoming. I felt very comfortable with the job after just a day of working. The hours were flexible which was excellent. Mangers were easy to approach and helpful when asked questions."
good,"The place can get very busy during sale weeks and it can get very stressful dealing with all of the customers, but it's best to stay composed. I learned how to handle money, develop skills in customer service and learn how to calmly deal with people. The management is great, they are always looking to help out and always have your back when dealing with any problems. The culture is good, everyone is friendly and says hello to each other when they clock in to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with any customers that can be frustrating and will not take no for an answer when asking about coupons and sales that are not going on. The best part of the job is when you help a customer and they are grateful for the help and thank you for doing a good job."
good,"I enjoyed my time at kohl's and I would apply again at a different location. The kohl's I worked at was a little crazy and unorganized, but I've learned a lot and learned how to do things properly."
good,Like as the title says I think kohls is a great job to start out with because it is very leanient and there is alot to learn and discover.My typical day is cleaning up and greeting customers and driving sales and much as I can as well as keeping up with new product coming in and putting product out as much as I can.
good,If you enjoy fast paced retail work kohls is the place to be. The management really acknowledges a job well done. The employees are friendly and fun. You can run into some bad apple customers but that's retail.
good,Great job. Just bad employees. All the ot u wanted. Loved the eo department. Some people just slacked on their job which made everyone else work hard with slow progress
good,"Seasonal job i loved it, people where great, the hardest part was figuring out where everything was in the warehouse.management was great worked with my college schedule.  Overall great job."
good,A typical day at work I would come in greet people at the front go to the back and some would immediately tell me to go to dressing rooms or cashier sometimes not always.
good,"Good work  place ,benefits are excellent   "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work.  Although I only worked a seasonal position I enjoyed it lots of fun and happy people. At times it was rough working black Friday but we'll worth it.
good,"Usually stay fairly busy doing something, like helping customers or clean and tidy up the sales floor. Most of the customers and other associates are friendly and easy to work with."
good,"With working at Kohls for about 3 years I found that even if you didn't get to make full time hours at such low pay, there are always other associates willing to give up their shifts so that you can earn a higher paycheck."
good,I love Kohls but the manager has issues.  I love the products and all the staff. Everyone was committed to total customer satisfaction and made it easy to deliver it.
good,This job was enjoyable but ended because I was just seasonal help. Work was fun but so early. I learned how to fold a shirt properly. And working with the customer sometimes was cool.
good,"Only time you get hours is during seasonal other than that you get 20-25 hrs a week. the jobis easy , its really not that hard at all. I have not much to say about the place."
good,"While Kohl's doesn't pay its employees very well, it was a very fun place to work. The atmosphere was for the most part friendly, however there are some managers who are not qualified for their position. The store manage is a really friendly and nice guy who will work with you on any problems you have and truly does listen."
good,One day from the next I was excited to go into work i enjoyed my coworkers very much.The managers were very nice and willing to help you out with any problems you might have.I was trained very thoroughly and didn't have to feel lost when I first started
good,"job was easy and was a nice environment to work in, management is good and are willing to work with associates schedules especially with students.  would recommend job to anyone"
good,A typical work day for someone who's been there for five years is basically doing anything in any area that is asked of me. Fast paced and busy place.
good,"I had a great experience here.  I had great managers, a good team working for me, that I didn't have to babysit, and a great work schedule.  I would recommend this job to anybody looking for part time work."
good,"This is a great place to work part time, they're very flexible with hours and diverse. "
good,There was a good relationship between the sales staff and the loss preventions staff. They also had good relationships within the loss prevention market.  Overall a fun place to work.
good,working at Kohls is much better for people who are looking for part-time or seasonal work. There are no set schedules or guaranteed hours but is great for a young person just trying to gain some experience or for older folks who are retired and need some extra income.
good,Great place to work. Management in lafayette is horrible. No team work everyone for themselves. Unorganized and not helpful at all.Learned how to deal with any customer in customer service.
good,"This is a great job for when you are just starting out, either in high school or college. The hours are flexible and the discounts are really fantastic. However, they are definitely hard to maintain in hours. They fluctuate pretty heavily. During the busy, busy, busy holidays, you might get worked pretty close to about 30 hours (part time) however at the start of the year, when the shopping winds down you might only get 4-8 hours. Again, the only guarantees are full-time, and it's near impossible to get to full-time. They have very few positions that are full-time, and they are insanely hard to get into. With that being said, they do pay weekly, so you have to budget for long-term expenses, but short term expenses are pretty easy. My management was pretty easy going, and they have a really relaxed policy on attendance. It can feel like a family, and its a great job to start out, or use as a supplement job, it is insanely hard to move up in."
good,"My experiences at Kohl’s have varied greatly in the years I have been there. My duties have included unloading trucks, replenishing products on the floor, and re-arranging and moving stockroom shelves for inventory. I have also had to bag at registers for customer check-outs. I also have recently been given the responsibility to run certain departments such as shoes and housewares. When I am responsible for those departments my responsibilities have included having to help customers in those departments as well as answer the phones from other Kohl’s stores.  During the holiday months I scan inventory items and make tags, as well as tag items for clearance all throughout the year. While doing these duties I have worked on teams with other employees as well as work independently."
good,Not a good place for so one who isn't that good with lighting and fast paced. During seasonal there's a lot of freight to come through also a lot of orders. There's a time bracket for which the orders come in through and back out for shipping. You have to stay focus and work diligently in order to succeed.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I did like my time at Kohl's. It was the only place that hired my after I left college. I was able to advance from the stock room to the men's department supervisor. The schedule was hard. I did not enjoy working weekends. "
good,Good easy job for anyone looking for first time job or flexible hours. Picks up around summer time so perfect for anyone looking to earn a few extra bucks during this time.
good,"I worked a register most of the time, had some trouble with some customers. Management was good about helping with trouble customers. Good about working with student schedules. There was a 12 point system at the location I worked at where if you missed 12 shifts for any reason no excuses (unless hospitalized, or dire family emergency) you were let go."
good,Great place to work very fun I have really no complaints about that warhorse wat so ever the have awesome benefits an good mangers an great pay
good,"Since I got hired as a seasonal employee a typical work day was fast paced and hectic, but i learned a lot about retail and the processes of being on the sales floor from this job."
good,"Great place to work, a lot of opportunities to grow. Great environment and great people to work with. Pay for beauty advisor is nice"
good,"Kohls is a nice place to work as a starting job, but I recommend that you continue searching for another job or get and education while working there. Most days consist of helping customers with finding what they are looking for and selling the Kohls credit card. The stores tend to be understaffed so you need to be flexible and be able to assist in other departments of the store especially and the end of the night. With retail consistently growing and adapting to changes to laws and the market things such as benefits have become only available to full time associates(Department Leads and Managers) and hours will be capped at 27 hours a week scheduled. Luckily there is no shortage of people giving away shifts so its possible to pick up extra shifts to get more hours."
good,i liked my job itself but my coworkers i found were not always nice. my managers were hard on me considering i am a full time student and would stay later or come in extra shifts when they asked. i like the store and the company just not the location i worked at.
good,"I temporarily worked at Khols over the holidays and this was a great job that paid well, although my hours were not very well set I would still recommend this job."
good,"I loved working at kohls, but all managers except one were disliked by most of the workers. Made me not want to continue employment there. However the store manager seemed nice enough, and food was provided during Black Friday. Overall nice place to work and a friendly environment."
good,Working in Kohl's part-time was a nice experience. The workplace and everyone that worked there were so nice and very positive in what they did. They taught me plenty of different ways i can do simple things such as folding towels a certain way. Also it taught me how to manage my time.
good,"Worked as part of a Replentishment Team and Cashier. Early morning shift. Organized the overstock room, placed new product on the shelves, replentished stock, cashiered."
good,Employees and management were very friendly and helpful when it came to learning the job. Also it was a rather fun place to work because I enjoyed working with the other employees there.
good,It was a great temporary job to work around a hectic school schedule. It always had you doing and learning different things.
good,they had everything in order. it ran very smoothly. willing to work with their workers. over all very great place to work.
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for if you are willing to go the extra mile and take on many different tasks.Working here the past 4 months has taught me a lot about being a team player
good,Im good its retail not my field of studies.Its a store that sells clothes. I have part time hours Therefore i need more regardless Im a single mother of two.
good,"Loved the people I worked with and loved helping customers with all their needs. Whether it being contacting Kohl's corporate, Kohl's.com, figuring out why something showed up on their bill as it did, helping them make a payment, looking up an item in the mainframe, searching for an item at a different store, or just helping them through the store. I loved helping all the customers, and all the associates. Super fun and nice enviornment"
good,Worked in receiving merchandise and then worked new merchandise into various departments. Created sets for merchandise. Worked price change events. Assisted customers in locating merchandise. Worked point of sale.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Mostly everybody is so nice and they genuinely care about you. The managers are awful at communication though. When i was hired i was told by the manager of the time that i was a permanent associate. He ended up getting a better offer at JCPenny so by the time the end of December came, the new manager called me into his office and told me they wouldn't be keeping me because of my availabilty. I was out of a job and had only three days left on the schedule before i had no more mine coming in."
good,People and customers are great to work with and the environment is happy and a good place to work. Workong with the company is great they really care about their employees and are always making sure that we have safe working environment
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's because management is fair and nice.  I like working with and meeting new people, Kohl's is a good place to work. I enjoyed learning new things."
good,Good job for part time work if going to school or a stay at home parent who wants to get out of the house. I wouldn't want to make it my forever job though.
good,"Worked various shifts and days. Some days more hectic than others."
good,"I did not so much enjoy working at Kohl's because as a brand new employee I was questioned daily about lack of ""Kohl's Charge"" sign ups. I understand that it is part of the job but I had barely known how to work the register and was being hounded about credit card sign ups. Didn't make me happy to go to work, at all."
good,"Over all this was a great work experience for me,being this was my first warehouse job. It was a professional, yet friendly environment. I enjoyed working here."
good,I worked at Kohl's for over a year and always enjoyed coming to work because my co-worker were awesome! The pay isn't great but it really helped me get by while I was attending college.
good,kohls is a very friendly environment. Very customer oriented. Key is to communicate with customers and make them feel welcomed and time will fly by. It is a fun time more than a job feel.
good,"The team is what makes you keep coming back each day. Managers are friendly and approachable but for the most part, have less of an idea of what needs to get done than the supervisors. Hours are inconsistent and the pay is poor."
good,Love working here just not part time im looking for full time work everyday. .I'm a very active and productive love staying busy..
good,The best thing about working here is that you get great discounts and get to work with fun people. The worst thing about this job is the management can be confusing.
good,"I enjoyed working with the infants. Even though this business is no longer open, we worked together everyday to ensure it ran according to guidelines."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work with challenges to learn and grow your opportunities.  The company has courses in developing your skill set that helps with running a store.
good,"good place to work, follows all workplace rules and allows time for appropriate breaks and lunches, store manager is helpful"
good,"Kohl's is a very large corporation, with all kinds of management. Depending on your department, you can have a more laid back manager who checks in regularly but isn't consistently micro managing your work. Or you can have manager who is very on top of projects being worked on in the department. Either way, all of the managers I have ever worked with were very open to questions and friendly."
good,"Every day we get to work with engaged associates and a management team that genuinely cares about their employees. There are multiple opportunities to learn different departments and advance to better paying and more challenging jobs. The work/life balance here is excellent, and family is a top priority for the people at Kohl's."
good,"Fellow associates were very nice and helpful. Overall, a good place to work. Management often stood around watching you work, which was annoying when it got busy. They would stand around talking with each other, doing nothing for 30 minutes. But, when the cahier lines were slow they'd send you to fold clothes or some other task, then the lines would get busy and you'd be called back. Overall, management was OK even with this."
good,"Physical, fast-paced, indoor position that involves continual lifting; lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25-35 lbs; and may weigh up to 70lbs or over."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work to me is getting the job done correctly and efficiently as possible &  enjoying the job.  Working with the co-workers & Manager is a must!   The hardest part of my job was trying to get the ladder down some of  the aisles.  I enjoyed the changing of the beds & putting up new back wall graphics.  Decorating the store with the holiday trim was fun!
good,I love working for Kohl's because I get to interact with people and because of the great discount they give. I learned how to use a register. My coworkers are so friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with tough customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and the flexibility.
good,I really liked to work there good company good staff. we really honer our customers give them very good services and discounts
good,"I was employed at Kohl's for 12 years."
good,this was an temporary seasonal position where I was a cashier ringing purchases for customers great experience. the job was fast paced but enjoyable!!
good,"They are very family friendly and accommodating with family issues, fun place to work, great employee discount, etc. I was a cashier and department organizer. The most annoying part was having to ask people to sign up for the kohls card."
good,"A lot of avoidable problems happen here. The reason is miscommunications between almost all employees. The problem is half speak English and the other half only speak Spanish. This is a problem if a customer needs help, neither the employee or customer can understand each other and other employees aren't trained for that certain department to help out."
good,Fun and energetic. Low Maturity level. Favoritism around every corner. Get Half of what you put in for forwarding in the ladder of the company. Pump a lot of smoke.
good,"Great staff,  great team to work with. Management is supporting and uplifting. I learn that patience is the key to any type of job."
good,I was very young when I worked here I leaned a lot and had so much fun working with this company. Great for a first job.
good,"I learned to be a leader, learned to be a serious multitasker when it was needed. Able to handle being alone during long periods of time and advanced successfully there to the point I decided it was time for me to leave."
good,It was a very fun place to work. very laidback environment and very low traffic. had a lot of regulars come in so you knew most of the customers that came in. hardest part of the job I would say is being there for unloading truck at 5am but the most enjoyable part was that we did it timely and efficiently and with all the coworkers being so productive
good,how to get things done in the most efficient and fastest way possible. Company was great and always engaging with customers.
good,Enjoyable place to work. They worked with my school schedule and my second job schedule. Co-workers always helped one another to get ready for closing.
good,"Work was fast paced as the store was in a high traffic area."
good,"Do not like you a treated like nothing, plus the workload and pay do not match at all. I know thats retail job for you but not what im after"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyed the opportunity. The environment was a great atmosphere to work in which made it easy to come in and handle business.
good,All of my co-workers were very friendly. I learned how to work as a team to get tasks done. I learned how to operate the cash registers and assist customers' needs. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people and watching them leave happy.
good,"didnt learn as much as id hope for the position. However the co workers i had, were really nice and great to be around on a daily basis"
good,Unloading a Truck. Management was always willing to help out with what ever was needed. The co-workers always lifting each other up and motivating. I loved my job it was always busy and I enjoyed talking with the customers and helping them in any way I could.
good,The management was very appreciative if you worked fast and put forth your best effort offering many thanks in the form of awards like Employee of the Month and daily Good Job notes.
good,"I work at the jewelry counter. It is pretty easy work to do. I have learned how to test diamonds, change watch batteries, and take links out of watch bands. Most of the co-workers are friendly. It is a stressful job because of grumpy customers and managers."
good,"unloading eighteen wheelers"
good,"I felt like a valued employe, the managers were nice and easy to talk to. They made sure you got your breaks and were there to help with tasks when needed."
good,"I worked here with No prior experience, and i think it was the best 1st job to have. I worked part time, move to full time, and worked and went to school. It was so hard, but hte people/company was there and understanding. It made the time there bareable. It also made me realize how much i enjoy working"
good,The management does what the corporate head suggests. Employees are forced work in a manner deemed acceptable by corporate
good,Unload into departments. Stacking carts for placing items on sales floor. Work part time two days a week. Good teamwork in getting things done timely matter
good,Coworkers are like family. The store is usually busy on the weekends and holidays. Management is quite flexible with the schedules.
good,Days included loading merchandise or unloading trucks. Stocking shelves or back stocking into storage. Helping customers on the sales floor and running merchandise. Employees were helpful in guiding new workers.
good,They are a great company to work for unfortunately the hours available to non-management makes it hard to make ends meet without a second job.
good,"Would daily wait on customers at point of service areas, would it be in a sales or customer service fashion.  I could overcome my insecurities of sales and customer service, make personal goals and challenges for myself and make them become fact.  Unfortunately, management changes constantly in this business.  Coworkers were friendly and always there to give you a helping hand when needed.  Working late, long hours during the holidays/return season.  The satifaction of helping others, having the highest rate for credit card solicitation in the store."
good,"Every location will be different, but what Kohl's does do is bring diversity and culture to it's stores. They offer a friendly environment for everyone and offer events for it's associates."
good,"provide help for customers when cannot find item. put on hold, answer questions on phone and in person. special order, work as a cashier, unloading and merchandise."
good,"The job really helped me become focused on delivering great experiences to customers and how to effectively communicate. Overall, a fun job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoyed working with the early morning freight team. we worked hard to get the merchandise off the truck in a timely manner.
good,"Both managers and associates are easily approachable, dependable loss and prevention team that insures safety of all employees and customers. the only downside is lack of hours given after holidays, which can cause financial hardship for part time workers."
good,I enjoyed being around my co workers. The customer's were almost always nice. I helped in any way that I could for the customer to find what he/she was looking for.
good,I enjoy seeing different people and its fast paced.  I enjoy working different positions.  The hardest part of the job is the compensation and inconsistency with management
good,"There are some advancement opportunities that pop up occasionally. If you get a good manager or supervisor, they will work with you on projects or just daily activities."
good,"Assisted customers upon returning merchandise, purchasing merchandise, making payments, and opening Kohl's charge accounts."
good,"A typical day at work was determined by your attitude. If you were upset, things were not going to go well with your customers. If you were happy, it would be a good and satisfying day. I learned several things during my work experience here. I learned that some days will be better than others, how to use a cash register, and many ways to solve problems were some of the several things. Management was great. They were very understanding. If you had a problem, they would fix it. My co-workers were great too. Some of them just had a lower work ethnic than most. The hardest part of the job was the learning process. After I learned everything it got much easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was how easy it was to make friends with my co-workers."
good,"Greeting customers and assisting them with finding desired product(s) or applicable substitutions. Explaining the benefits and advantages of our store credit card as well as our rewards program. Management is adamant about an open-door policy when it comes to employee questions, comments, or concerns. The work place feels more like a second home with the openness and willingness to help among coworkers and management. I've learned so much about myself and the potential that is within me by being able to move positions and gain hands on experience in every area of the store."
good,"did all parts of job, scheduling food cost inventory control loved helping with fundraising working with people teaching and learning from them"
good,"Although, you're working for a large company in a big department store, you still felt as though you were part of a family. Sales pressure could be high for soliciting the credit card but they would also offer bonuses for signing customers up."
good,This was a very nice store. it was properly staffed and pay was in line with similar businesses. work life balance was good.
good,"Working for Kohl's truly expanded my customer service skills as well as problem solving attitude,however the pay was low and the scheduling was constantly inaccurate."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping out customers, ringing them up and getting them out in a timely manner, and making sure the cash drawer has the correct amount in it at all times."
good,The communication barrier needs a lot of work. The managers wouldn't communicate between each other when left the employees without the correct instructions. The training system also needs lots of work.
good,"I enjoy the job honestly. I was hired as an Equipment Operator. Hours are long, but it’s do-able. The break room is awesome, there are 2 breaks a shift, and the occasionally give out free food."
good,"I have been here a long time. Good benefits.  Good environment. Gain good experience with different skill sets. Good people,"
good,LOOOOOOVE WORKING HERE. Never got bored thanks to the holidays there was always something to do. The team was super nice and understanding if for some reason you couldn't make it to work. meet new people and learn new skills for customer service.
good,I learned a lot about human resources and the hiring process during my time with Kohl's. This opportunity provided me with knowledge in a field that I had not had experience in previously. I worked with a lot of great people and enjoyed coming to work each day. This was a temporary job as it was a new department that the company was trying out to see if it was beneficial to continue on with in the future.
good,My co-workers were exciting and easy to work with.  The job was always fast paced and required good interpersonal skills.
good,"daily hiring, lots of payroll support, very good teamwork. We do a lot of seasonal hiring when the volume is high in the warehouse."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Re-stocking the floor with merchandise was one of my main tasks and working with my other fellow associates made the process much more enjoyable.
good,"Overall Kohl's is a good store to work at. However, a lack of benefits for part-time employees and sometimes poor personnel management need to be addressed immediately!"
good,"Reconcile daily lockbox payments, maintain daily balancing spreadsheets, fill out daily deposit slips for home office checks received, back off NSF's, enter refunds, verify and print out late notices and handle month end close."
good,"I liked my job and the hours there, management was okay, i liked being a cashier and interacting with people, i like checking customers out"
good,Its is a good place to work the demands and quotas are achievable but you are limited by the policy in place. You work 2nd shift most days and the amount of responsibility your given is not even close for how your compensated.
good,"Management was excellent to work for, very understanding and would do their best to work with employees.  Listened to employee input on daily operations and commended employees on their work.  Very pleasant people to work for."
good,"Friendly environment, flexible schedule, make employees comfortable and feel welcomed. I assist customers with making payments or scheduling payments."
good,absolutely loved working there but i have too many certifications to continue to work at a warehouse but if you are going to work at a warehouse this is the one to work at
good,"I enjoyed working for kohls I worked there for 7 years and I learned everything from how to run a cash register to knowing and getting familiar with all the departments they had there. I learned customer service returns and price asjustments and also working in jewelry and knowing how to count the diamonds and sizing customers watches. I knew everything about kohls and I liked working there I was promoted after 6 years as a supervisor for registers. I would handle customer issues and help get them resolved and also I would put away any freight we had and clean up after people on a daily basis, I wish I had the chance to move forward there as a store manager how ever I would work some very late hours and I had a child to take care of and also the pay was not great and I know kohls has the money to pay their employees more then average wage that is out there. I made 11.25 after being there for 7 years"
good,Overnights are totally different than day shift. We worked in a small group and re-stocked the shelves. The group that I was with were friendly and welcoming.
good,this job wasa  seasonal job and I did tis during the holiday season/ I learned to multitask and demonstrate great customer service skills. I worked with a few others in one department.
good,Fast paced and fun. Very friendly co-workers and management. But sometimes not clear enough instructions regarding certain tasks.
good,"Although seasonal, management was understanding and helpful. Customers were generally pleasant. There never seemed to be enough employees available to assist the customers."
good,"My job requires me to be responsible for the success and safety of the store and it's employees. I am in charge of handling customer issues as well and employee issues. I hold keys to the store, so I am responsible for opening and closing the store. I am also in charge of the soft-lines departments and the supervisors that work within those areas. I started with Kohl's as a part-time employee and have worked my way up to management. The hardest part of my job in ensuring that all customers get great customer service from all employees. The easiest part of my job is helping customers get the service they deserve."
good,I enjoyed customer service and restocking.  Building displays for the new sale.  The other employees  were nice and management was fair.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Requires fast and accurate picking and packing of products. Enjoyed the fast paced work during my time there.
good,I started working there almost right after high school and stayed there for a few years got some good customer service experience and dealing with the public as well. prepared me for other positions i took later on in my job career.
good,"worked 2nd ship, team work, managers are cool, keeping fast pace in certain time frame, good work style with coworkers maintaining a high percent for the company"
good,"Kohls is a good place to work, everyone there was really helpful including the customers and co workers . fun place to work"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was very happy working at Kohls Department store. It was run well and they gave proper training and made it an enjoyable place to work. As much as retail is a pain, they made it not as bad."
good,i enjoyed working there the only down fall was the short hours with low pay. and only worked 3 days a week since i was on the truck team.
good,Managed by various supervisors. There is opportunity to work and several departments and there is always a push to learn more about the company if you're willing.
good,I had a great experience working with a great team with a yes we can attitude. Great management always helping me lean more and go above and beyond my assigned tasks.
good,normally you spend the shift restocking or taking down shelves. a day went by very slow most of the co workers were very easygoing
good,"Great people to work with. Okay pay for someone looking for a side job for extra cash. Not a job you would want to work full time. they pay is not enough and they barely keep up with the 90 day review, so you may not get a raise."
good,i have been at kohl's department store for 3 years now. i have worked there for most of my college life. at my particular store the management was not what it should be and not understanding. for my co-workers i loved meeting many of them. some of us go out for drinks if we get out early enough.
good,My typical day there was good. I learned how to work as a team and to finish my work on time. Manage ment was fair and equal to everyone. My co-workers there was a good team to work with and was always willing to help out.The hardest part of the job is when we was short of workers and everyone gets moved around to unfamiliar work areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting productivity at the end of the work shift.
good,"Kohl's keeps you busy and entertained all day with a variety of tasks, customer questions and daily store management."
good,"Kohl's was a great establishment to work at and my team members were very easy going. I moved around to different departments throughout the store which gave me the opportunity to meet all of the workers. While I enjoyed working there I did not like the fact that I did not receive the hours I requested, resulting in around 8 hours a week. Another thing I loved was that you get paid every week!"

good,Very fast-paced work environment. Had to learn on much the job on the fly but management did help when I asked questions.
good,Some management is not well trained.  I do not believe that people are held responsible for their jobs. Too many favorites.  so much delegation that certain people seem to be doing nothing.

good,It can be stressful sometimes but after that you have the employees. they're really nice and you get a home like environment.
good,Wonderful opportunity to build satisfactory relationships and culture the attitude with others. Hardest part of the job was to engage in a steady schedule.

good,"My experience at Kohl's was different compared to my experience at Nike.  Kohl's was my first job coming out of high school.  I was responsible for unloading the truck along with 18 other employees in the morning before the store opened.  Once the truck was unloaded, we went out to the sales floor to stock the shelves up for customers to purchase.  I learned the different types of management strategy's in comparison to Nike and Kohl's."

Even on a bad day, it is the people i work with that bring me back up to top performance."
good,"Everyone did their part, and the majority were really laid back and all around good company while working. Didn't run into any problems while working."

Over all the work assignments and my co-workers were pleasant.  Had no problem with management.  They were all helpful and always pitched in to help run the store.  Never would have left if I could have been put on as full time.  I enjoyed receiving the employee's discount."

good,"A typical day was; clocking in, grabbing a head set, and starting at either Point of Sales or the Misses section. Then I would clean out dressing rooms and help customers find everything that they needed. Move to another section usually Juniors and start maintenance. Maintenance is folding all the clothes on the folded tables and making sure everything is hung nicely and in the correct spot."
good,"There are easier jobs out there but without any qualifications or special skills this is a good first job or ""get you by type"" of employer."
good,Usually during the day we assisted customers by phone as well as face to face interaction.  Learned to go above and beyond what was required of me.  I enjoyed assisting customers in finding the best items for their needs.
good,"While working at Kohl's, I experienced a very unorganized supervision. Since I was a temporary/seasonal worker, there was no training involved so I was lost when it came to how to work cash registers at first. Co-workers were very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was the fact that they scattered me from place to place with no help, but the most enjoyable part was the fact that I enjoyed having interaction with the customers."
good,Great company to work for.  On the job training and a fun environment to work in.  Must be willing to work on your own and as a team member to accomplish daily tasks.  Customer service is a must in this job and Kohls emphasizes the importance of great customer service to all its employees.

At Kohls you have to be able to work with others because you work with so many people on a day to day basis. Different people, different personalities.

good,It was a self starting job at first. when you go in you should have a good idea of what you are supposed to be doing. The co workers are very helpful and friendly. The top management and one other manager were very hard working. The team i worked most closely with was the best part of my job.

good,i like working here because it allowed me the chance to meet people while working. i also enjoyed the friendly atmosphere from customers to co workers
good,"Best part of the job was easily getting to work with Loss Prevention in apprehending and questioning shoplifters.

good,Working here has taught me a tremendous amount of knowledge about customer service and how it feels like to work at a fast pace.
good,"You learn how to time manage everything you do, multi-task and keep an open mind."
good,While I worked at Kohl's the most rewarding part of my job was working with the other associates in team based projects. This was my first job and it definitely was a very fast paced working environment; handling multiple tasks at once. A typical day would include cleaning fitting rooms and putting away merchandise. While taking phone calls and backing up at registers.
good,Great for people who are not looking for long hours and only a few days a week. It is hard to advance since they don't have full time except for supervisors and managers.

good,Great place to work with some great coworkers and company provides good benefits.  Customer Service is the most important focus for the company.
good,"I loved working at Kohls. It was fun to work with the inventory, although cleaning dressing rooms wasn't always the most fun. I just am not a sales person and we were constantly pressured to open new charge card accounts with the permission of customers."
good,I was responsible to making sure the tags were on all merchandise.  Verified price and sales prices on merchandise.  Asked each customer if they would like to open a Charge account with Kohl's.

good,the most enjiyable place to work.A good company to work with.
good,Kohls is a great company to work for and a typical day was on the phone making outbound call and what I learned was empathy.Their were a great team of manager always willing to help the same with co-workers.The hardest part of the job was sometimes collecting and the most enjoyable was helping the customer.
good,"Working for Kohl's has both ups and downs. One thing I always take with me that I learned at Kohl's is always work smarter not harder, meaning to be productive and get the job done without making extra work for yourself. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the various different customers you come into contact with everyday, simply because some can be very rude and mean. The easiest way to get through each day is your team having a good team definitely helped the work day progress and put you at ease."
good,"show up to work and check in with a supervisor"
good,"A lot of companies don't trust you to make certain calls on whether to honor coupons for customers or whether a sign said the wrong price we could adjust it so that the customer would leave happy, but kohl's does and I appreciate that. I felt very valued by my coworkers while I worked there."
good,"Aside from the fact that you don't get many hours and you get little pay, You learn a lot if you are open to learning, I have learned how to  unload the truck, merchandise (stocking shelves) inventory counting, customer service, price checks, Point of Sale, price changes, making a schedule for a crew  of up to 100 people covering multiple different areas of the store. I have worked with People Soft, helped in hiring and orientations, "
good,"My day at Kohl's is alwyas great. I learned so far how customers get their online orders sent out and I also play a big role in that. The managment is great as well, I liked all the mangers and my co-workers also. The harest part of the job was learning the task and how to do it, but I got it together and now i enjoy it. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting to learn soemthing new."
good,Over all I'm satisfied with the work but not enough work to pay bills.
good,i learned how to run a register. some of my coworkers didnt want to help out as much as i would have liked them to and some were just plain out snotty to me. but other than that i liked my bosses and liked working there. it was alot of fun for the time i was there. it was fun when everything started getting busy
good,I work a part flex schedule n not garmented hours hard to get hours.
good,"I was only a family and friends associate for a short time, but I think that it was a great experience to get to work there. I bagged items for costumers, got them help when they needed it, folded clothes, and put items back where they belonged across the store. The hardest part of the job was finding where things went in the men's section; however, i found it really easy to find and put what i needed to back in the women's and junior's sections. Working in the women's and junior's was my favorite part, because i had dealt with it the most and i was comfortable with it."
good,"A typical workday at Kohl's was very busy and I usually worked the cashier and greeted customers and made sure they had a pleasant check out experience. I would work the floor and make sure the customers found everything they needed and I also cleaned out the fitting rooms. I was trained in many areas such as the cashier, floor work, Truck (dock and unloading), inventory and over night shifts. Over night shifts include scanning products for clearance. There was many managers that any employee could count on. I believe the hardest part of this job was my feet hurting and the most enjoyably part of the job was getting to see customers happy while leaving the store."
good,"Supervised both the Indoor and Outdoor maintenance crews. Worked with Loss Prevention team. Dusted around building, pulled trash, cleaned bathrooms, vacuumed carpets, swept and maintained all tile floors."

good,It is a fast paced work environment. Managers are easy to talk with and are willing to help m
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is helping the customers"
good,I worked customer service for a month before having to leave for personal reasons. We were responsible for making sure every customer left satisfied with their experience. We did returns and exchanges. In customer service we were responsible for doing Kohl's credit card payments. I unfortunately didn't get to see much of my co-workers except for the few that worked customer service with me but they were great. the hardest part of the job was not to allow an aggressive customer get to you too much.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Yes We Can ! I hold up three different positions at Kohls but can pretty much work every department. I have done Jewerly, Misses, Kids, Customer Serivce, P.O.S, P.O.S Specialist, and finally Cash office. Management sometimes do not communite with empolyees and or each other about certain issues, which would be the hardest part of my job. But overall, I would have to say Kohls is a great place to work."
good,"A typical day of work would be an everyday retail. Able to manage and organize thousands of clothes per shift and managing customers with excellent customer service skills. I get along with all co-workers and managers. In my perspective, there were no problems with the job and being able to manage and organize was the most enjoyable part of the job."

The most enjoyable part of the job is being rewarded for the hard work the workers put in, especially during the busiest times of the year."

good,Kohl's has fine tuned my ability to multitask and achieve goals while supervising a team of employees and ensuring that they too achieve their workday expectations.
good,A fun and exciting place to work. I would love to have my job back here but it's like you have to know someone to even get in like most jobs these days.
good,"Enjoyed working there, good working with the rest of staff, enjoyed the rewards"
good,I loved working as a Freight Associate 1 but too many politics involved. My fellow associates were friendly. I learned to keep my  thoughts to myself even if favoring was happening. Sometimes crazy when unloading couple trucks in one shift but I love hard work.

My managers/supervisors knew they could depend on me making sure that the customers were satisfied or helping out the cashiers when they needed me!

good,"I work as Point of Sales at Kohls, basically cashier. Its a very fun job because of my co-workers who are very fun to be around, supportive, and encouraging. The only down parts are soliciting credit and hours. If you aren't good at talking people into signing up for a credit card, you won't work many hours. You may even end up working on the floor."
good,"A typical day at Khol's? There is no such thing! Every day is different.  You can be swamped hour and have nothing the next. I didn't really learn anything working here it's your average retail environment. Everyone that works there is great, for the most part, there is always that one. The hardest part of the job was meeting the credit card goals, either everyone has it or nobody wants it. The job overall was enjoyable! If the starting pay was more I would certainly still be there. The hours are there however for money to be made!"

good,"I interact with all different types of people in this fun based work environment. I open the cash registers in the am, and balance the books of previous day sales. "
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in, going to the floor, contacting the current Manager On Duty and asking what needs to be done.  You very rarely have nothing to do.  When it comes to the store, there is a good chance it's a mess when you go in.  I've learned that I like working with a lot of people but I've had some leadership qualities come out to that I can't really use.  I was very fast to learn their computer and technology they use to assist their daily efforts.  Hardest part of the job is covering the entire floor when someone decides to call in multiple times a week.  I work with a lot of great people"
good,I have worked at Kohl's for the past several months. My main duties include providing customer service and product knowledge about cosmetics.

The ""Yes, you can"" policy makes for an enjoyable customer service environment."

good,A typical day for me at work was always productive and I always had something to do to keep me busy during the time I was on the floor assisting customers and cleaning up after the customers. I always had a smile on my face when I greeted the customers as they entered the store. There was never a job to hard for me to do. My co-workers were always helpful and supportive. Management was always worried about their employees and I didn't learn much because I've done this type of job before. The most enjoyable part of the job was eating lunch and going on break.

I did a lot at new store and was excited to work there. Most rewarding part was helping costumers and meeting their needs. Worst part was our managers they weren't always happy to help us, no organization, no proper training, lots of favoritism and no structure. With in first year already had new store manager and assistant managers and our turn over rate high. I love retail and wanted to find a company to grow with and was stable. Sadly this just wasn't that company. I'm the type that's fast learner and always looking to move up not afraid to work or speak my mind and I feel that bothered some and they pushed me out by cutting back hours so I'd quite."

Customers always came first whether it was helping them find merchandise or making sure they had a great shopping experience with us. We did our best to make sure they got the best deal on their purchase and were very satisfied before leaving. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers, it made working there more enjoyable. I also looked up to a few of the managers as they were all about helping us to provide great customer service and make sure we excelled each day. One of the managers I was not very fond of because she was very rude and was always late to open the doors for those that had to open in the morning. I enjoyed worked in the jewelry department and at the customer service counter. I am all about making sure customers are satisfied with their visit and that they are taken care.

Instead it felt like I was there to talk to customers about their day and life."
good,Cares about their associates and are very flexible with them. A typical day is very steady. Co-workers have diverse personalities and enjoyable to be around.
good,"Good, safe work environment. Fun, friendly. Helpful to customers."
good,"I really enjoyed working a Kohl's. The environment was nice, my supervisors were very professional and easy to get along with. Only thing i didn't like was that the position I had was seasonal. Wouldn't mind working there again."
good,Not enough hours given to employees. Its a good part-time job but it's not enough to make a living out of unless you are an upper manager.
good,I enjoyed working there and meeting new people and learning new things. I dealt with customers a lot which was always nice except when you get cranky ones or ones who are rude to you. best part was talking to get to know some of the customers better
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"From the one week that I worked there, the staff was very nice. All the Sales Associates were trained to put the customer first. A typical day of work included placing items back on their shelves/racks, helping customers find what they needed, and bagging their items for them."
good,"When I first started for the company in December 2010, I noticed the core values and morals the company shrived for were very much a part of the actual day to day store routines. I hired on as a part-time seasonal employee and very quickly went from seasonal to full-time, and advancing to full-time department manager. Loved the hours, the job, my coworkers and the customers. I would normally work the close shift most of the week and open on truck days. Enjoyed merchandising and set up displays of new product. After breaking down the trucks, the store would be opening and through the day I would clean the dressing rooms, sales floor and displays, while also helping guests find the product they were looking for and assisting in their shopping experience. After closing, the department gets straightened and all the go back taken care of and then all associates do a floor sweep to make sure the store is ready for business the next day."
good,"it's okay i really only had it for 3 months so i really couldnt say much but i love the discouts you get as an employee,i love the discouts period...its great"
good,"Working at kohls really kept me busy. I worked in the Jewelry area I was in charged of counting the jewlery and putting it away at closing time. I have had great customer service experience, cashier experience and using my people skills. Our store was a high volume store so it was continuosly busy. I had to quit due to my school schedule and finishing up my last year in college."
good,"Go in and unbox the delivered items for that day, put them on racks to go to the sales floor. Then if I had time I would take those items to the sales floor."
good,"Prioritizing phone calls, multi-tasking, conducting reviews on the cameras, and conducting safety audits are all part of my day."
good,"Provided good customer service by greeting each customer, fostering a friendly atmosphere, having proper knowledge of the merchandise and offering assistance to customers. Performed merchandise recovery by returning merchandise to their proper place. Maintain the sales floor by keeping it neat."
good,"Job of freight associate is interesting, fun and never boring. You keep busy from the time you arrive until the time you leave which helps the time to go by quickly. You unload trucks, sort items by department, replenish the merchandise, perform price changes, back stock and assist customers when needed. Great team effort to get everything done in 8 hours. Great team of co-workers."
good,"At Kohl's it is fast paced, fun, and overall a good place to work. On a daily basis, I empty fitting rooms multiple times in a shift, assist customers with anything they may need, as well as clean and replenish my department. The management here is wonderful; they are all very willing to help you and answer and questions you have."
good,Excellent Customer service. Great work environment with friendly upbeat atmosphere. Awesome hard working associates.
good,I unloaded trucks and stocked the floor and helped customers at the sametime. Co workers were awesome. The hardest part of the day was cleaning up the loading dock.
good,This company is a great company to gain the cutsomer service experience that you need in order to land employment at other companies. The skills and technidques that you learn on the business side are those that can not be matched anywhere. The people that I have worked with are amazing and supportive of anything that I have ever pursued and made every effort to succeed in any given environment.
good,"If people are your passion, this is the job for you! This is a job that is mostly social in nature with some clothes folding in between."
good,It was a good job for a teenager. If you are looking for a job while in school this would be a great pick
good,"Always enjoyed going to work and the people I worked with. They were all very helpful whenever I had questions about anything along with management as well. Very fun, safe enviornment and work place and would definitely work there again. If I could have recieved more hours I would have definitely stayed."

good,I enjoyed working for kohls but the amount that we are being paid they expected too much
good,The most enjoyable part of my job here at kohls was the customers and being able to help them find things they needed.
good,"A typical day at work would include cleaning the fitting rooms after customers have tried on clothing, helping customers with questions concerning merchandise, operating cash registers, customer service, problem solving, among other things. I have learned how to help people and how to explain difficult concepts concerning customer service (ie. returns, refunds, etc). Management is typical, 3 tiered at the top and tapering off towards the bottom. Management quite often was not together on project assignments, thus creating confusion among the employees. My co-workers were great, I made a lot of really good friends during my time there. The hardest part of the job was knowing that customers were allowed to come into the store and have no regard for us as employees. The most enjoyable part of the job, to be quite honest, was closing time. We were able to get so much work done towards the end of the shift, and we were able to have fun while we were working."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a very fun experience for me. I learned a new trade while being able to enjoy myself, never having a dull moment. A typical work day for me included coming in to work and heading straight to the back room in which the floor would already be set up to start unpacking the boxes. Boxes would be slid down the assembly line and my tasks included unpacking the box and placing the items in the appropriate sections. My next task would be to take the items that had been unpacked and sorted and go out onto the main floor and place these items where they belonged. The hardest part of this job was probably just simply ripping the boxes open by hand."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical work day at the Kohl's distribution center consists of working with Kohl's associates and vendors to ensure proper auditing on the receiving dock.
good,"My typical day at work was to organize and clean the sales floor and fitting rooms, while accomodating to customer's needs. I learned how to multi-task and be more detail oriented when working at a fast, but efficient pace. Management was always on top of all duties of sales associates and constantly checking on us to make sure things were going smoothly. My co-workers were friendly and worked very well as a team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers who didn't want to follow store policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find exactly what they want and even giving them ideas on what to do. Helping the customer enjoy their shopping experience was very satisfying."
good,"Lots of fun, energetic and friendlyco-workers. Every day tasks included wroking as part of a team to meet common goals such as soliciting credit, assiting customers and maintaining an excellent experience for customers."
good,"I assisted in the operation of a $25 million dollar sales revenue store by effectively leading associates to meet the needs and wants of consumers. I managed approximately 115 associates and oversaw all hiring, training, and payroll activities. The most enjoyable part of my job was hiring and training new associates to ensure that they understood the company position of meeting consumer needs each and every time."

good,I love a good pair of shoes! Helping people find what they are looking for is very rewarding!
good,Great people love the work environment and my managers were nice kind respectful wish i could work there again.
good,"On a typical day every employee tries provide a memorable experience for all customers. First we greet with a simple ""Hi,"" and ask if they need any help or assistance. Base on the answer, we follow thru with other steps of continuing our great productive activities. We keep the store a clean and fresh, simply from picking up the little trash on the ground, to restocking inventory, to assorting inventories on the floor to keep everything looking fresh."
good,"A 12 hour day of packing order after order,always something to do."
good,"Unloaded trucks every morning, separated items and replenished merchandise onto the sales floor. Worked floor displays and assisted customers when needed. I learned a bit about freight management and how the back room of a department store operates. management was involved and helpful. I enjoyed all my co-workers, they made the day fun. The hardest part of the job was the early morning hours and the most enjoyable part was being around people."
good,"throw boxes from the truck onto rollers and slide them down until full. If the roller gets full help workers unload boxes, until line clears up.Go back to throwing boxes onto the roller, If not throwing cut open boxes and place items in appropriate location. Pull plastic off clothing place folded items on carts and hanging on Z-bars. Place home store, shoes, accessories, seasonal, and toys on u-boats or flat beds. the most enjoyable part of my job is that i had cool and efficient co-workers"
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers in anyway needed, assisting other associates, cashiering, upkeep of departments and the fitting rooms. I've learned many skills while working retail mostly great customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you can't always keep on top of everything because of the business Kohl's gets so you can't let it get to you when you can't complete all of your work. The most enjoyable part is being able to assist people and making them happy."
good,"Work is very easy and the environment is easy to work in. Management is always helpful with tight schedules, and co-workers are always happy. The hardest part of the job is the low hours that you are scheduled, however with many part-time workers with full-time jobs elsewhere, it is easy to pick up additional hours unwanted by co-workers."
good,overall this was not a bad experience would defiently use again
good,enjoy everyday of work. like the people i worked with and the bosses are very nice and easy to get along with.
good,A typical day at Kohl's is very high paced. There is always a lot to be done and not enough time or help to do it. I have learned that you need to ask for help and that you can only get done what you can do. There is never enough time in a day to keep up the high customer traffic. The hardest part is figuring out what is the highest priority to get done because you won't be able to get it all done in a day. The most enjoyable is seeing all the new merchandise that comes in and displaying it for people to buy.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,"This is a good workplace, they treat their employees good and with respect."
good,Customer service was a very good fit for me. The job was fast paced and the ablility to handle more than one task at a time was useful. It was difficult at times during the holiday season when the store was very busy but it was still an enjoyable place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working there, especially with my co-workers. It was always busy and fast paced, which I enjoyed. I learned different ways to deal with all kinds of situations."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work. Many of today's retail trends are started here. Kohl's offers top pay for salaried execs and the benefits are top notch. I've learned much from this company, my managers, as well as my co-workers. At Kohls' your Customer Service skills definitely get tested daily. So you learn to always offer service with a smile. We do whatever it takes to make our customers happy! I've worked at 2 stores during my tenure with kohl's. The hardest thing I have had to endure is the constant turn over of Store Managers. It was not as bad in my first store as it is in my current one. But overall I have enjoyed my time at both locations!"
good,Working there PT for nearly 7 years and now only get 4 hours or more per week. It's just not cutting it.
good,"A typical day was checking customers out helping the apply for store credit card, organizing shelves and helping put out new clothes. All of my co workers were very friendly and most of the management team."
good,"very busy work days made the time fly by, wonderful co-workers!"

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I like kohls. It is a fun place to work. Not a good fit for someone who doesnt want to work hard
good,"A typical work day consisted of coming in to a shift meeting, and then getting to work on the trouble orders. I was responsible for putting orders for replenishment of a location and clearing dated orders in a timely fashion. I also was a floor trainer, so if we had new staff I would take time to train them on how to take care of trouble carts and fill those order."
good,"Typical day at work for an LPO consists of checking the inventory of all high ticket merchandise, looking for possible spots for people to either conceal items or hide tags, create awareness on important issues from both corporate roll outs and store specific issues, make external theft apprehensions, check on all money shortages as well as assist in any investigation into any dishonest associate activity."
good,I learned that to work at Kohls you have to be a person with an assertive attitude and push people. The management wasn't too bad but they really didn't care about your needs. There were some though that really did care. The co-workers were great. A person could always find someone to get along with. I would say the hardest part of the job was pushing people to get a Kohls card. The most enjoyable part was working with people and helping them find what they need and also seeing the smile when you helped them by going above and beyond.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customer, organizing sales floor, and other tasks in the back stock room. From this position I have learned how to interact with people of many backgrounds. My managers are very dedicated workers who are very kind and friendly. They always understand if there are unforeseen problems and are willing to help whenever possible. This most difficult and most enjoyable part of this job is dealing with the customers."
good,"* Reponsible for my area, stocking, replemishing, setting ads & assiting customers."
good,It was a fun place to work in the begining. Just like all retail there was always more workers than hours available to make a living.
good,Kohl's is a place where you enjoy working with your co-worker and value your customers.
good,Enjoyed working in shoe department.
good,"A typical day at work: When Supervisors has a morning shift and oversee half the store while assisting the front registers & customer service., (Due to shortage of hours). What I've learn is to multi-task. As far as management I've learn to respect them and work as a team. My co-workers are a great team to work with. The hardest part of the job is making sure the associate knows and under stand Customers is first priority. ""Yes We Can""!. The most enjoyable part of the job is making your daily plan of sale."
good,Greet and assist customers. When working the public you have to smile and have a good attitude at all times. Management had good communication most of the times. The atmosphere was great. And the co-workers were also.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's for me usually involved arriving very early in the morning to unload the trucks and then merchandise their contents. Other days when we did not have a truck, I would usually help the visual supervisor with her daily tasks and help change out all the graphics within the store."
good,· Customer service on the sales floor and at cash register
good,I worked hard. Usually the floor was understaffed. My co-workers usally were very easy to get along with although there where not that many new comers that stayed on.
good,"There is nothing to tell. I did my job, enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"working at Kohl's was fun to me because of all the people i got to work with. Everyone was really nice and everyone knew how to get the job done. I enjoyed working with a lot of different people. I learned a lot about using a cash register and taking payments and so on. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with difficult customers and not losing your temper, because some customers could be really mean and nasty. The most enjoyable was when you seen the satisfaction on your customers faces as they left. I believe you need to treat everyone with respect and in doing so they will definitely be more likely to return to the store then they would had you not."
good,"I worked at Kohl's for 5 years during college. The management was very understanding and flexible working around my class schedule. We had six managers in my store, and communication was a major problem. The hardest part of the job was making sure the departments stayed clean on busy weekends , and the most enjoyable was the friendships formed with my co-workers."
good,"I work within the jewelry bay so I constantly have contact with the same people which I enjoy, it allows me to gain trust within my co-workers and get to know them on a personal level too. I learned how important organization and communication is within a career. The management is great, very understanding and will do almost anything to meet your needs and make your schedule work for you. I enjoy handling customers and their concerns and it being different every time."
good,Freshly opened store with many of work in order to be opened.. new store to the west cost. not very busy most of the time.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work was often slow. What I've learned from working there is that you have to go for what you want in life. My management was awesome, we enjoyed working with each other. My co-worker was great, we laughed and joked around but still got our jobs done at the end of the day. Hardest part of my job was seeing strange activity going on since most days were slow besides the weekends. Most enjoyable part of it was meeting a lot of cool people."
good,"I set sale signs, do beginning and ending paperwork, do an ad audit,"
good,"Loved all the people that I was able to meet. Just wish that more hours were offered and there was a days only schedule. It was not a great place for a single mother. Other than not having nights and weekends off, and more than 10 hours a week it was a really great place to work."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is I get to see different clothes and styles because I love clothes and love shopping. As an employee, I get discounts."
good,Kohl's was a fun place to work! It taught me alot about the retail industry and helped me come out of my shell with talking to people. My co-workers were great! The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with everything when we had a big sale going on but it was still fun working with people.
good,Good job long hours are expected. A company that brings out the best in you.
good,"Great place to work until corsicana call site closed. Other than that really enjoyed the enviroment from associates, the company itself and what the company offered for me."
good,"Kohls is a nice place to work, and my co-workers are fun people."
good,Kohls is a very competitive and customer oriented store. I have learned many departments. My favorite department to work for is the mens department. Most people work as a team.
good,"I worked for Kohl's as a high school and even a little while as a college student. They never once messed up on my pay, nor did they ever inconvenience me with random schedules. If I asked off for school related reasons, they would understand. A good place for a student to work."
good,"Train new employees, supervise employee, assign employees to specific duties"
good,A nice place to work but not a lot of room for advancement and the pay is not that well and your hours are constintly getting cut if we dont make sales or credit goals.
good,Good schedules hours and straight forward goals. Co workers were pleasant.
good,"typical day in shipping is quite simple loading 6-8 trailer with boxes, in receiving is unloading 1-3 trailers depending on merchandise, scanning, labeling and auditing. Loss prevention is about security for the people, merchandise and property. Using the CCTV's, walking around the building, keeping a kean eye out for safety. People are great including Supervisor & Managers."
good,"typical night would be unloading trailer, processing merchandise, replenish floor and backstock. management was great and very helpful in all parts of the job."
good,"If you don't mind constantly refolding and rehanging clothes, then it's a good job to have. Other than that, it is a nice working environment. You get an employee discount and work in an air conditioned store. :)"
good,"Working the registers, assisting customers, stocking the store, and organizing merchandise were my daily duties. I learned a lot about customer service and the best way to make customers pleased with their shopping experience. The managers were very pleasant and helpful. The co-workers were nice, organized and also helpful. The only hard part of this job was working on black friday. Everything else about this job was very enjoyable."
good,This store is very organized. Nice place to work. It was fun.
good,"Assist with customer needs an requests when needed, provide cashiering services, Stocking shelves,price merchandise and maintain fitting rooms.Our management was ran pretty well. Co-workers worked as a team to make sure the store maintence was kept up and things ran smoothly to keep out customers happy. Most enjoyable part of this job was learned how to work your way around in different departments so you never had a chance to get bored with just working in one area all the time."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"There is really no typical day. In retail is it changing daily and can be anything from sets to trucks to upset customers that you have to help with daily. I have learned that I am very good at adapting to changing situations and that if you have a great management team, that works together, you can have great results."
good,"In a typical day I would work on the registers either at check out or at the customer service desk. I would check people out or help them with returns, exchanges or finding products at another location. I learned a great deal about customer service as well as how to be a leader to new associstes. The management was great and willing to work with my class schedules as well as my internshio schedule. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers and some of the name calling they did at times. The most enjoyable part was knowing people were leaving happy wth the purchases made and happy with the customer relations within the store."

good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's Department Store. It started as seasonal work into a part time job for 5 years. I enjoyed the customers and working with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays- standing for 10 hours. The discount was great and made it fun to shop for Christmas. Kohls was a great place to work for me.
good,Fun part time job where you make long term friends from co-workers. Very flexible work schedule minus holiday time off.
good,"i was a seasonal employee so it was very busy all the time, everyone was great to work with and for"
good,"A typical day included anything from drowning in a pool of clothing in a dressing room to checking out customers for hours on end. The team they have put together is fantastic and easy to work with, even on the most high stress days."
good,i enjoy working at my kohls because the whole team is awesome. We are like a big family.
good,Working at Kohl's requires a lot of patience like any other retail job. The management and company try to take care of you. You will be kept busy and going above and beyond is the only way to stand out.
good,"Great supervisors, fun co workers, the most exciting job I've had thus far"
good,Your experience totally is based on management and how much of a people person you are. It is hard to get advancement because of requirements for hours. But overall I enjoy it and preferred my Florida store to the one I have transferred to.
good,All my coworkers were friendly and worked hard. The managers were cool too. Everyone seemed to do their job and were really helpful with the customers.
good,"Good place to work. Friendly people and good working environment. Good benefits, good hours, on site wellness center, gives back to the community and little flexibility"
good,"Kohl's is amazing for a firs job. Flexible work hours allows students to be able to work around your school schedule. The opportunity to move up in the company is so inviting and easily attainable. Every manager and executive associate is more than happy to help you grow and develop. They are happy to help you move up in the company. They challenge you, teach you, and help you be a better customer service sales person."
good,Starts out as a great workplace. Tales of succeeding and moving up. Then you discover the cliques and managers favorites. At least at my location. Doesn’t take long for personal morale to drop.
good,"The workplace is very friendly, from associates to managers to most of the customers. Particularly clean place, can get very disorganized during the seasonal times, so the workload is insane for the few workers"
good,"I felt that the staff both regular and seasonal were all friendly and helpful.  Also, a lot of the customers are regular customers who were friendly as well."
good,"A typical day working at Kohls was fun. I would come in a bit before my shift started and check the dressing room because i worked on the floor. After a few minutes I would clock in and get my day started. I learned that retail is really casual and flexible. The management was fine. When it got busy, It was never overwhelming. The hardest part about woking there was being scheduled to work really late on holidays. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. They always made a horrible workday go a lot better."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This is a great part-time job. You get to interact with the public and work in a friendly, fast-paced environment. I love my employee discount as well!"
good,Kohl’s had a nice environment and nice coworkers. The seasonal position was enjoyable and I am thankful for the opportunity. It was a good first retail job.
good,Great job! Enjoyed the staff and customers. New experience working in the Jewelry Department. Very face pace and exciting. Just to far to drive with the prices of gas these days.
good,Depending on the location everyone was always friendly and easy to get along with. If you had the support of a store manager who was highly thought of then you were gravy on the promotion track.
good,"The job wasn't bad at all,it was busy sometimes but always enough staff. The only bad thing at my location was the management staff. They caused many people to leave."
good,"Kohl’s has a great diversity of people. Everyone is welcoming and there’s always so much to learn! Management was great, hours and pay were fair. Personally the job was too slow for me, not very exciting and did a lot of staring at the clock. If you don’t mind being on your feet and sometimes if not most literally being paid to do nothing, than it’s a job for you!"
good,"I am currently working Seasonal at Kohl's.  The environment is very busy and time flies. Management is easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job, is that there is not much time for training so you need to stay alert and learn very quickly. The most enjoyable part is time goes by very fast because it is very busy. Nice place to work if you can pick up on learning new things fast."
good,It’s truly a great work experience you work with top notch equipment great people and make great life long friends. The only issue for me were the hours were inconsistent the pay is not enough to live off of.
good,"Management is understanding of student-work life, and flexible with the schedule. Very competitive when it comes to obtaining credit, but otherwise rather relaxed. Originally started as a seasonal, ended up being offered a position after the season had ended so there is some room for advancement."
good,"Kohl's had a relaxed work setting, with people from all ages. It was a very communication heavy role that required constant contact between employees and customers"
good,Kohl's has a very repetitive uniformed day to day work environment. Very well kept by the help of maintenance and each employee. Training is very precise and there's always areas of opportunity for improvement. Employees are meant to be very persistent with meeting customer needs.
good,Relaxed environment but always on the move assisting customers and restocking merchandise.  Hours are flexible and employees are helpful when assistance is needed.
good,"At Kohl's they were strict about how they wanted things done, however a good company. They were mostly very nice and understanding. The lunch room always had snacks."
good,"When I first started working I enjoyed it for the most part, however after starting school my hours were cut and after talking with them nothing has changed. I’m ready to work in a job related to what I am going to school for which is medical assisting."
good,It's the better side of customer service but you can't really make a living working here from what I can tell. I like it but the hours are inconsistent. If you are experienced in customer service you would like this job. They provide very little training before you are on your own so to speak.
good,"I loved the job. The managers, coworkers, customers, and the actual work and they are super flexible with scheduling. The only problem is pay. I made very little for the work I did. And since I was part time my hours would go between 38 to 14 hours it was a toss up every week. And since supervisors usually stay there for quite awhile I'm at the high position I can be. I would love to stay but it's not long term."
good,"Good hours while training, after training you maybe can buy a pack of gum. They don't give hours but they'll call you in even in days off. Over a year there and I had 9 hrs a week."
good,"I had no previous experience in retail.  It was a good learning curve for me and very eye-opening as well.  The staff was, for the most part, great and the benefit of music to help you through your day was a pleasant surprise.  I like working here."
good,"This job was easy to learn, and not very challenging ever. The pace varied from day to day and was mostly dependent on the volume of patrons. I liked the variety of department shifts I potentially could be assigned but hated the monotony of standing behind a cash register day after day. The people were nice albeit some were very jevenile at times."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working here is a great experience when you're beginning in life. The hours are good and the job isn't difficult. All in all I enjoyed working here and found it easy to make a way for myself in the store.
good,"In the ever competitive retail environment, Kohl's is positioning the company to succeed on a number of levels. There are so many opportunities to learn and associates are appreciated."
good,"Coworkers mostly easy to work with. Job can be fast paced but that depends on position. Management doesn’t always follow up on interest to advance, which is discouraging."
good,Kohl’s was a fun place to work. I really love running the cash register. However the management team wasn’t all that friendly. During the holidays it was especially more fun because it was busier.
good,More work keeps being put on department employees that are always overwhelmed with he daily tasks that are expected. It is all supposed to be done when there is never enough help for any of the customer service staff to get anything accomplished.
good,I have been a shoes associate for 3 + years and its what you would expect in retail. The best thing about Kohl's is their culture. The pay is terrible and there is no room to move up.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls. They were like a second family. It was my first job and I really did learn a lot. The reason I left was due to a promotion I had received. As soon as I had gotten it and finished training- the company got rid of the position (it was a sign management position so I would have been responsible for changing signs and price points all over the store). It was good other than that
good,"Working at Kohl’s taught me very good customer service skills that I am now able to use with other jobs. Good hours, but the pay could have been better."
good,"I haven't worked there very long, but it's a good place to work if you're working retail. As with every retail job - the days and hours can be varied and unpredictable, which isn't easy on your life outside of work. But the people I work with are great."
good,"Working here was fun, i enjoyed every day amd every moment, I learned skills I didnt think I would be comfortable learning or performing, everyone was friendly and helpful and worked as a team."
good,"I was originally a seasonal part-time employee for the holidays, but did so well they made me a permanent full-time employee. The job itself was physically demanding, but my supervisor and coworkers were the best."
good,The job itself was not difficult at all and the atmosphere was a pleasure to work in. The hourly availability makes it difficult to achieve full time positions so expect more part time hours.
good,"I learned a lot during my year and 10 months of working there. They taught me how to unload the truck, how to sort freight onto the floor, as well as customer service. I had a very fun time working there."
good,They really seem to care about their employees. Catered lunches were a regular thing. Fun environment to work in. Pace is fast especially around Christmas which makes the day go fast. The only down fall is low pay and inconsistent hours which made it difficult to plan family outings. But the managers and employees were all very nice and fun to be around.
good,"As a seasonal employee, you don’t receive any of the benefits but it’s great work experience and honestly it was fun. I worked in the kids and home department and while it could get messy in the kids clothes and toys, it wasn’t a big deal to refold and organize the shelves. Plus it was great to have the discount during the holidays so I bought A lot of my gifts for my family. Working registers could get crazy but there was always someone there to help."
good,"Depending on the day, it could be very busy. Management can be very nice unless they are busy themselves. Sometimes very sarcastic. Other employees are very nice and make you feel welcomed."
good,Kohls has great benefits but the pay is on the lower scale for Loss prevention supervisors. Main goal is meeting HPA the pressure is a little high to meet said goal.
good,"can be a fun place to work, too much latitude for slackers, recognition for good deeds but mgmt hands tied by corporate, no fixed scheduling, managers included, creates difficulty"
good,"As a retail associate, I worked in the fitting rooms, on the register, clearing customer service, repackaging returns, and helping customers in the store and over phones. I learned how to better relate to people as well as multitasking and many others. Management at my store was really good and fun to work with for the most part and all the employees tried to help each other out as best as they could. The hardest part of the job were the days we were super busy while understaffed, it became a nightmare trying to keep up with everything, but I really did enjoy working there and organizing as well as helping the customers."
good,"Kohl's is a very high intense job. You are on your feet all day and have to work at a very fast pace. This makes the days go by quickly but can be very tiring. Duluth has GREAT management, they are all very positive and work extremely hard. They set a great example for their employees."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal associate, i was hired around Christmas time i was hired to assist customers during black friday, up sell khols charge cards, and maintain upkeep on floor."
good,"My job was just a seasonal  job"
good,Like every job there will always be some issues.  Kohls has advantages and disadvantages but overall I like the team that I work with. The perks of working there is amazing
good,The management is pretty fair and does a reasonably good job.  The hours you get  are limited unless you are full time.  You can make a career here if there are openings to do so.  Pay is not high but coworkers and job responsibilities are reasonable
good,"You have to work at least one weekend day and preferably evening shifts too if you want to be scheduled more hours. Atmosphere was laid back. No one micromanaging, which was refreshing. If you are on time, do your job, and communicate to the people around you and to the managers anything that is going on, and they are happy."
good,"Great place to start working a minimum wage job. Steady flow of work, although sometimes understaffed. It's hard to reduce your hours during the holiday season or take time off, but management is knowledgeable and good at their jobs."
good,If you enjoy Retail and like work at a fast pace you can find fun work as well as opportunities for advancement.  Most people find the culture a positive as well.
good,"Very hands on and work oriented. A bit stressful and exhausting. Hostility can be high at times, but coworkers come together. Nice break area.  Fun activities."
good,Very interesting place to work. get to meet a lot of new people and the fast pace of the job keeps the time flying. hardest part would probably be selling their kohls cards.
good,It was fun and relaxed but work was being done efficiently. The management was good.  And schedule worked very well with college classes.  I would recommend working here.
good,Only working part time I quickly realized the environment and it wasn’t friendly whatsoever. No one took the time to train me correctly nor answered my questions.
good,Some of the people are great to work with/ for. But working in Customer service is not worth the stress for how little you get paid. The only raise that I received was after a few months of working there and I haven't received another raise sents and I've been there for over two years.
good,This was over all a good company but the lack of hours I was given was a set back. I was made to work Thanksgiving night/Black Friday while other times I would be give 4 hour shifts once a week
good,"Although this is a good retail store to work, they expected credit card solicitation from employees.  Stressful to work, especially at Christmas, as any retail store. Raises are very low."
good,"• Perform day-to-day store operations."
good,Learning to use the equipment and what my responsibilities were was easy and I was never afraid to ask questions or ask for help. The hours were easy to understand.
good,"When i first started at kohls, it was so fun. But within my first month of working there was a rumor completely made up about me, to this day i have no clue who started it but it never made me feel comfortable working There. People continued to talk about me while i worked there so i never knew who to trust. I did enjoy making customers smile and laugh! This helped me love what i was doing."
good,"Nice place for a part-time job but no growth opportunity. Managers were great and work with you when you needed time off.  I had a graduation ceremony and I was scheduled to work  couldn’t find anybody to cover my shift, so my manager found someone to cover my shift  so I could go. During the holidays you get hours but during the month after the holidays it’s so slow you barely get a few hours a week."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. Especially for teenagers looking for extra cash around the holiday seasons. Positive and friendly work environment. Always easy to receive help.
good,"You would clock in and then do your job. At lunch break, you would get a short amount of time to finish your food which sucked but I was happy to get out of there."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"overall i had a good time at kohls. the managers had clearly favored some associates over others. kohls was extremely lenient on their call-out policy, and some days that would screw us over, when many would call out leaving a handful of us to do the whole's job. the hardest part was keeping up with the changing sales and explaining to customers the coupon policies and kohls cash requirements. the customers were like feral dogs when it came to the coupons. all in all, it was a better than average retail experience."
good,The job is like every other job. It has its perks and it’s draw backs. If you’re looking for a job with really flexible scheduling and interesting coworkers this is a good place to apply for.
good,I enjoyed working the floor and greeting and helping customers.  It can be a very busy at times.  Also tiring to be on your feet for more than 4 hour shifts.  You were allowed to wear nice sneakers which did help.
good,I enjoy working at this company. Their hours can be really flexible and they try to accommodate your needs on the job. They are also really good at training new associates and offering assistance as much as possible.
good,The hardest part of the the job was the intense focus on metrics such as credit apps and other operational metrics.  This intensity created a culture where teams felt the need take shortcuts.
good,"Kohl's boasts a very fast paced environment which is good for employees looking to to get a wide range of experience but can sometimes give the ""fish in the ocean"" experience due to the size of the growing IT business."
good,"Kohl’ is an alright job for someone starting out in retail, but they push workers relatively hard and have sometimes unrealistic sales goals. It can be a very stressful work environment."
good,Retail always fluctuates from being very chill to very stressful and Kohl’s is the same way. I had not many complaints besides the hours in slow season and the occasional annoying coworker but people come and go often. You get trained in most of the positions so doing something different from registers is a nice change.
good,"Fun and nice place to work, with great benefits Kohl’s warehouse will provide new challenges, good team leaders hands on training. Extra hours and breaks."
good,"Good employee discount.  Nice place to work.  I enjoyed learning new things about retail, and got experience in cash handling. It does not pay very well though."
good,"I loved the people, great environment. I only worked there for about a month but it was a good experience. I would recommend a point of sales position. It was my favorite"
good,"I started as a seasonal worker and was kept on as a permanent part time associate. I have been moved around the store and have worked in every department. I especially like customer service and the home and kids department. For all of the physical work that is done, he pay is extremely low. They are very willing to train you in new positions which keeps the job interesting, but I see very little room for advancement."
good,"Kohls is a great atmosphere to work in but the hours are pitiful."
good,There seems to be no structure. There are policies that are not followed. There are employees who don't care as much as others. Employee/Employee conflict or conduct is not taken as serious as other companies would.
good,I have been with kohls over 12 years! I have made great friends a lot of fun fast paced environment. Our managers are very professional and polite. The holidays are the toughest a lot of up and down shifts long hours and short staff.  I have learned many skills in operations of day to day task of retail excellent customer service skills and over all knowledge of retail.  I love the fast pace energy that gets me exited to go to work each day.
good,Kohl's is a good company. Always trying to move forward. Lack of communication in store as a whole. No sincere acknowledgement of work. Favoritism seen from store manager.
good,I enjoyed working customer service. I love helping people. I was always putting out fires with customers and loved helping resolve problems. I was also in charge balancing the registers and the cash office.
good,"I felt comfortable and was trained quickly, was hoping would end up staying after seasonal over.  Will keep checking for openings."
good,"This job was not stressful and pretty laid back, other than managers constantly pushing down our throats that we needed credits. Many of my coworkers were very nice and fun to talk to. Job was very consistent and the your schedule varied."
good,I enjoy working here while I’m in college because their very flexible with my schedule and I have heavy loads of homework sometimes so this comes in handy.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,All associates I have met are friendly and helpful. Management is very approachable and willing to spend time with employees. Positive atmosphere and treat employees well.
good,"It is alright for a minimum wage job, except that I do a lot of work that goes above my pay and is that of what a supervisor would do and I have never gotten any kind of compensation."
good,Friendly environment and diverse culture. Have the opportunity to learn more about retail business and learn how to convince customers to sign up new account.
good,"I was hired for a seasonal position and at first it was chill and calm but when the holidays were coming around everything got busy. To me it seemed like I was underappreciated for all the work I did there. Some of the managers were good. But their were some that weren't that great. They were flexible with my schedule but sometime would give you a hard time if you called off. Plus, they did not for warn me that they were letting me go I found out a week before when I wasn't being scheduled again. I enjoyed the people I met and we all became friends outside of KOHL'S."
good,"I worked as a sales associate and I enjoyed working at kohls the other employees feel like close friends and management is friendly. Just have to get used to the inconsistency of some days being really slow and some days you have a line to the other side of the store, but thats a common part of retail. Kohls end of retail consists of A LOT of coupons though so get used to that. Customers were usually friendly as well"
good,"Fast paced during holiday season. Other than that, very laid back place of business. Managers are great as well as the other employees. For cashiers, on our down time, we are expected fold so no matter what, you're always busy."
good,"I only work on weekends, but when I am there it is enjoyable.  I enjoy working with the people and also ways enjoy when I see familiar faces that come in the store."
good,Would come in dressed really professional. Would mostly work at the cash register and help out customers with their purchases. Would have to try to get customers to sign up for a kohl's card.
good,"my coworkers were good and my hours and dutys were good, however my management and benefits were not anything great or to brag about, overall it was an enjoyable job but not a career i would want to to follow"
good,"Compensation was good, opportunities for advancements and support for job-related continuing education.  Kohls has made a good conversion for younger people.  As with many companies, they employ too many non-US citizens."
good,I loved working at Kohls. It was a very easy job. The management was terrible. You were basically harassed by management to sell more credit cards and bullied if you didn't make goal. Hours were very inconsistent. Part time to them means 35-38 hours and full time is 40. Training is pretty poor so you kind of have to fend for yourself. I still enjoyed being in retail and the job itself.
good,"Low pay but nice place to work flexiable with hours and time off if need be, super nice co-workers , very supporting team members.  The store as a whole was an awesome team and family"
good,"Managers are great, kind and understanding. Customers are more often sweet than angry. Communication, here is so strong, theres a natural joy within the workers, ""thank you, have a great day"", genuine charisma from managers"
good,I loved my time at Kohl's. I just found that that I need to leave to advance somewhere else. The only other issue was with one of my managers. I just felt like my work was not being appreciated.
good,A typical day at kohls would consist of interacting with a minimum of 100 people a day. For me that was not an issue at all. I learned ways to deal with stressful customers and management. The hardest part of the job would probably be gently informing customers whether or not coupons would apply to the items that they would want to purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the people that I was working with as most of them were very pleasant to be around
good,"Good people to work with. Co-workers are smart and hard working. But too much stress of work. Too much fire fighting and unstructured operation. Hardly any creativity. Really resistance to change. Sr Management wants to control all decision making and if you think independently, this is not the place for you."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls.  Fast paced work environment.  I had the pleasure of meeting many co-workers and customers.  I had the opportunity to learn a few different positions and enjoyed each of them.
good,I will forever be grateful for my experience with Kohl's. Its difficult to have a balance between work and personal life but it makes for a great experience. I learned a lot on the job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at this kohl's is very relaxed and almost everyone is nice. They do push credit down your throat everyday because they get bonuses if they meet their quota but sales associates only get a dollar for ever application they open. Management will work with you for scheduling and during holidays they let you choose 2 shifts that you want to work for that day and try to schedule you for those, that way you can spend time with family that works for you. You do have some night managers that want to milk the clock and try and keep everyone there as long as payroll will let them which gets really annoying for students who have early class the next day."
good,"Fun place to work and the management was very helpful. The atmosphere was good and the coworkers were all ready to assist when needed. "
good,"Working in customer service is a busy job.  I'll help customers do a number of things.  Some are pretty easy and some not so much.  The challenge can be to keep the customer relaxed and make them feel like you care.  I love being around people and helping them. If a customer is difficult, I think to my self ""maybe something upsetting happened to them earlier.""  Then I can still have compassion.  There are so many other things to do at customer service.  Even a slow day is usually busy.  Just the was I like it."
good,"The working is relaxed and enjoyable, the managers are nice and the co workers are great. There is no constant rush to do things and no one breathing down your neck as you do your job. I enjoy working here and if I could work here full time it would be great."
good,"My experience at Kohl's was iffy. I had managers who didn't like to communicate necessary information clearly to me. I had a supervisor who yelled at me in front of customers. The ""good"" part of my title comes from my sales associate coworkers who I worked with. They made work fun, and we really got along."
good,I really enjoyed my time employed by Kohl's. I had a great relationship with the management. They were down to earth and would work right along side the regular employees.
good,"Kohl's likes to hire from within, you can start off seasonal and get a proper job. Part time hours are assigned by availability and need, so having prior commitments such as school/family/friends will cut into your already unreliable schedule. Unloading freight is simple and doesn't require much learning. Working on the sales floor was a bit confusing because my training was not always given by a manager nor was it given consistently by the same person, which was poorly handled. Management seems happy to let you flounder around until they can catch you doing something incorrect and show you the correct way to do it, or ask you to perform tasks quickly that requires previous study of the sales floor to accomplish with any efficiency. Ask questions or you will get left behind / scolded. Being part time, I have only worked in one department, but am sometimes required to traipse around the store aimlessly to return merchandise to where where it belongs."
good,"Everyone was nice to work with."
good,Managers are always making sure you are getting your breaks and having an adequate amount of work to do when the day is slow. They are a bit pushy on the credit cards that Kohl's offers.
good,Typical day at work means running around and keeping the store and fitting rooms tidy. Also the customer is super important. hardest part of the job is getting everything done.
good,Lot's of great employee incentives. Interaction with various cultures was rewarding. Work schedule was flexible and they listened to your requests. The down side was the hourly pay
good,Worked in Loss Prevention. Job duties complete weekly audits. Focus on finding inventory loss through out the week. Best part working with security cameras to apprehend shoplifters.
good,"As a cashier at Kohls you are expected to stand in one place for hours, the managers don't allow much socializing with other coworkers, even when the store is very slow.  The store was never prepared for busy days and we were always understaffed. This means customers would grow impatient because there was no one on the floor to help them. As a result the disgruntled costumers come to the registers angry and they become more irritated when their coupons do not work.  Managers will bully you to get people to sign up for credit cards.  It is a great way to learn about the retail industry, but not a good job if you don't like being bored or stressed out.  The place is always between two extremes."
good,If you are looking for some extra money this is right up your alley.  Flexible hours and multiple options depending on your availability.  The managers are very nice and will work with you as much as they can.  It is a team environment and most people can answer questions or give help when it is needed.
good,When I started I really liked the job. But recently the atmosphere has gotten a bit wonky. Most people are friendly and the job isn't that hard. There is very little actual training. Most is a learn as you go.
good,"At times it could be very fast paced , which was most of the time."
good,Working double time because some employees don't do their jobs correct. Customers are rude. Some even are dirty. Some managers are very uptight when their boss comes to the store causing stress on the employees.
good,"I really enjoy working at Kohl's. Everyday varies by how busy it is. On busy days the days go by very quick and are very fast paced. On slow days, our duty it to organize, clean and do projects. I honestly really enjoy organizing so it was perfect for me! I really enjoy my coworkers as well."
good,fun and very hard working. it was great to work with fun people that loved to work at kohls. I would definitely recommend to a friend that is looking for part time
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Management is very positive, upbeat, and encouraging. The work is fast-paced and can be stressful around the holidays. The employees are very friendly. After the holidays, business does slow down more than expected and hours are usually cut for everyone who's not management."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work. However, it really would be better if all levels at store would really get a more structured reward program for their employees. "
good,"I like working there while searching for a higher paying position.  Being at Kohls requires teamwork/group participation, especially during the months when higher ups think its ok to work a skeleton crew. I definitely enjoy teamwork in whatever capacity I work, though it can definitely be defeating when you only get on the schedule 1-2 times per week.  The continuous drive to get credit cards is quite annoying and even the most competitive amongst us become disillusioned at times.  Other than that, I really do like those I work with and for."
good,In my time at Kohl's I've met many great people from fellow associates to customers. It's an overall good place to work just not somewhere I see myself being permanently.
good,"While working here, there was not one shift as to where I was not busy. There is always some sort of folding or tagging that needs to be done. There is also always customers that need helping or fitting room that needs to be clean. Never a boring day, but also was super busy."
good,"very team oriented, fun workplace with plenty of staff lunches, breakfasts, and bbq for compleated major projects.  other associates always ready to assist in other departments"
good,"Some management used negative reinforcement to motivate workers. Not the best way in my opinion, humiliation got in the way of a positive work motivation"
good,I started at Kohl's in the Women's Dept and was switched to offloading the truck shortly after where I found my calling. I was within a few months promoted to Supervisor at the recommendation of the current supervisor and was chosen from a group of 6 workers that had seniority in time over me. Being the supervisor over people that had been employed by the company way longer than myself was a challenge but in the end things went very smoothly. I really loved this job.
good,"It was an ok place to work, the work pick favorites for management positions even if you was hired and had the experience. Worked there over a year and never got a raise"
good,Typical retail job. Pushy on credit cards. Flexible on schedule and department placement. Good job for a teenager or second job that needs extra spending money but not for an adult trying to make a living
good,"Fast paced, always busy working.  Different departments have better work life balance than others.  Ultimately left because I could not move internally to a position that better fit."
good,I learned how to move quicker and multitask more. I learned communication skills and how to interact with customers. Overall was a good job and only left because it was seasonal.
good,"Employees relatively follow the rules, with the exception of the lazy ones, and some of the superiors are somewhat rude. but overall it is an acceptable workplace."
good,Not a challenging environment but tends to be unorganized with management. A lot of pressure with selling credit. Employees were welcoming and very friendly.
good,It was a pleasure working at Kohls. Managers were readily available to help if needed. Training was sufficient to start and coworkers pitched in when there was increased customers needing assistance.
good,If you are looking for part time work while managing another job and/or personal life Kohls is great.  You are driven to get credit applications and sign up guests for the rewards program.
good,Management was nice and understanding. They work well with your schedule and the environment is clean and welcoming. The coworkers were also helpful and communication is a major win in this department store.
good,Kohl's was my first job out of high school. It supplied me with the money I needed to save up for college and pay my minimum college bills by working on the weekends. It was a fun job that introduced me into the world of customer service. I don't have many complaints!
good,"Great 2nd income/job, enjoyed customers, co-workers, can be challenging but overall a good company to work for.  Flexible hours and they work around your schedule"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"You learn a lot about customer service, and working in stressful situations with people from all kinds of backgrounds. You do build a community with those that you work with, which helps make the shifts go by a lot faster and makes you feel good coming into the shift and leaving the shift. It is a little hard when you have 4-6 supervisors and managers because not everyone is always on the same page with jobs that need to get done, and everyone has a different level of priorities. It is very easy to become cross-trained within the store, which is also the best way to work there because you can help out whenever is needed. This is a job that you are on your feet 100% of the time, and need to be quick paced, for both the customers and your coworkers. You do not have a lot of down-time because there is always something to do and the shifts can get long. Because it is only a minimum wage job, you can't live off this job. There are annual raises, but it's by cents so it does not really do a lot."
good,It was a pretty much good experience wish there was a understandable and better relationship with managers. I had a fun time with other associates. I had pretty good pay as a college student but sometimes felt I did more work than I was paid. A lot come with that job.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's included meeting with the team in the morning to discuss the tasks that lay before us. The day then went forward with us performing the tasks that we were assigned, while attempting to help out the rest of the store if we could."
good,"Scheduling was inconsistent (bounced around from graveyard shift, to morning shift, to night time shift). Holidays were blackout days, all employees were required to work and did not get to be with their families. Employees were offered discounts, but benefits were scarce, and lunch time was a hassle (breaks not long enough). Opportunities for advancement were not easy to obtain, but not non-existent. Most of the managers were friendly and understanding, however a few had unrealistic expectations and favoritism was a definite issue. Overall my experience there was not all negative, but there are some improvements that could be made."
good,"I loved structuring the junior department area and dressing the mannequins to fit the departments request during that season! There use to me one supervisor in each department with an extra one or two helper/associates during the day. Quickly there were only 2 or 3 of us on the floor during the whole day and covering other departments. The dressing rooms would get so piled up. I'm surprised people still tried on things. I love the clothes, people, discounts, job, but didn't like being taken advantage of with more responsibility and same pay and same hours."
good,Throughout the day the job requires you to interact with customers asking if they are finding everything okay or if they need help. Answering phones for customer calls are very common as well. The workplace culture is very welcoming. It is a great place for families to shop and find quality and inexpensive items. The hardest part of my job if I had to pick one would be scheduling. Scheduling can be difficult to get hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with the customers. I really enjoyed helping and talking with customers. Also really enjoyed my co workers.
good,"They have good training and good management, it is not hard fitting in and looking the part. The only sad part is the hours of standing and walking around. but what can you expect from a department store"
good,"kohls had a very fun environment! the store i worked at also did a lot of charity type events with our community which was really awesome. management is typically good about working with your schedule. the hardest part about the job would probably depend on your position, so for me as a customer service worker, it would have to be remaining professional & providing a civil manner with rogue customers! but some of the customers are also the best part about the job!"
good,"I learned to make payments, register, count registers. Cleaned fitting rooms and placing the clothes back on the road. You learn to do everything if you do not know yet."
good,"weekdays are slow, weekends are busy. coworkers tend to have bad attitudes. always expected to be doing something when there are no customers to help. be prepared to listen to the same songs everyday."
good,"The management at Kohl's was fantastic, but one thing is they made employees CONSTANTLY do things, even if they just finished that job. It was fun to work at and the other employees were likeable."
good,I like working here but only because I did not need to support myself fully. The pay is low but above minimum wage. I also feel like the training book for the cash register was very out dated so they should update that.
good,"in a work place fast paced, filled with many customers especially during the holiday season I had to make sure I helped my customers as fast and as well as I could while getting credit for the company and making sure no customer stole any products. Having to provide customer service with a big smile and helping my fellow co-workers when they needed my help."
good,"I have worked at Kohl's for seven months now, and it has been an uphill battle. I got the job as a part time job to make some extra money. It became my full time job after I was offered a promotion. I thought that this would be better for me and so I took it. Unknown to me was that I would be untrained and given very little help to understand my position. Also I was expected to be a ""utility"" worker and cover when others needed it. Because of this, I hardly ever got my own work done on time. Also management has been in a state of constant change since I started there, because of this change they tend to micromanage their employees."
good,"Kohl's is a fast pace growing company that is fun and challenging to anyone who wants to learn all phases of the industry.There are advancement opportunities in learning to operate a walkie rider, an order picker, how to do put aways, shipping and receiving,to a lead worker to assistant supervisor"
good,"This was one of my first jobs. The environment is nice, both co-workers and customers. I would definitely recommend Kohl's for someone wanting to make a career in sales and management."
good,Fun place to work but very busy at times. Must have very good customer skills. Always on your feet but an enjoyable place to work for if you enjoy retail.
good,"very fast paced and hands on place to work , great discounts and everyone treats you very nice. flexible hours and okay pay. not the best at training though."
good,"Friendly workplace environment, flexible hours and schedule.  A typical day at work I would make my credit goal as I'm checking out the customers. The hardest part of the job was not getting paid enough."
good,Not a bad job if it's your first one! Everybody is friendly and management is very understanding! They give you flexible hours if you are still in school. Though the pay is only minimum wage and they are very selective on who they train to move up.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The place of work is very enjoyable so far. Work together. Alot of senior team leads want to see you grow and to become leaders as well. If you need advice everyone is willing to help.
good,"this was a fun place to work. Very busy, but makes the day go quicker. If you like fast and busy, this sure is the place. Not hard work in any area you pick to work and good pay."
good,The employees are like family there. I would suggest approaching them if you ever need help or have questions. They treated me with respect and were understanding of any problems I had.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kohls. The people were extremely nice and very helpful when I needed guidance. It was my first job so it built my customer service skills, taught me how to move at a fast pace and to run a cash register. The manager was fine. I did not want to leave my job but I had just had a baby and was only getting one shift per week and I decided spending time with my daughter was more important than a 4 hour shift."
good,Kohls is a great place to get your foot in the door. It’s a great company with many benefits. It’s hard to move up and most of the time the management is not on the same page with one another.
good,"I enjoy Kohls, people are willing to help if busy, should be more employees on the weekends working (scheduled) for which it gets busy and customers complaining."
good,I worked her to make some extra money during the summer and winter breaks I had from college. I only wanted to work as a cashier and have no plans to make it a career.
good,"I got along well with my coworkers and management team, but the pay was around minimum wage and there is little to no room for advancement. Full time jobs are rare at store locations."
good,Loved working there for 6 weeks over the holidays and would do it again next time around. Fun working with my sis and her crew.  Would love to have stayed on after holidays but my sis was management level so couldn't have.
good,"They work well with hours but don't pay much."
good,While working at kohls i enjoyed it so much. I loved my management. They were pretty easy going and worked around my school schedule nicely. I work both the register and customer service and enjoyed both.
good,"Anyone looking for a job in retail would, in my opinion, enjoy working at Kohls.  Management was great, there was typical workplace drama but nothing out of the ordinary.  The hardest part for me about the job was working mostly nights and weekends, since I was new. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to see all the new fashion coming in every day along with their great employee discounts."
good,Kohls was a geat place to work. They really do take care of the assocviates. Regional leaders are well equipped with what they need to complete assigned duties
good,"Ran register for most of shift."
good,"The hardest part of the job was talking customers into getting the Kohl's charge and working insane hours on Black Friday."
good,great job if your a student wanting a little extra cash working after holiday defiantly slowed down but its a good job if you want any experience in retail
good,"The job i was hiring to do, i have yet to do."
good,"The work life at Kohl's was fun and upbeat with the opening store manager.  We enjoyed our teams that were created based on matching personalities.  Being crossed trained was never an issue and growing in the company was always an option for those who worked towards that goal.  The remaining time I was there, management changed and it became very difficult to do anything ""right"".  The actual store manager never got out behind her desk and the assistant managers were turning loyal employees into people that hated coming to work.  Pay was never the best even though it was based on your work.  Even if you worked your hardest raises would not be more than 50 cents.  The hardest part of my job was to not break an item.  The most enjoyable part was being there for the costumers face making their wishes come true."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I did like working there. The hours were overnight. I usually worked about 2 to 3 days per week. It was fast paced. I worked the Christmas season overnight because I already had a day job.
good,"Kohl's is a good retail employer. You are required to work every other weekend.  It was a good experience, except for the Holiday hours. Often late hours and a lot of mess to clean up."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls, the management team was very helpful and kept the flow of the business running smoothly. Most typical days were making sure the department was clean and neat and to put out displays, restock, replenish, and assisting guests/ customers with all aspects of what they need. I also assisted with cashiering when needed. But most days were real good."
good,"Replenish stock and clean up loading dock area.  Management ability depended upon manager.  Hard lines was short staffed and had a lot of cleaning to do, soft lines had trouble getting employees that wanted to work.  Store manager very good."
good,"I enjoy my day at work, and the people I work with are great. I have a lot of hours during the Holiday time, but once that is over, the hours aren't available bc of payroll. But overall a great place to work."
good,"Kohl's is a really good place to start your working life as a teenager, but it is not somewhere I would stay permanently. It helped me get my foot in the door with work experience and gave me experience with customer service."
good,"I love this job but i need to find another because they don't schedule you with sufficient hours. I am a student so I only work weekends and the hours/pay is not enough."
good,The opportunities of growth exists with hard work and dedication. The turnover rate of managers are pretty high due to managers being recruited with little to no experience.
good,I feel like it could of been better if everyone did they jobs and not steal brake time Iiked the fact I can help the  customers find what they wanted and what they need help with and I loved the fact most customers would come to me to help them all the because they like how nice I was to them
good,"I loved my coworkers and the fast paced work we had to do. However, management was not effective and created a hostile work environment when he was present. I learned a lot about retail and sales that pushed me into my major. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction. The hardest part of the job was the large floor of the store and having to keep up with folding and cleaning the clothing."
good,"It was a great posotion but I wish it just paid more thanit did. I hated to leave but Ineeded more money. I had started goiong to school. I wanted a better paying posotion but t the time did not have a Degree."
good,"There are many people I work with I have never met, or do not know. Quotas are to be filled and sometimes it can feel like you're just a number. But, that's all to fault to corporate mindset."
good,"Although some supervisors weren't as professional as they should have been, I still gained the most customer experience working at Kohl's. The discounts were great and my coworkers were the best."
good,working there taught me skills i love to have and apply in other areas of my life. the management is very good and the culture is really good. They really try to work around your schedule but is not that flexible.
good,Kohls was a great place to work. The people there were amazing and the atmosphere was great. Everyone was very willing to help when I nedded it. Management was supportive with scheduling and training.
good,This was a typical retail position. Customer service comes first. Signing new customers up for credit and store accounts was second. Keeping the store safe and clean was last. Fun place to work and the environment can be rather relaxing and peaceful.
good,"Large corp. - Stable, less apt to store being closed, shabby equipment to work with - meaning lost productivity.. Inverntory levels  are inaccurate, resulting in lost sales."
good,"Customers are terrible and stuck up, everyone who shops at Kohls are either snobs who think theyre at Lorde and Taylor, or think 25K is a lot. Management is understanding, and work is relaxed, but you WILL be cleaning up after customers 24/7"
good,"Before I started I was told I was being hired for management at a certain salary. Once I started I wasn't given the position or pay that I was told I'd be receiving, but I settled into customers service and loved working there and all ly co-workers, but the hours were minimal and pay wasn't paying the bills"
good,"I enjoy this job, most of the people are friendly and talkative. Depending on the area you're working in the job can be easier or harder and in certain areas the requirements may vary."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Staff is typically very fun to work with. Good job for someone in school, management is typically understanding. Biggest con - pay/advancement........"
good,My typical day at work as a supervisor was like babysitting a bunch of kids with no real support from up management. They have taken workplace culture to a different level in a bad way. This is a associate based environment which leaves no room for Ops supervisors to learn and grow.
good,I like working with the customers and helping them find what they needed. I also liked being busy. I did not like having to clean up the fitting rooms because some customers thought it would be neat to leave the fitting room a mess.
good,This job is for people who enjoy working with people.  Keeping the store organized during peak holiday hours is a challenge. The hours are not convenient for a person that is only working seasonal and paying child care. The employee discounts are good.  Management is fairly younger than employees and that can cause tensions and personality conflicts for certain people.
good,Worked part time on the floor with merchandise and customers. Enjoyed the interaction and challenges that comes with retail.  Managers were great to work with.
good,"Fast pace work "
good,"Worked there for three years. The pay was good but I didn't really have much a ""home"" balanced life. I worked a lot of weird hours. That either required me to be sleeping while everyone else was awake. I didn't get to spend any time with my girls so I was forced to quit"
good,"I loved working at Kohl's. I met and worked with some very nice people. I liked the work that I performed, I felt I was out-standing in in my job, although it kept me on my feet non-stop the whole working time I was there, it was fast-paced and not boring at all. I loved working with the new technology that I learned while working there."
good,"Good place to work can be hectic, but that is retail for you. Coworkers are good, and you get really good discounts, but hard to get full time and good pay."
good,"My overall experience with working with Kohl's was good but, they were slow a lot of the times and made working confusing and I felt that I wasn't taught well during training. The co-workers were friendly and nice however and greeted me with kindness."
good,I actually physically put together the store's new Beaty Bank. I learned a lot about make up and ways to keep the product sanitary. It was easy to make daily sales quotas.
good,It's a good job. The only downfall is you don't get many hours or you don't get any benifits because everyone that works there is part time unless you are a supervisor.
good,"great place to work at. friendly employees. you know what to get done. only thing is very few management, when you need one you have to go look for one."
good,"The massive size of the organization and stringent processes made it difficult to move quickly from conception to execution. The company was going through growing pains and several organizational structural changes made the work environment volatile. The company was heading in the right direction with the new technology, organizational structure and process improvements, but the pace was just too slow."
good,"It was a good job for what it was. I only worked part time so I didn't receive a high wage, or get any benefits. The job itself was very independent which I liked."
good,I liked going to work somedays. It was a job for the moment and I couldn't see myself being there forever. I loved the responsibilities and departments that I had to oversee.
good,I worked in freight unloading and stocking.  The merchandise and and carts were heavy and hard to control. This was the hardest part.  The manager I wrorked for was very fair and knowledgeable.
good,The environment was nice. People were nice and they helped one another.  Can't really say anything bad. You are on your feet all day so comfortable shoes is a must.  They offered great employee discounts and the store had good product
good,"i enjoyed the interaction with the public in my day to day tasks. after awhile, the work became unchallenging and unfulfilling. i meat many nice people who i still keep in touch with"
good,"Typical day involves checking department and making sure it's clean by the end of your shift. I learned to offer exceptional customer service to clients. Workplace is swarmed with young folks as myself and it's great to work with them. Management is okay, so many mangers but each have their own personality. The hardest part is constantly standing so your feet tend to hurt without proper shoes, the most enjoyable part is working with outgoing employees."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"You can come in, do your job, and leave with minimal problems. Fairly low stress environment. You have to be prepared to answer random questions from costumers at any moment."
good,"Good environment. Promotes from within.  The executive staff is very helpful. Paid breaks, excellent break room. Great place to start first job. Good training program."
good,Kohls is not a bad place but it's mostly for college students that need a part time something short. As a parent I needed more benefits and more pay. Not enough hours.
good,"Salaried and expected to work 9 hr shifts but anytime 1 of the 100 retail associates called off or were late you were expected to stay and cover their shift.  As a salaried manager you can complete all of your expectations during a 40 hour work week but because store is open 90+ hours  a week you can leave one day feeling accomplished and come in the next day to see ruins.  Shifts consistently inconsistent.  5am-2am 2 days a week, 5pm-1am two days a week and one mid-shift.  Decent entry level management roll."
good,"I enjoyed my 11 yrs there, but time to move on.They we're fair, management couldn't get raises. That was given from corporate.  You have to stay there a long time to make decent money."
good,Working there full time is a plus. I only worked part-time and still loved it. I enjoyed the speed not to slow and fast when I need it. Management allows you to work alone but team work is still a factor when handling guest issues.
good,"I worked at the District Headquarters Kohl's in the Pacific NW for 7 years. My main goal was to enter into Management so I could move up the ladder and make more money. That never happened, Kohl's changed their policies for hiring Managers-in-Training. They used to hire from within their current employee base anyone who had the interest and experience to justify moving into Management. Now, they hire Assistant Managers directly from the list of Graduates of local colleges with degrees in either Retail Management or Merchandising. Only select colleges are eligible, so check first to make sure they have a contract with Kohl's at the college of your choice. For the rest of us, it's now just another job unless you're willing to go back to college and seek a degree in either of those disciplines. Kohl's has now become only a great ""temporary"" place to work while you're seeking a career elsewhere that offers better advancement opportunities."
good,"As someone in customer service and retail, my typical day was never the same twice. I ensured that the customer was served, and the environment of the store was welcoming and helpful. "
good,It was not the best place to work (for me) but a great place to work if you are in search of some extra income or a student. It's very quick-paced environment.
good,"I never new how busy a retail store can get. After my experience at Kohl's, I have realized it is one of the most organized retail stores in the industry. Customers might not agree, but it takes a lot of time and effort to maintain a department store like kohls."
good,"When I came on as a temp working 32 hours a week the Manager quit.  I was asked to step in and oversee the role of Manager and report to Tim Kupp;  Regional Manager.  "
good,The salary was good for the job provided. There was a lack of hours. The managers were very impersonal and the breaks were short. There was also a dress code.
good,"The managers are good with communication about other social and work opportunities. Too much technology was used in my opinion, we went from using very little technology with checking our schedule online to not even really needing a secretary anymore. It was all done through the app, which not all employees had access to the app and had to make adjustments accordingly. In my opinion it was brought in and took over way TOO quickly. Besides the technology factor it was a very fun work environment. They always had some sort of contest going or something fun happening with the local community for us to all participate in."
good,"Kohls is one of those places that's good for a first job. You will learn ALOT and gain lots of experience, but your rate will be low, and sometimes the managers treat you like you're a child."
good,Fun place to work at. Management is easy to work with and they try to help you with your availability. During holiday you can work a lot of crazy hours.
good,"this was a part time job for me for two years while I was in college. I truly learned a lot about becoming who I am today here, but they push the credit card way to hard  and it can be tough during the holidays"
good,"It's a great part-time gig. Hours were something to be desired, but it was a great atmosphere to work in. Employees were friendly and helpful. You receive lots of cudos when you are doing a good job"
good,I like working at Kohls.  It started as an extra job for Christmas.  I stayed on though.  I would keep working there but for now I am looking for more hours and more consistency.
good,The company had its ups and downs. Ups being flexible work hours that allowed you to be able to attend school or other activities but downs as in management weren't as reasonable with some things .
good,"A typical day, fun workplace, fast paced, management is nice. The training is well stated. If you need more they will provide. I learned how to work well in the retail business"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Always on the move, a bit on the fast paced line of work, work schedules are available for the next week, coworkers can be hit and miss depending on events. Customers can also be quoted as the same as the coworkers, a bit under appreciating on replenishment and stock room audits. The managers are respectful and make it easy to adjust the schedule for your work hours."
good,"In this job you were not hassled about things all the time. You would have assignment and you would get things done. I really liked the environment coming out of customer service. It was a good experience, and I really enjoyed the HR."
good,"The most difficult part of the job would be dealing with customers. The rule *The Customer is Always Right* is unfortunately not 100% correct. However, being in a customer Service heavy environment, we must always act with the best interest of the customer. Whether we want to or not."
good,"I loved working at Kohl's.. The pay was great but the hours sucked.. I would get but four hours a week.. Management is wonderful, and the employees are sweet."
good,The scheduling was done every other week so it was hard to know your schedule. During the day i would typically check out people when they were ready to leave and i would mark clearance as well
good,I was hired as seasonal help. My time there I ended up working in many different sections of the store. Which was fine with me I like to learn new things and it's always helpful should they need a shift covered and you don't have to go in blind.
good,"Very fast paced during the holidays "
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls, but unfortunately they weren't offering enough hours to suit my needs. The people were very friendly, and the job was never difficult."
good,Kohls has a team oriented and friendly working environment.  I'm looking for advancement opportunities and have been looking to move up in the company but haven't worked long enough to be considered.  The one con about working here has been the lack of compensation and benefits for part-time employees.
good,Hired as a seasonal employee.  Was hoping to get a full time position but there was none available at the time.  Was looking for a steady full-time job at the time
good,A great environment full of diversity and acknowledged every worker in every aspect they could that enlightened the company. I would actually still be with the company if my hours weren't cut as bad.
good,"No reviews of Kohl's.  It was ok  It was a job.  Direct supervisors were not helpful"
good,"Great place to work , nice environment but don't pay to much ."
good,its job. you can have unruly customers at times. your constantly stand on your feet. its entertaining meet new faces. But the scheduling could be better
good,not my favorite place ive worked. only good thing is discounts for the holidays. don't work with youre schedule very well.  management always in bad mood / angry at everyone. horrible training experience
good,"Kohl's was my first job and i had a good experience there and learned how retail works. My managers and boss we're really cool,friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working with my co workers and learning how retail works. Hardest part of the job was when the store got busy and i had to help more than one customer at the time and stay on task on what i had to do."
good,"Keeping the department looking clean and organized"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was an OK place to work. They were very strict on the no cell phone rules - even though it wasn't explained at orientation. All about hitting your credit and rewards numbers - don't expect to advance if you don't.
good,Great place to work and they work with college students and their school schedule. Management is very involved with their employees and will communicate when there is a problem.
good,good place to work management very good downfall was lack of work with the exception of peak seasons during holidays back to school sales and spring sales
good,The managers were great and the work environment was awesome. I was only a seasonal employee so job security was not what I hopes for. Still a great place to work.
good,"Very fast paced and often is asked to do more with less. "
good,"Its nice to be a part of the organisation and got great exposure to learn with good colleagues."
good,Supervisors were generally very helpful. Very willing to help anybody that has trouble with a task. Work is taken seriously but not a bad environment to have actually relationships with co-workers.
good,"it was fun at first, but then there is the managers breathing down your neck about pushing their credit card. And if you don't push hard enough, you get disciplined."
good,"A great retail company. A typical day consisted of maintaining store appearance by folding clothes, and arranging merchandise in a neat, orderly way as to enhance customer's shopping experience. I learned to handle retail work efficiently and have gained good experience from it."
good,"Kohl's was very demanding of their hours, and at times the floor was absolute chaos. But I worked in many different positions in different departments and enjoyed the camaraderie with my co-workers and learning on a daily basis."
good,I worked here while I put myself through school. Management was flexible with my schedule and always courteous. They were focused on providing a clean and pleasant shopping experience for the customer.
good,"Working as a store associate at Kohl's is very enjoyable overall.  Coworkers and lower-level management are very easy to get along with.  Upper level management can be difficult to work with, as they have many issues to deal with at one time and can act very snippy when dealing with yours.  This is typical, however, for any upper level management and can't be held against them.  The only drawback is very few hours.  I work in intimates and accessories, which does not need to be staffed as much as other departments, and currently I only get 4 hours per week.  Yes, that's right - per week.  I have begged repeatedly for shifts in other departments, and have offered many times to be trained as a cashier, but have been totally ignored even though I have proven to be efficient in all departments I have worked in, and have had previous experience as a cashier."
good,"Very easy going place to work. The people there are usually pretty cool because they're usually young, either senior in high school or college, like I am so it was easy to mesh with coworkers."
good,"I found I really enjoyed the job of customer service. It was hard work and often very challenging. I learned a lot about retail, marketing, and the personalities of the people who work there. It was often stressful but very rewarding."
good,They take anything back from customer don't matter if they got it there or not. Kinda hard on the employees but besides that it's ok
good,Good overall job for those without supervisory aspirations.  Management requires you to prove your resume experience before advancement.
good,Very well maintain good managers.I love the place has a good working environment. Does not give a lot of hours unfourtuntly . Good Job to have with the good co workers
good,Kohl's corporation is a great place to work if you love keeping yourself busy with constant change. You will run into new brands coupons and people to learn and experience everyday. You need to be quick on your feet and quick with your mind to accomplish daily goals.
good,"Typically the job is routine, according to your position. The factors that aren't so structures are customers, and sales. The hardest part, like most retail can be the customers or how busy it can get and the amount of help that may be available. On the other hand one of the most enjoyable part is the team."
good,Its a Nice place to work if your looking for an easy Part time job but if youre looking to stay a long time iw ould say it wouldnt be to benificial due to the hours given.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced work environment with a wide diversity in associates and customers.  The face to face interaction with customers and helping them resolve their issues made my day.
good,Lots of retail and customer service skills are needed. The hours vary. It can be a fun and creative place to work. Working long hours on weekends and holidays can be tough.
good,"It was a pretty decent job but they didn't give me enough hours and my pay wasn't all that good , I got paid weekly but I never made over $200 a week. The store was a mess most of the time, but they workers there are very friendly."
good,"I started working for Kohl's during the Black Friday/ Christmas season. I was kept on after the season was over. It was busy, but I kept up with the work, helping customers, maintaining a good attitude, and even helped a few people along the way."
good,The work itself was not hard to understand once you learned it. Management was not the best because they were always pressed to get orders out on time; which was understandable. My co-workers made my job very fun to go to though. The hardest part was finding work to do after peak season ended.
good,"fun and friendly, just really unorganized. when they could easyaly be top retail sales, they choose to take the back door instead of jumping at the front"
good,"I applied for Kohl's back in 2015 to be seasonal part-time, and come January, I was signed on for year-round part-time because they thought I was a good enough fit."
good,Good place to work but have to understand and learn sign language to be very productive at the school and as employee but other than that it's a great place to work
good,I worked here during the summer months of my collegiate career. This company worked with my academic schedule as well as a perfect balance between life and work.
good,Work and talk with people all day. Help out the customers find exactly what they are looking for. I learned better people skills and how to help people efficiently. The co-workers were great to work with! Management was okay and they would try to help with issues when needed but they would also not take blame for their actions. The hardest part of the job was the extra time spent at the store after close to fix everything till perfect. The co-workers make you feel at home and welcomed.
good,"Kohl's is a fast paced store. Always something to do, someone to help. The team is great, welcoming, friendly. Management has pretty good communication to the associates and tries their best to make personal time and work time equal."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers. I wish they had better hours. The managers need to communicate more with new employees an each other. It is difficult to start a new job when your managers are different each day.
good,No formal training program. Learn as you go basically which is not the way I prefer to work for a large corporation like this. I can understand the time constraints to train new workers but it would be of benefit to train properly.
good,"If you like customer interactions, it's the place to be. Having to meet credit goals is a challenge.  Overall the culture of Kohl's management employee association is wonderful."
good,"My time at khols was a pretty decent experience. I worked as a temp during the holidays and let me tell you, was it rough. I worked overtime and from witching hours to morning, but that was only because I worked with my friend who had those hours."
good,Great place to work. Day to day in certain areas it may get boring. If you like tedious work then you should work in a department or stocking. The hardest part is being able to feel like your in sync with the workplace all the time.
good,"Good company, limited opportunity to advance.  Typical retail issues, good co-workers willing to help make the job easier. On-going training and support."
good,"First time working in retail.  Good part-time job for extra money.  Co-workers are very friendly and helpful.  "
good,"Kohl's intentions from the corporate level are admirable. They want to provide an excellent environment for their associates, however something is lost once it reaches the store level. The pressure to execute the customer service goals comes at the expense of a lack of sufficient payroll to allow not only good customer service, but the regular feeling by the associates that they are failing at the end of every shift. There are some good people working, but the feedback can be a bit discouraging. It is also discouraged to give honest feedback when you have a VIP visit. You need to smile and say that everything is wonderful."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"the old management was on top of everything, they were well organized and well planed out. The co workers were all nice and friendly, the job was enjoyable. The con was being in the baby sections having to keep refolding them."
good,"A typical day can be busy greeting the customers and attending to there needs makes the work day fly buy, especially when you have such nice and proffesional managers. During my time here I leanred alot about how bussiness is run and what goes in the back and in te recieving section of the store. Hardest part of job has to be when im schedued on long shifts behind the register but overall manageable."
good,It was a fast paced fun loving group of people. they were always willing to work with me because of the hours I went to school.
good,Kohl's is a great place because management cares about your development.  They provide self-help courses and have an open book policy.
good,very good work environment and clean area. all the associates are so nice to the customers and always ready to serve them.
good,"A typical day at work includes putting away clothes, assisting customers, and cleaning the fitting rooms. I've learned how to keep things organized, how to make the store look more appealing to customers, and how to handle stressful situations. Management pushes me to always do my best. My co- workers are all very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of my job is having to keep up with the demands of the store and customers on our busiest days. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy."
good,"A typical day at work for me is merchandising clothes, putting them out on the sales floor or back in the stock room. Cashing out customers and handling returns are also apart of my schedule there as well. I have learned a lot about the retail aspect which i would not have learned if I did not work there. My co workers are always friendly and easy to get along with and that is the main reason why i like working there."
good,"You are a cashier and floor associate who handles fitting rooms, floor cleanup and go backs. Co-workers are often helpful. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed. You can become overwhelmed quickly with the amount of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping busy and working with your co-workers."
good,"Very generous discount every few months, but some management expected too much. Coworkers were the best! Unfortunately, some of management wanted you to do the workload of 3 people which was impossible, and some of them would make you feel terrible or make you stay over hours."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part. Apart from the occasional angry customer, it was really enjoyable. I wouldn't mind working there again. I have family members who worked there for years"
good,"I love the people i work with and enjoy going. Although its a great job the hours are horrible. "
good,I overall enjoyed working for the company. I met a lot of wonderful workers while working. I learned how to communicate with customers to meet their needs. I also learned how to clean and organize products. I learned how to work the cash register to cash out customers.
good,I really enjoyed working here. I think It is good for someone who just wants extra cash. Not good if you're struggling with money. The working environment was very pleasant. I liked all the managers and overall it was a good job.
good,"Kohls was a enjoyable work environment that encouraged hard work and dedication to the customer experience. While working there, co-workers were equally friendly to customers and fellow employees. There was never a dull moment, as even in lulled hours, the energetic and contemporary music playing over the speakers would encourage smiles and up-beat attitudes."
good,"Great Place to work at, the people are awesome. The company lacks stability and consistency. If management were better Id recommend 100 %. The perks of being an employee are awesome."
good,"Recovering sales floor,operating registers and anything else assigned by manager, Some of the managers were awesome. Co workers were some friendly hardest part is big sales and holidays slammed with customers. I enjoyed every minute of it."
good,"Kohl's is a company that believes in the family life work balance. There are no sales goals to reach, the only requirement is coming to work and providing exceptional customer service to customers over the phone."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's a lot, it had a lot of good employees that were helpful if you needed it, great managers, and a fun job to help customers"
good,"fast paced"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great opportunity to gain experience and work a lot of hours! Flexible and friendly working environment and easy to switch shifts
good,"I'm incredibly grateful for Kohls' mass hiring for seasonal jobs. It's very hard to get a job with no previous work experience, especially in retail. Working around the holidays allowed me to keep very busy, and it forced me to learn the job as quickly as possible. The hardest part of the job was keeping composure around completely uncooperative customers. However; once you learn how to deal with that, it becomes very easy to do. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers. All of my co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. All in all, it's a great first job to have."
good,Being a cashier really helped boost my self confidence and help me be more out going. It increased my knowledge of the store product as well as the people who shop there.
good,The management was great. The only bad thing I could say is that they barely gave you hours. Other then that everyone was nice and friendly and really made you feel at home.
good,"The team I worked with got along relatively well. A lot to focus on and sometimes I felt the managers expectations were sometimes too high. It is a job where you learn how to do everything and know a lot about everything. Sometimes you work until 12 am and have long shifts. But I never was bored and my shifts just flew by. I believe Kohl's is a great place to work, it was stressful at times though."
good,everyone that worked on the floor was nice and we all could work together but the Management is awful. they are all mean and don't care about anything that goes on with their employees
good,"Work there for years. hour unstable. customers great. good discounts, but medical benefits are lacking. lots of communication issues."
good,"Being Point of Sale I did everything customer service besides returns to the store. I cashiered, did exchanges, stock by the register, and in store payments."
good,"I hate standing or sitting around bored, so Kohl's was great as there is always something to do and no one just stands around chatting. They are very strict about taking breaks, which seems overboard, but i suppose they need to follow laws to protect themselves as well as their employees. The employee discounts for merchandise was very nice, and the lounge is nice with a TV, vending machines, and plenty of seating. "
good,"My day to day work at Kohls is easy, I don't feel myself being challenged. I enjoy the relationships I've built with my co-workers. My favorite part about this job is the volunteer opportunity. I like to make a difference in people's lives and believe  I do that when I volunteer. Its the most rewarding experience about being there. The hardest part of my job is the requirement to solicit credit. Often times this is not what people try to hear from me. I do try to make each customer feel special and make a connection with them."
good,A typical day at work was fun for me. I enjoyed all my customers and i even had regulars that would only go thru my line. My co workers were very helpful and effective when the lines became long and we needed backup someone was always up there in a timely manner.
good,"I was a seasonal employee here. It was my first retail job and although the management was nice, the coworkers that trained me weren't so nice and were actually rude to me. They barely gave me any hours and as soon as the season was over they slowly started telling people that were seasonal that they weren't going to be kept."
good,"Good place to work if being in sales is your thing. You have to be very flexible, willing to try different departments and having open availability is extremely helpful.  They do have pot lucks and a holiday party, and jean days sometimes."
good,I enjoyed the job a lot it was one of my best job experiences far as warehouses goes I enjoyed my hours and I absolutely loved the fact that they let us listen to music on the job.
good,"I loved working for the company, great people and productivity. Always busy and fun, lots of ways to move up in company. I wouldn't mind to go back and work this company again."
good,Working here gave me a different view on life. this job show me the independent side of me and help me become who I am today. some days  were hard and some days were easy. overall its a really nice place and I would recommend this to anyone who is new to employment.
good,Kohl's is a fun and face pace environment. Though you have to have patience when dealing with unruly and impatient customers.
good,"Typical day at work is keeping sales floor clean attending customers, answering phones good attitude and customer service overall. Learned good customer service. overall its a good environment, good co workers."
good,"Me and my team used to have fun in office and even work on time, but one day we really had fun when my manager was in leave and we dint have lot work to do the whole day our team had a great chitchat in office which was a good memory to me"
good,"Maintains supplies inventory by checking stock to determine inventory level; anticipating need supplies"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This is a great company to work for. Theres so many different opportunities that you can do here. Theres so many different people here. This is deffinatly a cool place to meet new people.
good,"It was nice work place but unfortunately there was too much work for little pay. I enjoyed the fact that it was a diverse environment, I got a chance to connect with other people. The  hours were not as flexible as I needed them to be considering I am also a student."
good,This is a typical retail job. Of course there are things you dont like on every job. But this is a pretty decent job. They spend a lot of time showing you how ton do things properly.
good,I worked AD Set.  I was surrounded by people who were both willing to give help as well as asking for it.  This attitude ensured that the everyone's job was completed satisfactorily.
good,The managers are great and so are they're employees. You have a few days throughout the year where you get really good discounts off items that usually exclude discounts.
good,"I actually had a lot of fun where I worked. It was always busy because it was during the holiday season. The management team was on top of things and they are good managers. I had plenty of hours and I felt appreciated even the short amount of time I worked there. I know they were interested in hiring me full time, but I was planning to move anyway."
good,"It was like everyone was one big family. "
good,"A typical day was greeting and helping customers, replenishing the merchandise, and cleaning up the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such great people."
good,"Supportive management, great environment with talent associates. It is geared towards letting you learn and grow in your job. Co-workers are wonderful and working with them is always a pleasure."
good,Fast paced work place with supportive management. Coworkers are fun and friendly. Management found new ways to keep associates engaged and occupied. Numbers are important to get but not entirely as long as associates are happy.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you have the right team behind closed doors. People were great to work with, very friendly. Being retail, the pay is poor but they do offer benefits."
good,"how to use a Palm Pilot, and do inventory and stocking, management was pretty decent but alittle unorganized. hardest part of the job was probably during the holiday days. and the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with all of the customers."
good,"Fast paced, great co workers, fun place to work. The management team is good, flexible start times.  Plenty of heavy lifting.  No room to move up the food chain though."
good,If you looking for something part time kohls would be a good job.The discount for associates are the best hands down and it was party much a lot of friendly people
good,"I learned so much about customer service, how to communicate with them and find each ones needs and what they are looking for. great place to work when you are a full time student."
good,"Very nice company,there were many great managers on the team that really made sure that the customer satisfaction gurantee was upheld and that their workers were also happy."
good,"I worked for this company for 7 years, I really enjoyed it until my hours started getting cut because they base cashier hours off of how many credit apps you get. I learned a lot from this job, such as customer service, how to unload a truck, merchandise, sales, how to make payments, etc. Most of my co workers were amazing, the hardest part of this job was dealing with some of the customers as company policies started changing."
good,"I get to work clock in then go to cash office to count register bags and balance the safe,  When done I run reports for the managers.  I then go though the store and pull merchandise that customers have purchased that they need to have shipped to them,  I then take merchandise and pack it to be sent through UPS, I then run reports for the following day."
good,Drive a stand up cherry picker to load packages to be loaded on to a conveyor and then shipped.  Use a scanner to locate and scan packages.  Productivity is measured on a goal basis.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Good people"
good,Great place to work except hours are completely all over the place and sometimes I rarely get hours. If was was given more hours to work I would be ok but since I rarely work I cant sustain myself with such little amount. They keep hiring new people and somehow they receive more hours than I do. I should have seniority over them. Other than that I would recommend it to a starting off teen.
good,"I loved my job at the beginning, but now, things are changing all of a sudden. My job is half way gone, and we are kind of feeling a lost. I felt like I had job security, now, not so much. Besides this recent change, it was a great place to work. I loved what I did and enjoyed staying busy and helping others. My co-workers are great people and I get along with everyone."
good,"Management was helpful, the pay was however, very low for the amount of work. The hardest part was standing in the same place for hours on end. The most enjoyable part was work working with co-workers."
good,great company to work for. they the bomb. so super duper friendly. had a blast. recommend it to all. great company benefits
good,Kohl's is overall great work place. The hardest part of my job is being  stuck to phone all day. I like working with  my co-workers on daily.  The most enjoyable part is the end of the work day.
good,"My typical day at work was interacting with customers, which I enjoyed. Management was always there for assistance. Soliciting Kohls charge card was a bit hard."
good,My work at khols has been a good experience over all the staff there are friendly and willing to help in any way they can. The managers are friendly and willing to help in small tasks as well as large ones however the lack of hours is disconcerting despite my avaliblity
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, especially for a first job.  It is collaborative, team oriented and, of course, people driven.  The only down side is that they rarely provide enough supports on the sales floor to accomplish all of the necessary tasks in the time frame they estimate.  Moreover, the managers aren't always as in tune with the general balance of the floor."
good,"I love helping people/ customers, so I guess the most enjoyable part of my day would be, finding whatever it is that they are looking for."
good,"Kohls was good place to work. I enjoyed retail and the rest of the people were great. Although only seasonal, I saw a lot of the business including the warehouse."
good,"I learned to communicate better with customers.  My co-workers and management  were the best to work with.  They were so friendly and made work feel like a ""family affair"" rather than work.  We were given a lot of flexibility for hours but sometimes there just weren't enough hours.  The hardest part of the job was being on my feet on concrete floors.  I enjoyed coming to work to see everyone and be able to help customers."
good,"to start the shift in a start up meeting, assignment is posted equipment checked, that's rge start uf the day"
good,Kohl's is a very busy department store.  It was generally a fun place to work and the employees were co-operative as well as management. I learned how to multi-task and be creative.
good,"oversee all store operations,always something to do, advancement  opportunities are available if your willing to relocate"
good,I was there to help unload the truck. Hang up merchandise on racks. More of the soft lines than anything else. I got hired in just on a temp basis then when it came time to be done I was never let go of. However I was usually working 1-3 days. Not because that's all I could work but because that's all they scheduled me for. I was always considered part time anything with 39 hours or under they were alright with. The most hours I got was during Thanksgiving.
good,"Kohls consisted of a variety of customers. It was never a dull moment but when help was needed, it was there. Although there was plenty of help, the store was mainly busy. Most of the time, one teaches themselves instead of getting a full training. Id offer customers our Rewards program and our Credit Card. Id explain how much they can save. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. The store was organized and it was great at recognition."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Busy store, some room for growth and work with great associates. This is a demanding job and requires a lot of physical work. I have learned that keeping quiet at times is the most beneficial for the company. While I don't agree with the way they just give the customers what they want, I understand that they do it so they keep coming back. The associates are the best people to work with and the management is okay in this store.The most enjoyable part of the day is making someone smile."
good,"Focus is on production; eye - hand coordination comes in handy.  Not for the faint of heart as you will work in shipping as a newcomer.  Very interesting and challenging, but hard work.  Expect bumps and a lot of bruises.  Kohl's implements fun activities and contests, periodically, to help maintain employee satisfaction."
good,"The best department to work for in Kohl's is Loss Prevention. Training is good, but could use some improvement. Definitely, out of all of the other retailers, Kohl's has the best LP department."
good,"didn't have to many people working so it was hard to be able to get others to cover shifts if needed. managers where beyond awesome long as you tell them what was going on and kept them updated, I learned quiet a bit there. always new people has a few customers come back to just ask for you for their help."
good,I loved working at Kohl's Call Center. There were days when the calls can get a little tough but the satisaction of knowing that your helping the customers is enough to overcome those days. The people are great and so are the managers.
good,"Working at Kohl's was a lot of fun and I liked the work I did there. the people I worked with were great, the work is easy and you stay busy."
good,Good customer service experience.  Worked lots of nights & weekends & long holiday hrs.  Worked in all departments during my 6yrs of employment.
good,"I spent most of my time there as a cashier. I learned a lot about cashiering. More specifically, I learned about all the possible operations cashiers are responsible for such as registering new credit card members. The management there was great. They maintained leadership as well as willing to help the cashiers and they were easy to talk too. It was good working with co-workers as well. The only part about the job that had some difficulty to it was obtaining hours. There was always competition for hours between cashiers. The competition for hours seemed subtle but it wasn't and it was definitely there. The most enjoyable part of the job was the positive attitudes in the work environment."
good,"I like working for this company due to great team work, great management, & great advanced opportunities. the management gives good incentives and acknowledges and praises great work"
good,"I learned more about retail, how to associate and help customers with their needs. Was able to keep work on fast pace environment. Friendly co-workers that were nice to be around and can work with. Hardest part about the job is remember where everything is throughout the store even after moving materials around. I enjoy most about the job is doing team work with the co-workers and helping nice customers."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work with an extensive history. I have learned how to do so much in a short period of time thanks the help of my co-workers always helping. The hardest part of the job has to be the standing and walking for something 12 hours straight. From time to time the management forgets to give you a break or there are not enough people on the shift to relieve you. Overall kohl's has been good to me and the people who work there make it worth while.
good,"Weekends and holidays are the craziest times to work at Kohl's but the busy days are the most rewarding. I've learned patience, diligence, and to really work hard when the going gets tough. The management staff is very engaging and focused on bettering not only the company but the employees. My coworkers are all generally lovely people, which is important in a business that is so customer service oriented."
good,"Kohls is very busy with a diversified group of shoppers."
good,"Its disheartening when a company only cares about getting credit cards. On my first day (orientation) they asked us to sign up for a Kohls Charge Card. WHAT?? All they care about is getting credit, instead of actually attending to the customers. Dressing room duty is the worst. If you thought picking up after your husband or kids was bad, what until you work there. All you do is clean up other peoples clothes."
good,"I was hired by Kohls in Meyerland on August 2011 before the grand openning. I learned some new things a few months after the grand opening. Some are difficult customer complaints, operating its register, and changing prices. Management there is some what mean-kind-of-friendish. They try real hard to organize the store as perfectly as they can. Co-workers come and leave due to lack of hours and the limited selection of items and management is sometimes strict. The hardest part of the job is handling what customers want. The store is small means they don't have alot of merchandise in stock than other branches. the most enjoyable part of the is help customers as you can with a smile."
good,"Since I worked a seasonal position, a typical day was very busy and it was hard to be unstressed. I learned how to quickly use a cash register, count money, solve problems and learn the lay out of the store. Management really fluctuated; everyone had their good and bad days so it all depends on if you want to hold a grudge. But when it was hard to get a straight answer out of the managers when you had a question so you really had to word your questions correctly. "
good,It was a good job but we were not paid very well compared to other large companies in the area that were doing similar work.  That always led to turnover en-mass...  Aside from the thanklessness of some of the jobs you have to fulfill its not really a bad gig if your looking for a job.
good,"My day includes picking up clothes, organizing the floor and helping customers find what they need. Don't really interact here I just go in and work my hours."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"In working as a Loss Prevention Associate for Kohls Distribution Center EFC2, it has been a very effective work experience in learning new things everyday. The warehouse is kept very well organized and efficient in the way the production throughout the warehouse is mannered. As a Loss Prevention Associate we are required to watch our own associates throughout the warehouse for company misconduct. Including: theft, time fraud, merchandise altering, etc. Loss Prevention specifically focuses on the loss of wages throughout the warehouse from its own associates through video surveillance, auditing of merchandise being sent out, and monitoring incoming of freight to the warehouse from other corporations. "
good,Unload the Trucks and stock the Inventory. Make sure all the shelf's were stocked. Clean up around the store take back Return Items.
good,"I enjoy working with customers and in the retail environment. Assisting  customers and  helping team members assist as needed. "
good,"The environment is a good place but when they can't hire enough people to keep the store clean it turns customers away. However then they hire to many holiday employees and will not give sufficient hours to those employees. There is a lot to learn about their promotions and rewards, some management think you need to know it all, but they just need to be understanding and help. Anyways mostly everything else about Kohl's was great and they care about family and try to work with you if you have family emergencies."
good,A typical day ranges from 5-8 hours a day.  I learned how to maximize my time and maintain steady hours in a part-time position.  The management is satisfactory.  The co-workers are great and range in different ages from different demographics.  The hardest part is in maintaining steady hours in a competitive place for hours and time.  The enjoyable part is keeping consumers happy.
good,The work environment was great made you want to strive to take care of the customers and take care of them made me become an great customer service representative overall
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. Working at Kohl's has taught me so much. I have learned to come out of my shell and talk to people. My co-workers at Kohl's are absolutely amazing. We are a team and we all work as such.
good,"Seasonal hire"
good,We shelve items to be shipped out of distribution center. I have gained a lot of leardership skills because they gave me duties of a lead or problem solver. The job is really not hard and i enjoyed leading my team and the learning aspect of it.
good,"The day  usually starts out with opening up customer service area first, than getting all"
good,"Typical day was checking out at the cash registers. "
good,fun and energetic friendly co-workers. management are cool individuals
good,"The best part about working at Kohl's is that no matter the manager (I have been through like 5 different ones at my store), They all work with my schedule.  They do recognize hard work, which always makes us employees happy. Finally, It would be wrong to say that Kohl's does not experience their share of ""retail problems"" like angry customers."
good,"*Clock in, get the freezer suits on, and start unloading the trucks with all the remaing product, 5:00 pm break, do shelf replenishments, help 3rd shift build pallets."
good,"All covered in resume."
good,"It was just an alright place to work."
good,* I do my best to help customers with our Great technique & my knowledge of jewelry.
good,Working at Kohls has been great and rewarding experience for me.I have obtained great supervisor and managment skills.
good,Awesome team. motivating leaders. Great customer satisfaction policy.
good,Great first job and weening your way into the work force... Advancement is hard but is an enjoyable place to work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I learned a lot in my time with Kohl's. Definitely one of the less stressful places I have worked at. The customers are great and your co-workers make you feel at home!
good,". As a cashier I handle the daily deposits for  the branch in City of Industry. I use a coin/ cash counter in my daily routine. At the end of the day, I balance the branch vault and prepare the cash/ coin for pick the next morning."
good,i didnt work here long but it was a nice job to get right out of high school. all i did was help customers and clean out dressing rooms. i also cleaned all the clothing departments before the store closed.
good,"Clock in get my assignment and unload as many trailers as I can. I learned how to count and document inventory, computer work, and read what we can put in the doors to work. Most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of the production accomplished each day."
good,"Very fast paced, I learned to deal with difficult situations during my time in customer service."
good,A typical night began with unloading trailers of merchandise then sorting out to departments and stocking. My co-workers were all good people and fun to work with! The hardest part of the job was maybe the unloading of trucks by hand but not too bad
good,I learned most if not all my customer service skills. In this setting you have to work as a team to accomplish the goals of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet through out the day. The customers really make that job and knowing that they are highly satisfied makes the job work while.
good,This company has grown since it's establishment in the retail business.
good,"I was only seasonal but I did enjoy working here, I always had something to do to keep me busy throughout my shift, the people I worked with were decent. There were some slow days where there wasn't that many customers then other days it was busy and I was running all over. The hardest part of the job was probably the constant walking back and forth due to my area being a good size and walking to the back to check for items, but it wasn't to bad. I enjoyed being able to help the customers find what they were looking for."
good,"It was not a bad job, but I needed to do something full time. For only being minimum wage, the work was very demanding."
good,"Kohl's is a very customer-driven business.  Our motto is ""Yes We Can"" and our main priority is to create the absolute best customer service ever.  They work really well with schedule changes, time off, etc. if needed.  There are opportunities within the company that occasionally arise.  Policies and the way to handle certain things often varies from store to store, and sometimes from manager to manager or associate to associate within the same store.  It is a company where one can shine, but it is definitely a team environment.  To succeed, one must be onboard with the team."
good,"A demanding job which required me to search for answers and learn on my own.  Was able to advance my position multiple times and was the go to guy for any questions about freight, RF units, and anything else really."
good,"I would recommend Kohl's to anybody seeking entry-level retail work. The compensation is as would be expected (minimum wage), but the environment and management more than made-up for it in my opinion. I had a great experience there during the holiday rush. The computer systems were easy to use/extremely user friendly. You're given a lot of flexibility in regards to what you can do for customers (discounts, rewards, pricing changes, etc.) and that usually results in a happier customer, which in turn results in a less stressful cashiering experience. As long as you take care of the tasks you're given in your department, you'll find the management to be friendly, helpful and accessible. I personally was most impressed at how often the management would be helping with folding in departments, hopping on registers when there was a flood of customers, keeping the store tidy, etc. Definitely not the kind of managers that feel they are above the tasks given to the associates."
good,"work every day was pretty easy, I learned a lot about jewelry, management was fairly decent, hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers but I loved helping people and feeling accomplished."
good,"Worked here for just about 4 years, some of the managers where nice. Working holidays here was horrible, very late nights and the store would be a disaster!"
good,"Being in the jewelry department was awesome. Not only did you learn about different types of jewelry/watches. You learned to fix a watch, clarity of a diamond. Origins of certain piece and the history behind the makers of a certain brand. I learned so much that I still to this day continue to use that knowledge on any purchases of jewelry I make or to fix a watch."
good,"A typical day at Kohls includes : picking up clothes from the floor and removing clothes flung on random fixtures and hanging them up, clearing fitting rooms, folding clothes on display tables, returning merchandise to the floor from customer service, unloading truck/merchandising, price changes, being placed wherever you are needed several times throughout the day before having the chance to finish a task. "
good,"A typical day at work, I would go in and clean out the women's fitting room, and then I would pick an area of my department to detail clean. I would assist customers in finding items. I learned a lot about merchandising a department. Keeping on top of the women's fitting room is hard because it is the busiest area of the store, and they usually didn't give me a lot of extra hands to help. I enjoy helping customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"Quick due to constant work"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Fun coworker. busy on the weekend. Good management. Meet customer
good,"A typical day at work would be organizing the shoes on the floor, assissting customers find something they were looking for, and operating the cash register when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers find shoes because I love shoes and a good fit is important for everyone. The hardest part of my job was knowing that it was temporary when I need something permanent."
good,it was fun in the beginning but the pressure of opening credit cards wasnt fun at all.
good,"In at 5 in the morning, immediately get to offloading truck. I learned how to quickly and efficiently offload truck to meet truck time. Coworkers were a delight to work with, knew how to joke while still get work done safely. There really wasn't a part of the job I found to be difficult. I overall enjoyed working at Kohl's"
good,"A typical day was greeting customers, answering calls from customers and assisting them over the phone, restocking merchandise, and register back up."
good,"Hard working people that are easy to get along with. Always stayed busy which I love, makes the day go by. Management stayed on their job which made my days easier. I enjoyed talking to customer and helping them."
good,"Within this position I quickly learned how to provide excellent customer service and how to work well among both superiors and coworkers. The hardest part of the job was ensuring that I controlled any frustrations with coworkers or customers and always remained understanding, tactful, and diplomatic. It was enjoyable to work among so many great people and to provide excellent customer service to them, which I found rewarding."
good,I would get to the store at 6 am and get things going with unloading the trucks or setting up the sales floor.  I did like being off work by 1 pm and having a family life.
good,"Kohl's is a great stepping stone for young people looking to add to their resume.  I've worked with a lot of great people over the past three years I've been with the company, and I've also learned quite a bit as well.  "
good,I loved being a cashier because I met people and helped them make their shopping experience delightful. I liked getting a bonus for selling Kohls charge cards to customers and letting them know the advantages of having a Kohls charge card.
good,"I typically answer the phone and transfer calls or answer any questions I can. I process returns and payments. I also check the merchandise to see if it is suitable to go back out on the floor or if it needs to be damaged. I work closely with other associates and members of management, we all do our best to make it a great work environment. I enjoy helping customers, sometimes they just want to stay a few extra minutes and talk, it is nice to get to know them a little better most of them are regulars. It can be challenging at work when we are short staffed and it is very busy, I do my best to quickly and efficiently help each customer."
good,Overall I enjoyed being apart of the Kohl's Corporation.It was a very fast paced environment. You were always surrounded by others and there was always something to be done. The co-workers were great. The Management was ok. The hardest part about my job there was being understaffed sometimes but the best part of my job was helping to make unhappy customers happy  and knowing I had a part in their happiness.
good,Kohl's has a great environment depending on which store you work at and your management. The store I was employed at I felt that I was able to learn how to work in retail however I felt that there was not a lot of communication on the management part on what could be done better as I worked.
good,I loved working here. The management was very consider of my work schedule considering I was attending college and working a second job as well. I was a cashier and floor associate so I did learn how to operate the kiosk and several merchandising techinques. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful.
good,"The management and co-workers were great"
good,"Kohl's cross trained us for the first 5 months of employment in every job situation. I have a vast knowledge of beginning to end of receiving, storing, picking, and shipping. Thank You for the education. "
good,"it was a productive place to work, you was always on the move and always had something to do. Had friendly customers and coworkers and mangers were always there to lend a helping hand if you needed it. it was face paced work environment and you learned something new everyday"
good,"I was hired at Kohl’s as part of the Operations/ Freight Team after leaving The Home Depot, while the new Kohl’s store was being built. Duties during this time period included setting up new store fixtures and displays for merchandise as well as setting up our stockroom for merchandise to be back stocked into. After the store was opened, I was also placed out on the floor for customer service and merchandise execution when I was not needed in the stockroom. Duties in the stockroom include, pushing merchandise to the floor as replenishment and unloading trailers sent with new merchandise."
good,"Typical day is cleaning area and assisting customers. I've learned how to work on their registers, and how to search for items in the system. The management was good there. Co-workers were too. The hardest part of the job was, sometimes trying to get everything cleaned before closing. The most enjoyable part was working on the floor."
good,"While working at Kohl's I gained more customer service experience, I learned how to deal with customers. The most enjoyable part about being a point of sale associate is getting to meet different people everyday,"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working with customers, but I don't get enough of an opportunity to do so because of poor hours."
good,"I learned how some retailers unpack and stock their merchandise, as well as inventory procedures for surplus goods."
good,"good work, good management and benefits, hire alot of holiday help"
good,"fast paced, learned to multi-task, good management, very family oriented."
good,"The one thing I was looking forward to, when going to work was just meeting all the different customers that would come to my register. they always made my day for some reason. I love meeting new people, even if its for a second."
good,"Custom support, help people with there DSL service working with puc, verzion and the tech was a good days work making every one happy"

good,I moved up fast and had a lot of growth opportunities which helped me move forward.
good,Loved the people I worked with! There is something about knowing you helped someone find what they are looking for! They wanted you to work all the time and didnt want you to have a life outside of work.
good,"Sufficient workplace, well managed I knew the specificity and all details of my job, was well trained and given opportunities to grow my talents in the workplace, hard work but well payed for the job and co workers were supportive, hardest part making department transitions but I managed well enough, easiest part communicating for every and all questions there were answers to a problem"
good,"Clock in see where we are at on sales and credit and rewards (Email or prior manger).

good,Easy job but you get no shifts when your trying to get shifts with another 100 people trying to get a shift with 7 openings
good,"As a Loss Prevention Associate my duties include: Operating the cameras to observe suspicious customer behavior pertaining to shoplifting and store thief, apprehending when necessary."
good,"Job duties vary based on whether you work in a department or strictly as a cashier, but all employees may need to hop on registers to help out when the store is busy. I learned about customer service, money-handling, and working in a department. I started as a cashier, but later worked in the misses, mens, and juniors departments restocking, rotating product, cleaning out dressing rooms, and helping customers with general and specific requests. Management was pleasant to work with and help promote the spirit of being on a team. Co-workers were also pleasant and knowledgeable about their job. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with job duties when the store was busy, especially around the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job (for me) was working in a department because I had more freedom to move around and could always find something to do to stay productive."
good,Same cashier job....different store nothing extraordianry
good,"I really liked kohl's! there was alot of great people who worked there, and when I was there we opened the store, but after we opened they started to accuse people of stealing, And I mean people who would NEVER steal. i thin they just over hired and expected more people to quit, either way it was definitely a downer..  "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Help customers check out and help with the cleaning and appearance of the store. I learned how to set up a store and how to better serve customers. Management was easy to work with. co-workers were fun to be around. the hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 6 to 8 hours a day. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers as they came through the line
good,"typical day varies in retail, learned alot about people. good place to work.. other employees like as well.  "
good,There is always something to do to keep busy at kohls whether its organizing the store to helping customers on the sales floor or checking customers out at the registers. The people who work there are all great and friendly.
good,"A typical day at work was to come in and clock in on time, then go down to assigned work department where current supervisor would tell you where you were needed throughout the workday, then clock out."
good,"Working at Kohl's is not for everyone. It all depends on who your managers are if they like you, you will succeed and if they do not the chances of a promotion just got harder. I enjoyed the work and the customers. The pay is minimum wage and part time. I had a great Assistant Manager who looked after me and gave me my promotion as an Interim Shoe Supervisor. After my tenure ended I left since I would have gone back to part-time and I needed a full-time job."
good,"Always a busy day, learned to assist customers in a more productive way, management was large but forceful. Co-workers were hard working and enjoyable, always enjoyed working with them, never a dull moment."
good,"When I was first hired at kohl's, it was a fun and friendly workplace. The associates are amazing people to work with and the management team was very organized and cared about their employees. Most of our customers are regulars and is a joy to help. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and meeting new people daily."
good,The management made me feel very comfortable and I love working for the company
good,Helping customers bring their accounts current durning difficult times. Everyone was great to work with.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls. I learned a lot about working in retail and working with the public. I had great co-workers; we all got a long pretty well and I enjoyed the management. The management was always understanding and helpful and easy to get along with. The best part about working at Kohls was be able to volunteer to help with Kohls' charity events and working for a company that cared enough to have and participate in charity events and that donated contributaions. If it wasn't for moving out of the area I would not have left Kohls.
good,A very fast paced job. Very rewarding in the customer service end. Need to be a very good multi-tasker and be able to pick up on various positions within the company to be effective.
good,In a typical day I can work anywhere from on the dock doing physical work to running a register. All of the associates and managers work and act like a workplace family. I enjoy everyone that I would with and is very diverse from young to old.
good,-The hours were very low for the mileage driven
good,All the management was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately I was only hired as seasonal help so I was not able to stay with the company longer.
good,It was a pretty nice place to work however there are a lot of lay offs.
good,Gives great hours to work with. They also give great vaction time.
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for. My day includes merchandising and putting out freight, making sure my department is clean and organized, and supervising any others working in my department. The best part is that everyone works together to make sure things get done. It's not always easy to get everything you want to get done accomplished in one day, but the challenge is part of the fun."
good,"Every place has those people you can't stand but for the most part I love the people I work with. I have a couple GREAT managers that make me want to come in to work and help out. The bar is very low when it comes to who they hire and the don't fix issues that arise which makes me sometimes wonder how or store functions. Some weeks they give you a ton of hours and the next you may have four. It is not very consistent. Kohl's seems to be a pretty decent company to work for and they keep growing unlike other stores that are closing stores, we are opening more."
good,"some days are easy, but the days when we have to replenish is difficult because the store is open at the same time and we also have to deal with the customers' questions and/or concerns."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I walkin and make the customers smile by talking to them mainly the elders that are there clock in sometime early if they needed help. I learn manager skill and duties and how to be a leader of my co worker. My co-worker enjoy working for me cause I am the type of leadr that would do the work myself this is call lead by example.
good,I love leading by example to bring associates to their highest potentials. Guiding and teaching new associates the ropes and also helping them reach their goals and our expectations of them. I feel you have to make the work environment fun but yet professional. This builds great moral and aslo great productivity. Team work is very important to me.
good,"My days were hard but fun. I learned quite abit about people in general (wants, needs,), how to relax a customer. Management helped you to reach your bestest, along with cookout days for the emplyees. The team of people I worked with was always willing to help. What I liked best was the customers."
good,"I learned how to do many different things because they were going through a remodel at the time so i was able to help with things all over the store, the environment as well as the people helped the day go by faster. I enjoyed learning something new every day, but I didn't like the lack of direction."
good,"Your day began at khols when you got back recovery, you place that where it goes and begin helping customers, when given the chance i would stock shelves and clean. It was also expected of you to help at POS whenever needed."
good,Loved getting to know customers and the different challenges that could come up each day
good,good benefits and co-workers. Management could have been better.
good,Would for the most part give you as many hours as requested but at times there were not many hours at all.
good,"This job was seasonal, but it was still a lot of fun. Compared to the ones that followed after it- wasnt really something to go home and brag about to anyone, but experience is experience!"
good,Love working for kolhs im able to interact with customers everyday. The tasks that has to be completed at work is making sure the truck is unloaded and everything from off the tuck is on the floor. I also work the register sometimes while standing on my feet for long periods of time
good,"Working in customer service was a nice way to get tons of experience. You would answer phones, get change for registers, process damages, and process returns, exchanges, sales, etc Working the sales floor you are able to help customers find an item they are looking for. Also working a register at the check out lanes and/or jewelry as back-up when needed. I learned to be patient as everyone has a different situation needing help. I learned to help out other associates when needed. Management was friendly and, for the most part, fair. Co workers were very friendly and helpful all the times. They make Kohls an enjoyable place to work."
good,8 hours
good,"The management teams work very well together. My team of ad set workers moved together very smoothly, so the job didn't seem hard at all. The hardest part was the overnight assignments; the adjustment of hours of the shift is what got me the most! If you're not accustomed to being up all night, it can be a hard shift."
good,I liked working there it was always busy and there was plenty of work to keep me busy.
good,the people are most exciting the management is slowly improving
good,"Day started with over view of dept to make sure items were in place for sales, make sure associated completed job list from night before."
good,Customers are there foundation for success and this has reflected in my customer service skills in all other jobs. A smile says a lot to any one and I practice this yet today. Relocation was not possible to advance myself with this company.
good,its a busy place to work. I like interacting with the customers daily.
good,Managment could use more structure to many posistions that tell you different things no set leaders
good,"My days at Kohl's were always very good ones, Kohl's is a great place to work. It is not a great place for advancement. If you are happy staying in the position that you have then you will be happy at kohl's. If you want to advance, as I did, then Kohl's is not the place for you. Give my age and my experience and my work ethic I should have advanced, but the managers at Kohl's hold you back especially if you have good work ethics."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The customer service is great and the work enviorment is productive and very clean
good,"i did returns and exchanges, issued money to floor registers, responsible for palm pilots, answered phones, issue job applications and credit applications, refund and adjustments. I scanned and did returns on defective merchandise to be sent back, counted down 3 drawers at the end of my shift, if i closed i had to make sure all money bags and any keys, palm pilots were accounted for."
good,Kohls is a great company to work for but it no longer was comptatible with the events that were taking place in my life. The work life balance was not suitable for my family.
good,"I worked many different departments in this company. I worked Register, Customer Service, Misses, Mens, Juniors, Jewerly. Normally worked register, handeled money and customer service up front."
good,I would check all the fitting rooms see if everything is clear out for the customers.Check to see if there any returns items that need to put back on the floor for repurchasing. Management need to work on agree on everything they need us to do. I love my co-workers they were great working with. Is seen my co-workers everyday and doing the truck also trying to keep my area clean.
good,This is a great job to meet new people and learn more about humanity.
good,"restock and organize clothing, bed, shoes, furniture, which ever department you are working in. Run Register. Open any new packaging in back stock."
good,"A really enjoyable job. It gets a little hectic during the sales because so many people come out, but is otherwise very professional, and lively."
good,It's an okay place to work. It's changelling. Very busy. They more than two people working in certain departments
good,"if you need hours they will give them to you. also if you need an advance on your pay they'll give it to you. they understand if you have school or a family, and they're willing to work around our schedule."
good,"Kohl's Department Stores is a fair company to work for in terms of employee benefits and values. However, their starting pay is low and the opportunity for advancement is narrow. As a floor associate (all employees underneath a supervising position), be prepared to often be asked to work in a department other than that which you were hired. On a positive note, one thing I appreciate is that associate breaks and lunches are consistently given no matter how busy the store is on any given day, i.e.- If you ask, you are guaranteed to have a break during your shift."
good,"Working here allowed me to develop more intense retail experience with handling replenishment and customers. However, I didn't like being hounded or having to go through unpleasant means to simply change my availability."
good,Being a cashier was fun but also things to learn. While working at kohl’s I learned how to manage my time while cleaning my department and learning how to interact with customers.
good,The management sometime had issues with communication but overall was a good employment opportunity. There was a lot of room for advancement. It was a friendly fast paced environment.
good,"At times, the store was great to work at when working with customer satisfaction.  The store manager might need to have some practical employee/management training to help her in working better with her employees and giving them support; thereby, eliminating employee turnover."
good,They treat you very well. I can’t complain about anything really except that they don’t always listen to you if you have a real complaint about an associate.
good,"The overall work environment was comfortable and training was done very thoroughly.  The fellow employees were nice and everyone was helpful.  The management team were great, especially the Store Manager who would assist with any job duty and had an open door policy."
good,"It was an experience I both enjoyed and felt frustrated over. The interview process need to explain their point system to the new employees. There was much confusion on how much a person a seasonal, part-time, and full-time would get. They give a packet but do not explain it. Thus many people were fired over the number of points they received, without knowing when they received them. This is a flawed system, and needs to be remedied. The work is fast paced and the rewards from the team is worth it."
good,"I applied at Kohl's because of the employee discount,the flexible schedule and the proximity to my home. While working there I found out the employees were helpful the management was supportive"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"i am able to work around school and work with the days i need off, Benefits are good and everyone is friendly, i feel accepted and have made relationships with my coworkers, everyone communicates well with one another and all work together as a team"
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee. I worked from October through the beginning of January. It was only $10 per hour but there was some flexibility in scheduling. It was pleasant enough. Be prepared to be overwhelmed at Christmas time though.
good,"I loved working at this location. There was a clear sense of community and the managers were great at their job. there was very rarely a communication error and everyday was productive. That does end as soon as you leave or the decide they no longer want you, though. I never actually received any notification that my seasonal position had ended and that they had no intentions of keeping me on permanently, they just locked me out of the system and I had to call to ask why."
good,"If you work really hard you will get promoted,  but the raise honestly isn't worth the workload and the headache managers will give you. The managers butt heads and there is no communication  between them. When manager A is gone, Manager B will make you undo everything manager A had you do.  It's back and forth.  I'm sure other stores are different. I was really happy here for about 6 months until  everyone started being dramatic all the time."
good,Kohl's isn't a bad place to work. Their scheduling is pretty flexible except for around holidays. The management isn't the best. But overall it's not a bad part-time job.
good,I process Kohl's and Amazon returns as well as facilitate online order pickups.  Reticketing  and marking down merchandise according to system standards.
good,It was a very good job and it kept me busy. The best days at work were on Saturdays because the day was busy and a lot of important work got done. All the people were nice at my job.
good,It was just a seasonal job but I really liked it. The employees were nice and helpful. learned something new every day. Loading trucks was probably the hardest thing. All in all good place to work
good,Worked here for 4 years and enjoyed it! Your coworkers become friends and some become family. It’s a forever changing environment but it’s okay. As with any management it’s all business and if they don’t like you...you not going far within the company but if they do well GREAT!
good,"Well, don't miss days. For any reason. If you miss 2 days, you're out. The managers are cool. Well, the store manager and the truck manager are cool. The others are picky. Just don't step out of line"
good,"Met a lot of great people , there were great discounts and it was a great first job experience , would recommend for those looking for a first job. It was a good environment , managers helped often with any inconvenience ."
good,"If you are looking for a nice part time job, Kohl’s is the place to work. The hours are flexible and it’s an easily place to work. The discount is also nice"
good,enjoyed the work and the people. My supervisor liked my work and trained me to restock. he sent me to different areas to help other people becuse he knew it would get gone. liked the bonus i got working 50 hours per week during peak hours.
good,Plenty of overtime during their seasonal employment. Very easy to complete interview with on-site drug testing. Choose your  guaranteed  2 days off per week. Incentive programs throughout the season.
good,"Independence and time management is what I learned most from the company. There's always culture within each store whether it be good or bad. If you're not paying too much attention, it won't bother you. However as you dive in there may be favoritism in the workplace. Keep on eye on that. Pay could be better."
good,"It's everything you expect from a retail job. Handling money, greeting and providing guests with customer service, and making sure you leave a great impression. Some days are hit or miss with how busy it may get; however, the pay is great for people who just started working and those who need extra cash! A lot definitely goes on, but the employees and management get through it together."
good,"Kohl’s is a good place to work good flexibility in schedule, but pay is weak. Kohl’s need to step up and make salaries more competitive for their employees."
good,"Lots of attrition due to long hours. Only management truly gets benefits because they hire people and give them under 30 hours, so as not to pay benefits. They open for early birds (6 am) and close fit night owls (1 pm) so if you happen to help close and open the store, you might not get much sleep. You get lots of exercise because you don’t sit down, but I considered this a plus. "
good,Working at this location was nice at times but the worst part about it was they don't know how to train people so all of the seasonal associates were confused and at times and didn't know what to do. You're expected to know everything already.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"typical days at work include manning the registers and taking care of customers first, and then making sure returns and other items are neatly put away. a hard part of the job was mainly personal interest in the retail atmosphere, which only works for certain individuals. yet, you are treated with respect, your opinions in the work environment are taken into consideration, and the pay is decent. pay could be a little nicer considering the stressful situations you may be in and the lifting you end up doing."
good,"I was always on my feet, I had training from someone who didn't listen to what I had to say. Management was pretty good, culture was good, and I enjoyed most of it."
good,"Nothing too major."
good,It was a great working place until I got pregnant and when I was sick they weren’t understanding about anything. I’d have pain while working and extra breaks weren’t allowed
good,It’s a chill back company that lets you do your work no one really watching over you breathing down your neck everyone pitches in there’s communication all day long on headsets
good,Very flexible schedule and great company to work for. My training experience when I signed on in my department wasn't the greatest as I felt I didnt have enough time to learn everything before I started on my own. They have since changed the training process to give more time to learn as the customer service department is more extensive.
good,"Being a seasonal employee, I put clothing back in my area and also, straightened up the area. I also worked the registers when needed."
good,"I love my job at Kohl's and I wouldn't want to leave, but as a freight operator the only work I really get there is when a truck needs to be unloaded. They have occasionally called me in to work other departments, but the most I've worked is 3 or 4 days a week and not full 8 hour shifts."
good,It was okay but the breaks to short I prefer something better well I need something better I loved what I did at kohl’s it was a good work place to be in
good,"I'm a seasonal worker and so far I've enjoyed working for them, hopefully they will keep me on. They expect you to work hard and won't chastise you if you do something wrong."
good,Working at Kohl’s e fulfillment center has been great! It’s a good work atmosphere and the work is pretty easy.........................................
good,Working with my co-workers was such an amazing experience. I enjoyed assisting the customer with what they needed. Being under compensated was the hardest.
good,Great place to get an opportunity to work on IT infrastructure projects!  Mostly recognized for a job well done from management but not a lot of opportunity to advance my career.
good,"I learned lots of customer service tips that I still use in my current job, I am grateful for the little bit of customer service experience that they did give. I make it a priority of mine to take something positive and useful from any job that i have worked so that it can make me a better employee."
good,"A typical day at work, you will walk 5-10 thousand steps back and forth between departments unless you're on registers. The hardest part of the job is just showing up, the rest is some heavy lifting and organizing merchandise."
good,"Kohl's is a good job with strong values. Kohl's emphasizes heavily on customer service/satisfaction. It is a great environment to work in, as you are surrounded by kind, welcoming team members."
good,"Well organized work environment, constant hospitality skills used. Room for advancement and more than happy to teach you new things.will give Flexible hours."
good,It is a fun place to work. Employee discount is really good. You will never be able to move up mainly part-time people. Hours are not very consistent only during the holidays. More like a fill in job or side job for extra money.
good,Seasonal isn't fun but no where during the seasonal will it be. My store had pretty good manager but some of them were a bit hard. People will always be hard to work with but in the end it wasn't terrible
good,Good friendship...Great commucation skills....Staff was kind and respectful...Staff worked as a team....very hard workers very reliable kind hearted people...
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is fast-paced and you really have to know what you are doing to get the job done not time. The hardest part is during Thanksgiving and Christmas time because of how busy it is.
good,"I worked as loss prevention, very stressful you miss make stop, it didn’t count if you retrieved the merchandise. The pressure is unbelievable. The LPM didn’t know anything she couldn’t answer question always had to get back to you. It seems as the regional loss prevention person only hires whit blond females so no chance of be promoted unless you fit that box. Pay was great, was able to make my own schedule"
good,Great job for a person who really needs a job. Flexible hours and pretty easy job. HIGH turnover rate for managers/ supervisors. Required to work busy holidays!
good,"This job will give you opportunity to learn all over the store.  I moved to another town and couldn't get there on time each day.  I subsequently lost my job with them.  Warning however, if you lose your position at one another will not hire you with knowledge of it."
good,"Management was very supportive in helping you achieve your goals, however they started to cross train in multiple lines of business, card service, Ecommers, Rewards and Fraud without additional compensation to associates. This was very stressful and training was not adequate to insure that the associate would be able to pass QA each month."
good,Willing to work around other work schedules.Willing to train employees. Management tries to keep the work place alive and active getting everyone involved in the daily routine.
good,"A typical shift is fast-paced, hectic, and exhausting. The hardest part of the day is meeting company goals. The most enjoyable part is being able to work friends."
good,Really nice coworkers. Manager is very competitive. The only thing I don’t like is the pressure to get customers to apply for the Kohl’s credit card. I am very uncomfortable pressuring people. Especially the elderly.
good,"It's a great place to work! All departments feed off each other. Fast pace production work Team work is vital in working with company. No team work skills, this might not be the place for you"
good,"I loved my job at kohl's I was one of the top associates. I met my goals daily, I felt that being the top associate I should've been paid for what I was worth. The only problem I had was making sure my hours were accurate and that I was paid for my incentives. My check was almost always short. I love how they would transfer me to different states."
good,"Fast paced always task to complete for the day such floor sets inventory markdowns pricing signing . as well as customer service credit apps. "
good,"Greet customers, assist with locating items they are shopping for. Cash out customer and make sure they had a nice shopping experience. Keeping area by register organized."
good,I worked seasonal for two months up to Christmas. I worked graveyard shift . It was fun but there wasn’t enough work for all the people they hired. They had raffles at the end of the last two weeks and all the employees were included.
good,"in 26 years I did almost all jobs. loved working there. I had mostly daytime hours did not mind every other weekend. I worked  on truck, repacking, manager trusted me to find my own work to do I knew what had to be done."
good,"working with khol's was not a bad job it was very relaxed an not phisyical at all, the hours were very few some weeks, so it is difficult to make a living with that company."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Kohl's overall, you are able to balance and maintain a great schedule and as for the environment it is a very positive work space."
good,A typical day at work was busy with a lot of running around the store trying to help co-workers and satisfy customers. I learned a lot about giving quick responses and being proactive and quick to action when something was needed to get done. Management worked hard but they had so much to do that it seemed like as an employee that I was disliked or invisible.
good,"I loved working there except it’s too much for any company to say you have to work on Holidays! I didn’t have a family to stay away from them every holiday. I also believe in,"
good,always have the customers in mind and customer care is number one they do their best to maintain the happiness of the customers .. they have a great loss prevention unit and they are really a good place to work never a dull moment and busy work environment never bored  always busy
