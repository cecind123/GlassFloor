bad,If you are not a kiss butt and a dumb butt then you're not going anywhere in the company I no from experience I worked there in Columbia city division for 8 years and if you didn't suck up to management or be a whipping boy you was screwed
bad,"By far the worst place I ever work at, management is cut throat and only care about production. Seen at least 5 people leave for poor treatment from management and other employees. This is not a career job, just a place for a pay check nothing more."
bad,"Work their for 9 years.high paying jobs where given to family an friend,if you werent in the group you are look over,Alot of jealousy."
bad,"Although they have a very nice compensation package, SDI does not stand by its veteran employees, your family is not important, they want you to eat ,sleep ,and breath SDI 24/7 ."
bad,This organization failed to focus on safety. as a result many people were injured every month.  The executive leadership would not spend the money to fix the problems.
bad,This is a great place to work for a few years but not a long term job due to lack of opportunity to advance. The work is hard on your health and the management needs a serious overhaul in order to succeed in the long term.
bad,Keep in mind this was a buy out situation and the SDI guys were fantastic. The problem for the company was the pathetic management group leftover from Severstal! I have stayed in contact and the situation still remains the same. The salaries being paid are enough to make the few good original people put up with the Napoleonic management!
bad,I dreaded working there everyday. I hardly saw my family and the management definitely needs improved. The only thing that keeps people working there is the pay. The average person makes 60k a year.
bad,"Well compensated, but long and often fast paced stressful hours. Poor upper management and supervision.  Good concentration on employee safety and health."
good,"Total dysfunction when I was there! They'd just brought in a new Gm and Sale Manager - there could not have been any worse people to work for than these two. After building my sales territory for many months, they disassembled it in less than two months with strong-arm sales tactics and even worse accounts receivable tactics."
good,"Production workers are on a 4 day/night rotating swing shift (12 hour shift). The benefits are really good but it comes at a cost to your overall emotional/physical/spiritual health. Also, if you are married/have kids its not a good recipe for building/maintaining solid relationships. "
good,"any foreman or friend of a higher up can get their kids or pals on with no problems but just be a worker who bust his hump and has dedicated over 15 years to a company who pigeon holes you cause of how good your are at your position try and get his kid on and there's no way it's gonna happen it's shows me how much worth I am with this company,I think my time is done.and my kid has the same outstanding work ethics that I possess."
good,It was a good place to work  good benefits and pay just long hours so it's not a bad place to work    But it's hot and hard work and stressful place to work
good,Working 12 hours day and nights pulling orders to be loaded on rail cars.I learned how to run a forklift. Good people to work with. Descent management except for some managers had no clue how to do the job their overseeing. Hardest part was working nights and best part 4 on 4 off.
good,"Great place to work!  They do a great job of promoting within the workforce.  Paid vacation, with stock options, and benefits.  4 days off a week if Great!"
good,"Great group of individuals to work with, not the best environment.  Dirty, hot, and dangerous work.  Casted molten steel into blooms, high quality grade steel that is rolled to customer recommendations."
good,Some days are rough and some easy.  Great pay. Typical buddy system to advance which is the biggest downfall.  Great focus on safety with production output a close second.
good,the place is highly innovative and technical and would suit any one with a passion for instrumentation and attention for detail. The staff was friendly to starters
good,Lot of places to learn move around and find fit. Co workers were helpful and willing to teach
good,"High speed with multiple challenges."
good,"Easy access to company leaders, but can be extremely difficult to get in the company without knowing the right people. Overall, it’s a fairly young company and is growing quickly, but they are looking for top talent at all times."
good,"As a Lab Tech. most training was hands on with explanations, and the work environment was good. There is a work rotation that requires you to work 4 on and 4 off with a day and night rotation that changes week to week. Most management does not have a day to day work environment with the employees. You also were required to work 12 hour shifts with some required overtime. The hardest part was the transition from week to week adjusting from days to nights.  The most enjoyable part was the crews you worked with were team oriented.  My experience was mostly good."
good,I enjoyed working for them I was on a part time fixture the money was ok the people were great I would reccomend this company for anyone looking for work
good,While working for Steel Dynamics I have gained experience in more areas then I ever thought I would. Great Company and good people.
good,"its a great place environment to work in. helping people, work as a team. made u feel right at home as if your one of there family members. i would recommend people to work there."
good,Worked for Bracken Ind. at Steel Dynamics Plant installing a furnace. My contact with Steel Dynamics was always professional and courteous. Very fast paced job with Bracken.
good,"•	Managed projects from cradle to grave on the most complex, successful green field mini-mill start-up at its time."
good,"Great inner departmental management, great training , great people. the 4 day on and 4 day off was a plus. They also have great benefits and treat you good during the holidays."
good,Very good company to work for. Not the highest salary but does offer good bonuses. The company possesses a laid back culture with many older employees that can offer sound insight to younger employees as well as new members of the steel industry.
good,My days at SDI I learned that team work and a motivated work ethic payed huge dividends but the harsh environment takes a toll on one's self physically. I still hang out with my old co-workers because they are some of the best people around. I only quit SDI to pursue other interest.
good,"Steel Dynamics is a profitable, record breaking steel production plant. I have been happy to call this company home for the last few years. Every employee is friendly and more than willing to help anyone without question. They pride themselves in work culture. Management, however, is losing touch with their employees. The company is growing at a seemingly exponential rate and it seems what was once called the ""mother ship"" of steel production is taking a back seat to corporate's agendas. Still an excellent place to work. I enjoyed every moment. It should be mentioned that the hardest part of the job isnt production, Instead,  its the mandatory swing shift (day/night) for all employees."
good,"A true lean manufacturing environment. The company champions the opportunity to lead and acquire business resources to control the cost of making engineered products within customers requirement safely delivered within time and schedule."
good,"The culture allows for anyone to talk openly to anyone else in the company. There is an open door policy from the hourly workers up to the CEO. This allowed me to pass ideas quickly from the floor to approval and implemented with no middle men slowing the pace. If you dream of a project you will be given full reign over it from cost justification, calling for quotes, awarding a contract and managing over the installation."
good,"Steel Dynamics has many locations and is constantly acquiring more. They are extremely safety focused and value their employees lives at work and home. The culture is small-town, family oriented. Much of the pay is compensated by bonuses to promote employee involvement and motivation and offset the bad times. It is a strong business and good company to work for."
good,"I worked at Steel Dynamics in Colombia City, Indiana for two Summers (2017 and 2018), and even though I didn't work in the Steel Mill or anywhere like that, I never felt like I was in immediate danger. During my first Summer I worked mainly in the warehouse receiving packages, working on spreadsheets, dusting and painting. My second Summer I worked with the grounds crew working on general upkeep of Steel Dynamics and I worked in the administration building organizing papers and helping IT with certain tasks such as counting certain items in storage. My favorite part of the job and also the most difficult was receiving packages in the warehouse. I enjoyed learning where everything was stored in the warehouse and it was challenging because I had to make sure that the computer inventory system was up to date based on items received. Both the management and other workers were very nice and I enjoyed working with them. The working experience was pleasant for the most part and the most important takeaway was gaining experience working in a larger work environment than what I was used to in another part-time job. Steel Dynamics is definitely a place that I would send my resume to in my search for employment in a professional position."
good,Very well managed company that cares about employees. I had to resign my position in IN because I had a man child working under me that didnt want to do his job as I had instructed then reported false accusations to a manager above me. SDI handled the situation the best they could. Was promoted within 3 months of employment. Hard work pays off! Good men to work with and company cares for your safe return home!
good,Company is employee focused and safety is the number one priority. Works are very well compensated for the time and efort they put into their job.
good,Working in a steel mill is a hazardous place to work so as a safety coordinator there is always things that need to be done.
good,"The culture is great!  Team effort in everything done.  The people make the company.  Outstanding personalities that make the job fun.  Hardest part of the job is its very fast paced and demanding.  A lot is expected of everyone, but it makes a well oiled machine."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind the shift schedule and you are comfortable with an industrial environment. There are many moving parts that could cause great injury or death.
good,My time at steel dynamics was very good.The people were very nice. The company was safety oriented beyond my expectations. They had regular meetings with food provided along with training classes
good,"Its was a great place to work, multi learning experience where I learned how to operate 7 different jobs. Also had  great benefits."
good,"Can not beat the benefits. Production based pay."
good,I loved working at Steel dynamics.  It was just the 12 hour night shifts that I didn't like. It was a great employer with lots of opportunities to benefit my family
good,Very interesting industry. Always things happening in plant and always problems to solve. Atmosphere and work environment only positive and everyone knows the end goal.
good,"Transportation Coordinator- Outside Processing/Customer Pick up"
good,"Great company that takes care of their employees. Great benifits, great money. Takes a certain individual to work in the environment. It's hot, dusty, and hard work."
good,"Busy Busy Busy, but that's the best way to be."
good,"A typical day at work-"
good,The culture at SD is of valuing staff and working as a team. I loved it here and only left due to a need to relocate. The company is ambitious and successful and that is entirely due to excellent management.
good,You learn to balance life and work with the schedule that’s planned out for the year. Allowing you to be with family and  still provide a decent life for them
good,Great place to work with great people. Work culture is high paced and employees are compensated for this. Benefits package and vacation is above average.
good,"My internship at Steel Dynamics is going very well and I really enjoying working there.  I am basically unsupervised but I do have a mentor checking up on me periodically and he is also a resource when I have questions.  "
good,Great employer and great co-workers and pay. Career growth and advancement is encouraged in all departments. Insurance benefits could be better and needs co-pay or lower deductible.
good,"Amazing place to work, great group to work with and a main goal of safety. Great pay, hot work but we'll worth it. Great benefits and stock options. Always able to ask for help it there was anything not understood."
good,"As an intern at Steel Dynamics they will pay for your housing along with a very nice hourly pay wage. The managers are more than helpful and if any questions arise, they do not hesitate to help."
good,"I learned a ton about .NET development and SDLC's while in my internship at SDI. My boss was very hands off which allowed me to become an independent learner so that was especially nice. The environment was very relaxed with all of the interns joking around with each other, but it was still a place to get solid work done and be professional. Plus, it's right by a really good donut shop so there was often donuts available."
good,"Family culture"
good,Most interns get stuck filing all day but I have got real world HR experience. I was able to help implement and train administrators on new software. I am currently in the process of helping with a new benefit plan and open enrollment implementations. I have been able to coordinate trainings as well as public events. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with and the new projects and challenges I get to work on.
good,"Steel Dynamics is an unbelievable company that has seen never before heard of growth since their inception 25 years ago. They do it by hiring the right people and paying for performance and promoting from within from those who perform well and work well within a team environment. I absolutely loved working there for the past 24 years and had I not had a family change event and a 160 mile round trip drive to work for the past 6 years, I probably would have continued to work as long as my health would allow it."
good,"This company puts a high emphasis on only hiring the best of the best.  Everyone (from top to bottom) is paid based on how the division performs.  This pay structure encourages high levels of collaboration to maximize production and, therefore, your paycheck.  You are truly part of a team."
good,I've learned a lot from working here. Technology here is state of the art as the steel mill industry goes. The working environment is very family friendly and everyone gets alone.
good,"To work at SDI is a true blessing , because of this job I’m able to provide for my family like they truly deserve . I love what I do and I enjoy coming to work every single day . Shift work isn’t cut out for everyone, but it’s a lifestyle I’ve grown to love over the last 13 years"
good,"One of the best places I have a worked for, I hated leaving. Great pay , great benefits and wonderful people to work for.. Steel dynamics have  Smart and intelligent management that knew what was going on with the process ,Supervisors and team leader was awesome to work for and employees was just like family."
good,"I could not speak highly enough about my time working at SDI.  From management to co-workers, the experience was incredible.  They took appropriate time to train and introduce me in to the SDI culture of Steel processing."
good,"Great compensation, and benefits package."
good,"I worked at Steel Dynamics as a Mechanical Engineering intern. I learned so much and was able to work in such a great environment. As an intern in other places, I was not learning or being challenged. Steel Dynamics allowed me to be in charge of my own projects while also giving me support by the wonderful staff. It is an environment that allows you to feel comfortable while also pushing you to be at your most productive. I highly recommend applying to any positions they have to offer!"
good,"Excellent job for beginning, hard, manual laborers with aspirations for a skills in a great trade. Worth every hour, every penny!"
good,"A typical day always had surprises and new adventures allowing me to grow as a professional. I learned many valuable lessons including how to work with people from different backgrounds, how to communicate effectively, how to hone my skills as a safety intern and to implement my ideas into my work. The other employees there were always friendly and helpful in all aspects. The hardest part would be to stay on top of all of the tasks but through the help of everyone around me it was very enjoyable to do. The entire job was enjoyable and it was great to make lasting relationships with my fellow co-workers."
good,"I love job at Steel Dynamics, they treat all their employees with the upmost respect.  They are family orientated and care about each and every employee."
good,Steel dynamics was a wonderful company to work for. Good pay and benefits. Professional leaders.  Good insurance. tuition benefits for the children of the employees.
good,"SDI is a great place to work, they understand that many people have other things besides work going on in their lives.  Management is very strong on the corporate culture and safety being of paramount importance.  This job has taught me many things that are just not able to be taught in the classroom.  All of the people that I have interacted with treated me with the utmost respect.  My co-workers were extremely knowledgeable and very technically savvy"
good,Strong daily interaction with various service centers with intense service and pricing requirements.
