rating,review
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Horrible place to work. Disney magic does not exist at all. Leadership is non existant. It's hard to believe that this place even considers itself part of the Disney magic. Walt would turn over in his grave.
bad,"Horrible company. The company sucks, the management sucks. They’re all condescending jerks. The customers act like it’s their world and we live in it."
bad,"You made money but most went towards rent. I was really broke and decided to come home after not making enough money. Everyone told me not to do it, but I want to try something new."
bad,Disney treats employees like garbage stay away. DI losses money cause they wont listen to their intelligent developers. To many corporate decisions. It feels like high school working there.
bad,I hated working for this low budget company! The pay was very low and they would fire people because the work volume was slow. They lied about making temp employees perm and would string people along until they no longer needed them. I hated working there! It was a pure waste of time!
bad,expérience intéressante gâchée par des teams leaders qui ne sont pas sur le terrain mais veulent montrer qu'ils décident tout .
bad,Ont as l impression d être au collège plutôt que dans une entreprise d adulte as éviter de toutes urgences
bad,"Hated working there. Would never recommend working there. The worst job I ever had. Overall attitude of company was not employee appreciation driven, it was profit driven for shareholders"
bad,"at this work there was no organization, The hardest parts is that there was no  enough personal because everyone renunciate, they give me to much work, only 15 minutes of break and no benefits at all and less pay."
bad,"I had a horrible experience at Disney, my second time around, you get punished for doing good work, some people at Disney operate as a total gang and not in the best interest of the company, blue vs green badge discrimination sucks, contractors spy on employees as they slowly move to replace them."
bad,They have bad pay and treat everyone besides guests like garbage. They truly do not care about anything but money. I would never work for the again. I do not recommend them.
bad,"Not paid decently to be able to survive cost of living , management does not care about employees' well being, make it difficult to have a life outside of work"
bad,"I'll put this as simple as simple as I can. Disney will recruit from out of state, not offer any sort of relocation help, overwork you, and will never pay you enough to meet the cost of living in your area. Not only that, but I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and when I went back to Disney they let me go because I didn't inform my management that I would ""be absent."" Stay away from Orlando."
bad,"I show up to a team of people that were never motivated."
bad,"It was hard and the pay was low, there was no advancement. It was hard to want to go to work on the daily and the culture was really unsettling. It was the unhappiest place on earth."
bad,"Awful management. "
bad,"Disney does not treat their employees well at all.  You're just a number.  Management is ""brain washed"" to the company line...""always blame the employee, it's never the company's fault.""  In 11 years, I know of only two good managers.  IF you like being used, then this is the place for you.  The perks aren't worth it."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"Terrible company to work for.  They only pretend to care about their cast members.  Management is brainwashed to the company ""line."" Hardest part of job is going; most enjoyable was going home. Workplace culture ""the company is always right"" even if they are patently wrong!  I was penalized for being late for work due to a traffic standstill caused by a motor vehicle accident involving two deaths! I guess I was supposed to leave my car on the highway and start walking! Some managers don't care about such things as sexual harassment!  A number of us had to actually go to HR beause the manager wouldn't do anything about sexual harassment!  They are cheap  Housekeeping and kitchen workers are the most 'abused' cast members. They work the CPs and ICPs to death, then take most of their pay for ""rent"" in complexes that Disney owns! They get these kids coming and going!  It's a disgrace! You don't want to work here."
bad,This was the worse company to ever work. They dont care about their employees. They dont do breaks by the protocol in OSHA during the extreme hot summer conditions.
bad,"After 2 weeks of training, management made it crystal clear that they want to mainly have ex-law enforcement and ex-military as their security members. I was neither, but have a Bachelors in Criminal Justice. Free-Thinkers are NOT the type of person Disney Security Management wants to have working there. If you bring up an idea, you are told to keep ideas and thoughts to yourself. Security is to just ""observe"" and not react to an issue unless Orange County Sheriff officers are to respond to an issue. If a Disney Security officer was to respond to a call, management is to be asked and you are to wait for a reply on what you are to do even in an emergency situation. Security is mainly there to search bags and watch guests. Report any issues to management and await for Orange County Sheriff officer to respond to the call."
bad,"not a great company to work forthey do majour (15mil) contracts with companies that o not handle contractors well - it seems like a scam, the subcontractor takes all the money"
bad,"Worked here for a couple months. Clock in system made it so that you cannot clock in 1 minute after your shift start or you get a sort of penalty. My area has many workers who would take ages to clock in and I’d be stuck in a line behind them. I’d arrive for my shift 10 minutes early but be unable to clock in on time due to my co workers taking forever. Eventually the times I clocked in a minute late added up and resulted in my termination. Management didn’t bother to hear me out or investigate further yet I was on property early every shift but got terminated for being late. Welcome to Disney, a fascist land of self gloat and ego plagued Upon all entry level workers by their strict god-like mentality management."
bad,I hated working for the company. They never worked with me. I brought in two doctors notes saying that I was highly allergic to tomatoes and couldn’t work in a kitchen and they put me in one. I didn’t apply for a kitchen job!
bad,"I worked as a temporary cast member in a pop up Disney store and this was by far the worst job I've ever had.  Most of the management were clueless and insensitive, the only nice one was the main store manager who is now not a manager because the company decided she wasn't good enough. Couldn't do right for wrong in this place, I'm glad I got out when I did."
bad,"highly unprofessional. very unprofessional, although colleagues went to college alot of them acted in a manner that would suggest otherwirse. Disney needs to reorganize."
bad,poor management. They do not know how to handle large volumes of work loads because they do not have structure. there is no room for growth.training is not the best.
bad,"My experience with The Walt Disney Company is that it was competitive, without needing to be, compensation was low because the attitude was that you are working for the best in the industry and therefor easily replaced. Conflict with those in charge lead to intervention from my union, which was the only way to keep me in place for the contractual period"
bad,"Working in one of Disney's call centers is pretty much thankless work. There is a shift bid literally whenever they feel like it, making it impossible to plan your life. For 3 months you might have off Wed/Thur and work 11-8, but then out of nowhere they have another shift bid and you end up with Mon/Tues off and a shift from 3-11. To make matters worse, there are mandatory ""Extra Hours"" ie. overtime. And they do not care if you have other things planned in your life or responsibilities to take care  of. The pay is extremely low and is likely the reason behind the low wages in all of Orlando since Disney is one of the biggest employers. The management (and I use that term loosely) is incompetent largely because you get promoted at Disney based only on who you know and how long you've been there, rather than your skills which creates a management team who is inept at doing much of anything."
bad,"I was not pleased with my position with Disney. It was very stressful, with long hours and low pay. "
bad,"Unless you are applying at the studio, don't waste your time working at the park. You will receive little to no benefits, poor pay and little in the way of career advancement."
bad,"People are wonderful, upper management takes advantage of living conditions to keep you down. They know you can’t afford to lose the job so they keep you around at minimum pay."
bad,"Dysfunctional overall, overly political, highly redundant, no fun, confusing org. structure, no career advancement, behind in technology, does not pay well, lots of company kool-aid"
bad,"Company has a very toxic work culture, comparable to fraternity hazing. If you are not obsessed with the brand then you are perceived as an outsider and treated as one."
bad,"You can't really write a legit review, it's Disney after all. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,They do not work with your schedule. The Union take your money and does help when needed. If you have a family do not work there they will not pay enough and it takes 15 years to get anywhere higher up in the company.
bad,I had a bad experience working for this company. Too many chefs not enough cooks. People don’t do their jobs cause they are union and don’t care.i will never work for them again.
bad,"It can be weeks before the company assigns any hours. They do not return calls when I ask for hours. They keep wanting to recast me. The hours can be long, and late. They spend a limited amount of time for training because they want their employees out on the floor as fast as possible."
bad,"if you want to have the Disney name on your resume, need benefits, or you're corporate, then I would understand why you want to work or still work at Disney. But for your average Cast Member, we are under paid. Management is poor. I am very disappointed with the company. I have not recieved an raises. My wage only went up when the minimum wage went up. I've been with the company on and off 5 years and I'm still at minimum wage. Been in my department for 3 years and the new cast members that just got hired make the same amount as I do. The pay system is unfair at Disney. There is also a huge lack of communication with leads and management."
bad,"The only good thing about working with this company, is it was interesting meeting people from around the world and I enjoyed brightening the vacations of families and especially the children. Other than that do not work for Disney, they treat their employees like pawns."
bad,"the day was dragging because i'm not English  so they where treating me like no one there, they where rude  ect.. so i left the place."
bad,"This is the most cutthroat, cheapest place to work.  They discriminate and encourage cutthroat environment when there is no reason for it.  You do actual work which would not be considered interning... you are just exploited labor.  It is so bad, young people are scared to speak up bc they are told they would never work in the industry again if they did.   Post, Finance and"
bad,"I had thought working for Disney would be a dream come true. It was NOT. The internal politics, the demanding of no facial hair for men, and over-all nature of the drones who work there is not conducive working environment for me."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. Terrible pay, bad benefits, micromanaged beyond belief with nearly weekly policy changes, and an almost cult-like insistence on loyalty to Disney. The working hours and schedule were awful, and the accommodations and materials provided for the staff were not nearly enough (at least in the center in which I worked). "
bad,A manager was leaving and they where being rude  * bang bang the witch is  d e a d * vile people in the store not a good bunch to of worked with over christmas period
bad,"i would receive 2 paid hours of work and then be ""on call"" for the rest of the day/week. when i asked for more hours i was told to be grateful for making more then minimum wage and those hours where all that was available to me, anything more would cut into management hours and i wasnt important enough for that. was told i didnt smile enough, and told i had ""resting beast face"" wasnt allowed to take bathroom breaks. uniform is dry clean only. i was shamed on being to early to work(15-30mins on my own time) never clocked in early."
bad,"Work schedule is always in limbo. Poor work/life balance. Shift pick by seniority, and you get bumped down when more senior people transfer into your department."
bad,I had issues with Disney from the start. It took them four months to get back to me after my interview and then it was hard to speak with management about anything. I felt like management was always against me and constantly trying to find flaws in what I did as well as other people. I was set to work part time only but was forced into working full-time hours.
bad,You never know when your last day will be and they treat you like nothing. there are not any chances to be advanced up the latter.
bad,"Good environment"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Heavy work load for one person. Not very understanding management team. Does not approve shift switches or requested time off. Mandatory six days during peak seasons regardless of availability and school schedule.
bad,"Safety of employees is not a matter of concern at all. We get assaulted, verbally and physically. Security is not even called out by the supervisors. Very time consuming for very little pay, they require employees to make them their number one priority, yet do nothing for employees in return. The only way to move up in the company is to know someone in a high place. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Even if a potential candidate is overly qualified for higher up positions, they don't stand a chance if they're not ""popular"". Very clickish and immature, High-School like environment."
bad,To always do what is best for the customers/friends. Working in a inbound call center resolving problems with orders and shipping out new orders in a steady pace.
bad,"I have never had such a bad experience working,  as I did here. Lots of unprofessional staff  who should not be working here."
bad,typical day was long hours. Learned to document everything. Management was never around. Co workers were fun. Hardest part was no breaks. Enjoyable was the birthday parties.
bad,Typical day was long hours. Learned to document everything. Management was never around. Co workers were fun. Hardest part was not getting a raise. Most enjoyable part was birthday parties.
bad,they work you hard and dont recognise your accomplishments. they never promote the people that deserve to be pormoted.
bad,"The Walt Disney Company promises an exciting and fantastical work experience to its employees, and I decided to go for the Spring 2009 College Program."
bad,Housekeeper required to clean 14-18 rooms per shift. Overtime was readily available.
bad,The PMO I worked under at Disney IT has been disbanded since my departure. Leadership recognized it wasn't working. Consulting at Disney on the whole was difficult because of executive leadership changes and deep political history between competing departments.
bad,"Have to work 7 days a week to keep the bill's paid!!!! Co- worker's are hard to get along with!!! Odd hour's, no concern for fellow worker's!!!! Someone is always complaining about other worker's!!!"
bad,"to Disney you are just a number. And it is made very clear that management and the company can get away with ANYTHING and everything. I worked there for a year and half for 40 hours a week until I got benefits. I fought with HR to get my benefits and I was told I had to earn it with seniority. All job transfers purposely do not give you in writing your new job description. During the 5 promotions I had in 3 years there every role is transitioned to was not what I interviewed for or promised. When I tried to fight it, I lost because they never gave me anything in writing (purposefully). Poor wages I knew so many homeless employees. Such a shame"
bad,"A day at work can be the elevated by the people around you most days, unfortunately when you work in a kitchen people don't seem to have much concern for the lonely cook toiling away as s/he tries to keep up with the myriad of orders coming in. Days at work were arduous and stressful with the management and company environment."
bad,"Great place to work if it's your first job.  Eventually you'll get over it after they brain wash you , the magical illusion that once got your attention will dissipate into thin air.  You'll be left with more debt than you started and wasting so much time just parking the lot to take a shuttle to work..."
bad,"Treated like nothing not included in anything unless you were considered a 'cast member"".   Employees run the company -shouldn't be crying on your way to work."
bad,bad pay to many stupid rules on appearance  make you park almost a mile from job they do not care for there employees they do not follow OCHA safety guidelines
bad,"No real opportunities, lots of corporate politics, favoritism, talent doesn't matter. Toxic culture, unless you are Disney fanatic and choose to be blind."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"This company is all about the money, if your family gets sick or you get sick. forget it. They expect you to almost faint or throw up on your shift, just to release you. The chemicals will make you very sick."
bad,"This is the worst place ever!!"
bad,"Very busy property, with very high Guest expectations. The amount of detail and effort expected of Cast Members is unreasonable for the very low pay, that is not competitive for the market,"
bad,"Takes all the fun of being with the public by finding things wrong that you are doing. Think you are going to advance in the company well think again. Worked hard on a project just to get yelled at for not communicating to the team while the rest of the area knows whats going on, not cool. Don't ever think this company is for its workers."
bad,The pay is too low the hours are not bad. Its too hard to sell vacation packages because too much customers are not interested. Its a phones job the pay is very low unless you make a lot of sales which is hard to do. They will get rid of you if your not producingl.
bad,"It's exactly what you'd expect it to be. Most of the time I always had positive interactions with guests but most of the bad experiences I had were with other cast members and the management team. You'd expect everyone to be professional at a large company such as Disney but unfortunately that is not the case. Most of the cast members are fresh out of high school kids that can't seem to leave the high school drama behind. Management is absolutely no help at all since they are all just worried about how to slowly advance their dead end careers at the expense of anyone in their way. They pretend to care about the cast members and the guests but managers are constantly changing faster than communist leaders, it's pointless to even try and learn their names."
bad,"They dont care about people like they use to........................ They make u work all hrs of the day the. The want u to make them come before your family... "
bad,"The magic doesn’t translate to the employee experience, but it gives you something to hang onto as you wade through the misery. The digital TV strategy was incoherent, the politics were intense, and the level of paranoia and backstabbing was pure Hollywood. Although my unit was mostly female, my line of report was all male and included an incompetent person who had no real mandate and was being protected by his friendship and long held ties to his own boss. It was a classic old boy situation."
bad,The managment doesn’t care about you they care about money. You don’t tell them if you have school or a second job because as soon as you do they purposely start to schedule you during the times you have to be off.
bad,"- don't join this company, nothing but beurocracy, especially Indians in management roles."
bad,"This job has really pushed me to my limits, I need to work a second job to keep up with bills, if they paid us more and gave us hours instead of calling an canceling the shifts every week this job would be a great place to work. I simply could not afford to work here."
bad,"They hire you without getting their budgets approved and then you are told that budgets were not approved and people like me who had to move from New Jersey to Orlando are left in lurch. There is no remorse or apologies from the management. They are smug about it that you got a chance to work at Disney albeit for few months."
bad,Working for Distribution Services is the worst decision. They are stuck in old management styles and there is no room for advancement. They treat the employees like things rather than people and do not embrace the Disney culture.
bad,"Everyone there is so hungry to move up that they will stab you in the back the first chance they get. It's ok if you know that going in, but it can be a bit of a shock otherwise."
bad,How can the Disneyland Resort continually expand when their employees struggle to afford housing? It is because they don't care about their employees.
bad,"It is a back stabbing,cut throat that abuses their workers with low wages and threats of layoffs and termination.Alot of favoritism and lack for advancement.Stay away from this company.The longer  you are and the more money you make,it is likely you will targeted for termination."
bad,"Make friends with everyone because that is how you advance, small minded some people can be great other are awful.  High school mentality.  The jobs can be great.  There are some really wonderful places."
bad,"Too much has changed, it's all about the money not the cast or guest culture or experience..  I feel like I spent my whole life there and am now dealing with the PTSD of a bad relationship."
bad,"If you are trying to cut your teeth in the real world (fresh out of college), Disney is a good place to work.  If you are expecting to rise through the ranks of Disney in your field there is a tough road ahead of you.  Disney is a glass ceiling type of company and will not promote individuals in general past Director level.  They hire outside the company for those positions at least in the technology field and several others from what I have experienced."
bad,"This company does not care at all about its ""cast members"". They do not pay fairly for what their employees do for the company. I knew several cast members who were working full time and living out of their cars because the pay is so severely below the living wage."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Don't expect to make any money nor move up. Not the Disney it used to be. Ridiculous work expectations with absolutely no money incentives. No wonder they have such a high turn over rate.
bad,"I'm going to keep this simple since I am currently employed. I wish it was a better environment to teach in. There are some who are striving to make it better, but there are some who are only out for themselves. It's depends on each classroom and its dynamics. Seems like admin is striving to improve. Resources are near endless. Pay isn't enough. I love the children, most of the families are awesome. It's great having Disney benefits. I've learned a lot since working here. I hope there are better teachers who can come in to improve the place more."
bad,"Not a great place to work...priority changes too much, learned to care of people, management can be very deceptive. Hard to enforce policy and procedures. I enjoyed working with the Cast members"
bad,The management staff are ego maniacs. There is definitely a lack of professionalism there. The management staff are threatened by anyone who shows a degree of knowledge and professionalism. They do not want you to question anything that they do. I was treated like I was a threat to their positions simply because I am very professional and efficient.I would perform my work tasks while assisting other departments with their work load. Management was astonished with the fact that I could do that. I took the job at a time in my life that I just wanted to relax and not have a lot of professional responsibility. It was very apparent that I was over qualified for the position and they knew it. Management kept asking me what did I want to do within the company and was flabbergasted that I was not trying to move up. I simply wanted to 'chill' for a while and working here did not place any demands on my life.
bad,"I contracted for ten years and they used a third party to pay my salary to avoid paying taxes to the government and avoid paying health care, while at the same time they show the world they are fair and equal."
bad,"Management lacks ability to inspire analysts.  Favoritism is rampant and the entire time it was ""do as I say, not as I do"".  "
bad,"There are zero health benefits, holiday pay, breaks no matter how long I've worked and the managers and staff are so cruel. I've never been treated this way at a work environment for doing nothing wrong ever"
bad,great first job for when i was in college but not enough pay after taxes.
bad,"Cool environment for high school students. Met some AMAZING PEOPLE from all walks of life; however, the pay and workload are not worth it!!! "
bad,"Worked here under contract for 9 months. The interview went well, I thought it was easy. Casual talk, somewhat technical."
bad,"People working at Disney do not have a concept of the opportunities beyond Disney, creating a dependent mentality. Pay has recently reached 12/hr, expectations are extremely high with no reward, moving up is close to impossible unless you know somebody, and worst of all, management can be very manipulative and retaliative as well."
bad,Disney is a horrible place to work at. I do not recommend anyone to work there especially if you are a mom. They don't care about the type of hours you need. Also they don't pay good at all.
bad,"I was hired as a security officer over the summer and things were great at first I was working well over 40 hours a week. However security is union, and ever six months you bid for a job.  Well if you don't get anything overnight everything will change. You will be put on bag check, which if you don't mind reaching your hand in random people's bags is not bad. The bad part comes when they hire new people after you who get 40 a week but drop you down to 20 hours a week. On top of that they will schedule you where and when they want, meaning you could work at any park or resort at anytime. The last issue is the fact that security is a joke, I had to respond to noise complaints in hotels and when I would confirm an issue, rather than act as a security officer and handle the issue you wait for the hotel manager to handle it. I waited so long on a noise complaint that the people passed out drunk before he finished his dinner break. The fact is until Disney treats security like security instead of costume characters Disney will never be safe."
bad,It's really hard to work for a company that don't care about there employees. They also treat the college program worker lime less of an employee and the college or program workers work harder then anyone there.
bad,"Very difficult to advance a career if you are an assistant."
bad,booked reservations for hotels dining airfare and vacation packages including park admissions.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of lots of walking around and checking guest satisfaction. I used the registers quite often, spent a lot of time putting items back in their proper place, and lugged around heavy boxes full of expensive items. I learned a lot about guest service and how important their experience is to the well being of the company. The management team was incredibly disrespectful and passive aggressive and made it abundantly clear that the only way to get a promotion in that company was not hard honest work, but to be in their circle of friends. My co workers were kind hardworking people and a good amount will agree with what I said about the managers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the sometimes obnoxious theme park goers who demand perfection in every single aspect. Not that I'm incapable of performing my job perfectly, some people are just set on being angry and you can never please them. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely being able to interact with the children and do anything I can to make their trip to Disney more entertaining and memorable. I love kids."
bad,"Management was not there to help and guide you. They were awful. Not the happiest place on earth."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"The company will work you as much as they can while paying the least amount possible.  When profits are down the company will exercise its ""at will employment"" privileges and terminate you without cause."
bad,"Some not all are out to get you. Its not about what you know but who you know and most of the managers treat you like garbage most of the time, like they are better than you"
bad,There is little or no chance of advancement. There is no method for initiative and too much condescension from the leaders. The worst part of the job was dealing with leader and coordinators that didn't deserve to hold their positions
bad,"Lower management has a ""use 'em up and loose 'em"" attitude. Lower management is inadequately prepared to supervise people. Supervisors expect cast members to make up for their errors."
bad,"This company is a very toxic workplace. Management in every line of business loves to fire people w/o probable cause. You have to brown nose and rat on co-workers to move up. My bachelor's degree has lead me nowhere but to a dead end job with no future whatsoever. I advise job lookers to stay away from this company, because you may end up having regrets in the future."
bad,"I used to love Disney until I worked for them. They are all about making a buck and when the people spend tons of money on character dining, management rushes those characters through the dining and will yell at the performers if needed to make them move fast"
bad,"Disney was my dream job but it turned out to be a nightmare. TERRIBLE management with NO people skills. They keep wanting to reach for their imaginary brass ring but the whole time, they will only promote people who kss up. They do not like people with an opinion."
bad,Working at the Disneyland Resort gives you the benefit of going into the park whenever you'd like. However those types of perks are not very comforting after starting. They won't work with your schedule and management is not very helpful.
bad,"I worked for the company around 6 years. First thing i can say people are racist in there. You can't talk in different language at all. Even if you whisper, someone will come closer to listen what language you talk and then will give you bollocking. In my opinion brand like Disney should be open for all the nationalities and languages, but Disney magic probably doesn't work in the warehouse or is just fake to say in TV. Also no chance for any progress if you are not close friend to the management or family relative. You are just the number in their eyes. After six years of being with the company manager didn't even come to me to say good bay, no one from team leaders did.  This is the treatment they give to everybody."
bad,They give you food or product then say they never gave it to you in order to fire you for theft of company property. This is because they are unable to fire you most other ways because hourly positions is a union position. They are always trying to fight the contract and not giving out raises or the bonuses as a bribe to sign the horrible contract.
bad,"I worked from home for this company, my day would start at 5am pacific time and end about 1pm pacific time.  It was a very busy job, there was no time to breath, it was call after call after call.  The only real thing I leaned is that you have to be very patient.  The management was not that great, rules changed overnight all the time, it was a lot to handle when one day you are told you can do a certain thing and the next you are told that you are not allowed.  The hardest part of the job was getting no breather in between calls.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the excitement in the voices of the guests about their vacation."
bad,You see guests at their worst and management is completely useless. Everything is very bureaucratic and takes forever to get done. The people you work with are as overworked an underpaid as you are and it really becomes a bit like a family because you see them so much.
bad,"There is little room for advancement within the security branch. There is no ""typical"" day. It all depends what location you're at. Very stressful job, with terrible leaders."
bad,"If you want to have the Disney name on your resume, need benefits, or you're corporate, then I would understand why you want to work or still work at Disney. But for your average Cast Member, we are under paid. Management is poor. I am very disappointed with the company. I have not recieved an raises. My wage only went up when the minimum wage went up. I've been with the company on and off 5 years and I'm still at minimum wage. Been in my department for 3 years and the new cast members that just got hired make the same amount as I do.  The pay system is unfair at Disney. There is also a huge lack of communication with leads and management."
bad,"I love the Walt Disney company and their vision as a whole but I think working for them, they expect too much out of their employees for what they pay them."
bad,As a cook we're on their paid over work barely got break and pretty much 6 days week most of the time underappreciated and really abusive my experience with Disney has been horrible as a cook
bad,"If you don't show up on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.  One of the many mantra.  They're not a good company to work for as they're filled with people who are not good people."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,If you want to be bullied for $10/hr than this is the company for you They treat incoming workers like trash and expect you to deal with it. don't do it if you know what is good for you. You should also work for this company if you love 12-15 hour shifts and 1-2 days off in a 2 week span.
bad,"Management is replaced every other month as are the employees, even if you catch someone stealing right in front of you , not even a manager or security can stop them because it will insult the person."
bad,"Yes you read it right, Disney has a children's center in Burbank and Glendale and I had the unfortunate pleasure of working at the Glendale site. These teachers are so prideful and rude, you couldn't do anything without getting snitched on to management that you're not being ""Disney show"" The needs of the children never come first, it's always look good in front of parents. The management played favorites, even teachers who were cussing other teachers out, nothing happened to them because they were favored. People with bad attitudes got to do whatever they want, like sweep sand all day and not even interact with the kids. "
bad,Director and VP have consistently informed me to inexperience working with minorities. The hardest part of the job is the fact that the organization is not inclusive and sometimes hostile towards differences. This is unfortunate because the hardest part of the job is not the job at all...
bad,This was a remote position so the remote experience I would give it a 1. Very strict high metrics and expectations. Not a lot of positive feedback. Very low pay wages for the level of expectation.
bad,"Hourly roles are good, with decent time off opportunities if you request early. Salaried is much differed, not much available time off, long days, and an expanding venue of responsibilities over the 7 years I spent there."
bad,"I will not write anything in depth because Disney is the devil and I have no interest in dredging up such horrible memories.  I love the Disney magic and was amazing at taking care of guests, but I hate the company."
bad,it was ok  just be prepared to work be able to hit production maintain a go above and beyond job expectations. always try to maintain a positive attitude.
bad,i was a bus driver there .love job it was fun.but the team-leaders was not so cool. all looking at you and if you dont have Disney look then they jump on you . but its ok if they dont have the Disney look.the ppl at Disney most are ok but some are real jerks.and they try to get fired if they can just in the name of free stuff.so i would never work there again .and i dont think ill give disney my money no more
bad,"A great job ruined by bad management and poor organization. Where the company works all over the world in the exact same manner there is a LOT of paperwork and a lot of hoops to jump through and without proper management and leadership these hoops are not jumped through and you will suffer from that. The job itself has the makings of a great environment ruined by these factors. As with most retail it's all about the people you work with. Don't ever get involved with Disney if you are going in thinking it's all sunshine and rainbows as there is a lot of hard work going on behind the scenes to provide that magic. But it is very rewarding and the children, and most parents, definitely make it worthwhile."
bad,the new executives don't support Imagineering. imagineers are now managing outside firms to do the jubs they were doing. work life balance doesn't exist. the cruise line dry docks are the worst. very unsafe conditions.
bad,"It's crazy how Disney is a multi billion dollar company but they pay call center employees $10. It can take years to become a Cast Member (permanent). Also, if you are not permanent, they do VTO but usually they end up sending everyone home so you just end up making gas money. That job is for fresh high school grads who still live at home with no real bills."
bad,If you work there only do the internship.. It is a great chance to meet people and get a great life experience.. Other than that Disney has no room for growth and has the worst management. Join a medium size company get the experience and then switch over if you want to work there for a high level one.
bad,"Age-ism is very prevalent at Disney. They tend to push people out as they get into their 50s and you see very few people past their 40s,  Great Stock but horrible employer!!!!!"
bad,"The Global Security division had a 65% turnover rate annually among executives. My previous position is now looking for its fourth incumbent in only the last two years.  Lower level employees were largely safe from turmoil but executives were removed under questionable justifications and amid bogus accusations by ER/HR and typically left completely unsupported from the VP & SVP level. The rumor mill following a departure was typically damning of the employee who either left voluntarily or was fired. Wild and unfounded justifications were offered to the division for why yet another executive had departed.  Upon departure, even executives were escorted to their vehicles with no chance to empty their offices or say their goodbyes."
bad,It's a great place to work but so difficult to get hired or rehired.  Easiest way is to become a temp but if you've been laid off or position was eliminated like mine... you aren't allowed to temp for a year!!
bad,"Impossible to move up. All based on who you know and if you're in the right place at the right time. No raises in three years. I'm an EMT student with a perfect record, no failed audits, and no reprimands and I have to deal with a management team with a fraction of my experience because they're all buddies."
bad,I currently work at the Disney Store at the tucson mall. I used to work for The Disneyland Resort in California and relocated to Arizona. The first couple months of working here were the best. I saw so much potential for working her. It was like a little piece of the resort but in The desert. Little by little I saw the true colors of the management team. They are very unprofessional. I honestly feel like I am in high school again. I would not reccomend anyone to work here till a new management team is there. And it's such a disappointment because working for the resort was the absolute best time of my life and now working at this store it's the absolute worst.
bad,"Position was at the Disney Resort in Vero Beach, Florida. Put it this way, you lose the ""Disney Dust"" when you go to work for them. Underpaid, under appreciated, and cut-throat environment. What the public sees does not truly represent what goes on behind the scenes."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Income was basically reliant on tips and business was too up and down for that. Disney has changed a lot of there perks for working there which were once an incentive to work there.
bad,"fast pace calls"
bad,"Ambiente ostile non paziente con  il personale"
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, lied to and promised this and that. Company does not appreciate their employees....no advancement no raises...etc. Lie after lie...sounds good until u see all the things that goes on behind the scene"
bad,"Very hostile work environment, draconian first line cultish supervisors, employees intimidated to not talk about or seek redress of issues."
bad,it was great but not worth the pay. not a really good place to work at for minimum wage. People get underpaid there. Crew members were accountable for many things.
bad,"Overall, stable and growth oriented media company. Various businesses that provide optimal opportunity to learn and grow."
bad,love being able to be that helping hand. being able to learn the different things I never learned when I was a child about Disney. and how Disney was first started and who created Disney.
bad,the kids made working there so much fun!  however the hours were great!
bad,"Went into this job with the hopes of retirement and having an exciting and secure career, after 4yrs I’ve discovered the company doesn’t intend for Cast members to make it a career. Management in my area is rancid and doesn’t care about the well being or advancement of their cast members. Favoritism runs rampant and mediocrity is promoted. If you have a skilled trade, stay away. Perks of the job have been cut by at least 50% over the course of my tenure. The unions are useless and bow down to the company, caving in to the company and low/no skill workers while leaving the skilled trades high and dry. If you don’t plan on staying past 3yrs, this is the perfect job for you."
bad,Managers are always out to get you. Days are spent sitting behind a computer screen answering emails from customers all around the world pretty relaxed. You really have to be a kid at heart to work here.
bad,Loved trying my hardest everyday to make a guests experience the best it could possibly be. Management on the other hand plays favorites. They will also like to tell you. That is you mess up there are thousands more to take your place.
bad,"On calls are required and make it hard to have a life. It's just a retail, part time job, it's ridiculous. You cannot move up in the company. It's almost impossible. For $1/hour more, you can apply for leads when they are available (only seasonal/someone steps down) and do a lot of what the managers do and a lot more than the cast member duties, and it's not worth it. Typically it's you and one or two cast members, typically just you and a manager some nights, even busy nights, and it's not fun or worth it. They are always busy but never use on calls so that time you set aside is wasted. 5-10 hour work weeks don't pay the bills, which isn't fair when you're a college student and cannot get another job. You get free Disney Park tickets but how is that a benefit when you make $30-$100 a week and can't afford to even go unless you're the manager. If you need to switch or call off, you get a ""point"" and three points in a rolling 90 day period gets you fired. That's not fair either, because what if things happen or occur and you cannot control them? If you do shipment, be prepared to not get your entitled break, either."
bad,This company expects a re great deal of character animation in your voice. It would be a good place to work if management would not give you a QA in the beginning or middle of your work shift. A bad QA makes it hard to have a successful day when done at the wrong times.
bad,"Worked for the reservation center in Tampa. I was a new mom working full-time. I had to pump at work because I breast fed my son. There was no designated mother room. The ""mother room"" was really the nap room which was shared and had no lock. I felt extremely uncomfortable here. Working hours were up to 12 hours a shift during peak season which lasted half the year. Working here was torture"
bad,"Because the employees think they can do what they want, and then they will throw you under the bus to get ahead and you go fired!  they say that they are strict on rules but some do what ever they want even accuse you of and lying about it, so they don't get in trouble. Beware some managers favor other to get you fired!"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"Been working here for nearly 4 years and only if you kiss up to the right people will you get promoted. "
bad,"Worked a unionized front line Cast Member role:"
bad,"Was not the most magical place on earth.  Need to focus more on the retail environment and not trying to by WDW.  Upper management was horrible and would not make decisions on their own.  Always was ""ratting"" everyone out to HR and Market Manager.  Always trying to get people fired from the store because they are too involved in business they shouldn't be involved in."
bad,"If you don't mind being Disney brain washed then work here. Even with all the perks, you have to be very aggressive in getting hours because you will definitely work ugly four hour shifts for a long time. This company is all about seniority. The training process and hiring process is great though and you will have fun events exclusive for employees from time to time."
bad,"Do you like working long, stressful hours being yelled at by guests? Or maybe you like getting paid minimum wage while working mandatory 50+ hours a week? Or perhaps you love working every holiday with the chance of being fired if you call off. Or perhaps you love pouring blood, sweat, and tears into a company who will replace you in a heartbeat. This is what it is like working for the ""happiest place on Earth."" It is fun for a vacation but a nightmare to be employed here."
bad,"When it comes to the leadership at the resort it changes everyday. With that comes the difference in style. However, that also means that the rules change everyday. Also they don't care about performance only compliance."
bad,"I love disney... the history, the parks, the memories..... but working for the company you are not cared about and you can't move up. overall the culture is toxic and drama filled and you can't live off of what they pay you. They make it very clear that you're dispensable. The guest interactions working in the parks are wonderful and the actual work is really fun, but thats where the positives end."
bad,"The perks of discounts in the parks, hotels, and free admission seemed perfect at first, but then several months later the promise of fast growth and advancement is still empty. It's easy to get stuck in a position. Management is not supportive of cast and management doesn't have knowledge of the field, so their assistance is often more confusing than helpful. Pay is extremely low for the work that is expected of cast."
bad,"Hard work every day and no appreciation. Out in the hot sun every day, co-workers made the job great. Does not take care of their employees very well."
bad,Assisting guest that call in about the website. Great co-workers helpful and nice. Helping guest to solve the opportunities that they have.
bad,Management will do all they can to pay you less and make you work more.  You can not take sick days or be more than 2 minutes late or you will be fired.
bad,"From walking in, to working i felt nothing to make me wanna continue working there. Terribel work enviroment, the work was very easy and hours were steady, but to many issues from poor management to miscommunication is why i left."
bad,Disney is a company that has no problem in engaging in nepotism.  And there management has no problem with threatening you with your job position to get a point across.
bad,"While I made some life long friends and had a great experience I can talk about for the rest of my life, don't expect to have a life or make money if you're going for the Disney College Program. I worked a minimum of 50 hours a week and got paid minimum wage. On top of that, Disney claims they provide partially subsidized housing, but I still paid $400 a month to live in a 3 bedroom apartment with 6 girls. Ultimately, I did finish the program (many people do not, they either self term or are termed by management) and asked to extend my program I could not because I lost money working for Disney. It was the best thing I would never do again."
bad,"thrown under bus"
bad,"if you plan on having a meaningful career, working hard to get what you want in life, and have a good work life balance. this is not the job (long term) for you, in my department we have a very negligent management team, hard workers where run to the bone and we where treated like trash ( by some) there where some ups but they didn't make up for the downs."
bad,"Even a union job at WDW your job isn't secure , you can be fired at any given time , poor understanding of the trucking business , you be treated as a labor not a truck driver ..."
bad,"compensation does not meet work requirements, You will make alot of money for disney and not as much for yourself..... ................................"
bad,I don't believe our working environment was very good we haven't had a raise for 4 years and when the union finally got the standard of living raise I had found a better opportunity at another hospitality establishment
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,My time at Disney was not what I expected and my leader would say that I was going to advance then he would drop the ball. I applied to other jobs and he would approve them even though I was great in my position.
bad,"This job is just that - a job. Do not intend to make a career within the Parks. The culture here is very much 'who you know' and rarely do you see deserving people move up. As a part-time, college, or unnecessary (just for fun) job, it's not bad at all so long as you don't take it seriously. The discounts and free admission are the only reasons many of us are still here."
bad,"everyone thinks that working for disneyland would be a dream. it is not. until they can pay their workers fair wages and improve the company culture and be less catty, it will continue to have high turn over rates and people not wanting to work there"
bad,"Many managers abuse their power. I have had nothing but poor experiences working there. Would not recommend to anyone. Way underpaid. But some of the coworkers are cool, that's the only benefit."
bad,"If you are a salary leader, there is no work life balance.  The hours can range from 10-12 plus hours a day.  Your job is not guaranteed and the senior leaders do not really care for your well being or life."
bad,Talk about cut throat!!  There are some good people but it is substantially outweighed by the folks that will stab you in a split second.   Very demanding job with low pay as they rely on the Brand.
bad,Walt Disney world used to be a great place to work. They at one point really cared about their employees and the quality of their product. Now it's all about the bottom line. Management is incompetent and skeezy. They nickel and dime their own employees even at the company cafeteria which by the way is awful. I've been served undercooked chicken tenders time and time again.
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever been to, let alone worked at. Management have no idea what they are doing, they receive criticisms from higher up and pass it down. The job is a constant cycle of being overworked, bullied and critisized, and then being told to do mindless busy work in the little free time you have so that your ""productivity"" can be measured. Training doesn't prepare you for the role at all. Expect long days (12+ hours), and to not be able to use any of the benefits. Trying to take holiday is difficult as managers are reluctant to grant it. Morale is low and to spend time with your co-workers is to complain about the job as that is all anybody wants to do. The company regularly try to make you do extra work and events on your days off. The actual English course is terrible, and you are told to lie to parents and customers to promote it."
bad,The best part is definitely the free admission and discounts. There is not very much flexibility with scheduling needs.
bad,"Pay is awful, but you get free admission....when you have time off.  No promotions. Too many things to get fired for.  They basically own you while you work for them."
bad,"Dealing with angry, tired, hungry adults and children. Serving food, stocking, and cleaning."
bad,"The company has a lot of potential for growth, but the executive managers lack management skills and do not value employees. Those that work hard are hardly ever rewarded and only those who have ties to the upper management are the ones who get promoted, regardless of their performance, education or interpersonal skills."
bad,"Very few opportunities for advancement, and no room for individual creativity when working in operations. Company focuses on finding ways to exploit needs and hopes of regular people for profit, including those of its employees. Offers few perks to its employees unless they can profit the company. No flexibility with scheduling at all. You must provide full availability including holidays and you will still have weeks where you only get scheduled between 4 and 15 hours but spread across 4 days."
bad,"The management at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Merchandise location does not allow for the employees to feel included or valued.  It is a constant sense of undervaluing the employees who work directly with the guests everyday.  Their voices do not feel heard and their ideas on how to make the work environment better and not taken into consideration, a lot of the time the leaders are on their phones when another employee is trying to have a conversation with them, which contributes to the feeling of non-inclusivity among employees."
bad,"We were promised 32 hours per week but were given approximately 14 hours.  It wasn't enough hours to cover for college dorms and living expenses.  Management was done by former college student interns, not always professional leadership."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,The job as a bus driver was easy but you had to deal with other driver that put you down and bully you. You could not tell them to leave you alone or you were afraid Disney would firer you. If you said something to a manger they would do nothing because that person was one of their favorite. You had to know the Disney rules and follow them or get fired. That is always over your head. I had a driver picked on me for 5 years and told a manger and found out that driver had someone in the office that protected her and she could get away with anything. I finally left because I could not take it any more. The job as a bus driver was easy but dealing with some of the driver was hard. That driver would lie about me and told a shop steward and he said that I would be in big trouble if I said anything more and she was doing everything. Management did nothing because she was one of their favorite. The hardest part was to get her to leave me alone without getting fired. I meet some people I could tell about what was happening. But in the end I could not take it any more.
bad,"Hands-on experience in configuring and administering Linux Red Hat Enterprise 7 ( DNS, DHCP, Networking, High Availability, etc)"
bad,"I would not recommend working here unless you plan to make a career of it, or are looking for a summer job. The work expectations and the benefits of working here are not proportional."
bad,"I've had issues with my boss and had to go to HR 4 different times.  It's very clear to me, and I've heard from other assistants, that HR is here to protect the executives, not the assistants.  I've worked for Disney for almost a year now.  I've also worked in legal for 15 years and I've never seen anything like the hierarchy at Disney.  It's very real."
bad,"The job description given was completely different from what I actually do. Unless you like sitting at a phone all day answering the same questions with every call and hearing people complain, do not apply. They also force you to say that there is a survey at the end of the call and offer to transfer to Chase to apply for the Disney Visa. If you do not, you get a bad assessment"
bad,"Studio Payroll Management is the worst. They only think about themselves. They see employees as trash, replaceable items, not as people who have families and lives outside the company. They do not care about your health or personal issues. They expect you to be a working machine. If you want to have a chance of a promotion or a decent raise, agree with everything they say and do. If you are not willing to do so, they will do anything in their power to have you fired. Stay away from this department! The Disney Company, itself, is a good company to work for. But again, it depends on the department you work under."
bad,"My experience was only for 2 years, I faced management that were less than favorable, and when injured due to an accident refused to allow me to seek medical attention, that is why I left I had to undergo surgery while for making a current injury worse due to not being allowed a long enough medical leave and being threatened with termination."
bad,"Stressful; Raises are not tied to merit anymore so a perfect review may only earn you a 2.5% increase, or lower."
bad,"I was once required to work through lunch but still docked 30 minutes from my check. Managers simply did not care about the workers. The one good thing I will say is that Disney gives you a lot of ways to please the customer. As a service rep, I had a lot of power as far as what I could give them in compensation for late or missing packages, incorrect orders, website errors, etc. and very rarely had to escalate to a supervisor thanks to this."
bad,"I worked almost a full year as a dishwasher in one of the restaurants, and let me tell you, it was not at all pleasant. It started off fine, the environment was bright and the people were friendly and tolerant towards my extreme lack of skill. However, as the months went on, the curtain began to open to reveal the disgusting truth. Daily rule changes, some of which were things that literally swapped back and forth four or more times within the course of a week, constantly under-scheduling people to work and forcing others to cover their shifts, almost no communication between the FIVE managers we had in the restaurant, and a constant feeling of ""not performing well enough"" are just some of the less tolerable aspects of working here. But hey, at least you can sign people in for free a few times a year."
bad,Takes long just to get to work from the parking lot. Not a lot is offered to employees and guest can be horrible sometimes. Human Resources is hard to reach when you have a problem and scheduling does not work with you.
bad,"Really liked the warehouse fun environment. Training was great, learned a lot. Thought I was doing well and was let go a week before my probation period was up "
bad,"Not the ideal place to work - underpaid and lack of respect from management.  Every employee is a dime a dozen.  Moreover, there is a lack of coordination.  Management lacks the ability to make important decisions.  It is a reactionary culture rather than proactive."
bad,I did not necessarily work for Walt Disney itself I worked in the Disney Store on 46th Street in Manhattan work experience there was okay not a career choice did maintenance for a Contracting Company under Disney
bad,"Not ideal as a career .  Difficult to advance and everyone is underpaid and over worked.  Experience for a future career is the only plus. They supply tons of learning opportunity.   The union doesn't really help and is a waste of money considering it's a union position, and even nonmembers get the same representation without paying the dues."
bad,It is a real privilege to work for the preschool audience. I was very luck to create and deliver content that delighter children. It is a world wide company so consistency across region can be challenging.
bad,"Working at Disney you are just a number.  They tell you in your training classes they can fire you for taking home a pen.  If you want a job this is the place, if you want a career with loyalty stay far away.. They do not have your back."
bad,"Its an ok job to have to get your feet in the door of Guest Services. I really enjoyed what I did learn from this company.Training is horrible, they expect you to learned everything in such small time."
bad,"Great brand, but extremely demanding. Not much work life balance. Working at corporate is understaffed, but can not speak for other segments. Pay is good. Very unstable and constant layoffs."
bad,"I would get the invoices, pull the order's. Frame the paintings, put the hardware on them, package them up and ship them out. I learned how to identify certain paintings and the different types of frames available. Direction from my supervisor was up and down. To many change of procedures without me knowing, then once changed then she would go back to the old procedures without me knowing. My co-workers were amazing to work with. They were on the IT side so we all got along pretty well. The hardest part about my job was getting one direction from my boss. The most thing I enjoyed about my job were my fellow associates and the enthusiasm and energy they brought to work."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"The magic in the Disney company really is gone. The expectations are not high for what you have to do and its really easy because people call you, no cold calling. It was just an unhealthy environment for me, but physically and emotionally ."
bad,"A typical day at work is stress less"
bad,"Whenever I come in to work, its always calm. I open at 8am, stock, do inventory, but after all that I have nothing else to do besides stand there and wait for people to buy something. Its a tiny kiosk so there's not much to do. "
bad,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo y adquirir experiencia en atención al publico, cadeteria"
bad,Toxic work place. Management creates very toxic and unhealthy work environment. Ask for “confidential feedback” then announce to other Cast members everything you said. Management likes to Terminate cast members right before holidays to keep cast members scared for their jobs. They Terminate you then tell you to “have a  Merry Christmas!” Used to be an incredible work place that was fun to go to work. Not so much anymore.
bad,"Did not enjoy working until 1am most mornings and did not enjoy working two weeks in a row with no days off. Cliental at this resort were extra challenging, beer budget, champagne taste."
bad,"This company will treat you badly and not care. Most managers don't care about their workers. Leadership is very poor, it washes out those who are actually great leaders. Stressful work environment but you will meet some of the best people through the guests and your co-workers."
bad,"The Walt Disney Company does not care about you, you are just a number, replaceable at anytime. Great place to work for a short time to add it to your resume. Don't try to make a career out of it. Even if you can survive the long haul, they will let you go before you can retire."
bad,The workplace is a get it the best way you can. If you need help it will come when it is convenient. You must have the ability to do your best without help and being micro-managed.
bad,Hard place to earn a decent living. Could not pay bills on a bus driver wage. Union has ruined this company. Best part was free park tickets. Just couldn't live off the wages.
bad,"It's not a bad company, until you look at your paycheck. "
bad,"TWDC is a greedy and manipulative company. The average worker is homeless and starving while the company has the utmost expectations from their employees.  Long, miserable hours in direct sunlight in long sleeves, socks and pants with very limited breaks.  Pay is not fair whatsoever.  They make it impossible to become full time so they do not have to give you benefits."
bad,Arrival 1 hour prior to curtain. Seat guests according to there tickets.  Observe audience to maintain order and safety.  I learned a lot about superior customer service.  Management works hard to ensure happiness of the guests.  You meet a lot of great people with this job.  The hardest part of the job maybe learning the correct procedures.
bad,There is a huge discrepancy in that the company values it employees.  Maybe their higher level management but not the employees who are there everyday.  There is poor communication throughout the entire company and lack of communication even in the department.  Compensation is poor and your annual bonuses are also not reflective of how appreciative they say they are of your work and efforts.
bad,"Don't expect to get anything accomplished at the creepiest place on earth. "
bad,Loved assisting the guest and helping families plan their Walt Disney World vacations. I was able to give the guest information on attractions that their family might be interested in while visiting Disney World.
bad,"The IT department is just about work."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"Projects are interesting; "
bad,"Disney is great as far as customers, and enviornment. We got free lunches and treats on the floor. But the chance of having a permenant positiuon in the company is slim to none. some of the management is not so good either. They all give you  incorrect inforation and blame you when customers want to speak to a supervisor. There point system is good though."
bad,"e uma empresa aparentemente boa, mas com algumas irregularidades.eu mim relaciono bem com todos funcionarios pois foram 8 anos de convivencia, eu acho que e mas dificil e a falta de comunicação por parte da direção com todos, o que mais mim agrada são todos alunos pois são muitos amorosos."
bad,"Very quick turnaround. Worked on many different projects and with many different people. Learned a lot about Management styles, and how to deal with certain personalities. Learned a ton about Consumer Products. The hardest part of my job was that it wasn't pushing my limits or creativity. The most enjoyable, meeting certain people and getting to build specific relationships."
bad,"Disney has 4 guiding principles that are memorized by everyone and practiced by few, they are courtesy, safety, show and efficiency. These principles are valuable if they are practiced as published."
bad,"Disney is a good company for people who want a lifelong career with one company. For people who come in from the outside it is regimented and the people are lifers in all aspects of their thinking. They know the ""Disney way"" of doing things and they expect a new comer to guess what they need. I got very little instruction on what they wanted me to do. I sat in my cubicle for more than a week waiting for an overworked recruiter (who started with the company 16 years ago as a ride operator) and poorly skilled practice leader to assign me work. On my last day the practice leader (who was in the office a couple times a week, was gravely unqualified to be a manager and would not have lasted a month with another company) told me ""I expected you to be more of a consultant and tell us what we should do. I gave you hints about what I wanted"". I then said: "" I thought the telling part was your job; here is a novel idea how about clear communication?  How about telling me what your expectations were? I am not good at guessing"". They fill most of their openings internally so if you start in the parks as a ride operator, a few years later you could be a poorly skilled middle manager in a business unit you have no skills in. They have all drank the Kool Aid and assume everyone wants their jobs so most of them have a PhD in backstabbing. The average"
bad,"My experience was not well. I felt used and looked over at my company. i worked for a third party through disney. They were very indecisive on when they chose to be Disney vs when to use ""we're not disney, it doesnt work like that"" i felt taken advantage of."
bad,Enjoyed working from home and setting my own schedule. Repetitive work with little opportunities for advancement. The position was as an independent contractor through the company Arise.
bad,I liked it but it was only temporary Thur a temp service management was okay for the most part I’ll work their again if the opportunity come towards me
bad,The Walt Disney Company claims to be very divers however there are strong prejudices against certain protected classes.  However the company will do everything it can to cover any sign of discrimination.
bad,"In an office-technical role, you will make more money than in the parks or resorts. However, anywhere you go in this company is very competitive and even though they scream the core values (The Four Keys) of the company...it is hardly ever valued or taken into account. Managers I have been exposed to, for the most part, have little care for the people beneath them and forget where they started. Training of employees is a joke, and the upsetting thing at the end of the day is while Walt screamed ""innovation"" - it takes months, years, or never for your ideas to even be implemented. While they are quality people who do work for the company, the majority are people who do not really know what they are doing, are paid horribly in compensation, and view you like a number instead of a person."
bad,"I would not recommend working for the walt disney company, in the past 5 years they have released as in terminated hundreds of employees. the company also does not offer a full retirement plan for employees who started from the year 2004."
bad,"el clima laboral es horrible, el sueldo es malo, trabajar en los parques es angustiante y agotador"
bad,"Disney overworks their employees AND combines that with poor pay, no overtime pay (with very long periods of mandatory overtime), a lack of benefits (poor 401k benefit), and taking time off can be very difficult. Raises barely cover or fail to cover inflation. WDI is located in Glendale, CA (Los Angeles) where the ultra expensive housing makes their poor compensation and overtime work EXTRA painful."
bad,If you are established its hard to move unless you know people. The younger the better. they rather mold you. They have their own language and parking is terrible.
bad,"commute. the reason why I am choosing to leave this job is the time and gas it requires to get there on time from my current location. disney overlooks possiblities that could happen to cast members. for example, they run their attendance by a point system. Calling out sick is three points added to your record, being late is 2 points. After a certain amout of points, you are called in to recieve a writtin on your record."
bad,It was a happy place to be but the people that worked there were not nice.  Maybe a couple.  Nobody wanted to help me and they mainly stuck by friends.
bad,"It is fun to work at Disneyland but they don't pay enough for the work that is required of us. It is fun to meet new people and interact with the guest, but what is expected versus what is paid is minimal."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Low pay and high stress for the amount of money the park makes. Easily punished for minor mistakes that are out of your control. Very little room for advancement.
bad,"This review is based on working in a Disney theme park. Working for Disney is worth it for the product we sell: happiness. But as amazing as creating magic is (and is really is amazing), it comes with a catch. Employees work to achieve impossibly high customer service standards for just above minimum wage, and have to deal with some of the worst guests in customer service history. It is not a job for the weak of heart. The perks that come with working for Disney are great, and the benefits package once an employees reaches full-time work status (which could take years), is comparable to none. Workplace morale is in a slow downward spiral, as the parent company focuses more money and energy on theme park expansions and company acquisitions instead of looking inward at the current employee base. There is an ""everyone is expendable"" mentality instead of a ""growth and development"" mentality that causes Disney to be a short-term employment opportunity for reliable and ambitious workers who would otherwise choose to stay."
bad,"Been in the same role, same shift, same position for 10 years with no changes. Great if you are looking for safety and security. Not so great if you want more."
bad,"Manipulative instead of motivational, low to average technical level personnel, relations and genealogy more important than professional skills, bully tactics."
bad,"The internship is hard work, nothing new or unexpected.  However, from my experience, being able to network with leaders or explore other aspects of the company was a no go even though this is the college program and students hope to get more out of the internship than just working 60+ hours."
bad,Nationally recognized poor compensation. No work life balance. More and more benefits being minimized or eliminated. ..................................
bad,I hesitate to actually review this place since I am unsure where this will be seen.  Suffice to say I worked for a boss that betrayed me and another that screamed at me and no support from HR.  Disney is well known in the industry for its particular specific brand of crazy environment and unless you swallow their particular Kool-aid you will not do well.
bad,"I had a lot of fun working for the park. Always meeting new people from all areas of the world. wearing interesting costumes. working Different places in the park. Its a fast paced job. Hours can be draining during holiday's but its exciting and forever changing. "
bad,"Good working environment. Low pressure, pleasant offices, great on-site cafeteria. Low pay, top-heavy management, too many layers of managers, unorganized,"
bad,"working 9.5 hours in a day"
bad,"Long hours. Really busy all the time and not enough staff available. poor management skills."
bad,Although my time at Disney was only five months.  It was a temporary assignment. I was grateful for the opportunity to work there.
bad,This was a good starter job. It was not the ideal place to work but was a good job for being in high school. Employees were fun to work with and management was very kind.
bad,"A typical day at work would be answering calls, emails, and make sure that guest had all of their needs taken care of. Over all the company is a descent place to work for. The company needs more Disney friendly workers."
bad,"Fun place to work.  Learned a lot.  Use cutting age technology.  The people that I worked with are mostly great.  Management in my group only think about the bottom line and care less about the people.  The company overall doesn't look at employees as people, rather just as resources. Very hard to get promotion.  Everybody is expected to put in more than 100% otherwise you're seen as incompetent.  This makes it difficult to have work/life balance for someone who has a demanding family life.  The company likes to outsource jobs because it's cheaper.  Layoffs are common."
bad,"Too many managers who are non productive, who pass on work to limited amount of workers who have to put in long hours to meet deadlines as there are not enough worker to do the work,"
bad,"I enjoyed working for Disney, but due to poor leadership the work environment was hostel. But I enjoy my job and the guest service I provide, the benefits are very good."
bad,You get pigeon holed into a position and then you get stuck- unless you're in one of the few departments that promotes just about every year. Then you get to watch your peers move up the chain while you toil away in mediocrity.
bad,"You will enjoy amazing health and savings benefits, plus who doesn't love to get in free. However it is very difficult to move up and pay is well below fair. Part of your pay is just being able to say you work there."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Online Shopping; Marketing; Internet Sales; management skills; processing banking transactions 
bad,Can be a good place to work but depends on where in Disney. Very seniority-based.
bad,"Working at Rainforest Cafe was interesting and had it's good moments. However, I very strongly feel that the company overworks and underpays it's staff. You put in long hours without any breaks, and your paycheck just doesn't show it. The environment was challenging, which would be welcome if you had any room for advancement, but you did not. I enjoyed working with the people at this job, but overall this was the worst job I've had, I'm afraid to say."
bad,I worked at EPCOT in the fall of 2011. One of the hardest jobs I have had to this day.
bad,"I thought I would love working for the Walt Disney Company, but my time there was full of frustration. The most valuable thing I learned from working there, was what I didn't want in future roles."
bad,"Management sucked, no one knew what they were doing, absolutely no communication. Policies changed from manager to manager. Pay was horrible, if you didn't work 50+ hrs. a week you couldn't get by."
bad,"I’ve worked Merchandise and Food & Beverage for about 15 years. "
bad,Very high stress job. One call right after the other with no time to catch your breath between calls. Very micro managed. They give you seven weeks of “training” but then throw you to the wolves without you really being prepared.
bad,"Management has their favorites, didnt want to work with my schedule only with others."
bad,tellement d'effort à fournir pour aucune reconnaissance que se soit pour le salaire et évolution de poste.
bad,"This is not a company that is easy to move up in unless you are dating someone who knows someone that will help you move up in the company. I've had several friends (with years more experience) who have been passed over for jobs because of this. If you work hard and network, it is possible to move up. You don't get paid hardly anything! $10 a hour is the current pay rate for front line cast members, coordinators and managers only make a few dollars more per hour. Thankfully I worked at a location that offers a lot of overtime, but that is not common at most locations. You have to ask yourself, is it worth it to work yourself to death to make a meager $15 a hour? It is impossible to make enough money to have excess cash and have enough free time to enjoy your life."
bad,"TWDC is one of the most trusted brands in the world, and it did not reach that position without a lot of very smart people working at the top of the organization."
bad,"there is not really much room for advancement, out of the 10 years i was there only 1 person has been through emerging leaders(our manager program). the only real perk is i get to sign in my friends and family for free but other than that there really is not much for upside. sure sometimes the throw a small party and give you food during cast appreciation week but i never really feel appreciated, it feels like hush perks if anything. moral is low..... at least in my department."
bad,"My typical day at work was I was responsible for daily incoming cash, checks, ach transfer & post payments in SAP. Enjoyed the free pass to disneyland"
bad,you work like a dog at this place and they tell have a problem with your work. It can be a good job in just then Management make the work day so hard and want you to do crazy work in a lil time
bad,"I hated my time at the Disney Store, mainly down to management. Most co workers were fine, the pay was pretty good and they do have a rigorous interview process (which seems a little unnecessary for a retail job). Hopefully management has changed."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"Makes for a good retirement job but will never provide a livable wage. Management only sees its cast as a means to an end. Most ""promotions"" are lateral and will not lead to a drastic pay increase."
bad,It should be a fun place to work. The cool products and IP keep you going - but the culture is a drag. It really isn't enjoyable and its very political. Its not until you work somewhere else that you realize how unhappy you were at Disney.
bad,"Its a good place too work depending on what you do there. Each department is responsible for there own groups. My typical day is busy.  Thats the best part, quick days that go by fast.  I also the interaction that my job affords me. Twelve people to facilitate an entire studio as well as off studio locations. Micro managed with bells and whistles and constantly watched are some the things I don't care for. My management team is inexperienced and clueless at there craft. Those are the the hardest parts of the job. Most of my coworkers and the workers at the company are good people. Yet a lot of stuff falls through the cracks of such a large corporation. Since its entertainment theres a fair amount of red tape and politics. Over the last few years it has seemed to increase with the acquisition of Pixar, Marvel and Lucas Films.  Its still a good company overall, but it isn't really Disney anymore.  The company perks are the best part about the job, though they have limited or completely eliminated through the years as the company has become more profitable. The atmosphere is also a welcomed sight.  How many people can say they work at major movie studio."
bad,"Management is stylish but inept. Layoff rounds average every 12-16 months but management is rarely affected which is confusing for staff and tough on morale."
bad,"Even though I worked on a team that took on every mobile platform, we were still at the bottom of the barrel.  Management is terrible and even though you are expected to be very knowledgeable in various fields like QA Testing, Analytics and completing full testing cycles within a few days, the company is so cheap that they pay minimum wage and is highly unlikely to hire on employees that are actually hard working, extremely knowledgeable and not a ""favorite"" employee."
bad,"Nobody gets promoted, but nobody gets fired either.  Management has no idea what mentoring or communication are."
bad,"When I started at Disney, I started as a temporary employee as did every one else and after completing my probationary period, I would have been a full time employee. My position was a Guest Services Representative where I worked in an inbound call center and helped guest place online orders and responded to emails.  It began as a good work environment, management was helpful in the beginning,  and they told us about a lot of advancement opportunities that would be available once I became a full time employee.  After working there for about a month, I was offered a new position as a Dine Representative where I helped guest plan their dining reservations and Disney experiences for vacations.  I was a little hesitant but I am always open to learning new things so I told my manager that I would give it a try.  I did not know that management did not train for this position.  I had one full day of training from other employees that were not very knowledgeable about the position and then I was on my own.  With only one day of training, I did not know everything that I should have known such as information about the park, locations of restaurants, and many other things that guests were inquiring about.  I did not like the fact that I could not offer my guests the best experience possible because I didn't know a lot of the information that they asked me about.  I wanted to change back to my old position where I was thoroughly trained buy I did not know that once I tried out the new position, I couldn't go back to my original position so I was stuck in a position that I wasn't thoroughly"
bad,"Hardly any room for growth, too many politics, and fake. If you like kids, it's great, but the company is fun because the staff makes it that way. Too strict though."
bad,It's a OK job.  Not suited for people with a great deal of experience and knowledge.  Law enforcement frowned upon / not wanted only when needed.  They do not fit the character / persona that  they portrait.
bad,"Interns are worked odd hours and make less than standard cast members, all while getting no pto or health insurence despite working full time hours. Honestly if you get a full time congrats, but if you have pt or are dcp run far and fast."
bad,"No hope of full time or benefits, no career help or advancement, difficult to get time off for illnesses. Poor training, and extreme lack thereof. Felt as if I was completely disposable, even though my passion was to learn and grow with the company."
bad,"As a first job, the place is amazing. Different types of benefits and perks really make working here fun. After the honeymoon phase of working for TWDC, you start to notice how there is really no progression. I learned that once I became a lead, there is no more advancements in your career there unless you desire to become a manager. Unfortunately, to be a manager at Disneyland requires you to drop everything in your life for a low salary. There are no connections to anything corporate unless you intern, for free, at the studios. Even then, those opportunities are very limited. Seldom, does the corporate side look for employees in the parks. All advancements in a career in the parks stop at manager. You could opt to be a Disney Ambassador but unfortunately, that role can only last a year until the next ambassadors and picked."
bad,"My particular position was new within the company, and no one really knew what to do with the output of my work. I got burnt out pretty quickly given the situation."
bad,Management had not understanding of SDLC and was not open to being educated by the SME's they hired. That made it difficult in reviews and career advancement.
bad,"Disney clearly has no other solution but to hire more people and require extra hours for months because they don't know how to be more efficient. A lot of little things that you have to remember, not enough pay for all that."
bad,"The constant change over in personnel was staggering and you were left with the feeling that no matter how hard you worked, you were never going to be able to catch up because, you were having to do two jobs, as someone was always leaving and / or you were training a new person.  Very stressful environment, but you did learn a great deal.  The Disney job looked real good on your resume and propelled you to much better job offers outside the company.  That's why there was always so much turn over."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,"So, Disney isn't the same company it was 20-30 years ago. They removed many of the benefits for employees, opportunities for advancement are slim, and pay is marginal for the amount of work you do. Also, lots of drama regarding coworker relationships and sometimes management does nothing because of either Union policies or HR/Labor relations policies that have a way of convoluting decision-making."
bad,I worked for The Walt Disney Company for almost 7 years. I saw a real future there until I realized how much precedence bureaucracy has over the daily operation.
bad,"Derecting people how to park."
bad,"Great environment,great benefits,lots of gift,lots of training,very stressful place to work,high volume of very demanding guest.   But you meet wonderful people from all over the world who sometimes you become friends with through the years of then traveling to the same location."
bad,"Typical call center hours and environment.  People are generally happy to be there working for Disney.  There is a friendly company culture, but that doesn't mean the culture is good.  Apart from the friendliness, it is no different from any other corporate setting.  Pay is very low and commission is kept a secret until you are about 6 weeks in.  Many metrics to achieve before you can get the commission.  There is room for advancement, but unless you are just enamored with ""working for Disney"" you could make more money elsewhere."
bad,"It's a great environment, had the time of my life at my internship at WDW. Would not want to make it a career at a park anyway, however, the job itself was a lot of fun."
bad,trabajo duro y pesado sin dias de descanso con un pago que no cubre el excesivo desgaste físico
bad,"I worked in the entertainment department as a character performer. The job was incredibly fun as you can imagine, and employee safety was top priority. Very friendly and fun work environment with lots of perks and fun events, but pay was very low, a truly unlivable wage."
bad,"A typical day at work in Disney is to me flexible and able to move on the fly! I was asked to don several hats and get things done in other roles that I had not been hired to fulfill. However, I am a team player that can play several positions on the team! The management team I worked with did have issues in being transparent with the team at times. Especially when it comes to budgeting and funding for the projects. I was signed on for a 6 month project and then told the project was not getting funded after 4 months. So please be aware things can change and move fast at Disney and you might not be considered on whether these changes can affect your life and well being."
bad,"There are plenty of opportunities to learn (most of them out of necessity, not for your personal growth) and the company really does like to push a ""Disney Magic"" culture to all employees. However, infrastructure changes are frequent and, as a result, layoffs are a common thing. Unless you were able to land a higher up position, you are made disposable from day one. I have seen everyone from producers, project managers, department managers, and QA staff laid off in my time here. Most employees are hired on contract and it is rare for anyone to work for the company to the end of their contract before a layoff happens."
bad,i enjoyed my stay there because of the positivity. ilearned how to make happy calls and intake happy calls for disneystore.com. the hardest part was dealing with irate customers and keeping up with the always changings trainings.
bad,Company to attached to the 80s corporate america mentality. Needs a cultural shake up. They are loosing all the talent to more progressive media companies like Netflix and Hulu.
bad,"Do not go here if you want to leave. It's very hard to leave because you get comfortable. It is impossible to move up beyond a certain level. Nice company, fun place. Use it for a college job or retirement years job."
bad,"Training is very good, however there is more negative that possitive. work life balance is bad. A lot of extra hours required, which is good when you want to make enough money. Management is horrible."
bad,"Greeted and helped guests with merchandise purchases, inquiries and provided them with exceptional service. You are a small part of the overall WDW world. Management is supportive but limited. Cast members are often stressed out due to long hours."
bad,"If you like working from 5AM to 2PM, then this might be the job for you. Especially if you like working for ten dollars an hour. If you're new to QA or even have a few years experience, this is going to be the kind of place you end up. It's not horrible, but you really have to grin and bare it to make it through most days."
bad,"Disney is a great place to work if you a kid at hear and want a fun job.  Believing in magic, and pixie dust and enchanted castles is what makes a great Cast Member.  However, if you are seeking decent pay with a regular full time hours, Disney is not the place.  The park is over 60 years old, with MANY high seniority Cast Members from the 1960's grandfathered into newer contracts, still working through out the resort.  Which means, Full Time is nearly nonexistent.  I tried for 5 years......Disney is a great seasonal job, but nothing to make a living off of, sadly.  Walt is turning in his grave."
bad,"The management are quite rude, condescending and put a lot of unnecessary pressure onto staff which means that you can't enjoy your job as much as you would like. The perks you get with the job are pretty good and the majority of the customers that you get are really friendly and polite however the way the management treat staff outweighs the perks of the job. I wish they'd have explained at the job interviews what it really is like to work with them because they made it sound like a really friendly and comfortable environment however its the complete opposite. They are very funny with shifts too as they will put you in for extra hours without even asking but if you have to tell them you cant do the added shift they end up being moody with you and just shift it to another time that's suitable for them."
bad,This job was fun to do all the interactions with people where amazing and great. Although my coworkers where not the best of people to work with and there was no room for advancement in the company.
bad,"Learned to work with and for a diverse group of people."
bad,Disney is a good company overall and has a lot of different divisions/departments to work in. A typical day is pretty fast paced and you get to learn your immediate co-workers pretty well. The hardest part of working at Disney is that there is a lot of bureaucracy so it's very difficult to bring new ideas to the table.
bad,Supervisors were less than helpful. Guests left on hold over an hour due to this. I began work w/15 others & only abt 3 were left when I finally quit.
bad,"Working as a student during their summer college program was the only way I could every afford to go to Disney World, so I am very grateful for the experience.  Unfortunately, they did abuse me and other students with working strange hours and half the pay of their full-time employees doing the same job functions.  We got schedules every two weeks that were never identical and one day I would work night shift closing at 11 then have to be in at 5:30 the next morning for the next shift.  I got sick once from lack of sleep over this."
bad,"I love my work and, more importantly, the people I work with; however; job creation has stagnated and there is too much work and not enough people to meet all of our goals."
bad,It’s ok. It has great benefits but the cast members are definitely not taken care of very well and when we start to mass quit they bring some shiny new thing to the parks and people stay for the free tickets to expirience said shiny to thing because we don’t even make enough to buy a one day ticket. If you just want to work here part time and not move up within the company it is a cool place. Be warned staying here for longer than 5 years it becomes soul crushing.
bad,"Honestly this job got worse the longer I worked here. It's all fun and magic when you first start, and then you realize that managers and cast alike take part in drama and let it heavily affect the work place. Managers in my area were known to play favorites, gang up and bully cast members on stage and off stage, and sometimes even sexually harass us. "
bad,"inbound calls, hard schedules, hard to move up but supporting the Disney brand is fun.  Under paid a lot of responsibilities. little recognition."
bad,"Yes, it's Disney. But all that means is pictures of Mickey Mouse everywhere. It's still a HUGE corporation whose goal is to make money, like any other job."
bad,When I worked there it was under Nikki Bryant. They are cold heartless people. The money was good. The benefits were great.
bad,"•	Assisted guest with placing orders"
bad,"Great opportunity to work for a fortune 500 company. However, the compensation was low."
bad,"Pay is horrible, company does not value cast members. I gave Disney 2 stars for the culture. The people you work with are amazing. I made life long friendships with coworkers and guests. Although it was difficult, I did enjoy going to work."
bad,"Unless you love everything Disney or are desperate for work, don't do it. Especially if you have family or loved ones you'd like to be around. You'll spend most of your time at work getting paid very little."
bad,If you need a place to get good money this is the place to be. The discounts are the best. The kitchens can be much cleaner. The senior cooks could be more polite. I had to buy lunch on my lunch breaks.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
bad,Disney's Seattle office is a strange mix of overworked full time employees and an abundance of contractors. The managers are highly ineffective and the lack of foresight is challenging to navigate.
bad,a typical work day at disney warehouse is normally alot of work then by lunch time it slows down. the communication there is completely off and when there isn't any work to do they would keep you there the entire shift instead of just letting people go home.
bad,"this place was okay. there was a lot of drama behind the scenes with management who would not know how to act professionally, but aside from that, it was a nice job"
bad,"I worked in Shared Services which was the corporate division of the Disney Company. the culture was different there than working for the actual parks and resorts. Management was not really supportive in my department, and it was difficult to advance if you weren't in contact with the right people."
bad,This company is only in it for the money. Management will make it seem as if they care but they don't. Guest are really rude and will do whatever it take to get what they want. Most of the time managers will side with them.
bad,"I discussed in a previous review that this company parades this coveted internship to lure people into it. They say having this internship on your resume will help you get jobs and it's extremely prestigious."
bad,typical day come in assist guest with anyhing they need they call i answer
bad,"Like working in a mine field full of daisies. Wonderful and amazing projects, awesome brand recognition outstanding employee benefits (even for temp personnel). management came in two flavors, best friends or evil dictators, Working here was a definite love/hate relationship."
bad,A regular day at work is interacting with guests and wiping down tables also serving when needed. I learned to deal with guests around the world with many different culture background which was difficult to please.
bad,"If you love Disney, working at the Disney store can be a lot of fun, however, don't ever take it as a full time job. The hours are really bad and the management team's are really poor at communicating with their fellow employees. Trying to change shifts is next to near impossible. It's fun for a high school job."
bad,"The work culture is great and everyone is helpful and friendly. "
good,"tu sueldo no queda fijo, ya que disney paga por el libro que vendas"
good,I have always loved Disney and always will. When I had the opportunity to move to Florida to work there I was so excited. Working at Disney was fun but the leaders were not helpful and did not treat their cast members with respect.
good,"Disney was a fun place to visit, but once you’re employed by the mouse it loses all the magic. Stressful work environment, long hours, overworked and severely underpaid."
good,"This is the worst job to work for. The only good thing about is the discounts. You receive free park tickets, 50% on Disney hotels and certain Disney restaurants."
good,Good experience to have. Every department is different. Management is needs to work on its treatment of employees. Work life balance has room to improve.
good,"Too much effort, for very little return; treated like the lowest of the low. Managers don't care about you. co works can be annoying."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"It was a job. You go do your shift and then you are finished. If they need help they will call and if they don't they won't. The position is very political and they are always changing the processes in the way things are done. Management falls in the same boat as everyone else is, so they get frustrations and are able to help."
good,They only care about the money they get from their guests. They will throw the lower end employees under the bus to serve the greater corporate needs.
good,"Productive all time "
good,"Horrible management. No benefits, low pay. Nothing magical about it. Stressful environment. No benefits. Difficult working with mamagement. Competitive atmosphere."
good,The Disney company is great so long as you aren't in waterparks. They literally put everything that happens in the park on the backs of the lowest paid cast members and don't have many chance for advancement in recreation as a whole. Many other roles are great for advancement and guest interaction but recreation not so much.
good,"Housekeepers and union signed agreement with Disney for 13 rooms per day per employee. Check out rooms take a minimum of 50 minutes to clean. Stay over rooms can  take up to 20 minutes. Management will pass out your assignment sheet for the day and key. After considering morning and before leaving tasks and two breaks you have 6.5 hours for room cleaning. Mathematically and factually there is not enough time to do your job the way you are expected and required to do. "
good,"they're always restructuring, there's no advancement or security or room for promotion.  management tells you nothing about what's really going on.  it's a mix of mad men and high school."
good,This was a great time as a intern but they only pay minimum wage.  We were never guaranteed to get a full 40 hours.  The entire time you are pinching pennies to get by.
good,"The Yellow Shoes division at Disney is company that Dows not deliver on it's full potential due to constant restructuring and questionable management. The individual employees are talented, and Disney as a whole is a smart company to work for, but this division does not have the visionary leaders necessary to achieve the potential of the business unit."
good,"My personal experience wasn't the best working there but it is an amazing company, just my department and management. I believe that with a different set of managers and better understanding of my actual job title I could've went farther with the company. but the horrible management, underpaid and lack of communication it wasn't the right fit"
good,"Disney is a great place to work if you're just looking for a supplementary stream of income. Work schedules can vary from week-to week. One week one can be scheduled more than 60 hours, the next three not scheduled at all. That being said, the bonds made between cast members are usually very tight."
good,"Coming in with a love of Disney and the culture is important, if you don't love it you won't make it. Long hours, late nights (I was often there until 2am and sometimes had to be in the next morning at 7am), and little pay make it hard to want to keep working there. If not for the magical moments you get in your job - which become less and less the longer you're there - there would be no reason to stay. Unfortunately, the management also doesn't care about your condition then expect you to be there no matter what. I was in the hospital getting my appendix removed due to severe appendicitis and  I had to call in and receive a point every day I missed - they didn't care that I was literally in the hospital."
good,"Some days were okay. Then came the day the threatened to fire me because I was 20 minutes late. My dad worked at the mall. I had to wait for him to get off work, come all the way home, we had to get my baby sister ready and in the car seat, and travel all the way back to the mall again to get me to work. It was my first time being late and they threatened to fire me for it. Since they threatened to fire me at my first job for being only 20 minutes late, I quit on the spot. I was devastated."
good,"As a Sales individual at this Company, you can thrive as there is no cap and you have the ability to control your income through hard work and perseverance. Unfortunately, moving in to management means that you are subject to (in this department) Florida wages and salary which, in the state of California, don't carry you far. Couple with that the lowering of incentive/commissions each year, year-over-year and lack of progression/development, the longevity of lasting in a sales management role is extremely difficult without a secondary income."
good,"Really depends on the department you work in.  If you're lucky, your direct manager and team lead is supportive of your career growth and work/life balance."
good,The management was okay. Worked outdoors. sometimes long hours. It was a high school and into college job. It was fun for the time being. I would go back
good,They choose to let employees who have only been there a few months act as floor supervisors to guest they claim to treat as family. They also allow employees to be rude to other employees with no consequences if the employee is liked by actual supervisors or people that work at there podium. Overall working at Disney is not a magical experience but during the holiday's they did have magical moments.
good,"Great place to work if you're in the right department, but don't count on job security as they have annual lay offs twice a year. Corporate politics are a huge play here and constantly change, so job security is non-existent."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Im not really sure what to say. it was amazing at first but living in fl in 90+ weather, it wasnt magical wearing long sleeves and pants just to cover up my tattoos."
good,"Personal experience was not that great. But got to learn a lot , every day was a new challenge. The co - workers were not that good a lot of office politics was very difficult to survive."
good,"no benefits ever, no raises ever, not ever sure what was happening"
good,They tend to remind you that you are replaceable. Not too great if you are in school because they have mandatory availability during your finals which makes things more hectic.
good,"clean,sell,i learned something new,the management,i reserved the comments,the co-workers,i reserved the comments,the hardest part of job is too heavy,the most enjoyable is meet new people."
good,"Retrospectively, I loved working for Disney. In the moment -- not so much. Especially being a college program intern, you get bad hours and even worse pay. It looks incredible on a resume, and I don't regret that I did it. Everyone's experience is different. I just happened to not have a great time. However, I miss the company and I am in the process of applying for PT and FT, if that says anything."
good,There are many perks to working for Disney but there are also a lot of politics and constant change because of the type of business it is. Depending on the department you can definitely grow in your position.
good,"The company doesn't care about you as an individual.  They only care about customers and making more money.  As an employee, you are replaceable.  There are a lot more people lined up for a job there, so they treat employees as dispensable."
good,"Low energy more of a Marin culture, not San Francisco. Young staff with limited people skills looking to cause problems with co-workers. on the edge of the city not easy to travel and parking is not free."
good,"ok, to work their  more busy and time is going fast, get over time when they have  as much as you can time. if your have good experience . and good insurance ."
good,mangers were not fair at all. they do not know how to handle situations in the correct manner. scheduling always had issues on how to give the correct availability.
good,"A typical day at the travel center includes daily updates on travel sales. Main job is to build Disney travel packages for all budgets. This is a non face to face job. Typically, you are timed and monitored for quality assurance. The workplace culture is hot to cold, depending on how sales are doing. My favorite things were the perks of going to the Disney parks, and getting that warm feeling when you made a families day by selecting the perfect package. The hard part was listing to yourself on a recording. All in all, this is a fast paced environment and it requires a lot of time. Disney offers their employees lots of fun things to do, but, there is never time to participate due to work schedules. Oh, one last thing, you have to pass training in order to even work on the floor. If you cannot pass, you will be told to leave."
good,"If you are a college student with no ""real"" responsibilities, it was fantastic. I have been hired at many locations by having the Disney name on my resume. But, looking back, I went into debt as I could not afford to live in the area."
good,"Typical day at work is usually being harassed by management to sell product while stating that ""we dont sell product we sell memories"" which is just a cheesy way to say make more money . You only advance if you are a butt kisser. They never give you the opportunity to. It isn't about hard work it's about being a butt kisser which i must say since i can't use explicit language. Management is constantly harassing you. It is very demanding. Guests are incredibly rude which is to be expected, so not the worst part of the job. The worst part is really the management that is not hired from within the company. Many of them are hired without previous disney experience so they don't have the qualities that they are trying to force you to have so there is no real opportunity to ever make it past coordinator to leader. Free entry and the holiday discount are really the only good things."
good,"Even as an intern, I would not stay with Disney for so long if I didn't like the people I worked with. There are virtually no benefits except getting into the parks for free. You cannot make a real living off this experience let alone save money."
good,"I worked for TWDC over 12 years and was promoted 3x during my tenure with the company. Overall, great experience but not a lot of room for growth in the corporate segment. Also, there is very little diversity in executive/senior leadership positions in corporate segment. Who you know carries more weight than what you know."
good,"I loved working for this company because I was able to make so much magic for our guests and it was very rewarding for me. As for working for the company itself, my leadership teams weren't the best and they weren't that helpful. It was very frustrating having to go through multiple people to get through to the person you actually need to talk to about an issue. I also hated the point system they use on you. For every tardy/absence, you get a point. So, if you are sick, you get penalized for staying home and taking care of yourself."
good,"The benefits at Disney are some of the best I've had.  Great insurance and discounts.  While I was there the amount of overtime required was excessive and would be forced into your schedule when it was convenient for the company.  My father had cataract surgery and I was not able to accommodate that into my schedule despite many requests/appeals/attempts for schedule trades, etc.  I had to call out unpaid and I lost $400 in income that month.  I feel like that should have been approached differently and with a more human touch."
good,"This job was fun to have while in college. For a while the low wages were okay because of the other benefits such as discounts and sign ins. However, they have recently been taking away many of these benefits. The ticket prices continue to rise while the wages are stagnant. There is little care for the employees, as they are seen as very replaceable. It is also quite difficult to move up due to poor management."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,The management in the department I work for needs a major overhaul! Lack of focused direction and learning experiences rarely occurred. Hands were always tied when it came to doing my job due to leadership/management. Not much of a work environment for anyone looking to learn and grow in the field.
good,"I learned a  lot on guest service, food safety, training, laws etc. - the basic skills to understand a restaurant operation. For promotions, it's all about whom you know, not about skills. Many management just moved up from the bottom, so don't know much about the restaurant operational skills that apply at outside real restaurants."
good,"There are pros and cons that come with a job with the Walt Disney Company. As a College Program Intern (though you are under-compensated, put in poor living conditions, and worked to the bone) you meet a lot great people, have some wonderful experiences and it is a great internship to have on your resume. If you are looking to further your Disney Career, you need to either be hired into Professional/Management internships right away, or directly into Line-of-Business. This is because to be hired into entry-level operations is to undergo a long a grueling journey for even minimum job advancement. Do to the sheer number of employees and the craziness that plagues daily park and resort operations, good work can often go unnoticed; and with so many highly qualified and wonderful people clamoring for very view higher positions (that are often given to interns anyway) you'd have more luck swimming out of a pool of syrup than furthering your professional prospects in operations. Leadership is hit or miss, either you have absolutely stellar folks who are fantastic at what they do or people that (for one reason or another) make the operation ten times more complicated than it needs to be. It is also important to note that choosing to work for Disney is to see the less shiny side of the Mouse, a clear glimpse into the corporate atmosphere that every day becomes more apparent.  Concern for ideals and the treatment of Guests and Cast Members is penultimate when compared to furthering company profits and gains."
good,There is no room for advancement and they are unwilling to give a pay raise. They'd rather hire management from the outside than promote within with people who already know the company and how it runs.
good,"Between low compensation and high demand of workload with surprignly little hours, it is a company that tends to take the upmost advantage of it's employees. employees have resources at their disposal, but a living wage is not among them."
good,The people you work with are usually really good people. Managers are some of the worst managers I have ever had. The pay is ok but not the best. Discounts are good.
good,"As alluring as Disney's content is, it's corporate culture is stale, byzantine and deeply hierarchical. Getting nearly anything done is a chore. "
good,"Working at Disney is what anyone can ask for, but unfortunately you have to be cut out for it. When I was hired I started out as an attractions Cast Member. My duties were simple and easily manageable at first. I worked in two locations in Disney California Adventure. I would be scheduled nights for World of Color and days I was scheduled at the Hyperion Theater, The first month I was there I was trained at the Hyperion Theater, it was a lot of information to take in and remember, but with time you start to get the hang of it. When my training was over, I thought I would be working regularly at that location. No, unfortunately, I was scheduled for World of Color for the next month. I would later then be scheduled at Hyperion, forgetting any knowledge that I had learned before. It was a very stressful, and every time I asked a lead for help, I would get the help and then I would be personally talked about later. I had to find that out from overhearing a conversation between leads. When I wanted to talk to the actual manager about it, there would be no one available to talk to. It wasn't until later when I was called in for my attendance, is when I actually met my manager face to face for the first time in the 2 months that I had been hired. I explained my situation and let them know what was effecting my attendance. Even with giving my complete availability, they still seemed to disregard it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the guests. Hearing their stories on how far they traveled for the one day or the week they were staying. Truly inspiring. But, everyone's"
good,I worked here for a while. Disney is very strict with attendance and performance. Most days I was scheduled at least 12 hours straight. New employees and interns get worked the most.
good,"Disney isn't what it used to be as a company to work for, according to people I've talked to who worked there 20+ years and then left due to the company taking a downward turn. The fact that Walt Disney World is mostly unionized is probably the only good thing. Management has gone downhill, and my experience there was mediocre. Wasn't the worst job I've had, wasn't the best. But I wouldn't change the experience for the world. It was a once in a lifetime experience, and I made friends from around the world."
good,"If you want to be able to feel great about yourself and the job you do, it will be difficult to maintain that here.  Enough is seemingly never enough."
good,"Fun place to work, but there is little to no advancement even after years of hard work. Pay is not adequate. Getting free admission to the parks is great. The work is stimulating and always changing. Always learning new things. If you get a good manager, the hard work will be worth it."
good,"Is a great job if you're not looking for career advancement, but little growth and not a lot of opportunity. The people their are nice though, however, work gets redundant."
good,"Some days can be hard, where there's not enough merchandise in the store to support fixtures. With the help of teamwork, we come up with different ideas and make changes."
good,Manager and director were condescending and micro-managing.  Very professionally discourteous.  Little or no work/life balance.  Very disjointed organization; no common vision.
good,"It was fun working there, but the pay is sub par. Only good benefit is being able to go into the park for free. Good first time job"
good,Great company to work for. It always felt great helping people with their vacation and to hear their excitement. I learned how to give exceptional customer service not only over the phone but also through instant messaging. Management was great during hiring process but over all not so great keeping up with every employee. Co-workers were great very motivated and helping. The hardest part of the job were the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you get to go to any Disney park for free and you get a couple of passes for family and friends.
good,"The College Program is great for some people.  You get to meet people from all over the world, but you also only get federal minimum wage in most cases.  We all know that isn't enough money."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"This local company has been here in this market for about 17 years.  Not very many business's know about them, and they do not market themselves in this area,  no building signage, a poor radio signal, No proof of listenership, yet expect big dollars for a product that really has no value, except the word DISNEY.   I was advised from previous employers not to take this job, but I was up for the challenge.  They cannot keep sales people and are a rotating door in and out fast.  Even after I was let go for lack of sales, following salespeople have been fired. Latest manager (3rd for me in 10 months), is a wonderful lady.  She knows her stuff, but has no support from the offices in California, regarding keeping staff that are short timers.  Most of them are in fact, let go shortly after hired.  When I went to work for this place, there was only the manager and the event coordinator.  A sales person was hired just before I was, and let go shortly after I was.   Typical day at work was to arrive at 8 leave by 7 or whenever you were able to get something done.  The only thing I enjoyed about working here, were the support staff of other stations, those I worked with here in Seattle, the local manager and the ego associated with working for a large corporation such as DISNEY.  It really was a job with ""Golden Handcuffs"".  Everything you created as a professional salesperson, had to be approved, and alot of times vetted up the a manager in Southern California.  One particular timely proposal I lost took 3 months to be approved from upper management, beyond Seattle.   As you can see,"
good,It's just a fun thing to do in college. If you're a disney fanatic then it's a no brainer. It is good general customer service experience to have on your resume but then I would say sales experience is probably more valuable. If all you wanna do is go to disney then yes do it but other than that I'd say there are better options for building a resume.
good,A typical day at work can go from relaxed to stressful within seconds. My job in particular is to cater to costumed characters' needs. That are not a very thankful group of people. The entertainment department is referred to as Disney High because that is the level of maturity 90% of the time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people who go out of their way to make things difficult. The most enjoyable part is seeing happy guests watch a successful show.
good,"It  was a fun experience. Even though I temporarily worked for Disney On Ice  I learnt a lot about merchandising,  time management, and cash handling in a fast paced environment."
good,"Good: learn new things every day, fun people to work with, all about the environment and animals."
good,"This is a company that values customer service and take very good care of each guests needs. My journey here has been okay. It’s not what i expected but it was fine. Working in a customer service driven company can be tough bc you always have to keep the guest is happy, you kind of forget about your own peace and sanity."
good,"If you’re desperate to work but don’t plan on staying, the management is absolutely horrendous and protected against any disciplinary action due to old contracts they are on."
good,"I worked at multiple locations in the theme parks, including food and beverage, attractions, and entertainment operations. While day-to-day tasks varied, all locations were fun and fast-paced."
good,"The DRC or Disney Reservation Center is the worst place on all Disney to work with. Mandatory overtime every week, they use a very penilizing metric system to grade and pay your incentives. Yo can easly get a zero if you can’t find Cinderella Royal Table wich needed to be booked an year in advance."
good,"It was a draining job for the minimum pay and the amount of ungrateful guests who would yell at things we had no control over, but a lot of times I took great pride in the work I did. I oftentimes miss the work I did, but the ""disney look"" is too restrictive and I felt too robotic, as if I couldn't be myself. Guests like people to be outgoing, funny, themselves--not some robot going through the motions. I felt under appreciated for the work I did. I think my entire department felt under appreciated. Little by little, we all left. This job did NOT work as a student. I tried transferring, but was not able to, so I had to quit. My department was nice because we worked inside and had a small department and knew everybody. Maybe I'll go back someday. If you don't mind having your life taken over by your job with little to no gratefulness from your management, feel free to work here."
good,"I had a fun time doing my job, but scheduling is very erratic. You can work a shift from 14:45-12:15 and then get scheduled 8:45 the very next morning. And during peak season, you must be fully available. If you have something to do (especially around the holiday season) you better have planned for that a year in advance. The next piece is hit or miss. The people working there are very... should I say, ""cliquey"". You might start to feel like you reverted back to high school. There can be a lot of down time, which could be nice, but can also make your day feel like it is going slower. The most enjoyable part of working for Disney is the joy that you can bring to families. Out of all the people's vacations you ""ruin"" (or so they say) it feels great when you can make the guest smile."
good,"My organization consisted primarily of new leadership, primarily those promoted from within, with little to no leadership experience and what they did have amounted to extremely unprofessional behavior. My director had clear favorites and they were allowed latitude many of did not have, such as coming in at noon and leaving at 4..to go to happy hour with her. Disney is NOT what many would imagine, not the happiest place on earth yet I did build some strong relationships."
good,"The enthusiasm for the Guest experience should be matched by the enthusiasm for the employee experience. It is not."
good,"The crew you find yourself working with become your family, and end up having your back far more than the leads or managers. The hours are cutthroat, the company does not care about you as an individual."
good,"Overall, I learned multiple facets of media event production. I specialized in event transportation for the majority of time with Disney, organizing, managing, developing, and executing transportation for all our media guests during marketing events. I created and managed budgets, staffing, vendor relationships, and internal Disney partnerships. I also coordinated our Disney Reps Program The Disney Reps host our media guests to ensure that they were at their interviews on time. The most challenging part of my job was the timeline. Media are prone to make last minute decisions in regards to their event confirmation. This makes planning transportation very difficult, but I learned multiple ways to make sure I was always fully prepared. The most enjoyable part of my role was being a part of the Disney brand. I enjoyed making magic for all of our guests. Unfortunately the Media Events department has limited options for advancement."
good,"Top management heavy and the ""leaders"" for our group only cared about making themselves look good in order to get their fat bonuses and pay increases. No mentoring, no added support, very political internally.  Low pay with lots of work that becomes redundant.  Surprisingly, no big ideas or creativity are welcomed since corporate doesn't want to do anything that may risk the perfect family wholesome image.  Moral is always low with a lot of ""cast members"" feeling stuck.  Not even sure having Disney on your resume gives you an advantage. Absolutely no opportunity for promotion since leadership only promotes those that are ""yes"" men/women and don't question authority."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I enjoyed doing the Disney College Program, it was a lot of fun! I enjoyed working in the parks and the people I worked with. It was an amazing experience getting work with people from all over the world."
good,Disney is a very large company.  There is no easy way to rate the role or department that you are in due to the wide variance in experiences.  It is highly dependent upon the leader that you work for.
good,"Working for the Walt Disney Company is a unique experience, in that you may have an amazing or miserable time working here. I fall in the middle of this spectrum. "
good,"Seniority Runs the Job Task"
good,the management was great. a typical day at work was getting there and getting an assignment for an area to stock for the day. the workplace culture is miserable.
good,"I know people who loved their time working here, unfortunately, I had very poor managers that created an environment that pitted employees against each other. I felt that in order to advance in my role I was expected to throw others under the bus. But the company is large and my experience is not a guarantee."
good,"Its a great environment to deal with guest from all over the world. I love to deal, meet and greet people with adults and children. It is a very fast paced job, always walking."
good,"Très bonne convivialité, sympathique, dynamique mais très exigente pour un salaire très bas."
good,"Ambiance de travail correcte et plaisante"
good,Good place to work initially. I felt that as time went by management didn't appreciate their teachers and didn't have forward thinking plan to develop the school any further than it had been up to that point.
good,"Management tends to not care about lower level cast members. I would not recommend working there for an extended period of time. The perks are ok, but not really worth it in the long run."
good,"Working for Disney is a dream come true until you work there. The corporate side of the company is soul-crushing, and will squeeze every last ounce of magic out of you until there is nothing left."
good,"typical day at work is busy, i have learned to be organized, however management does not see your effort. the culture is low and the hardest parts that there is no support from admin. most enjoyable part is helping children grow and learn."
good,A typical day at work was doing the same thing for 8 hours with two 15 minute breaks. I learnt how to do manual labour. Management wasn't great and neither was the job culture.
good,"Disney has great benefits for its employees, however actual pay is very low.  Low level management is not the best, generally they are very inexperienced.  There are many places to go within the company, but most are lateral moves, promotions and opportunities to rise up in the company are very restricted."
good,"For making millions they do like to screw you with coverage. Its a great job if you don' have bills to pay or any major responsibilities. Guest believe you don't deserve a raise, and they are quick to run you down or berate you. Management is money oriented, and not about making the magic for them. The break areas are terrible in the summer because not all are indoors, not all have benches so you sit on the floor. "
good,"Current workplace culture is lacking empowerment and leadership decisions. Very stressful environment lately with worry of job security, which is a 180 from just 3 years ago."
good,"I enjoyed the benefits of working at Disney, but I've never felt more objectified in my life. I understand that large corporations need to operate like this on some level, but I often felt as though the humanity was removed from this job."
good,"It's excellent job if you're in college with no real financial responsibilities. Management is subpar but every department has one really good one. All in all, you're just a gear in the machine. nothing else."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I had this job as a seasonal job. I got stuck working graveyard stocking the store. The manager was pretty cool until the brought in another one the made working there terrible.
good,"Good people but leadership breeds a culture of back stabbing.  If you aren't willing to take what you want, without asking, then you won't be recognized as having something to offer.  Each division runs like it's own little silo, thus eliminating the opportunity to share ideas, resources or even optimize budgets for bulk purchase and license requests."
good,"Fun work place but poor career advancement."
good,"It's important to keep in mind when working for Disney that all decisions are about money.  If you make your working life here more than that, you will get burned.  I've seen it happen over and over again from ex management all the way down.  There are good people here who love what they do, but the company's relationship to its employees is about money only, bottom line."
good,"All you have to think about is making your boss feel good, and learn how to make smart excuses in an American way - you don't have to achieve anything to be proud of yourself - this company has whole a lot of money and they don't care your achievements.  Just try to make your boss like you!"
good,"My time at Disney was nice, as well as my co-workers. My work day starts off logging on setting up for the day, and let the fun began, working in a graphic design section u have to have an cretivity, tlant, and maintain a out of the box attitude , you just do your best to cret fun and creative designs for the magazin's readers."
good,"6am to 2pm was a great shift. Get your work order, start decorating. I learned there is a craft to decorating a christmas tree. Management was ok as people but sometimes CONFUSING while managing. I think i had the best co-workers; FUN, LOVING, like to eat and share. The hardest part of my job was trying to work with someone who did""t speak english. this was especially hard when we needed to get things done. I enjoyed the traveling to decorate the cruise ships!"
good,"In order to do well at Disneyland, you have to LOVE it. People stay working at Disneyland because they love it and not because of the pay. The perks far outweigh the monetary compensation. You must be happy to make slightly more than minimum wage to work there."
good,"Training"
good,i am just not cut out for disney with the clothes and the people it be fun if i had that mind set but i dont it wasnt a bad job just wasnt for me
good,Typical day was spent initially reviewing items for the day or problems unsolved the day before. I learned SQL for the first time.  Management was right there with us but we mainly had our work cut out for us there was little interaction with management.  Co-workers was great and we spent many  hours at lunch going things at the office and getting a decent lunch.  The hardest part was the constant update to the the IVR system but most enjoyed 
good,Typical PA duties for a tv show production. Whether it's acting as a runner to pick up equipment from vendors to holding a light fixture in place on set.
good,This hotel does not sell itself due to its awful location. The general manager that took over made it very difficult for the food and beverage operation succeed. Several of those of us who were managers and directors were falsely accused of random things by the HR director to the point where personal lawsuits against her.
good,"Overall, everyone is very friendly. You begin training by watching over 8 hours of modules. The only problem I had with the company was scheduling. I could only book off or switch shifts 3x a month. If you have other jobs or are in school it can be pretty inconvenient, especially because you're not guaranteed time off."
good,I have no review. It is your choice to decided if you are going to apply and then accept or decline the offer. They will over use you in hours and expect low pay.
good,"While there were positive aspects, and opportunities to grow, there were some challenges with team leadership and transparency.  Overall the company was a great experience."
good,fast paced environment where people are doing multiple things at once any wearing many hats. management is always in meetings and hard to contact. They stress that this is a place where you can grow but it is the opposite. normal hour but sometimes you may have to come in early or stay late but nothing out of the ordinary.
good,Not necessarily what you know very political and who you know. Very long hours little appreciation. After 12+ hour days told by senior management be lucky you didn't work 14 hours
good,You have to be at the bus stop 3hrs before your scheduled shift if you want to be there on time. Families can either be very pleasant or unpleasant. Got paid every friday. Very little time for recreational fun. Great benefits though.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Not a hard working atmosphere at Corp HQ.  Studio productions worked very hard, but corporate environment worked essentially 9:30 to 4:00 with lots of free time.  Shareholders not well served by legal and HR executives, overpaid, under-performance."
good,"I love TWDC and hope to work there again one day but I was included in a round of layoffs simply because upper management didn't like my direct manager. So despite our department doing really well, our entire team was let go because of personality clashes. It's really unfortunate but there are so many political issues at the corporate levels. "
good,"The higher up you go it seems the better the management is. However, the higher ups respect the leadership role which is good and bad. Intern Managers suck but the higher managers wont see that because they trust them. The good is that they allow the role to not be multi-managed and well the bad is that they don't seem to really check on the lower management they just trust them. The one's at Port Orleans didn't care about the guest above their own laziness."
good,"The benefits are really nice with the PTO, and park benefits but the pay is horrible. I had to leave the company to get a decent wage that allows be to be able to live (albeit, not comfortably). I loved the jobs I had, but they just need to pay more."
good,"A typical day as a custodian involved cleaning restrooms, public areas, and lots of customer interaction. I learned the procedures required for my position through training from leaders. Most of my managers were understanding of the job requirements and could help with problems in most cases. The workplace culture varied greatly depending on position and location. My area had employees who mildly enjoyed their position or invested enough time into the company to continue in their field. The hardest part of my job was cleaning restrooms after difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers, who have been through the same hardships as me."
good,"The Walt Disney company is over hyped. They are good to work for for short time but don't get stuck there. You don't know how it is till after ""traditions"" and training. They'll move you up quick and they try to call you in all the time on day off. It's nice yes. however, those days you come in, they will never give you standing points (brownie points) upon being fired or laid off. you cant win even if your performance is spotless."
good,"Basic job description: fixing problems on a Guest’s WDW account using proprietary software, engaging in live sales & service chats and responding to email."
good,"Fun and happy campus, didn't really provide much training or meetings letting everyone know about the current work process. "
good,"A typical day consist of about four project and or departmental meting per day."
good,"It was a typical warehouse job in which the hours were up and down (mainly up). For the most part, that was the only issue, working long hours and not having time for self or family."
good,"""The reasons that i work here"" is dwindling every year. There hasnt been a cost of living increase in a long time. Management is not interested in learning how to work alongside you."
good,"I love the perks of working for Disney, from the employee benefits to the resume listing. However, after a while it becomes quite apparent that there is not much room for career growth. Additionally, the political environment that comes with all major companies abound. Finally, the salary of our C-Level Executives and EVP's are far too high as compared with the actual development and parks staff, and there is rarely a bonus if ever distributed to the employees."
good,"Disney is definitely an intense place to work at, it's fast pace and at times very stressful. But once you get the hang of it, it can be a lot of fun. But be aware that it's not for everyone"
good,"Good stuff:"
good,"There are two types of managers at Disney (and possibly anywhere): those that want to do a good job and produce great product, and those that want to protect their job.  Disney is choked by a crushing middle management that is heavy with the latter.  Job performance has little to do with advancement in most areas.  The benefits are great, but originality and innovation are generally viewed as too troublesome to pursue."
good,"It is far better to be a direct full time employee. Contract employees are disposable."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,it was an ok job. I enjoyed having a pass and the discounts during the holidays but the work is a lot for the little you are paid. especially during the holidays. after holidays you will burly work for a while and that did not work for me as I wanted the hours but couldn't get them.
good,"The Walt Disney Company is excellent at marketing and selling their product and licensing to image-appropriate companies.  "
good,"Good place to work for a year or two.  Many learning opportunities-- if you can land the right position.  Top-notch exposure to world-class hospitality and entertainment services.  Devoted coworkers and generally upbeat working environment."
good,"Love seeing all new product and sharing my Disney knowledge but some management are incredibly hypocritical and sneaky. "
good,I loved working for Disney it was so animated and I loved putting all the Disney characters in to play when I was assisting a consumer but this position was seasonal
good,"A typical day was to clock in and work, it wasnt a super rewarding job. The management there wasnt good at all, they have poor communication skills and that makes it hard to work for such a big company. The hardest part of the job was how unappreciated we were as cast members. The most enjoyable part was working with great people and make friends along the way.  As a trainer there Ive learned a lot about leadership and how to lead by example and also being approachable."
good,"If you are a part time cast member, good luck getting enough hours to make a sustainable living or full time employment. Waiting list is a joke. Even if you are full time, wages are low. Working poor. Many cast members need roommates to be able to pay the bills."
good,"It's a great place to work if you are working for fun, not to make a living.  Almost every worker there needs a second job, moving up isn't about being good at your job, it's about who you know."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but I had a manager who didn't always give me my breaks and who always gave me negative critiques and not in a good way. She promised us 16-20 hours weekly and knew I was commuting an hour or more for work and I was lucky if I got 8 hours a week."
good,"3 month international college program with students from all over the world. Mixing of cultures, free rides, discounts and living arrangements were provided and good."
good,Your day is spent with constant guest service and you'll either be scheduled too much or too little. I've spent 4 years working here and as much as I've advanced the pay is never enough nor stable to live off of. Some practices are questionable such as constantly hiring part timers but working them full time hours for most of the year with out benefits. It's good for a first job? They train you to be an ideal worker and you'll gain experiences you can't even compare to other company (mostly good but some bad. And I will say i've made many life long friends here.
good,"Great on-board training"
good,There are many different divisions to work at within The Walt Disney Company. I have been fortunate enough to experience teams that create an excellent work culture while I have also been on teams that seem to be neglected and overworked. The projects you work on are always interesting but your job security is always in question.
good,"Little opportunity for advancement, not very good hours, very strict, guests are impatient and rude but coworkers are inclusive and friendly, direct leads are generally down to earth. It doesn't pay well and you won't get many hours but if you love disney and love people then you'll have fun."
good,"HR has no experience and say in employee issues. Very incompetent management. No room for growing. If you are not good friends with management, no chance to be successful."
good,Disney Interactive was a great place to dabble with many different aspects of the Disney brand. The interactive side is still trying to figure itself out which often leads to frustration. Growing pains are always a part of large companies so if you could hang in through that you will be fine.
good,"It's not all that it is hyped up to be. Pay is not great and people are overworked."
good,"If you are an extrovert, you will enjoy working for TWDC. Expect to collaborate and communicate regularly with your entire team. There are clear cliques because many employees have been with the company for many years; it can be difficult to be integrated as a new employee. Very traditional company that upholds traditional officewear dress code, limits any remote work, and expects lots of overtime."
good,"The company as a whole seems to lack the magic it was first inspired by and more money hungry. management needs to be restructured throughout the company - at least in parks & resorts - and there should be better pay. The benefits are great and the cast members are incredible. The company is misleading in regards to career advancement - you are told you can move up but company loyalty seems to not matter since alot of higher positions seem to come from outside whereas current cast members stay stagnant in their current roles which creates frustration and resentment - this needs to change. Also, the pay needs to improve - cast members are the face of Disney and should be treated with more love and respect - cast members are being paid at poverty rates which is not cool."
good,Things are still riding on Walt's coattails. The leadership team is based too much on seniority. Up and coming leaders are fleeing the company.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"The good thing about Disney is that i got to meet new guests,got to be in Star Wars Celebrations , and also meeting star personalities.I learned the positions of training and coordinating ,and operating rides while fallowing safety rules and laws."
good,"Sadly not Walt's Disney anymore. Entry level management is looking to make a name for themselves and care little for those who they manage. Senior leadership can sometimes show compassion, but in my limited time with the company it seems that everyone is willing to walk over you to advance."
good,"Working at Disney is truly only for people in love b with Disney. Their customer service and training is pretty great, but they do not want you projecting your own personality, rather the Disney persona they ingrain in you. The job was easy however, everyday you would do one job such as stocking or bussing or fry cooking among other things. Management was a joke, 4 managers, none of which did anything important. If you ever needed a day off you needed to go through an online system called the hub and never got to talk to anyone face to face. Shifts were always long, sometimes 12 hours and many times I wouldn't even have enough time to catch 8 hours between shifts."
good,"Inbound call center"
good,Good place to work for a short period of time..  There is no perks including Disney ticket entrance. Only perks is free parking @ Disney.
good,"Disney was a cool place to work. With this job i mostly enjoyed meeting people from across the world, especially since they had the exchange program and everything."
good,"Represented a heritage more so than a corporation, client approval.  Difficult to get things done due to P&P and no legal ramifications.  Very demanding workload and last minute assignments.  Expected to work round the clock."
good,Take calls for guest Planning to visit The Disnyeland Resort. Can be very fun. There are few managers that are wonderful.
good,I learned about time management and getting things done on time.
good,"Great place to work at for college students.  A typical day working in retail is constantly interacting with guests and selling our products.  I've learned to manage my time more efficiently, because during peak seasons, everybody is required to work full-time hours.  Each complex is managed by different management teams.  In the complex that I work, the management team is great in terms of having operations in our complex run smoothly.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with frustrated guests.  For the most part, watching guests being happy is the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"I worked as a UI automation tester. Our team responsibility to develop Regresstion, GUI and Functional test scripts."
good,The only way you move up at Disney is if you have relatives in HIGH places.
good,"Long days, little pay, can ruin the ""Disney Magic"" working there."
good,"My daily role required assessment and assurance of digital deliveries between our local production teams and global partners. I would help troubleshoot all technical issues and correspond accordingly with all stakeholders.  My former management team was very professional, focused and supportive of the team and encouraged feedback.  A new management team was brought in and the workplace environment became toxic and hostile which was felt throughout the department.  Decisions were being made without proper feedback or consulting.  Unprofessional and inconsistent.  The hardest part of the job was understanding the direction and focus of the new management team.  The most enjoyable part was when we had the opportunity to be exposed to new technologies and contribute to its implementation."
good,"I had a great time at Disney, It was my first job in the industry. I learned a lot from my first experience."
good,"The only problem I had was the lack of hours and not a set schedule, it more like on call employment."
good,i love my work as devops engineer or can say senior build and release and work with passion to resolve issue.
good,"Worked with many fine cast members. Long-time tenured members fondly remember the 'good old days' when the company valued talent and wasn't squeezing the pennies and life out of everyone. No special fun at Disney except Park Passes are a nice benefit. Definitely a large company culture, where everyone is a cog and disposable."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Company was in disarray because of the Fox Acquisition.  My Supervisor lacked focus and always looked for others to bale him ou or blame.  He was afraid of his job ad being replaced.
good,"I have been with the company for years and it just gets worse not better. The employees aren’t valued or appreciated. It’s all about Guest Satisfaction, no matter the cost and how much money the company is profiting, at the end of the day. Employees feel like a number, not like an appreciated employee."
good,Hours are long if your salaried and all work is third shift so you get calls in the middle of the night.  Overall I would not work there because parks and resorts (entertainment) is not my field.
good,"You are just a number not a person, all they want you to do is sell and they listen to your phone calls and try to catch you doing the sales process wrong. You are required to sell, sell, sell."
good,"It is not the happiest place on earth. Difficult culture. Very compartmentalized. Not a great team feeling. Very terratorial."
good,"Met a lot of people, learned a lot from my peers, overall a good experience. The job is very repetitive, the pay wasn't that great for the working conditions but I somehow made it work."
good,"disney has a strong brand which is why most of us want to work for them.  However, they are known to be one of the lowest paying employers in the industry.  It works out better if you get at least 3 yrs experience and leave the company go work somewhere else and come back.  That is really the only way to climb the corporate ladder.  Unfortunately if you transfer within the company - they take into account how much you were paid in your last position and give you a minimal raise.  Not enough to count as a real raise.  I used to love the benefits when I started we had christmas parties at Disneyland just for employees and their guests.  That no longer exists.  Benefits are slowly being chiseled away.  I think though Disney is now waking up to the tougher competition in the marketplace and are willing to be more flexible in terms of compensation and enhance their benefits package, but it will be a slow road ahead.  There is a lot of buyin internally that needs to make this a reality.  If you are a Director level or above you will do just fine here.  "
good,"the coworkers are the best part"
good,"If you work at Disney Magnet School you have to be on top of your game.  Every day is a different day.  One day you could be a kindergarten teacher and another day you could be an 8th grade teacher.  You could have a great day one day, and a very horrible day the next day.  I learned that you have to always remember that you are working with children, and you could make a difference in their life, or you could damaged them for life.  The hardest part of my job is not knowing what class I would be covering for the day, because it is very difficult to develop strong relationship with these students.   The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am allow to do what I love, and that is to teach, and make a difference in the life of a child."
good,"This is a great place to work for someone that is in college and looking to make a little money on the side, not for someone that has a family to support."
good,"Working at The Walt Disney Company is highly stressful and requires that an individual has no life outside the company. Very demanding with many people acting like high school children. I had a much harder time dealing with my management and coworkers than I ever had with the guests. Not at all professional and I found that unless you were best friends with your management, you would not advance in your career."
good,"After working more than seven years with this company, I have experienced many positive and negative experiences. As the years pass on, it has become more and more evident that the lower level, non-salaried employees  that work both backstage and onstage in the resorts are devalued, mistreated, and mismanaged by a rising unprofessionalism and insensitivity amongst some supervising staff. Employees specifically in my department have been denied breakrooms, bereavement, leave of absences, or shift trades to take care of dependent family members. Not all supervising staff in the resort are this way. There have been good examples as well, that make all employees feel valued and appreciated, regardless of their role in the company. Those few individuals create the magic Walt wanted in this world."
good,Strict Employee guidelines you must adhere to. You'll work with awesome people and will sometimes have to deal with really bad guests. Summer weather is brutal.
good,It is a good workplace. Supervisors are nice and understanding. The problem is that the breaks are really short in comparison to other companies. You are walking for 8 hours straight (if you are a picker) and in break times you can barely sit down because the only place where you can sat was in canteen and was always very busy. But what i liked is that here i had a good training for my department (Picking).
good,"Disney has an overall culture of happiness and support but each attraction, restaurant, store, etc.. has its own micro culture that can make or break your experience."
good,I was discriminated against due to my demographics by more than one manager.  I did not represent the ethnic background nor age demographic seemingly sought at my particular location.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Lack of career advancement is the number one issue with Disney, besides lack of hours or crazy hours, few to no days off, and compensation. Management is hit and miss."
good,"working for Disneyland Distribution  Center was long hours and not well paid the agency at the time was Selec staffing and  was paying 11.75 an hour, however, I cannot complain about the Managment and employees  they had for XPO logistics they understood we were getting underpaid and  many hours were giving, They would do raffles with all employees this would include the temporary employees."
good,"If you are someone that is not going to school or does not have any kind of life outside of work, then this job is for you! Plenty of hours, great perks, but you'll be working too much to even use your company perks"
good,Can be a good place to work for some people. Networking is key. It is a lot about who you know rather than your skill set. The workplace culture is not for everyone.
good,"The Walt Disney Company truly allows you to succeed if you follow the rules and truly have a passion for your job. When looking into a college job, apply here. Disney has given me the confidence in public speaking."
good,"The management, depending on the location, was either wonderful or not enjoyable to work with.  The locations were very inconsistent in how they were run.  Communication was poor throughout the company.  People working the same position were easy to get along with and were enjoyable to be around.  One of the greatest negatives was not having a say in the hours we worked.  Depending on the location someone might only work 6 hours a day where other locations work 12 hours a day.  There are also forced 6 days in a week that you can not decline.  The best part of the job was interacting with people from all over the world every day.  It was very inspiring.  It was nice to be in a place where the customers are energetic and happy most of the time.  It was a great learning experience throughout the Walt Disney training week.  The company has so much to learn from."
good,"Disney has the fortune of its name and the happiness associated with it backed up by its continue growth which equals job stability."
good,"I worked very long hours for very little pay. I attended to guest and ensured that their rooms and corridors were clean and more. Everyday working for Disney was a learning opportunity eg, working as a team to exceed guest expectations, experiencing new places and cultures."
good,"Working for Disney may seem like a dream but the reality is much less than perfect."
good,Very fast paced to keep up with the consumer. Benefit was that you get three free park hopper on selected days. Not the happiest place on earth for the employees.
good,"a great place to learn, but it is a difficult job and you don't have much job security and you don't have many more benefits other than free tickets for family friends and of course getting into the parks for free yourself."
good,"Walt Disney World was once a creative culture and family oriented. Today, Disney is more corporate than ever. Only thinking about the guests dollars instead of the guests experience. Walt's days of sharing the park ""equally"" with communities is now more about the classes and who is willing to pay more for someting that use to be standard for all."
good,"big company, big culture, sometimes focused on excellence, sometimes solely on the bottom line.  those who never pointed out that a task was impossible were rewarded for their silence"
good,"Working for the TWDC has been fun and difficult at the same time. It would be an excellent place to work once retired and not concerned about money, but it is hard to make a living while working here. The guests and coworkers make the job worth it from day to day. It’s difficult though dealing with such a high turn around of Cast Members. Management teams are a hit or miss. Some are great, others are terrible. It really depends on your Work location. I have truly made some lifelong memories working here and would recommend it to people with the right personality (people persons) or for people looking to work a bit while retired."
good,"Great co-workers, some of the management filled the villain role a little too well!"
good,"As a Cast member your first and most important job is you are the face for the company. A typical day included showing up before the park opens and starting up the ride. Once the ride is up to standards than you can run the ride allowing guests to enter. While the park is open and you are running the ride, Safety is the number one key. Making sure that guests get on and off the ride safely. Making sure that guest are happy throughout the day is another goal the company sets. Answering questions, helping Guest with disabilities and educating and acomedating. Once the park closes we are in charge of making sure all guest making it safely out of the park and the ride is shut down for the night."
good,"the only good thing about this job it was very close to my house and was very stressful job  ,i manged to work in 3 different working field"
good,"It was okay over all, just no real way to advanced as a career. Good environment but too strict. if they were to give more benefits and get more incentives  for doing a job well it would make a difference."
good,"Great perks, not much chance to move up in the company. Not much diversity behond the scenes but there are diverse shows and movies. Lots of work needed to make Disney a great company."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,The Company took over most of Disney IT Support. HCL was first given a 3 year contract and is now presented with a renewed 5 year contract. Predominant support is off shore with few US worker.
good,"Days varied depending on number of guests, tasks rotated during the day, tiring & stressful due to management, difficult dealing with guests but was great place to work. meet someone new everyday, you get to work with people from all across the world, can enjoy your off days at the parks for free, alot of young people and college students working kept it fresh and energized, DCP was an amazing experience, DIFFICULT yet fun"
good,"pin point the workers. Let it be known  what is expected of you everyday. At the point that you know what's up before go home for the day. The hardest part of the job is that is maintaining the work force, having. people to show up for work everyday and doing the job outside their job as well .To run a good business is to know the worker and them knowing this is a team effort not individual one . Team works makes the dream work not a joke. Knowing this you will win every time. TEAM WORK !!!!!!! from bottom to the top to the all around the kitchen make it work ."
good,"The area and position I worked was very hard often physically demanding as well as mentally, I found this very challenging and struggled with the way my management dealt with many things. "
good,"As an English speaking member of a Spanish dominant team, I often feel at a disadvantage. The overall company offers many opportunities while the Housekeeping Dept. does not. Work is physically demanding however, physical therapist and nurses are on property should anything happen. These resources however aren't easily accessible to hotel employees, especially for night shifts."
good,"-fast paced environment"
good,"très bonne équipe , nous somme dans un autre monde"
good,"Easy job to get, but very hard to work at. They teach you a lot though, and you become more professional the longer you work there. Good job to teach discipline, patience, and develop other skills you'll need later in life. The benefits make it worth it."
good,Very simple job with the day filled will sales and multiple task. If you are good a multi-tasking then this is the job for you. Also you have to sell a certain amount of the GAP Inc credit cards.
good,"On stage, everyone was pretty decent to guests, but not to the standard I remember as a child there. Working in Attractions was not a positive experience. There was a lot of social drama involved. I would never work in an entry level position for this company in the parks."
good,"Une bonne ambiance général mais un gros problème avec le management, qui est déplorable, un manque constant d'efficacité et donc un manque de motivation pour les ouvriers."
good,"I came to Disney straight out of College.  It was a great place to start my career and learn what corporate America is all about.  "
good,"Coordination, and follow up with people"
good,"While working at DIsneyland sounds fun and unique, they demand a lot from their cast members and it might take years to get full time."
good,"My workplace was outside in a kiosk in an amusement park.  At my job, I learned how to work in a mobile kitchen, work long hours outside in a busy very busy setting, and work with a diverse group of hard working people.  I was always scheduled to work 6 days a week, 48 hours a week, but I would always end up working at least 55 hours a week.  Most of my co-workers worked long hours like me.  Some of them loved it because of the overtime and some of them were tired of the long hours.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to balance my personal life and my work life.  Because I worked at least 55 hours a week with one day, I would have to go grocery shopping , do laundry, and have time for myself on that one day off.  My leaders understood that my co-workers and I were tired of working so much, but we had 8 kiosks and a certain amount of people had to be in one.  However, they were very accommodating to the cast members that were in culinary school or had another part time job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with guests.  When I was working at my old location in the hotel, I wasn't able to interact with guests the way I did at the amusement park.  I got to see thousands of people daily live freely and enjoy their vacation."
good,"Working for Disney World brought a whole new meaning to ""customer service"". I have never experienced so much freedom in a job as a lower level employee to grant automatic, on the spot customer service. A guest drops their drink outside, not a second thought, here's another. ""What's that? You didn't receive your brownie with your meal? Don't mind showing me the receipt i've got you covered!"".  Having the direct authority to please customers with such ease (most of the time) was a relief. I was able to rotate between front of house service as well as the back of house kitchen, this transition was welcome and it allowed me to see all aspects of the business operations."
good,"People work there hold huge pride as part of the Disney family. Even people remotely related to Disney call themselves Disney employee. "
good,"overworked, no job security, replaces US workers by Asians where they are growing."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Hardly anyone there has even worked in the garment industry or went to school for it and it's very frustrating.
good,"I got to meet people from all over the world, and help them. Served food, took orders"
good,"It was awesome to be able to work at Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando.  Everyday was fun.  The problems working there was that the pay was low and they took rent and utilities out of your pay.  Also , frontline workers dealt with different managers with different managing styles (some highly competent and some not competent at all).  Enough training was provided.  Going to the parks for free was awesome."
good,"If you work there long enough you do get disneyland tickets and health care other wise nothing. Raises consist of toys and prizes not so much money, unless you are co manager and there seems to be a lot of those. Most 80% of the my co workers were sweet, helpful and nice. If one co-worker doesn't like you expect not to get hours and get shifts cut. Everything is at a fast pace and you always are ding something. Stay smiling at all time, greet everyone, help people answer question/ find what they need. Clean the whole store, keep everything organized at all times. Work at the phones and cashier. It was all a hard job really, but I enjoyed organizing at the end of the day, the toys and working with kids."
good,Never really worked our full 40 hours because of slow production and it was a seasonal job
good,"Interns work about 40 hours a week, during the holidays it can go up to 60 hours a week. We were only paid $7.79 which did not cover the costs of rent, food, bills and personal expenses. Other than that, this internship is for the EXPERIENCE. Even though I was broke and tired all the time, I had a wonderful time, and I love Disney. If you love Disney, Pixar, and Disney World apply for this internship."
good,good company if you live in LA. Benefits and activities in LA for Disney are much beneficial.
good,"This job had a variety of tasks and multiple clients, which kept it quite interesting and challenging."
good,A typical day is made up of a lot of guest contact and making dreams come true.
good,"It taught me the ins and out of working. Being on time, looking professional, and working my hardest."
good,This was a positive experience where I took classes on innovation and leadership. I found it useful when building professional relationships with coworkers.
good,"is good that the company rules and regulation, just that the employees too much dramas and attitude"
good,Very hard job so be prepared to work hard and not be able to have another job working round the clock so just keep it going I will go back but they need to pay more money but if it's apart time job it will work just fine
good,"Its hard to generalize the complete work experience as I did successfully complete all my tasks, but I must say it was not without exhaustion. I worked in five restaurant locations each with its own set of rules, but quick service work differs in difficulty from other roles. It's a roll of the dice, but you need to have stamina and a positive attitude to maintain working there with a sane mind in your role."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Stressful days when it is busy. Learned how to manage my time and how to interact with multiple people. Management is not the best. They are more focused on themselves than others. Workplace culture is a family type atmosphere. Hardest part of the job is communication between management and employees and everyone being on the same page. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide excellent service to the guests and bring a smile to their faces.
good,"I was looking to relocate to Central Florida, and my natural inclination, not knowing much about the local job market, other than Disney, was to apply and work for the Boss Mouse himself.  "
good,"I work for the Walt Disney Company in Orlando, Florida and have been here since June of 2018 for the Disney College Program. I have been working in custodial at the Contemporary Resort and this experience has been a great one with the managers and employees. I have been deployed to other resorts and can see why the Contemporary stands above the rest."
good,"C'est bien payé, les locaux sont accueillant mais le personnel est irrespectueux des employés."
good,"ambiente dinamico, leggermente confusionario ma molto stimolante"
good,"stressful, lots of responsibility, but equally rewarding. leadership can sometimes lack. so much emphasis is placed on the guests that the needs of cast often fall by the wayside."
good,"Very low pay while executives take home millions. But we get ""perks"" so that's nice. Very little advancement since people stay for a long time. Depending on which department you're in, you either really enjoy it or you really don't."
good,Good place to work bit they didnt have the right assistance because nobody couldnt even tell me who my manager was because nobody knew who they wehere apart from that they were very rude whith everybody
good,"Not everyone is treated the same at this company. That is true at all companies, but it was to the extreme there between pay and work areas. It always felt like an unfair competition working there."
good,"I helped open a new location of licensed Starbucks for Disney. The description didn't match what I got. But I was only an affiliate of Disney. I stayed for 6 months, had a good experience but I was looking for more. Good job for someone in their early twenties or going to school."
good,"Working at Walt Disney world, the pay never helped with cost of living. People would try to work as much overtime as they could get and still have decide if they would either pay their bills or buy groceries each week. The hourly staff is fantastic and Ive created life long friends with it, but some of the management needs work because when you have an employee who harasses the team and gets no disciplinary actions its hard to believe you have support for your leadership team."
good,Working for the ESPN franchise at Disney Anaheim was a very stressful job 7 days a week you could not blink it was push push push until you went home and start all over again the next day
good,"ambiance très agréable, personnel tres humain à part la personne dont le poste s'appelle ressources humaines ...."
good,"For the walt Disney company to be such a large company that is known world wide, you would think they would pay their employees so much more. It’s not liveable"
good,"You have to have a love for Disney to be successful working there. The pay isn't great, and the hours are not as plentiful as some would like. Advancement is a slow process. Discounts are fairly good especially around the holidays. Need to be consistently punctual and healthy, as there are no paid sick days unless you are full time. You also have to love working in a customer service oriented business. It can be a lot of fun and you get to meet a ton of interesting people."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"This job is great if you're still going to school and need experience as well as a flexible schedules. However, be prepared to have short shifts if you don't hustle to scheduling for them"
good,"I go to work, do my Job, and I go home.  Good sports leagues and activities for casts.  Great benefits.  Low pay and inconsistent work hours.  interact with lots of differing individuals."
good,"If you like Disney culture, you would love the company. They provide good benefits for Manager and up, not a lot of opportunities for full time jobs or corporate."
good,They say it's hard to get into Disney but once you're in you have opportunities to move around. I found the opposite to be true. The metrics show that around 1% of employees transfer across segments each year.
good,"An enjoyable experience, working with the youngest requires extra care in customer service. I had good leaders and horrible bosses. One of them refused to assist me while I was getting verbally attacked from a customer."
good,"A good company to work for, but know your title and what it means coming into your job.  Ex. you might have SR. in front of your title and find out that it's still a lower title/pay than you expected."
good,Great Perks!!! Most enjoyable part of the job was working with children and other great people in my department. The workplace culture varied all over the center.
good,"Put in the work, network with others...then there are plenty of opportunities. Also, Disney will stay around for a while -- job security! "
good,After being there for 5 years it just got really stressful. Cast members took their job too serious managers were no help and guests were sometimes obnoxious.
good,"challenging work/life balance and lack of transparency and trust via senior management, collaborative team approach overall, continuous cost cuts annually and elimination of positions"
good,"Make no mistake that the Disney Store seeks to provide the kind of guest experience that is associated to the brand. Disney prides itself on telling stories through creative selling techniques that are infused with Disney language and culture but underneath it all, it's a way to way to push for UPT and conversion as with any other retailer. Due to this emphasis, there is an added stress to push sales and its unfortunate that after all the work cast members put into this role, the pay is not comparable. Its a job to have fun with, to curate your salesmanship and to be proud when you succeed through positive reinforcement. You will work hard, if you enjoy Disney you'll enjoy the environment, but its not a job that pays the bills or provides a livable wage."
good,"The company is based on making dreams and magic happen and for those who are paying for it, they get it, For the employees or as they call them, cast members, its not the same ( well at least where I worked). You really have to go in there with a different mind set then you would as a guest."
good,"I clean stuff and make sure every thing is in order. It's a very mind numbing job in the sense that it can be incredibly boring or incredibly stressful depending on were you're station. I very much dislike the idea of hunting hours just to make ends meet, but hey live sucks."
good,"greet guest "
good,"Working for Atos at Disney was interesting. No incentives or raises."
good,A good place to learn a lot of people skills and support related issues. Depending on how focused you are on moving up the ladder you can move up in the company pretty fast if you work hard enough.
good,Company will sacrifice you to save a buck. WDW is currently targeting long term cast members that have the company pension program.  They are increasing job responsibilities so that the individual can no long meet the expectations then forcing the person out of the company along with their pension savings.  This saves the company a lot of money.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Really enjoyed working there when I first started in 2008; however, all good things must come to an end. Structure changed and it was time to move on."
good,This job involved lifting heavy equipment and hooking up speakers and tents and quickly and effectively. Afterwards we'd provide high energy entertainment for crowds of youths as well as adults.
good,"I worked in Feature Animation for 4 years. I worked in the IT department as a TSR (Technical Service Representative)."
good,"Nice people that work from home often.  There were free bagels on Wed.  There were screenings of the movies sometimes.  "
good,Management was barely every around. In Animal Kingdom there were 4 area managers for Discovery Island and whenever you needed them they were never around.
good,The silver pass is great! It really depends on where you land in the company.  Certain areas are amazing and some are awful.  It's a huge company and that has many benefits and many set backs.
good,"This is a good job for a student or someone who is looking for a few hours a week to work. It is difficult to move in this company, but they provide great perks."
good,I enjoyed going into work everyday and working with some of the most brilliant people in the entertainment industry.   While the project lasted we exceeded expectations and impressed our superiors.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team and the sense of accomplishment at preserving Disney's legacy of music.
good,Being an Imagineer is like being a celebrity. Disney Guests know about Imagineering and want to know the people who make the magic come to life. It is a honor and humbling experience.
good,"This is definitely a fun work place. However, there is not much room for growth unless you plan on moving to Orlando. The schedules are always changing. dress code seems to be a little too strict."
good,"In the mailroom I sorted inner office materials.  The days went fast, but the compensation was low.  The best part was bumping into an occasional celebrity, and riding the delivery bikes of course."
good,"Disney is an amazing company, though their corporate culture really limits the development of their employees.  Management mandates a high degree of deferential treatment to senior leaders and perpetuates a very hierarchical environment.  It is difficult and time consuming to drive results.  The benefits and pride of working for such a strong brand does offset this negative component somewhat, though working in the Corporate segment presents cultural challenges that are not as prevalent in other companies."
good,I have learn to be a better supervisor and a strong individual. I also learn that there is more than one way to make your employees & guest happy.
good,Lots to do everyday with something new.  Can get really hectic at times with so much to do that it can spill into your off time to meet the deadlines.
good,"The normal work day is whatever your scheduled for, if its four hours depending on your position you might be extended to a mandatory 8 hours."
good,"When I worked here, I had full time hours on a part time contract. The work was easy and the staff was nice. A great place to work."
good,"Disney may the happiest place on earth, but it's not always like that as an employee. Management is not always as it should be (which is something to say about every company) but I had higher expectations for Disney. Not to speak for every manager there, but there are several that lack any leadership qualities."
good,"Although the scheduling isn't the greatest, there is no call center in the world like Disney call center. Everyone is usually friendly although you have some sore thumbs like anywhere else. I learned more about Disney than I ever thought I'd know because my trainers were absolutely amazing. Did you know Disney has a lay away plan? :) Management is pretty understanding for the most part...of course not everyone likes everyone but work is work and everyone is respectful of one another at Disney. The Disney call center is like a big happy family. The hardest part of the job is the overtime when the holidays hit. The guests are usually easy to please even when they are upset. The BEST part of the job is creating the MAGIC. You really get brainwashed to be a Disney fan and you will not regret working here. You will forever be a happier person."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"New Breed is a grea job to work if you are trying to make easy money. I appreciate the fact that this gaveme better opportunities to improve in myself. I learned alot about my responsibilities and made sure that I stayed advanced. My co- workers were normal, helpful at times, and reassuring me mostly of the time.The hardest part of the job is what any other newcomer felt. I really did not like the fact that the on the spot manager kept sending me home on my first couple of  weeks. That made me lose track of the pace of flow I was suppose to keep accelerating. The enjoyable part is that I enjoyed the time and the benefits I had there."
good,"Your management can really make or break your experience.  As an entertainment giant, there are a lot of egos.  I find many Managers and Directors lack proper managerial training."
good,"the management is ok, the pay scale is low, they except a lot of work from you but do not pay as the amount of work they ask from you."
good,We always go out to the local community and host performance in order to promote the Disney brand. We do so by providing outdoor activities to families and kids all around and we reward those who participate by giving out prizes. It truly is a magical experience.
good,Always on the edge of leading technology. Fun place to work. Many times conference rooms are named after Disney characters.
good,"Its ALL about our guests / customers"
good,"When I started we were an independent studio developing our own ideas. It was a creative environment where we nurtured each others ideas and worked together for the greater good of our studio."
good,"Project management ability"
good,Disney is a great company to work for. Being an employee of Disney gives you the feeling of being a part of something very magical and grandeur.
good,"Being a fan of the culture of DIsney I was able to handle some of the kool aid selling that this compnay is constantly throwing at you. If you are not a fan of the Disney Guest Experience, this is a horrible place to work, and if you are worried about your experince as a guest being ruined by your job, stay away."
good,"You learn the needs of your staff, i also cover management jobs and duties. My co-workers are young but good fun to work with. The job is easy in itself but the hardest part are the customers."
good,"On a typical day I pick boxes. I learned how to be more accepting in my job duties. Management is not quite up to par for my liking. My coworkers are very hardworkng. The money is great. The hardest part of the job is the demanding job hours in the summer, and late fall; from August to Januarary I was working twelve hours for seven days a week."
good,"Great work environment, makes you feel good about coming to work. Work-Life balance is manageable. Goals are tough but can be met with great teamwork."
good,Only been a the Disney store for a few months now but it is one of the best jobs iv had all staff are treated with the same level of respect as high up management
good,"Every multinational company has positive and improvable foundations that it works with.  Every company is a living breathing entity that changes constantly, shifts gears, changes priorities, makes good business decisions and some questionable ones.  As with any company, internal consistency was difficult and challenging but the customer interactions were always very ""Disney""."
good,I love working here but I just hate when the work slow down the hours do as well and they are unorganized and it’s just all over the place. I just want a Monday - Friday job that pays good
good,"The great thing about working at this company is that no day is the same as the rest. However, it can get at times a bit repetitive. You either start work early and end in the afternoon or work late and get off later. The work schedules are not super flexible. Must ask for days off early and have seniority. Great benefits and if your lucky enough you'll make life long friends."
good,Credit Data Lake team is responsible for all the credit data that is available in Enterprise Data Lake platform.It also does its part for the Payfone project by sending daily reporting files which gives insights about new sfy accounts that are created and update reporting file which tells about the changes made the already existing syf accounts.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,It was very great job always want too make the consumer happy even when they mad I love helping and working with other as a team everything was great I
good,"Things are pretty fast-paced where I work; which is something I enjoy about the job. I just believe communication from leaders to coords and from coords to cast could be much better. It seems like every day something abut our operation is changing and not everyone will be aware of it, causing confusion. Though interns do the same work as full-timers for the same number of hours, we are paid less and lose out on some benefits. It is a fun place to work but its more about your location and coworkers than the actual company"
good,"I love this company and INVESTED my all into it. This company does however need to treat their employees better. Overall, I see the goodness in everything and their was plenty here."
good,"trop de deplacements, j etais à mon compte donc au final avec les imots je ne my retrouvais plus financiemerement"
good,I enjoy the opportunity to meet amazing people every single day. Whether it being meeting new coworkers or guests who visit us from around the world. I get to experience it all by communicating with them and learning about them.
good,"I loved my time working for Walt Disney World, but I found the work/life balance to be non-existent. I had to work every holiday, and crazy hours that were never consistent. Schedules would be released 2 weeks in advance and could change up to 48 hours in advance. And your hours could be first, second or third shift. This made it impossible to plan anything (vacation, doctor's appointments, social gatherings, etc.)."
good,"The job culture was a bit too relax; but learned a lot art guides and its contents. Also, a bit overwhelming"
good,"recomendable, un lugar con mucha competitividad en el mercado"
good,"If you’re looking for a career at Disney go to college. Any other position is not enough to live off of. Great atmosphere to work in but cost of living is not up to par. Can’t enjoy most benefits as a part time or full time casual cast member, you can’t afford it. Other than that great fellow cast members b they do become life long friends."
good,"I loved many of the more immediate managers, the number of talented people who were dedicated and worked at the company was extraordinary but to be expected given Disney's brand. I hope to find another contract there soon."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is an excellent workplace for retirees, however if you are looking to support a family or make a career I would highly advise looking elsewhere."
good,"if you do not live near or in anahiem and are getting pain minimum wage do not do it. You cannot get a raise, was a flat rate of 11$ constant manager change, Leads can be really nice or vaguely interested in anything you have to say. However the environment outside the office is pretty great, like free sign ins, communicating with people, parking is a nightmare in you park in K lot. This was before the strike maybe differemt"
good,a typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job does not include confidential company information
good,Job experience with the Walt Disney Co. all depends on your leadership team. If you have good management that cares and wants to develop you then it's a great place to work.
good,"In food and beverage you only get paid $12 an hour while the rest of the park makes at least $15. Perks are great though. Working with guests can be frustrating but when you make someone's day, it is all worth it."
good,very good company to work for.  Good structure and culture.  Very enjoyable work life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a job.
good,"As I said, you work here because it's Disney and everyone thinks that's cool. They have good benefits but the pay and room for advancement is on the low end."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Great place to work, some of the management was lacking, but others were really good."
good,"I was only there for a short-term. The Seattle office was great, though--agile, creative, fun, and motivated. Would have liked to stay on, maybe in a different role to continue to work with great people."
good,ts good if you are a student. The pay is not that great depending on where you work. The majority of cast members are nice. Managers help out if they can. Flexible hours but work holidays and weekends usually.
good,The tech department was lacking so the site would crash ... that being said the work was terrific in the beginning but as the years went by things started to decline
good,"Moved to AZ otherwise would still be working there, great customer service job.Was able to help people from all over the world. worked at various table service locations and banquet events. I would work double shifts willingly six days a week many times, because i enjoyed the job that much."
good,"good company and benefits with them, there is room for growth but you would have to really love Disney to enjoy your job . you also get free ticket to the park which is cool."
good,a typical day will be answering around 80 calls if you work around 8 hours but if overtime is mandatory for that week you will end up taking around 80 calls extra for that week. It is very stressful and not worth it for the pay that you get. You will be selling all day and trying to hit numbers if you want to get paid the miserable incentive they want to give you.
good,"Relatively straight forward and easy tasks, typically varied between:"
good,Its a good place to learn new skills in a short term period. There are a lot of org changes which are not beneficial for career growth. I would work here if only no other option.
good,"we had to work on a stressful environment, with very bad management and a lot of damaged equipment. On the other hand, has a lot of collateral benefits and it's well organized."
good,"good at providing individual developmental plans for employees, very difficult to obtain a work and personal life balance. Days off were constantly changing with little or no notice."
good,Only cons are you are temp and sometimes sent home early when call volume is low. The pay could have been better than 12.00 hourly. Mandatory holiday hours required.
good,"Disney said they would work with my schedule for school and literally only give me the two days I need off from school. I need an extra days since my classes are tough and require long study hours. They also extend people like crazy, they always under staff and never over staff by at lest 2 people."
good,Its a lot of hard work and will make you a workaholic.  Benefits are great but the pay and hours suck. Make sure you know about Orlando because guest get lost all the time.
good,"Worked for the company for years and honestly the pay is not worth the required activities. Verbal abuse from guests round the clock, sometimes hazardous working conditions, and poor union representation."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I really enjoyed working at Mickey's of Glendale it was always something new to see. It was ice. I even got to meet the guy who played the rock in advendures . It was very interesting  to see how some famous people don't like following  the rules.  But you just smile and still get that I,D"
good,"The people you work with are friendly and the environment is very positive. It’s an easy job but the opportunity to become a full time employee is limited and sometimes your hours are like 4 hours a day, 2 days a week. I guess if you have school it’s a good job. Schedule is not consistent either. Regardless, was a good experience."
good,"If you are a character of habit this is a good job, doesn't require much thinking on your feet. But the people are nice (coworkers) and the managers want to see you succeed."
good,"I was on the Disney College Program in my experience with the company. While on the program, I felt as if we were thrown into our roles with little to no consideration as to which roles we felt we would thrive in. For instance, if I lifeguarded at Blizzard Beach and that park had to close for refurbishment, I would be transferred to Quick Food and Beverage Service. Never once were we consulted or asked if that would be ok or would be a good fit for us."
good,"To work at Disney you have to be able to walk long distances from parking to your work location.  Customer Service is a must and being a team player is a must.  The kids are the best part, especially those that are challenged, love to make those kids happy and smile to have a Magical Day."
good,"I had a book published by Hyperion, which is owned by Disney, so no relevance here. Ignore the rest while I use up the required one hundred and fifty characters."
good,"I worked for The Walt Disney Company for 4 years, the work was fun most of the time. I worked with a lot of great people. The pay wasn't enough to sustain living anywhere near property so most people there have roommates or are on the Disney College Program."
good,"The pay is too low when you are trying to advance, great benefits for friends and family. You work super hard and are not paid comparable to the work."
good,It’s a great place to work and grow. The experience will make you a better person and give you excellent skills to use in today’s economy. I worked for the company 6 years and it was the best time of my life.
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier, started with stretching to get ready for my shift. Next, the leads give us roll call about what is new in the park, safety issues, and new updates with prices. Finally, we get assigned our area of work or the day and we check out money. I make sure my fund is complete ($500) and head to my area. Part of being part of a magical place, I have learned that courtesy and show has a major impact on the image of the company. Customer service is everything when I am trying to make peoples days more magical and satisfying. My management team is very flexible and mandatory when it comes to meeting daily sale goals. However, I like a challenge and meeting the expectations that are given to me. I wouldn't really say I had a hard part at my job because everything was pretty self-explanatory. The most enjoyable part of my job is making people feel special and having them smile. It brings warmth to my heart to know I made someones day more special."
good,"I a place where you can experience a work environment like no other, with a competitive career growth.A job where you are constantly able to meet new people."
good,"I really enjoyed my area, my coworkers and my leads, but management typically did not have much hands on involvement which I disliked. Scheduling also did not work around my preferences which was stressful. You were never guaranteed certain days off, especially in your first year. There is a lot of pressure on cast members to maintain a high standard of service, but I do not believe the pay matches that. There are great perks such as entrance to the parks, discounts, and friend and family admission."
good,"environnement de travail faisant régner les ""on dit"""
good,"I had a great time working at the Walt Disney Company, but only for so long. There is now way you sustain yourself on the pay, inconsistent hours, and they expect so much from you. It was a perfect when I was in college, but a after graduation, I had to get out. I tried to move to management with my degree, or even to a corporate office, but it was impossible."
good,"The job is incredibly easy and have to deal with constant stream of guests. No weekends, unless you ask 3 weeks in advance. Theres job movement capability but rather a convoluted process"
good,"Everyone is getting pay raises across the board at Disney so really this is the company to be with, not those other theme park companies where they are paying people so little."
good,"The work is fast paced and you must pay attention to detail."
good,"very corporate environment, not alot of chance to move to different roles within the organization.  I Would to apply for a different role withing the organization"
good,"It is hard to be a student and work here, I have been scheduled during class sometimes. I do enjoy having a ""costume"" rather than free dress. Benefits are good."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I like the fact that I get to meet new people and have a positive impact on their guest experience. I look forward to coming to work and working within a team setting with my fellow co-workers.
good,"I was lucky to work with the Walt Disney Company twice as a Disney College Program participant. I made some incredible friends, and gained valuable work and life experience. If you're at all interested in working for Disney, I say you should do it. However, in both of my experiences, I found the culture of Disney to be lacking. Daily life as a Disney Cast Member is intense and full of opportunities to make magical moments for guests. It is an indescribable feeling to impact a family on their vacation, or to see a child's face light up when you call them 'princess'. "
good,"Very low pay"
good,I would not take back the internship. I was surrounded by professionals who loved what they did and every day I learned something new. My coworkers kept me sane when I worked 13 days straight at times and 12+ hour shifts. It was hard not to love being at work because guests couldn't afford for you to have a bad day. I truly learned a lot from my short time there.
good,"If you are in the right department, it can be a great experience to work here. If you are in the wrong one, it can be pretty tough."
good,"Over more than a decade at TWDC, I had absolutely terrific managers, who taught me amazing skills, while fostering an independence to move forward in my career.  I also had bosses who were insecure, suffered anger management issues or were indecisive.  The culture changed with the management at all levels.  It's a great company with amazing brands, but the culture of any group changes with each management change."
good,J'ai bien aimer travailler chez Disney car sa ma rappeler mon enfance
good,"very fast paced"
good,"I feel it's diverse,  but still a little racist and can be uncomfortable. Benefits are great but not much room for advancement. This place is either for you or not"
good,I was in the disney college program which meant i was at the bottom of the barrell so be prepared to work long hours with little pay and time off.  You get about 10 dollars an hour with miminal breaks and some times the work conditions were terrible.
good,"Walt Disney was a great place to be during the time I was there, thought I'd be a lifer.  The Company purchased ABC while I was there and due to this merger, my whole division was layed off."
good,"It's been several years, the company has changed hands, but it was a good place to work at the time. Nice people. Busy, long hours."
good,"There seem to be two different cultures, one from Disney and one from Capital Cities, still lingering from the ABC acquisition. The studio side and the broadcast network side are two different animals."
good,Quality short term experience. Little room for growth and advancement with opportunities to learn. Workplace culture represents the core values of the company.
good,Walt Disney is a great place to start and end a career.  The intern I am in is great but my location was a bad fit.  I love the people but working In my location has made me resent guest.  Thanks.
good,I worked for a third party company inside downtown Disney (Ridemakerz). I had a lot of fun working there and the environment is nice also. Anytime you can go to work and have fun is a good day
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"While some groups appear to have diversity, there is an age bias ... teams are more comfortable with young applicants/workers.  Must fit within the 'culture' of Disney."
good,I liked being a Verifier.  It was fun looking at all of the toys and costumes.  Breaks were okay and some of the people.  Very crowded with all of the Temp agencies employed there.
good,Having 20 plus years of experience in all aspects of a shared service environment made working for Disney Worldwide Shared Services a perfect fit for me.
good,"order puller. picked merchandise per order.and shipped them per order.this was daily,also used a hand held computer to do this job.made boxes and counted the items to be shipped ..quality was a must and speed needed to be accurate ."
good,"Working for Disney was a dream come true.  Everyone I worked with from the managers to the staff was very kind.  The pay was was less than a person could do to live, and they expected open availability.  We got a lot of perks, and park benefits, but I couldn't survive on the pay.  I miss working for Disney, but am glad I found something I could live on."
good,"Although the guest service work at the Disneyland Resort is helpful for future positions elsewhere, the financial compensation does not cover basic costs of living, especially given that many deductions are applied to one/s paycheck. Such deductions include high-priced union dues for union representatives who do not know current procedures or policies."
good,"I don't mind working again for the company given the opportunity."
good,Can be a very demanding job and fails to take into account that people have priorities outside the workplace. But can also be extremely fun and fast paced.
good,with this being my first job i knew not what to expect but working with the manager i had she was sure to get me in the right dirrection. disney was just the beging
good,"Disney is a place for people willing to learn and get the basics for further advancement internally or elsewhere."
good,"Especially working season, one must be constantly on their toes and not miss any details. Customers shopping around the holiday season tend to leave the store a bit disorganized, so cleanup can be quite the task."
good,"Disney has a very high expectation for their employees, but the salary does not match the level of responsibility."
good,Large company to move around different segments but it is not enough to work hard. You need to network in order to move around. Most groups hire/promote from within.
good,"It's nice learning how to make the store magical for the guests, but it was not always magical behind the scenes. I learned how to engage with guests and make their visit the best it could be."
good,"Disney has varieties of teams. Depending on the team and org, you will have a complete different experience. I would say I was not part of a cool team and so the experience was not so pleasant."
good,Working at Disney was interesting. Seeing all of their different characters and items was fun. We had to make sure we were very careful when packing and shipping these items.
good,It was really nice when I worked I meet some great people there. This place has been closed for some years now. I don't know how much more you want to know this job has ended.
good,"You will get addicted to the culture within this organization, so much so that once you have gotten comfortable working within the company, most people simply just don't want to leave."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"This store gets many small children as guests, which is great for anyone who loves children and would like to work with them. However it is not a place you can grow in much, the ages visiting the store can limit your growth in communication skills. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the environment of the shop. Coworkers were amazing to work with."
good,Not an environment i would like to work in again.  Rude coworkers. Never returned back my calls. Only fun part was playing with the kids and at the cash register
good,"""We work while others play"" is the slogan every new cast member must repeat at orientation. If you are the ""others"" this slogan is great. For the Disney worker this means missing out on almost all important famiy events and holidays. The work environment is fun for the most part, but very stressful at times."
good,"Disney Epcot is a great place to work. The guest are always great and easy going. You can meet other cast members from other countries. Everynight you can enjoy the illuminations, you feel like you're in vacation but you have to give your best because the Disney cast member have to be perfect."
good,Good Company to work. An overall decent management to work with. Proper guidance and training are provided to completely understand the project for Quality Assurance
good,"My over all experience has been good. I approve of the CEO and the company's direction. There were some changes in the company as a result of the new direction, but it was all good in the end."
good,"Enjoyed working there as it's only seasonal work"
good,"Tedious & monotonous "
good,"Working for Disney centered more on fun and games than actually learning. A typical day consisted of preparing lesson plans for the evening and preparing the classroom for the days students. Days consisted of teaching 3 to 7 classes of 10 to17 students per classroom. Each class was 45 min or 90 min long. Each class we would focus phonics, vocabulary, and proper ways to use the vocabulary in a sentence. At the end of each class we would demonstrate to the parents what the children have learned. I learned the dynamics of a new culture and enjoyed meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was having to focus more on being a performer than being a teacher."
good,"Those who live and breathe Disney fare much better than those who prefer to branch out in their tastes.  Life/Work balance is askew - a typical day for me was 9am - 7pm.  Culturally, I'm sure it varies depending on the division you're in, but the place is rated PG, which can be a good thing, but we're all adults, so it's weird."
good,"Fun place to work during the holidays, which is what I did. Gets a little hectic sometimes but they always keep it fun. I absolutely love Disney stuff and Disney music so that really helped."
good,"Focus of the job is to have fun with it and make it a wonderful experience to the guests. Customer service is to be taken serious. Typical day consisted of assisting guests, maintaining the work flow f the area, be sure to make sure every guest is a happy guest."
good,"Fun place to work, but it can be stressful. It is long and strenuous to advance. life work balance is non-existent. A good place to learn though."
good,disney is the most magical place on earth. when you work here you get a lot comps. pay is not so good though. only apply if you're throwing up magic.
good,Good base for learning and developing in your career as you start out. Able to grow your personal and professional brand by partnering with various different departments on a daily basis. Good medical and educational benefits.
good,The college program was not what I expected at all. Worked 46-58 hours a week with three 14 hour shifts a week. Will not be returning to this company.
good,"everyday is an adventure no day is the same in my area we learn about our guest from all over the world .being by the ocean is amazing sunsets, sea life and experiences."
good,"I work on several contracts within Disney, so I never feel like I'm doing the same thing everyday. What I enjoy doing the most is working on the help@disney emails. People all over the world email in for help, and I enjoy solving any issues they're experiencing. Whether it be an issue with an online Disney competition, or an issue with booking their Disney holiday. "
good,"Good direction with experienced staff but projects move slowly due to embedded infrastructure."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"great environment , when its hot its hot , when its cold its cold , great people to be around ever body helps everybody . its a very big building they has water for everybody and also make sure you are comfortable"
good,"Overall, the company is enjoyable. The company does a lot of good in the community and being part of the brand can be fun. As a general rule, there are fun team building events and quality leadership to help with professional development. There are plenty of opportunities to learn something new if you take initiative."
good,Room for growth and opportunity. Worked in various fields and loved the culture. Benefits were great and great work perks.
good,"I can not say enough about the friendly atmosphere and commeraderie amongst the Cast Members at the Walt Disney company. Everyone there is super friendly and great. The job, however, was mind-numbingly boring and did not pay very well. Opportunity to advance in the company was non-existent, despite what some there may say. Management, while still nice people who are easy to get along with, were not interested in helping staff succeed or advance."
good,"In and of itself the job was interesting and fun, and I did learn a lot about the QA field for video games, but the management seemed to be lacking. There was a very negative vibe among co-workers and the lead would do nothing to help solve the issues. I also experienced harassment many days for my beliefs. There were some very helpful people that helped me get started but more than often I felt like I was dumped in a playpen with a group of little boys. The best part of the job was when we were actually doing the job and discussing the games, the bugs, etc. that was about the only time you could actually have a conversation with many of the testers without them being straight up jerks."
good,I do not wish to discuss my time there. I left for multiple reasons not limited to but including not being treated fairly and not having my schooling taken seriously. I had to leave college because I did not have time to study and work.
good,Fast paced work environment. Help guest with their bags to the room and  unload cages with luggage from the airport in a approximate time.
good,"Disneyland is a great place to work if you need to get through school. It pays higher than any other entry level job out of high school probably will. However once you are in a location it can be easy to get stuck and transferring is a lengthy process. While they will make attempts to work with a school schedule,  dont expect holidays off.  They are very strict on appearance and management is a hit ot miss depending on location in the park. Most locations in the park can be very stressful as well since you are dealing with a large amount of guests on a daily basis."
good,"This a ground force job for starter in law enforcement. Good for starting your career. This a ground floor job, needs more field training."
good,being a assistant manager gave me a lot of opportunity to learn a lot about myself and how to mold myself and adjust to everyone's different personalities. Usually we are busy and everyone works hard and as a team. my cast members rely a lot on the assistant managers.
good,"- long hard, tiring."
good,"Viajens seguidas umas das outras, sem nem um dia de descanço, as vezes apenas algumas horas."
good,"j'étais dans un poste qui organisais les événements spéciaux ,dans tout le parc ainsi que dans les hôtels, comme des conférences, anniversaire, foire des métiers, ect."
good,good work hours we work the 4 day ten hour a day shift which is great giving three days to be home with family. Typical day was  work in a large room with other analyst
good,"Was able to gain experience on a variety of skills. Worked testing mobile and console titles, and was given leadership responsibilities."
good,exceptional company focused on creativity and kids. ever growing place with challenging tasks. TV channels are not the core of its brand.
good,I did not have an issue working with the people. The biggest issue was that I was going to school in Miami and my manager would schedule me while I was in class. Therefore I had to many no call no shows.
good,"This was the  most exhausting, rewarding experience. The perks definitely cancel out work life. If you have the time, I would recommend this."
good,"worked here on and off twice , just never secured a full time job so cant say to much"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I work in a creative environment.  The enthusiasm for learning is rewarding on a daily basis."
good,"great company, great benefits & teams that can appreciate the hard work of the team in the retail stores. The expectation of the only salaried person is a bit much, not the support that one would exoect"
good,"da questa esperienza di lavoro ho imparato a lavorare su di me, per correggere gli aspetti del mio carattere più scontrosi e per esprimere con più disinvoltura quelli più comunicativi. la difficoltà è stata tenere una riserva di energia per la sfera privata, tra gli orari dei turni. la parte più piacevole, sicuramente, il contatto con il pubblico e quella più soddisfacente, sentirsi parte di un gruppo e partecipare al raggiungimento di obiettivi per il bene comune."
good,Walt Disney Studios was a great place to work.  I enjoyed the Disney culture and working in the Library/Vault area handling physical assets coming in from post-production.
good,"Creo que es una gran empresa, muy experimentada tanto en el surtido y producto que ofrecen como en las técnicas de gestión del personal. El problema en mi caso fue que esas técnicas no se aplicaban en la tienda en que trabajé y se prescindió en un tiempo muy breve del 70% del personal."
good,"Most of the people I work with are awesome.  I feel appreciated by my immediate leaders and teams.  The pay is not comparable to the 'outside world'.  The fast-growing trend is 'more work and less time to accomplish it with less resources and less people'."
good,"Not a good management, poor decision making powers because of this final product always gets hamper. Also art gets surprisingly lowest priority in company like Disney."
good,"Flexible schedule and great benefits. I enjoy working for Disney, great opportunity for advancements. Friendly and great co-workers, enjoy every aspect of my current role."
good,Internship had nice perks like free theme park tickets and random events on the studio lot but very corporate culture.  There is no room for growth and compensation is low.
good,The days are long and the work load is intense.  The people are wonderful and management is average. What I like about the company is the creative culture and the innovative work spaces. Disney is always one step ahead of it's completion which brings pride in working for the company.
good,"This being the HP Partner for support, exposure to HP Products and keeps you inline to the latest technology. Very good place to work with for technology oriented people. Chances of getting moved to HP directly"
good,it was a fast paced environment with lots of team members involved with the job. its a fun experience working for Disney and being able to interact with different people.
good,Mes journées de travail au seins de cette entreprise étaient assez fatigante. J'étais parfois de nuit. Mais l'ambiance de travail était quand même assez agréable vu que je n'étais pas le seul jeune de l'équipe.
good,"There were many great corporate resources for the artists working and designing Disney collateral, print and internet."
good,"Working for this company is rewarding, as well as difficult.  You basically have to have your whole entire schedule free for random shifts throughout all hours of the day and night.  All holidays you are expected to work, and there isn't very much opportunity for advancement through the company even with higher education."
good,"Good hours, shifts can be short or very long. Frustrating at times because of Disney standards, but it is rewarding at times"
good,Great company! You have alot of growth and opportunity. Constantly working with people who enjoy what they are doing and always wanting to develop.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Working for Disney was very challenging, but rewarding. I gained character and great communication skills."
good,"Disney isn't exactly the BEST company to work for, yes you get your perks like tickets and discounts but I personally don't agree with the way management is ran or how employees are treated. If you have a CHOICE, I would run far from Disney. Hope this is helpful"
good,"Working here I have learned a lot. Fun place to work at. Difficult for advancement. Pay is not the greatest but hey payed vacation, sick days. Get people in for free. The most difficult will be at night or weekends because there are more new people. Something will always go wrong."
good,"they are not ready for diversity, if you are a minority your hard work will just be hard work, you will not move up, nor will you be considered."
good,"As a member of the Housekeeping team, responsibilities include, but are not limited to, overall cleaning of guest rooms, including stripping and making beds, vacuuming, dusting, and replenishing items such as linens, amenities and various supplies. Housekeeping cast members also interact with guests daily, responding in a timely manner to their requests, assisting with directions and sharing information."
good,Guaranteed 40 hours a week.  Get to network with hundreds of like-minded people in our industry.  Great benefits.  Working hours are a challenge.  Different off days each week.
good,that this a big company and don't value their worker..i had tro help people and the company got upset because I went out my way.
good,Answered all incoming calls and emails related to billing and game play.
good,"very fun and amusing. Co-workers are great and helpful, management goes above and beyond to assist in every need."
good,"brilliant working environment, friendly co-workers, gained ample experience about warehouse enviroments enjoyed socializing with the fellow staff at disney"
good,Disconnected management with unrealistic sales objectives and lack of resources to achieve high productivity.
good,"good company and business to work for, im looking to possibly relocate given the right situation."
good,Busy call center environment taking calls from guests about the Walt Disney Resort area.
good,working at The Walt Disney Company was very interesting and fun
good,The culture at this organisation is youthful and energetic. with the non stop pace at workplace there is no time sit back and relax but keep moving and enjoy.
good,"environnement de travail très exigeant, mais convivial dans le fond"
good,"Gestion de la vente de la gamme vidéo sur 5 départements."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,its an ok job. i love the environment but the workers are just unsettling. you try to have fun but sometimes dont even feel like going to work. no room for growth and not worth the pay just to stay with this job. need something more stable and need something to actually pay the bills with
good,"Assisted guests with phone and online orders, provided specific product Information, supplied spontaneous resolutions for customer issues, and responded to copious email requests while achieving required goals"
good,Projects were hard to find.  Learning new niche products was the best part of the job.
good,My skills and experience is not fully utilized here. Communication is limited.
good,This job had three shifts open mid and close.Open would keep the utensils cart stock mid would come and sweep and pick up the trays to be wash and reused.close would keep trash bin clean and empty never letting it get to full and before leaving would make sure that every thing is clean. the hardest part was dealing with the weather your are all ways out side so there was ac when was blazing hot and not heater when it was freezing cold the most enjoyable part was even as a part timer u had at lest 30 hours
good,I have a different activity to do everyday of work. My co-workers make the work day fun and go by fast. I learn something new almost everyday because there is a lot to learn no matter where or how long i have worked somewhere. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my accomplishments at the end of the day.
good,É uma empresa que respeita o funcionário e prima pela ética.
good,"el trabajo constaba de dos puestos con turno mañana y tarde,rotativo,realizabamos el control de stock de la mercaderia que nos llegaba,reacomodar escaparates."
good,Disney is a historic company that provided a great starting point for my career.
good,"We had a strict reporting time. Have learned to close sales deals for concepts to the clients  and also draw premium revenues to achieve targets on individual and team basis."
good,This was a temporary sales job that was in a fun enviorment. The sales were fairly easy however I made alot of commission by advertising on my own outside of work. I worked as a shift supervisor amd trainee.
good,"It ended up not being the place I want to work in the long run, but it was a great experience to learn from."
good,This job was all about learning. The Disney company put a lot of concentration on training the employees and interns. The classes they provided were great stepping stones in my education and helped me to understand the expectations and inner workings of large corporations.
good,"Typical day was come in, grab some Coffee, settle in, Check E-mails, check Jira, and then get started on whatever projects I had that day. Ads were typical, as were animations, Virals, and Page layouts. We got lunch catered every day, and every day was diffrent. We had the ability to opt out if we wanted. Then after lunch was usually more work, and communications with the Home office (which was in Palo Alto CA) More projects, and then home."
good,"journée assez souple car tout les jours je suis confronté à un poste différent ce qui nous évite la routine."
good,"This job is ideal for someone who doesn't really need a fulltime job, just some play money. Love the company, but, need a better paying adult job."
good,Depending on what you are required to do it can be either boring or exciting.  Summer time and holidays are the most busy.  It can be boring and the day can drag if there are small amount of visitors. 
good,Walt Disney Travel Company is a great company to work for. Benefits are on par with other companies in the area and the opportunity for growth is immense.
good,"trabajaba muy augusta allí. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Daily guest interaction from people all over the world.  I work when everybody else gets to play.  Making smiles.
good,"We were a team of eight, fit into a small room with barely any wireless internet!"
good,You had the chance to make people's vacation plans come true. The benefits were great because you could go to Disney anytime for free. Also I was able to earn commission on top of pay
good,Um dia típico de trabalho era realizar as rotinas financeiras da empresa.
good,"This job had a large crew and management team that were in an out on this seasonal basis. Hours ranged nearly 24 hours with the store being located in a mall. High traffic, lost prevention and locked down nights of register counting and cleaning are what this job entails."
good,"Working in this warehouse has been a life changing experience i have learned so much here, its an ok place to work however everyone stats off part time and they hardly make anyone full time. there has been people there that have waited 5 years to become full time."
good,Everyone knew they're place yet were cordial. Management was nice.
good,"It a fun workplace if your looking for a summer job. Great interactions with people from all walks of life & co- workers turn in to family members. The best thing about working their is the co-workers make everyone feel like family, they make the job fun. The worst part is the management. Most of the management have power issues & most of them don't even hold a college degree. Advancement in the company can be easy if you kiss up & the management team likes you. If they detest you, your out of luck. The benefits are really great for full time employees & most employee are part of a union so they had job security."
good,Worked on the ship in the drydock.Worked on anchor brakes and propulsion.
good,"Good quality of life, good atmosphere. Very limited advancement opportunities. Working in theme parks, the hours can be very intense, but there is nothing like it in the world."
good,"I learned so much working with the Disney Institute for 4 years. The onboarding and initial training was top of its class. I loved the work that I did and the people I worked with were supportive. Management needs some help, and they need to bring more outside people into the company to move past groupthink. They are not equipped to create a secure culture for their remote Cast Members. Working remote was tough for career advancement opportunities and the support of the Disney Institute from the larger organization was not very present. Overall it was a good experience and I learned so much that I am excited to bring to my next opportunity."
good,"It was a good job in the beginning. Once you start your emploment, the things you were told don't come to fruition. The management is lacking, they do not stand behind you."
good,Disney is a fun and stable place to work if you are seeking to maintain lower level of employment. It becomes increasingly difficult to move up in the ranks and is a continuous battle of seniority and who you know versus actual qualifications relevant to the job .
good,"Disney is a place where dreams can come true, what you need to keep in mind is that nightmares are also dreams. You can either love your job, or you can just have a bad time there. Disney is looking for perfection in its workers, and have a very high standard of what they expect. If you feel like your struggling, most managers will help you. And Always ALWAYS join the union. It will protect your job from unfairness."
good,"Depending on how much the manager wants to advance his career is now much he/she how much you will be pushed.  At the same time, depending on the supervisor, will determine how much your efforts will taken in consideration"
good,"Middle management needs to better focus on moving the business forward rather than pursue ""fun and friendly"" outside of work relationships with subordinates."
good,"Working for WDW for me was a DREAM COMING THROUGH, I performed differents positions, start as housekeeper, merchandise, vacation planner, bus driver, but...today day is very hard, sorry but after so many years they don't want you stay anymore, dosen't matter how hard you working."
good,"I did the Disney College Program and can say that I wouldn't want to work there PT or FT. The pay sucks for what we have to endure from guests and sometimes management, the hours are flaky and you're always competing with your coworkers for more shifts. The best thing about being a cast member is the free park admission and seasonal discounts."
good,"Depending on the team you work on it will determine your experience as far as typical day, learning, management, and culture.  What is enjoyable about the job are the company perks."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,If you're a student looking for a job that is extremely flexible this is probably the ideal job for you. Working full time and trying to make a living is nearly impossible working inside of the parks.
good,"This was the best job I've ever had in my life. I felt that I learned a lot about game development but I don't think it helped me launch a career like I thought it would. Four years later I'm still struggling to get anyone to look twice at me or my skills, even with Disney Interactive on my resume."
good,"Fun workplace"
good,"This was an internship. Very difficult work but great culture to keep you going. Great experience, considering it was a temporary internship. "
good,"I work hard everyday making great food but have not gotten a raise since I worked here and don't want to be stagnant in my career. I love my schedule, but don't feel appreciated for the work I do."
good,le managment est très bon et les collègues très sympas
good,Disney Interactive was my first testing job. It was a great place to learn and grow as a tester. Though there is very little room to grow and any positions available were scooped up immediately.
good,"My trainer was rude and didn't help me learn. Then I was let go because I was unable to follow the protocol that the trainer failed to teach. I really hated this because I enjoyed being a cast member, and working with guests. Essentially, my anger is towards the employees, not the company or parks."
good,"Great place to work with smart people.  Most want to do the right thing.  Either you move up or move out, however, so prepare for one or the other as you grow in the company."
good,Otimo lugar para se trabalhar e desenvolver habilidades profissionais
good,"Working at Disney was exhilarating and challenging. The challenge was to complete a never before attempted project under extreme conditions, with high expectations."
good,"Fun to work with the public and help with their day.  No opportunity for growth,  hard to get time off, hard to get full time. Growth opportunities are better in certain departments"
good,Great experience to travel and learn different cultures but the work expectations were to high for all employees. Pay was good with incentives for salary increase and position advancement
good,"The job in China improved a lot after  I  left.   They started to  offer  3  +   6 -  month  opportunities.  Had that  been an  option  when I was there,  I might have stayed  longer."
good,Depending on where you work will depend the type of management you have and the type of work you'll be doing. Some locations such as F&B may have longer and harder shifts versus merchandise locations. Some locations such as MK are the busiest.
good,"I first started working at Disney as part of the internship then eventually went seasonal, part time, and full time. I loved it in the beginning as I was and still am a Disney fan. However, the ""magic"" was a little tainted when I started working there. Wages are very low and the work can be very hard most of the time. The parks are great to visit but terrible to work for."
good,"Working here I did have a lot of fun with guests and my co workers. I've met some really great people but the pay is not the best. You get paid every week but for what they require you to do the pay is not enough. You work a lot, on your feet, keeping a smile on your face, but not always getting supported by your team. Advancement opportunities are there but some managers play favorites so its almost like high school in that sense."
good,"Company is great with great culture. But like anywhere else, it all depends on which dept/group you are with. Company cares about the individual, but easy to get lost in the shuffle..it's a large organization."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,It was a fun place to work and you always had something to do but there wasn't room for growth and the pay wasnt very good and they over hired so not enough hours for everyone
good,Disney provides their employees with the tools they need to be successful at their job. They take the time to train and make sure their cast members know their job.
good,The nature of the job was very lax however the rules and regulations were particularly stringent based on the compensation received. The work culture seniority is based on time in position and advancement can be difficult  for the impatient and those not akin to bureaucracy.
good,"Getting into the parks free was nice, but the lack of pay even as a full time cast member was very upsetting. I worked there for nearly 4 years, 2 of them as full time and still made well below $25k, and just barely above min wage. Guests could be awful or amazing, much of how your day went depended on the people you met, location, and the people you worked with. I ended up leaving due to the commute being too much, and a  retail store closer to home offered a higher starting wage than what I had been making with Disney after 4 years."
good,"I grew up a Disney Fanatic, and I was thrilled to land this highly competitive internship doing what I love. But the fact that my team and I made less than a living wage and weren't allowed any time off in our 8 month internship created highly stressful situations. A lot of Orlando Disney employees are homeless, or on strike. Getting into the parks for free is a great perk, but not being able to pay rent or feed yourself is not a comfortable feeling."
good,"If you are In your career field, or not, take advantage of what Disney has to offer. Connections, networking, resources. In life everything is not made for everyone. Some love it some don't. I had a great time there made tons of friends and learned a lot.  Enjoy the ride and or the view."
good,This company is very inclusive and provides good extras to their employees. The management is overall easy to work with and the fellow cast members are good at communicating during tasks that require team work. it is fun to interact with the guests and provide magical experiences
good,It is fun to be able to go to the parks for free but they definitely expect a lot out of their employees. Be ready to work! Sometimes will be scheduled long hours.
good,"Working at Disney World for the College Program is a mixed bag. You may have a fun role and nice managers or you can have the complete opposite where you are get chewed out by angry guests non stop. I did the College Program twice and I liked it a lot more the second time due to my role as Custodial. Managers were mainly friendly, interactions with guests were pleasant, and the shifts went by very quickly. Unlike other roles you had the option of trading locations with other cast members so I was able to work at various other resorts and parks which was tons of fun. Like I said its a mixed bag. I didn't really enjoy being a park greeter or watercraft deckhand that much but thats because I'm a bit too sensitive to work in customer service so custodial was more of my thing."
good,Needs more structure and better pay. Be more concern about the workers than production. Give some type of incentive make the employers feel like they're appreciate. If the workers are happy then things should flow.
good,"Good place to work, long working hours, availability of overtime and not too stressful work. However, the agency which is called industra steals money from the workers by not paying them fully. Plus they keep charging them for fees that do not exist. Sometimes, the money gets paid back after several weeks, other times they get away with the money."
good,"I had both good management and bad management at Disney.  What I found is that if your supervisor is incompetent then they will be threatened by anyone who is competent and will try to cause them to fail.  This creates a poor work environment and stifles growth leading to poor attitudes by workers.  Under great management which I also experienced,  workers flourish and feel appreciated which leads to good morale and advancement.  Unfortunately, union workers, if they are bad workers, are almost impossible to fire and that can bring down morale."
good,"Not a bad place to work, really, if you don't mind the low pay.  Other than that, benefits are decent as well as the vacation and Disney discounts."
good,"When you hear Disney you expect all the magic, however the reality is they cut a lot of corners at the cast members expense a lot of the time. great benefits but no room to grow the people in any desirable positions don't leave."
good,"Since dubai is a open city and lots of tourist people is coming here they beed to come up with the design not only for local people or as general."
good,"The insight and knowledge gained everyday when working with stakeholders, executives, direct reports, colleagues, business, technology, and vendor partners is invaluable."
good,"Like any large company, your experience at Disney is highly dependent on which group you work for and especially your manager. Early on in my career here, my manager was burdened with wearing three hats: selling our group's services to other segments of Disney, doing release planning, and being the product owner. Over the past couple years, they've been divvying that role up more, which has helped, but there are still managers that have too much work and too few resources here. In addition, QA is a bit of a problem, since they aren't willing to pay for enough QA engineers and often don't budget enough time for the developers to fully QA a product. They are just getting to cloud deployments and automating the testing of many of the products developed here."
good,"Même si nous somme trop sur les clients, le quotas de ventes est tout de même élevé. Le seul soucis est que l'ambiance de travail entre collègue n'est pas des plus attirant."
good,This company had great perks  for the medical benefits. The  option for discounts and park entries for you and your family are also a plus.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I enjoyed working for Disney for the longest time. I worked at a brand new animation studio and enjoyed the people for the most part. I never could connect with my peers being among an older/family job crew. Lots of great parties and celebrations among the several lay-offs and project cancellations.
good,"Worked on several films with Walt Disney Animation Studios.  Consistantly, the last third of the project amounted to 6 day weeks, 60+ hours.  That said, the films are turned out beautiful.  If you care more for the craft than your personal life, this might be the place for you."
good,Was my first job out of college was very exciting and got my feet wet in the business world.  Learned a lot there as well and had great experiences.  For instance worked on the Summer Olympics 1984 in LA as a liason for KABC-TV with other TV stations from around the world.
good,Working for the Walt Disney company is a great opportunity to learn and grow in a professional level. The ethiks and drive needed to work in this amazing company will push and test you but for those few that can overcome the difficult trials will find not only a fulfilling career but also a family.
good,Malheuresement les opportunites d'evolution sont assez bloques car tres peu de mouvement.
good,"The advantage Disney Parks has over other companies is stability and excellent benefits.  The health benefits are pricey but you get what they promise in terms of coverage without having claims rejected, etc."
good,"I had a good experience with the company, great people and work-life balance at least in my team. The work was interesting but I wish that they gave more responsability on the projects I was given. The full time employees have great benefits but people stay in their positions for a long time so it's hard to be promoted."
good,the company as a whole was fun meet alot of different people different cultrues .  management as a whole.  you knew who would do whatever they could to get ahead who there favorites were.  and who they chose to move up in the company.  (even if they didnt have people skills
good,"It was a seasonal position, creating w/o's that comes via fax, emails, incoming calls, daily communication with customers, sales. This was a good place to work but not enough hours. This was a seasonal assignment that ended."
good,"You have no time for a personal life, basically very time consuming with everything. Management was not so great, and seniority means nothing, its all about who your friends with."
good,"I have been there for some time and enjoy my co-workers and for the most part the job, but there are times where it can get stressful."
good,Good company with good benefits.  Hours can be challenging as a lot of work is done on third shift.  Typical day are 9-10 hours.
good,It was always busy. I Had to take luggage to the guest rooms answer to any of their needs. Help them with any other extra things they might need.
good,"Its is a great job for being in close contact with people from around the world. interacting with people on and in the pool areas is so amazing that it is a pleasure to go to work .  The upside and down side of this position is the constant training , regardless of weather conditions.  Training is great and enjoyable , but during the cold snaps working in an water environment is taxing.   The management do help you in many ways and provide safe working environments ."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the different people you are exposed to working with and the people you are serving from around the world.
good,"Aprendi la venta al publico, el vocabulario distinto qe hay qe aplicar, la gerencia estaba bien dirigida, con autoridad, y todos los dias haciamos ejercicios para subir autoestima y animo para salir a vender con mas entusiasmo"
good,"I worked in great studio that strived to push the envelope in games and creativity.  I was fortunate to have worked with such great people.  "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Great place to work."
good,"No room for advancement or growth. Amount of ours is very inconsistent. One week you will work 10 hours another week 20 hours. I enjoy working for the company and interacting with the customers, but wish the hours were more consistent and they offered full-time work with benefits."
good,"Working at Disneyland is a very fun first job, but i really want to move forward to bigger and better things. I learned a lot from working at Disneyland , the managers were very nice and responsible. The hardest part of my job was the fast pace, but i got used to it after a year of working there. The most enjoyable part of my job was making people happy."
good,Great for work/life balance. Average salary and benefits. Slow paced. Very less chance of growth promotion.
good,"Lots of interaction with people on a daily basis. Lots of dealing with upset guests, frustrated people. Management has many bad days. Tons of emphasis on seniority."
good,One of the busiest call centers I've worked in - of course it was holiday time and the economy was better then. If you need a frequent restroom break this is not a compatible job. Fun staff to work with. Hardest part of job is handling upset customers. Most enjoyable is employee discount.
good,"While working for the Walt Disney Company, I felt my talents where passed over for persons with less qualifications but longer tenure.  I believe in advancing the right person for the job not the person that has been there the longest."
good,"You get to go to the parks for free and most coworkers are cool, but you're easily replaceable. With so many frontline cast members in the company, you sort of feel like just a number there, and most managers don't take the time to learn your name. That being said, it's a fun and flexible job for college students. If you're looking for a career, the company has plenty of room for advancement if you're willing to put in the time."
good,"Work experience depended greatly on what location you worked at, your direct management, what line of business you were in, and how close you lived to the resort. Having worked in quick-serve foods, it could be rather rough and tiring, especially being a cashier that couldn't leave their designated spot without a replacement or a supervisor. I also worked completely surrounded by customers, which could be even more exhausting."
good,"Can be a lot of fun working for The Walt Disney Company. You get into Disneyland for free and get several tickets each year to get friends and family in. No matter what department you are in, there is drama. Many young cast members act as if they're in high school. Management doesn't provide cast members with enough working tools to accomplish details properly but just well enough."
good,"This company provides so many things for so many people.  I was very proud to be a part of the magic. The job can be stressful.  "
good,It's very much a job that depends on your overall attitude towards the Disney product and your showmanship. A great place to work part time and experience interactions with guests and a confidence builder as well as get your first steps into the company.
good,Great company to find were you fit best for your talents. Don't join the union. The union is the weakest link of the company; you will only progress as far as the worst worker.
good,"I learned how to work as a team. I was learning project management. The hardest part of the job was sometimes getting needed equipment "
good,"At Disney, my typical day was managing resources and guiding management and technical staff of strategic direction of Technology. The culture at Disney was for everyone to be trained the Disney ways. This included new employee orientation day was for one full week long. We reviewed all WDW business units, employee responsibilities and benefits."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment of The Walt disney Company. I loved building relationships with guests and providing the best experience possible. I enjoyed the responsibility I had with my attractions role, though I wish there was more room for career advancement within the company."
good,"I am currently enrolled in the Disney College Program with the Walt Disney World Company as a Guest Operations Specialist at the ESPN Sports Complex. I began this internship in May 2018 and will finish up Jan. 3, 2019. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I did the DCP for spring 2018. It was really fun but very rigorous when it came to working. I was a vendor so I got to hop all over MK. If you aren't up for walking 20 miles plus per day in the heat, it's not for you. But the experience was still great. The management and the work atmosphere was very friendly, and upbeat. So many laughs and great connections were made, and the free tickets for my family was definitely a plus. As long as you do the work, the play aspect is worthwhile. I wasn't there for the money. The downside is that the pay barely got you by if you spent it all on junk food and merch. I was good but I know many that were scraping pennies together to get by. Be wise with your money!"
good,"One of the best experiences of my life, but also lost the magic a bit for me since working behind the scenes. The management differs so much between work locations."
good,"The workplace is always fun. I learned to be open and communicate with my colleges and guests. Management always had a great attitude. The hardest part of the job is when guests don't like technical difficulties or being told ""no"". The most enjoyable part is the people you work with. You make lifetime friendships with many people from 18-60+ years old with great vibes and attitudes."
good,The culture is great but there is not much room for growth. Hardest part of the job is having to do the job of 5 other people but you are not rewarded for your work.
good,"While Radio Disney was still around it was aptly referred to by my superiors as the ""pinkie toe of Disney"". No benefits or ability to transfer internally within Disney."
good,"unless you know someone, hard to get promoted, if you looking to go in to the parks, it's great specially if you have kids, but there is a lot of blackout dates"
good,"There are a lot of pros and cons to working for the Mouse. Got a lot of great perks when I was there like discount, park entry, etc. I have heard that they have been cutting those things back gradually though. No other benefits until you are full-time. You have to put in some time as a part-time worker before getting full-time, and your record has to be pretty spotless to be considered."
good,I would have loved to stay .  I just had trouble with the verbal test on the monorail.  You have to be able to clear speak to to control.  If you fail this the will force transfer you out.
good,"I worked with a lot of good people at WDW, I also worked with so many people that the union protected that should have been fired from any job. A lot of call outs you will have to cover ect. Managers are distant for the most part and are mostly office workers. Pay is poor for expectations. Best part of the job by far is the benefits."
good,Disney has the benefit of being able to pay employees very poorly because so many people want to work there. Overall the work and colleagues are amazing but the pay is just garbage
good,"Great company values but management is not so great. It has a ""High School"" kind of vibe. Pay is not great for the tasks you are expected to do but if you love the Disney Brand it may be worth it for you."
good,"I was only on a short-term contract. The Seattle office was great, though--agile, creative, fun, and motivated. There did seem to be a chasm between Seattle and the corporate office, though."
good,"I learned a lot on my college program, including what amount of work is biting off more than what I can chew. The workplace culture is swell if you have the right leaders, but in general, working at Magic Kingdom, you should prepare yourself for long hours and rowdy guests, as well as making magical moments with guests who have waited all their lives to come to Walt Disney World."
good,My day began in a exciting workplace & culture that generated the best results for the organization.  Just because i was great sales person doesn’t mean i will be an effective leader. However i learn that with those few years.
good,"In my experience with the Walt Disney Company I was able to get some of the best training in guest service. It was the number one goal.  It's what the company strives for,  making sure every guest has a positive experience, and we go above and beyond to make sure that happens.  This company has also trained many other companies because our way of thinking, definitely works."
good,"Best projects! Such a fun company to work for! I made some of the best friends during my time working at Disney and the employees are quite characters, very kind people."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney is a pretty fun place to work. We get into the parks for free, and the pay isn't so bad starting out. The benefits could be better, and they don't treat their employees as well as they should."
good,"I was a cook for Disney world as an intern and I liked it. I liked the diversity of the place, but the management needs work. The culture can be a bit overwhelming at times, but that might be the point."
good,"environnement de travail agréable, belle entreprise"
good,"The pay doesn't match the work that is entailed for their leadership team at the resort.  There is little to no room for advancement.  Its a great part time job, but as a full time cast member, you cannot survive off these wages."
good,"Managers need to spend more time with staff and have less of a hierarchy approach to management. Great working environment, ability to go to premiers and after parties, great place to grow your career"
good,great work experience learned about the  magic of Walt Disney and how it feels to create magic for all guest young and old.
good,"Didn't want to leave, only left due to past convictions and the company wont take anyone on with prior convictions. did customer service on day to day basis on either email, chat or phone calls. It's like working within a family, everyone is so eager to help you if they can."
good,if you can stand in one place and not move from designated area then you''ll be fine. this guy pays cash plus comiision on your sales.
good,"Working for Disney was very rewarding due to the content of the work and the ability to create memorable experiences for Guests. Unfortunately, Disney is a big company and is plagued by office politics. I felt like working hard was not rewarded and management was more concerned about hiring their friends than hiring productive workers. Hopefully, it was just my department because the content of the work at Disney is pretty awesome."
good,They don't seem to really know what they are doing but some of the benefits are amazing. But they are always changing. So do not expect to do the same thing every day.
good,"Management is supportive of your career advancement and person growth.  Challenging, fun work and workplace. This company not only designs, builds and developments entertainment magic, it truly is the happiest place to work and play."
good,"Very happy working environment with  everycalibur of people from different cities and countries. It is truely a place where dreams come true, atleast while dinning with us.  It is a very high pace work environment where meals are produced at a quality standard. From the preping of salads, to the hot demands of the large grill.  We welcome and greet everyone that come to our restuarant. This has to be the most sanitized environment I have ever worked in.  We are constantly being reminded of the safetyrequirements and guidelines. Although this is a happy place to work, the drive is very tiresome."
good,This is a fun place to work. The cast members are what make this company great and the experience for our guest great. There are lots of different opportunities to be had if you know where to place yourself and have great mentors like I have. Unfortunately the pay is not up to standards for the cost of living especially if you have a family to support. I enjoy going to work each and every day however you find yourself spending more time at work and picking up overtime in order to make a decent salary. Work/life suffers greatly from this. Even many office and technical positions require you to work odd hours and on holidays as it's an entertainment company and it never closes.
good,Typical for a big company - executives can be a little over-bearing and the hours can be long. Perfectly manageable if you have a good level of IQ and EQ.
good,Working in the groups department is very fast paced and there is always something new to learn! The people I work with are fantastic.
good,"Though it is no longer an operable branch of Disney, it was very fun. There wasn't much room for advancement, but it was a great team."
good,"Overall the company is good, however on management level very dirty politics. No reward and recognition."
good,"A typical day at the MAP includes morning announcements contingences with choreography for that day according to dancers that were either hurt or unable to show up. 5 full shows of powerful dancing, Lunch and a nice long drive home. Management within the show differs with each stage manager or assistant. Some managers have more experience than others and operate as such during the show and or show mishaps. The Hardest part of the Job was the inconsistency with management, and sometimes there inability to communicate effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job was the extremely Talented Cast of singers and Dancers."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Fun place to work. Great co-workers. perks are ok."
good,A typical day at work consists of serving and appealing to the guests which are the number 1 priority. I've learned that hard work and dedication is extremely important when working at OKW. The management there wants to see the employees' dedication in everything they do at the resort. The coworkers are extremely diverse where I was exposed to many different cultures. There is a great deal of diversity at Walt Disney World. The hardest part of the job is the hard labor that I've done working at OKW. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting guests from all over the world and being able to put a smile on their face while providing service to them.
good,"Even though I may have had my fair share of complaints working for Disney, such as scheduling and having a life, I will never say that I regretted working there. It was easily one of the greatest experiences I have ever had and I'm so grateful I can say I worked there."
good,It was my first year working at Newbreed and it was a learning experience.
good,"I have worked for the walt disney company on a part time basis as at the time was working other jobs.  Due to the type of company that it is there are a variety of things that take place such as movie premieres, events at the studio that the company puts on, the various films shown and the added attractions and props from films as well as creating attractions for the public and working them and seeing the guests smiling faces."
good,"The work was a very fun atmosphere and my co-workers are going to be some long time friends, but it was incredibly difficult to request certain days off even though I asked for it months in advance. The hours are long on some days (up to 15 hours) and it is hard to work with some of the managers."
good,"Aprendi a supervisar a la gente de la recepción, a trabajar bajo presión constante, a pesar de que era un trabajo divertido."
good,"Depneding on time of day I was scheduled, I was responsible for opening, prepping, working upto 4 different stations."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day or job is knowing that i made someone's day by shipping their order to them on time. My co workers are great, i love working with them. I have learned alot of little short keys on the keyboard/computer."
good,"Work life balance has been great. However, the opportunity for advancement are limited. Communication between different departments can be improved."
good,"It was like no other place. Left on positive rehire terms. Would love to return."
good,The job and the people I worked with were great but the management left a lot to be desired. Management seemed to be very ill informed about jobs and daily activity as well as employees.
good,"If you’re available most of your days every day this is the job for you, the only shifts available at the time were 6am-2pm and the following week 2pm-10pm and so on and so forth. The staff were pleasant and the job wasn’t a bad job. I worked for disney through Industria and they were very helpful and offered travel for a cheap cost."
good,"Very demanding, schedule based on seniority, union dues, but those pay off, free park admission and sign ins, managment is hard to get ahold of just annoying"
good,"I think there is a great perks plan here at Disney- "
good,It's very interesting company to work For. You can learn new things about the company and its foundation and when it found by Walt....................
good,"You learn to be very bubbly and exciting if you’re not already.  Very laid back but professional work environment. Chats are available for instant help, you take notes on your calls, and the coworkers are always willing to help on calls. When it’s slow, there’s VTO. You’re rolled over after peak season if your attendance is good and if your call rating is good"
good,"Great company to work for, collaborative, good management, comfortable work-setting. There are many innovative and inspirational staff and incredibly creative."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Very fast pace, lots of early starts and late nights."
good,"Honestly loved the work, but the lack of living wage has made it difficult to make even the most basic necessities in my life possible. Depending on the area you work in, the teams there can make or break the whole work experience."
good,"The workplace is busy, which is a plus, because there is always something to do. The cast members are pleasant to work with and the atmosphere is positive and upbeat. It is a great for a person without experience to gain good knowledge and skills."
good,"Disney English isn't a bad job to have, however it isn't for everyone. Some people love it and others loathe it. Work culture all depends on where you are assigned. People's experiences are all also unique. The work hours are long on paper, but it isn't horrible in practice. The most difficult aspect is constantly having classes close and be replaced with all new students (depending on, again, the circumstances and needs of your center)."
good,"I work at the DRC.  Besides booking the perfect vacation, you have to hit over 20 points in the conversation or else you lose part of your salary.  You also have to maintain a $2000 minimum when you book a reservation or you lose your commission.  This is a demanding full-time on phone job.  There are fun Disney benefits and they are great- if you have the time to use them."
good,"Over worked, underpaid. high expectations. I loved the experience of physically going down there. Although I didn't love the whole experience, although I felt like just a number and not an actual employee they cared about."
good,My experience here wasn't all magical. It wasn't perfect and full of light like they expect the Walt Disney Company to be. Managers are almost abusive leaving employees for hours with very short breaks
good,"If Disney is good at something it is creating experiences and illusions that work ones imagination. Working here is no exception. From the get go you go through a course called Traditions it is a insight and crash course on the culture that is required to work at Disney. Everything in this course mesmerizes you and makes you feel that you are a part of something greater. This class brain washes you to believe that this is the place to be that there is no future beyond this resorts enticing, romantic, and at times cheesy environment. With that being said this is a great place to work while going to school and making something out of your life. As a leader and as a cast member that worked nearly five years with the company I can't tell you how many students dropped out because of mediocre position advancements they received while working there. I saw management with no experience manage people that had MBA's no joke. I saw hard working people get sacked because of manager preference of other employees. I saw people with perfectly great work ethic be disciplined for coaching coworkers that did not pull their part. "
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company for the last four years now and at times it can be challenging with the guests and the need to maintain a certain atmosphere but it also helps to keep yourself in a good mood. Management has always been a hit or miss, depending on who is on the team at times some managers are more helpful than others. The hardest part of the job would be the time commitment Disney asks of you and the hours but if someone is looking for hours, depending on your location, they will give you hours. Also working weekends mostly is hard. Also for me the commute. The most enjoyable part is seeing the guests happy/"
good,"Each segment is different, The Walt Disney Company as a whole is MAGICAL! Avoid politics at Corporate. A lot of restructures and change. Must be nimble and adaptable."
good,"The work is tough be rewarding; lots of magical activities to help build company morale. Work life balance is good, lots of holidays and time off."
good,Fun place to work. Everyone is quite nice and always positive. Co-workers were nice and had work experience which helped me. Getting to be part of Disney was amazing.
good,"Walt Disney World is a world-class vacation destination, but behind the scenes there is very little opportunity for advancement. Management at this company is very inconsistent and does not communicate well with their co-workers. The Cast Members (employees) working for this company are very special people that are underpaid, and not respected for the work they put forth to make peoples' vacations incredible. This company is extremely money hungry, and does not care about their workers as long as the dollar signs keep rolling in. The most enjoyable parts of my career with Disney has to be seeing the smiling faces of the guests when they enter into the Park, as well as being able to enjoy the Disney Parks after work with friends and family for free. The hardest part of the job was to advance and establish a secure career here, as even with graduating top-of-class with a bachelor's degree in honors Finance, I was still being forced to work in a job which skills were minimal, and the only educational requirement was a high school diploma."
good,very good place to work very professional gain good practice friendly place good leraning place and apply good skills lots of respect
good,"I learned the importance of hard work, been on time, giving even more effort every time. The hardest part of the job was completing the amount of room in the time necessary since it was my first job but i always gave it my all. I was managed by four managers, i was assign to three sections of the hotel so i learned to cope to different speeds and management styles due to my different managers."
good,Working for Disney has provided a great experience. I learned how to work with people from all countries. Management was very supportive and helpful.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Driving around live action wild animals on a two week safari, its always fun."
good,"Working for one of the most highly successful companies in the world has been a real pleasure, however I am looking to learn more and use my skills to better a new company."
good,Fantastic people all working to do the right thing and support each other like family.
good,"While Disney creates innovative and unique products, the business behind-the-scenes and office culture is traditional, conservative, and immune to change."
good,Co-workers were really great people to work with however management was very poor.  I learned a lot of new crafts working on many of the attraction decorations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was actually going to the park and seeing how much joy you bring to children's faces as well as adults.
good,Was able to make reservations for Disney parks and dine make Disney Magic for all while maintaining quota
good,"It was a wonderful experience with opportunities to interview for different positions, however, the compensation is very low."
good,"Its a nice Experience when is joined Disney,"
good,Working there does not feel like a job. The culture there is very welcoming at least with coworkers. Management is very up tight and by the book. Very particular about the way their cast members are presented.
good,The company is exactly that a company they do not work well if you have a second job or go to school you can put a request for a window of hours you can work but they will put you where and when they need you
good,"How you may experience working with Disney depends on which part of Disney you are a part of (i.e. Pixar, Marvel, ABC, Resorts and Products, Mobile, ESPN, Disney Animation, etc.). There's the general Disney culture, then all of the sub-cultures within each business. Some businesses have mature models led by sound leaders. Others are immature and have archaic business or IT procedures. If you are interested in working for WDW then hone in on which business you are looking to work for and investigate from there. 'Working for Disney' could mean a lot of different things depending on where you land. Also, although the benefits are wonderful you can't pay your bills with free park tickets and dental insurance. Don't go after the shiny object of benefits if the compensation isn't right for you. Disney has a tendency to pay below market value because the benefits are so good. But again, you can't feed your family with 50% off merchandise coupons. If you plan on taking a lower salary to work with Disney, be sure to make the job a part of your overall career strategy."
good,"My time at the Disney Store in Times Square was an overall great experience,  with the exception of certain leads (supervisors) trying to overwork us, and making us do additional things that were not in the job description (training newcomers)."
good,Provided essential project management administrative support to Walt Disney Company’s theme park subsidiary in support of Disneyland themed projects which included the design and installation of the Indiana Jones Adventure Ride and Tomorrowland rethemes as well as renovations at Walt Disney World Epcot Center
good,since i'm working for walt disney company i learned a lot and improved my skills and developed others. I like to work with guests to make their trips or vacations unforgettable.
good,"the biggest con of working for the Disney reservation center is that you are given a name to which you go by and are not allowed to use your own name, time off was difficult to get approved"
good,was a fun place to work. hr weren't that flexible. breaks were short also the space was small and crowded. hrs did go though also the locations extremely far.
good,siempre fue bueno que como part-time me daban 40 horas semanales lo cual me ayudaba mucho tanto en mi vida laboral y en mi vida personal.
good,"I loved my job as a Tea Master."
good,"J'ai eu la chance de travailler au sein de Disney Store: naturellement, l'ambiance est agréable, cependant c'est extrêmement strict: il y a une façon très précise de se tenir, des phrases types à dire aux gens (ex. ""je vois que votre fille adore la Reine des neiges!"" et non ""puis-je vous aider?"") etc."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Provide a lot of learning opportunities, room to grow and Competitive environment."
good,"Was great experience, great job, great team work and very clean when I was there. Managment first years was great. the have a great job culture."
good,"Their weak link is putting untrained people with no filming backgrounds into positions they are unqualified for and get in the way of Seasoned Department Heads trying to do their  job by  making uninformed decisions effecting the schedule and creating overages ."
good,"- Un día normal verificar los servicios de procesamiento tecnológico, suministros, los transportes,etc. aprendí ramas de tecnología, sistemas, procesamientos logísticos,etc."
good,"I enjoyed being involved in the culture and the history that is Disney.  It opened my eyes to new things.  I loved working with the children, and the characters.  It was always a fun place.  Always a new experience. I wish it had lasted longer"
good,I would work there again. What a talented group of people! I learned a great deal about the interactive world and am impressed with their organization.
good,"What makes the job enjoyable is the cast members. I further enhanced my communication skills, team work skills, and leadership skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is able to make magical moments that guest will remember for a lifetime."
good,"Everyday teams of lifeguards are assigned to open 2 of the resort's 6 pools each, then scan the pools and start a strict ""10/20"" (time to see a guest in distress/time to reach a guest in distress) watch. Anything could happened so management is very team oriented and friendly, they really try to create a sense of camaraderie so my coworkers are all comfortable working together during emergencies. Days can be very easy, while others can be very stressful. The biggest downside is that schedules are not guaranteed, and some weeks you could have 50+ hours while other week you don't work at all."
good,i learned alote about food  the job wasn't hard i loved it i enjoyed the job i think i was one of the best in there  :)
good,Very Large Company With Plenty Of Room For Advancement & Growth.  There Is Also Great Diversity & The Work/Life Balance Is Awesome.  Benefits Are Also One Of Many Driving Factors To Be Employed With Disney.
good,"I worked at Ghirardelli California Adventure, although it was not fully associated with Walt Disney Co. We still had to deal with the same guests as any cast member did. It was a great environment to be in with the co workers who I now call my life long friends to this day. I learned a lot about customer service, food handling, and maintaining a positive composure for guests. The only unfortunate thing about the company is that management had favoritism and some people would have hourly rates higher than others."
good,I start of with welcoming guess into our location and creating magic for all kids and families. Working Disneyland has helped me improve my customer service skills and has given me leadership and management skills.
good,Overall it was a once in a lifetime experience but did not fit my personality in terms of job security and advancement or flexibility to work in different departments
good,Working front line at the most visited vacation destination is fast-paced and stressful. It can be wonderfully magical and yet so frustrating. It's a fun place to work but cast members are not paid nearly enough to live comfortably.
good,"Had I known, at the time, that most jobs required so much manual labor, I probably wouldn't have been so overwhelmed. There was always something to do. Posing as a character was fantastic. I did it for a while, then injured myself and was sent to light duty. The company made sure I was taken care of, and continuously spared no expense for me to be back in shape to continue dressing in costume."
good,工作环境还不错， 工作内容比较单调， 基本项目不会太有挑战性， 数据的维护和模型建立需要一定的灵活性
good,"There is a lot of opportunities to work there. They have a lot of benefits, such as free park tickets, 401k, health insurance, life insurance. Management sometime has lack of sensitivity."
good,"Disney has a strong workplace culture and diversity of working people. I was in a college program, it was fun but hard at the same time, for example, the working hours sometimes is too long to balance out the regular life."
good,"I love Disney, but seeing all of the behind the scenes of how the magic comes alive is very heartbreaking. It's draining, demanding, and physically harsh on your body. I was only one of many to pass out during work due to exhaustion and dehydration. It gets full and hectic during the summers and MNSSHP."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"det var ganska roligt att jobba i disney on ice, och produktivt"
good,"A typical day at work - very challenging, learning new projects, reporting and assisting two legal executives"
good,"Buena empresa para poder desarrollarte"
good,"I did really enjoy working here ,the people were good to work with really friendly which made me look forward to going into work. Nice atmosphere and all round good job."
good,"Disney is a fun company to work for. Staff is friendly, and knowledgeable. We have resources to do our job efficiently, and our guests are our number one concern. We assist guests in a call center environment in booking magical vacations, as well as standard hotel room reservations. We are the first point of contacts for our vacationing families coming to Disneyland! How cool is that?"
good,Very busy every day.  Learn how business work. Very professionals. Very cooperatives co-workers. Sometimes was when not have enough personal. See happy the guest when that transaction was done. Very satisfaction with my Job.
good,"Would have gave five stars, but as my pregnancy progressed, they still had me stock items (cases of waters/vitamin waters) and pick up items about 30-40 Lbs heavy,"
good,"Typical day at work is checking the ques for incidents, changes, etc.  Troubleshooting sessions with various BU's.  Great teams and fun place to work.  Hardest part of the job was scheduling.  This is due to the constant shifting of employees due to nonstop budget crunches.  It's a great place to work but much like much of corporate america it is getting less secure career-wise every day.  Contractors come and go.  Just when you get to know someone and how they work ebb and flow wise their gone.  Or you could be the one gone.  Even permanent people leave the company all the time.  This was once probably the most  happiest place on earth to work at one time but now that happiness is overshadowed by staffing issues."
good,"The Walt Disney company is a great place to work. Everyone is super friendly and the energy in the building is amazing. It is truly the best job I ever had. Only thing was the schedule, they are not really flexible when it comes to your personal life. its either what they offer  you or nothing at all."
good,"It is a good company to work for."
good,"l enjoyed my time in Florida working at Disney. It has been a great resume booster and results often in interviews thanks to my short time working here. "
good,"that was a great experience, lot of fun and respect each other. I like Disney world that's why I stay seasonal with them. Epcot is my favorite park."
good,"Disney allows for creativity and input. You can come up with ideas for different campaigns, participate as much as you want, and have a lot of fun. The only downside was the balance of work and my personal life. I would often find myself answering e-mails after work hours or even on weekends. Even with time off, I was requested to answer e-mails if the need was really important."
good,I'm currently in carts and I hate it. The biggest thing I hate though is all the rules. People sometimes only stay for the benefits. Very strict here.
good,"Great place to work at, helped me build great learning skills from this company and benefits. I learned how to really interact with our guests  by greeting them each morning and giving them a nice smile asking how their day was. My co-workers would sometimes help other workers if they have not finish the rooms. We cooperate very nicely and its much organized. The hardest part of my job was having to make sure the rooms are perfectly clean so our guests that stay have an amazing memorizing experience"
good,very tiring but fun to interact with the children long shifts but overall fun to do for the weekend. coworkers were great the mangers were nice but  there should be more communication during the weekend.
good,This really is only a great job for students and retired people. Not much room for growth and not many benefits for the extremely quick paced and stressful work done.
good,"Management is great. They are always out to help with guest situations, but also to keep an eye on employees, which does scare some people. The pay is not competitive at all, which is incredibly frustrating. It's a fun place to work, but fun does not pay the bills."
good,"Great company as there are very good staff medical benefits. The company provides fruits twice a week. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,clean and maintain water park after hours. bathrooms.leaf blower .collect beach chairs and stack.mop floors throw and change trash bags.
good,"If you are going to get a minimum wage job, make it attractions at Disneyland. The workplace culture here is amazing. You'll never forget your years with Disney. Part of it is that everyone is underpaid and overworked but it really promotes bonding. Nothing compares to being a member of the Disney team. Management can be very strict but you never really interact with them anyway so it's okay!"
good,"The Disney Company employs millions of college students to work so they can pay them dirt, give them no benefits whatsoever, and work them like they’re full time."
good,I hated where I worked until I found out I could pick up shifts elsewhere. Then I was rarely at my home location. Don't complain about your location to anyone there.
good,"Work every holiday and a minimum of 50 hours a week, but gain an experience like no other and a strong name to put on your resume. Not a company you stay at long term if you are money driven or desire work life balance."
good,I enjoyed my time as a cast member. The role I had was amazing I loved my co-workers and my location. I even met my now husband at Disney. I recommend Disney.
good,"very hard to advance unless you stay for years, work you really hard, management is good but pay and compensation is not worth it unless you have another job on top of it."
good,"I love working for this company, but job security has always been an issue. I know things happen daily, and I like to think out of change comes opportunity :)"
good,Participated in the Disney College Program. Enjoyed my internship experience and everything that it offered. Very great experience and would recommend it to other college students.
good,"As a Disney fan, I loved working at the ""Happiest Place on Earth""... As an employee, Disney has to step up and keep the emplyees happy in order to keep up the moral. It's a great job for a college student that lives less than 5 miles away. If you live in Los Angeles and commute to Disneyland, forget about it. You can't make it work."
good,"no comment at this time. You come in, work several hours with inconsistent work hours and schedules. It can be very unaccommodating when it comes to work and life balance."
good,"I worked there and it was fine loved the guests but there was no chance of advancement because the managers would not help you advance so they could have job security. "
good,"Working for the Walt Disney World company is amazing and the real tasks of the merchandising role are expected. However, the specific area worked in has a severe lack of supportive and responsible leadership. The management does not support their employees and sit in their offices instead of assisting guests or their cast members when needed. I learned in-depth customer service experience but the negatives of the leadership and how they do not support people is a reason why I want to transfer into a different area of the company or leave it as a whole."
good,"Slow to no advancement in work, management a bit unorganized, hardest part of the job was not being able to leave because the benefits are good. The most enjoyable part of the job is the guest interaction"
good,Loved the free park access for myself and my family. Fun environment (most of the time). Late night hours and mandatory overtime during peak............
good,Not a job I would go back to unfortunately. Hours were limited. Pay was not great. Management wasn't the best and I never felt I could make the connections I wanted in the company.
good,"Disney is great place to work if you are just looking for a day to day job with no real advancement, but if you are looking to move up within the company, it is extremely hard to do so unless you are willing to sweet talk your leadership team- and even that does not necessarily give you the best opportunity for promotion."
good,Overall I truly love the company.  The union is what holds the wages low.  If the union were not there I am almost certain that Disney would be paying much better. The leadership doesn't provide a good fair culture for promoting the right hard working people either.
good,"Since the Disney Reservations Center office can sometimes feel disconnected, they do bring characters to visit the call center, for photo ops and meet and greets. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I enjoyed my time at Disney very much and felt the management was looking out for me as a creative individual with the potential to grow. I learned a lot of organizational techniques that still help me to this day in my other fields.
good,"Disney's IT module supports numerous technologies and is focused on enhancing the customer's experience to the fullest. They love to forecast data and take every visitor a prospective customer."
good,"But management knows you can be replaced very easily, and not afraid to show it. Scheduling will do everything in it's power to keep you happy, only if you're good friends/kissing their butts. The most enjoyable part of working in the parks is the fact you get paid to do very little. When it comes to making their employees happy, Disney does try. But mostly the ones that they are making happy, the guests. Although that is what people pay for, the employees, or Cast Members get forgotten about. If you ever really wanted to see how the general public acts under pressure, it's a good place to get stressed out about literally nothing. 30 minute lunches to walk to a location that can be 3-10 minutes away, only to wait to get your food, to walk back to your location and eat your food within 5-10 minutes."
good,Disney is a great place to work! Overall it's a good place to learn and grow. You can move up pretty fast and you can move around to many different departments within the origination.
good,Each day can be very different working with this hotel.  I learned the value of leadership and confidence in public speaking and communication skills.
good,"Magical experience but long hours and hard scripts!"
good,on the phones busy loudfree coffee coworker fun and managers always busy
good,"Worked with Star India now part of Disney India. Not one of the best places in terms of work culture. Competitive salary. Low work life balance. Environment, culture very team dependent, overall need work in terms of culture."
good,"This job is great if you have been with the company long enough to bid for a decent schedule, or if you are a type of person who doesn't mind working weekends, holidays, and night shifts with little time for anything else. The atmosphere feels very stagnant and not a major opportunity for growth."
good,"The union seemed to make a hostile work environment between hourly workers and management. made it rather difficult to get any politics worked out. Everything ended in a stalemate, it seemed."
good,"Fun culture, and almost everyone is a Disney fanatic. Due to this, there is a low turnover rate with full-time employees, and advancement opportunities are very limited."
good,"For the most part, this was a really fun place to work. Unfortunately, the salary would not have covered the costs to live there. There are many employees at the parks that have to choose between rent and food."
good,Company gives cast members multiple discounts for food and lodgings. Cast Member and guest passes are also provided for free entry into Disney theme parks.
good,"I was happy to work for this company and grateful for the opportunity. I knew when I accepted the position that this job wouldn't have any advancement opportunities, but I didn't want to pass up on the chance to work for such a well-known, great company."
good,"I worked at the Disney Store in my city and the management team was just absolutely terrible. I can't blame the whole company, but cast members were leaving left and right due to the lack of understanding. Extremely unapproachable team and very difficult to work with. From the time I came on the first day, it was extremely difficult to speak to the manager in charge. She and the assistant manager were extremely condescending and rude, and were difficult to work with. I was only really able to build a relationship with about to management members and they really pulled for me and understood what was going on. If I could work at a different Disney Store I would because the benefits were great and I absolutely love the company. The cast members who had worked in previous Disney Stores prior to that new store opening had made it clear that they would also be leaving because the management was really difficult. I was thankful that my job position was only temporary for the holidays. The problem is that I had school at the same time and the management didn't seem to take that into consideration. Overall, I loved the Disney culture and the other Cast Members, they really give their all because everyone is so passionate about the company they work for. One thing you need to be in passionate because even if you're having a bad day, you need to still be able to see the princess or the superhero in every kid and make them feel like they really are. It made me feel terrible that I saw this Disney Store in not so good hands. I could guarantee that this place would thrive alot more if it"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"working here isn't too worth it, especially moving from out of state. it costs too much to live in Florida and the compensation for the job isn't worth being outside for 8+ hours a day getting yelled at by guests."
good,"My experience with Disney was a ~7-month-long internship at Animal Kingdom. The culture was strong, and they showered the workers with park-related benefits. Entry into the park almost made up for the bottom-of-the-barrel wages earned by even seasoned employees. A surprising number of my peers stayed; some of them are happily working there still (6 years later). More power to them. Some folks will love it. I simply didn't want to fight my way up such a short ladder."
good,"I enjoy working here but will continue to keep my position part time. If you are looking to pay your bills, this should not be the job you depend on to do such."
good,"Overall my experience working at The Disney Store was pleasant, I met many wonderful people whom are still my friends to this dat, however I've found that no matter how long I am there for or will be there for, there is no room for growth or succession. The only positions for full time are for a Store Manager and the Assistant Store Manager. I'm a Sales Lead Manager and I'm employed as ""Part Time"", yet I'm required to have open availability as if I were ""Full Time"""
good,It was hot. We were overworked. Stressful situations. Coworkers were amazing. Got to create a ton of happiness for a ton of people. Got very tired of being low man on the totem pole only being an intern. Made the job suck.
good,"I learned warehouse duties. How to operate forklifts,and pick merchandise. There was a lack of consideration towards part-time employees. They weren't considerate to employees."
good,Overall with benefits and hours also the environment its a great place to work. However the pay is dismal and the supervisors are horrible they hardly work with you and they offer very little tolerance for error. They drill sales down your throat and if you don't meet all the requirements for the call you get written for it after two mistakes and then the third could lead to termination. Due to the heavily driven sales tactics instead of working as a team you are working against each other. There were constant system issues you would think for Disney they would have that together.
good,"Though the hours can vary and be demanding, the customer service skills that I have gained during my time at the Walt Disney Company are absolutely impeccable. I am incredibly thankful for the endless opportunities that I have received to meet people from all around the world from different cultures and backgrounds."
good,"In the position that I was located at Disney World, it was extremely busy all day long.  They put a ton of responsibility on the cast members, which was a positive for me.  A downfall was that management typically never worked in the same position so they can only understand from a distance."
good,I enjoyed my time in the college program. It was a lot of fun and I made some amazing friends. But the work can be frustrating depending on your placement.
good,Unfortunately this was a very male dominated office and thus run like one. I wouldn't recommend this job to others starting out.
good,"The greatest asset of WDW is it's people.  There is high accountability here and a host of really committed, intelligent associates at all levels."
good,"Amazing Culture, but it's a very cut throat environment that boarders on slave labor sometimes. Management is also very hit or miss sometimes."
good,At the time lots of transitions made you question the management's ability to manage. It was hands off management and systems placed to bump you out if you did not comply quickly enough.
good,"I liked working for the Walt Disney Company, however it's hard to implement change when needed. Other than that, it's a great company to be involved with."
good,"Disney is a fun place to work and gives one the opportunity to spend the day in the park helping guests in and out of attractions while preforming character roles. As a cast member as long as you follow the rules everything goes real well. Pay was low and work hours were tough for Cps, but overall it was great experience for the amount of time spent there."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"The people are hard working and outgoing. The workload can be unpredictable, and the current management/leadership does it's best to keep the group moving in the most efficient direction. The best part of the job is the gorgeous view I have from the window close to my desk."
good,"It was okay at first. Then things got real. poor treatment of workers. Company was selfish. Low pay, grueling hours. Working here had it's downfalls, but also had it's benefits. It was okay at first living with roommates and then things got kind of boring."
good,"Journées très différentes"
good,"The work at Disney is challenging, to be sure. Not the least of these challenges is the workload placed upon each employee. It is a very collaborative environment that requires multi-levels of buy-in for each project."
good,Being with Disney had its pros and cons. The work culture was very friendly and lenient. Working in such kind of atmosphere was truely enjoyable. The Disney Voluntears events and the corporate cricket matches were equally enjoyable. The name is really big in the industry but that doesn't really reflect in the kind of work I was assigned. The hardest part I had to deal with was the fact that the management wasn't upto the mark.
good,"Though the perks of working for the location are great (disneyland tickets, movie tickets, corporate discounts, special employee events) might be great, working for this specific location isn't great at all. Management continuously stresses out employees by under staffing the location and not taking staff needs into consideration. Wages are low and staff constantly has schedules change with a maximum of one day in advance."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had. The group I work for is very busy, dynamic, and growing. The team is very supportive, yet you have the autonomy and flexibility to do your job without interference, yet there is always help and advice available. The group (and company) are very meeting and planning intensive. The team strives to incorporate best practices and current technologies and standards wherever possible & practical."
good,The Disney College Program is a completely unique experience. Cast members are some of the kindest and hardest-working people on the planet. The communication and customer service skills learned through this program are second to none.
good,"Fun company to work for, and an incredible place to interact with guests; however hierarchical structure leaves relationships between leaders and cast members impersonal/lacking."
good,"The working hours are pretty long. As Guest Experience Managers, we usually work about 10 hours per day. All promotions are based on other peers/leaders/managers' opinion about the individual. Moreover, receiving Guest compliments and letters are also considered extremely important for getting promotions. Guests are very high maintenance, hence, there are plenty of opportunities to learn how to handle Guest situations. The company highly supports managers and cast members compensating Guests whenever we feel it is necessary. The empowerment we receive from the company is amazing."
good,"A good company, but it doesn't pay very well. Depending on where you are, management varies, some may do well, others, not so much. There is room to grow and advance, but it may take a while."
good,"They offer options for advancement, but for only 5-6 people a year. The cast end up becoming wildly political and begin to use dirty tactics such as social media stalking to report anything they find unfavorable. Have had several managers have a clear bias with no where to report it well as many of the cast are afraid of retaliation. Very democratic workspace and they speak freely about politics everywhere."
good,"My experience with Disney was unforgettable. I did enjoy my years being at Disney because everyday was definitely something new. This job was/is like no other because making people's day special everyday is something that is indescribable. I made many unforgettable memories, and met so many wonderful people along the way. So wonderful that they became beautiful friendships."
good,Working for the Wilderness Resort and Campground was very rewarding.  Working with both Housekeeping and Recreation department was an eye opening experience.
good,I loved working here but it is a dog-eat-dog world. If you don't have the ability to put yourself out there for shifts you will never get any hours. Weekly you are scheduled 10-15 hours when you first start because of seniority and if you do not call your schedulers multiple times a day it will stay that way. Staying on top of them allows you to work full time (without full time benefits). The management is typically older Cast Members who have worked in the park for a decade or more and they are often very clique-y with their friends. It can be very difficult to penetrate this.
good,"Unless you are developing; QA at Disney is like any other Video Game QA position.    Contractual; with very little room for growth.  If you make it, it can be great... but even if you are outstanding; there is a high likelihood you'll be released due to headcount."
good,I worked for Disney thru a third party platform that I logged into from my home. I would not be able to do that since I did not work on Disney property
good,"No control over days, hours, or night/day shifts. Very difficult to balance life and work.  Everything changes from 1 week to the next. Cannot make plans with family at all. But - wonderful international co-workers and 99.9% delightful guests from all over the country and world !  Very exciting and magical unless you get home at 1:00 AM after 8 hours on your feet."
good,"I was there for almost 3 years and I can't count how many times they had a re-org. This doesn't affect much the day to day operations but people are in constant fear to lose their job. This is hurting the culture and the stress is palpable."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,As a lifeguard the hours were sometimes unbearable because of the heat and you are literally just staring at water for an entire shift. They are very strict for lifeguards and it was not an ideal job.
good,"Working here, many people get sucked in with the free tickets for life after working there for 3 years.  Even though its the happiest place on earth its hard work. Standing on your feet for hours at a time and constantly in the heat serving guest."
good,"Its a great, fun place to work, but the pay is extremely low, especially for the cost of living in the area.  There are opportunities for advancement and in different business areas, but there is a lot of competition."
good,"There is a lot of stress from management to enforce policies that more often than not lead to unhappy customers. When management would be called to assist with the situation, they would throw the employee under the bus for the sake of a happy guest. You're left with a slap on the wrist for doing your job and a snarky customer because they got their way. Lose-lose situation."
good,"Working for a media company provides a lot of exciting opportunities and experiences."
good,I now have a strong knowledge and understanding for Customer service and pleasing the cast. Very strong leadership skills that I can bring to another company.
good,The work culture and the sense of family is what is motivating me to stay with the company. The fellow cast members will become your family because you will be working with them 5-6 days a week.
good,At the museum I learned a lot about Walt Disney and Animation. I would say I was not able to grow at all and that is the primary reason I chose to find something new. A lot of what goes on in that museum is highly confidential. I cannot include those details. Thanks!
good,Everyone loves to come to Disney World because of the thrills and the magic. It's something else to be apart of making the magic and making dreams come true. Disney has amazing benefits and great support on learning and growing in any field that you would like to go into.
good,"This a good place to work , but lack of advancement is the down fall. They will give you overtime so you can make great money. All and all a good job , but you can not move up easy or quickly."
good,"Depending on where you work for the company, it can be a magical experience.  However, the info you need to be successful can be disseminated slowly or not at all."
good,The volatile nature of the interactive industry provided little job security.  Daily creative work with colleagues was a joy.  Opportunities to learn new things were abundant.
good,"Creative and Fun place to work.  Change in management sometimes makes it difficult to advance or in getting the opportunity to advance since they tend to bring a team of people they are already have worked with, at least that was the case in my area.  All areas and management differ ."
good,"The increasingly low wages offered and lack of advancement is surprising. My location is closing and I have zero job security after over ten years of employment there. Tired of seeing the pay raises at the very top but simple requests at the bottom are not affordable to the company. I am sad and embarrassed to have discovered how low the average wage of salaried managers is. When is Disney going to respect and recognize loyalty and education instead of making everyone feel replaceable because someone else will do the job for less. It’s all less than a living wage and the company should step up and address these issues with fair wage increases to reflect the economy, they certainly can afford it."
good,"Working in a fast paced theme park environment.  Management can be spotty as you do not have a single boss, but instead multiple leaders.  Pay was below a living wage unless you worked a lot of overtime."
good,Im conflicted.  I love the company but i feel its cast member satisfaction is on the decline.  I love the company but don't like the lack of growth in my division and lack of leadership support.  Things have changed so much over the years and it doesn't seem to be for the better.  In my department growth is very lateral and pay increases are minimal.  Also more work is constantly added to current roles but pay doesnt change.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"A decent job to work.  Not too busy, but not too slow.  Good teammates to work for.  Benefits are not bad, as you get free access to the parks year round and can offer to bring in friends/family a few times a year.  "
good,"I've learned a lot from working at Disney. Mostly that they don't care too much about the compensation for their employees. I've also worked very hard to move up, I've had support for a promotion for months, however I've yet to be given said promotion, when others far less qualified have advanced. It's all about who you know, and how much you want to kiss their butt."
good,I worked in Food Prep in 2012 at WDW in the back of a kitchen in one of the busier quick service locations and it was very fast paced and fun. Being able to just enjoy the park before or after work or even on an off day was a nice perk of working there! Working at Disneyland was a great experience but it was stressful during the holidays and summers.
good,"Disney is a mega company with mega budgets in some cases. However, it is a corporate culture, can be less than ""nice"". The brand has increasingly been watered down, as have the design standards and the creativity."
good,If you like disney its worth the experience but i am not a fan of the work or work environment. I did enjoy the weather though. you were paid poorly and treated like garbage
good,The biggest benefit of working for the Walt Disney Company is getting into the parks for free.  Pay is horrible but the co workers tend to be awesome since we are all in the same boat.
good,"This is the perfect company for a college student or a person beginning their working career.  Advancement can be extremely difficult, unless you are connected.  If you can attain a leadership role, follow the flow.  Going against it is highly discouraged.  Believe it or not, the best notation on my resume for finding work, especially outside the company."
good,"I have great references and history with former managers/bosses within The Walt Disney Co which can be provided upon request."
good,"I loved working at Disney. There are wonderful things about working here that you'll never experience other places. The friendships you make while here is amazing. On the other hand, you'll have no life if you work in the parks and aren't hired on full time. Required availability for part time employees and agreement that you won't interfere with their scheduling by having additional responsibilities. Lack of opportunities and poor pay is why most people leave. I would LOVE to still be doing what I did but I don't really want to share an apartment with 4 other people for the rest of my life."
good,"My workplace was my home. I paid for training on how to make dining reservations for restaurants at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. I received phone calls from Disney guests wanting to either plan their vacations or guests who were already there and wanting to just make reservations at a restaurant. The hardest part of the job was finding availabilities for high-request locations or finding a suitable substitute. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction that I felt in helping a guest to have the very best experience during their vacation."
good,Disney was a great place to work and bond with co-workers. It was a fairly easy job and did not have a lot of work to do outside of the classroom. You were given plenty of prep time for lessons. The most difficult part of the job was the hours were long on weekends and there was little room for advancement and raises.
good,"A typical day at work was busy. I learned a lot about the Walt Disney Company. Management was good to workwith most of the time, but could be difficult to work with as well."
good,"Fun place to work, great people, tons of extra curricular activities. Free snacks everyday. Free pizza for lunch every friday. Inside scoops on unreleased Disney content."
good,"Typical day involved normal administrative responsibilities calendar management, meeting scheduling, typing of correspondence, time reporting, answering phones, filing, ordering supplies, making travel arrangements and preparing travel authorizations and expense reports, reconciling corporate cards with expense reports."
good,"I loved working for this company, we had a different manager that took over our department and I became uncomfortable working there. It was such an amazing experience and I learned so much from our Guest Services Director."
good,"You will never find a better place to hone your skills, and polish them to take out into the world beyond Disney. This is a great company to learn from, and an excellent place to cut your teeth whether you continue on with Disney or find your professional home elsewhere. Having worked at Disney will give you a pedigree you will not find elsewhere."
good,Disneyland! What more can you say? it was never the same day twice always an adventure and good times with great co workers. Each department is different and all leaders are different your not an employee at Disney you are a cast member in their show!
good,"Working at Disneyland was a great experience, especially for a first job. They give you the opportunity to move up, for the most part, but to get really far you have to network and make sure that you are the managers' favorite. Every land is different, so my experience is probably different from other cast members. The management team in my land, as a whole, were very inconsistent, unorganized, and unfair, unless you were a favorite. It's a very seniority based company. You can be the worst worker in the entire world but you wouldn't get in trouble if you've been there a long time. My cast members are the reason I love my job. I love seeing their work ethic improve and I love being the lead they can trust."
good,i worked in several postions with the company but if management didnt like you it was difficult to deal with...didnt promote within the company
good,"Efficient organizational skills were applied on a day to day basis."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"The benefits are wonderful, but there is little opportunity for advancement, and the pay is mediocre at best. "
good,The Disney brand is strong and protected in everything they do.  The parks and resorts are the best examples of the Disney brand love. It is worn proudly and honored with great respect for tradition.
good,"Everyday was a new challenge. As a lead in Disneyland, I have learned and acquired great customer service skills. Everyday was a new experience with not really knowing what type of customers I will meet."
good,"Developed 5 year rolling strategic plans that translated into strong tactical plans that allowed for a balanced approach to local market needs."
good,"A typical day of work can involve a wide variety of tasks or calls. We performed system validation in the morning to ensure that all of Disney's reservation and booking systems are ready for the start of business hours."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, greeting guests, working the cash register, and making sure store looked clean and neat."
good,Train all cast members on new initiatives. Very busy constantly have something to do.
good,"friendly staff, flexible schedule, great commissions and bonuses  "
good,"I enjoyed working at the Disney store in Sherman oaks, I was a cast memeber, which is a sales associate. Very FUN place to work."
good,"Management is always willing to listen, lend a helping hand, help you learn something. Best part about working for Disney company is it feels like family. You feel like you’re working for something more then just retail. Worst part there’s no job security, no learning form mistakes."
good,First wearhouse job and great experience!  My coworkers where friendly and I liked the fact that they didn’t try to work us too hard even though we couldn’t sit down we had plenty breaks and everyone was very cheerful . They made the environment very comfortable!
good,"Being a part time Photopass photographer is a great experience, the good can mostly outweigh the bads - like seeing a child meet their favorite character for the first time, seeing proposals left and right, getting cast compliments. But, it is a very fast faced, busy, high stress environment to put yourself in. The hardest part of the job is definitely keeping up with the ""point system"" for sick/call out days, always keep an eye on your record."
good,"I enjoyed my almost 24 years at the Walt Disney Company.  I was able to work in a variety of areas and gain valuable work skills and experience.  I had the privilege to work with some fantastic partners throughout my time at the Walt Disney Company.  If you are a fan of this brand, working and representing this company is special."
good,"Loved working for Disney. Pay could be better and some days are hard with guests especially around the holidays. Perks were awesome though, can't beat going to the parks for free."
good,Restaurant sets employees up to fail with lack of teamwork and help in front of house. Back of House is always behind and constantly has mistakes on orders.
good,It was a wonderful learning experience and a large company to learn many different types of businesses. You can move around a lot within one company. Overall good.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I am a contracted employee, and as with any Executive Assistant contract, it can be extremely fast pace and at other times not so much. Fortunately there is a balance."
good,You would walk into work everyday knowing that you are going to make someones day a little better. You had your coworkers that were there to support you every step of the way with any questions you might have.
good,"My experience with the Walt Disney Company was incredible largely due to my attitude coming into my relationship with the company. The pay is poor, but the magic experienced was well beyond worth the low wages at the time."
good,"Your work schedule is not set and can vary up to 8 or more hours They expect you to work for 8.5 hours  .5 is for lunch which is not paid for, then return back 10 hours later after you have gotten off. This can wear you down severely so be prepared. When you first start working there you will be starting part-time getting on 4 hours a week to start and gradually increasing and later openings for full time may be offered to cast members."
good,"I absolutely loved my job there. The job itself was fun and your coworkers are like family. There is a lot of opportunity to move up depending on your seniority. However, scheduling was an issue. I felt like they did not work with school schedules. If you did not get the days off you requested (Ie. school schedule), you were forced to call out. I felt like they were looking for reasons to fire you. Also, the wages were not enough for someone to live on their own. Overall, i think it is a good job for people who are looking for a first job or something fun after you retire."
good,"A great deal of interactions and public speaking with all guests at the Disneyland Resort. Guest interactions, guidance and information of various facets and experiences. The opportunity to speak before a large audience of guests and performers."
good,"I learned a great deal from my time at Disney - customer service, time management, product management and placement. Overall, it was a great introduction into life after college."
good,"This job is mundane and mind numbing.  Does not require much analysis or complex problem solving.  Answering calls, emails, and faxes.  Speaking to guests about aspects of their vacation plans."
good,"Fun and fast-paced workplace. Heavily customer service oriented. At times, it could be extremely fast paced, and other time there was a lot of downtime."
good,Guests want to go to Disney to see the magic of being a child again. They go to Disney to have their children have the most memorable experience in life.
good,It is one of the best jobs in Anaheim. You get to know different people from around the world and constantly hear their native language from guests and even from fellow cast members.
good,"Working in the food industry at Walt Disney World Resort allowed me to build more patience for my future job. Typical day started at 10 am, worked for four hours, break, and then changed location for the next 6 hours. Management typically fair. Hardest part was the long hours with only one day off. Most enjoyable part of the job was the experiences and teamwork I got to do everyday."
good,"Regardless of the hard work and commitment, end of the day it boils down to the company not willing to convert the contract positions to FTE due to work visa limiations"
good,"Working for the walt disney company was a very unique experience. There's no place like the walt Disney company! From seeing fireworks almost every night, to meeting people from all over the world..there's no work environment quite like working for the walt Disney company."
good,"I took part in the Disney College Program, so I have a unique perspective into that offering of the company. Overall, it was more of an internship than anything else, and if you treat it as such you will not be disappointed. The communication skills I learned on that job are still being used today, and I worked with a really terrific team. The hours and guest interactions could be awful at times, but overall it's a definite recommend to the right people."
good,"It was repetitive, fast-paced, with good management. The hardest part of the job was working out in the Florida heat for eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with guests."
good,"Working ""behind the scenes"" in one of the world's most iconic companies is exciting and fun. Generally a positive working environment with great co-workers. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Fast paced work environment. I did the college program and we were the bottom of the totem pole. Wish they had more opportunities through out the parks.
good,I greatly enjoyed my days working with the Disney Company. I worked in the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique where I worked behind the scenes. I ensured that the rooms were ready for the princesses and helped if clothes did not fit. A typical work day started at 7:30 and would end at 4:30 or 5 with a two thirty minute breaks along the way. We would have a least one hundred customers a day.
good,The most rewarding thing about working for the Walt Disney Company is the relationships that you develop with your fellow cast members. Everyone is fixated on the goal and we all work together to get the job done.
good,"It wasn’t a terrible job, perks are great, but it just did not cut it in terms of providing a healthy work life balance or income to cover living expenses."
good,I really enjoyed the college program that Disney has to offer. The downside to working there is that they have you work very long hours and you do not make that much money.
good,I didn't intend on writing anything here but it won't let me move on without doing so. Now I have to come up with 150 characters since it won't let me...
good,Sometimes you get the luck of the draw and get put in a team that does great and sometimes you get those teams where people are against something new and upcoming in their environment
good,Disney is top notch.  Great company in which to start your career.  They do everything with excellence and are great at training their Cast Members at all levels of the organization.
good,I like working for wdw because it's a good opportunity to meet people and increase my skills. I have the opportunity to work with people for around the world and learned a lot about merchandise and overall enjoy working for the company.
good,My time here made me feel like I was just a number. The only thing they seem to care about it their bottom line. Benefits (ie discounts etc) are great but getting full time is near impossible.
good,"Working for Disney is one of my happiest accomplishments.  It is undoubtedly the happiest place on Earth, however, it is a lot of hard work.  The hours are long, but the reward is great."
good,"I worked at the World of Disney, which was under a lot of pressure to meet sales goals. As a result, some of the managers were very unpleasant because they were stressed. Also, I was a college intern, and was thus overworked."
good,"Hours vary widely and you get a new shift twice a year, training is 7 weeks long with a 6 month ""new cast member"" learning period which is useful since there is a lot of information to retain."
good,"When I worked for Disney California Adventure from 2011-2015 my starting pay was 9 an hour. When I left my pay was around 10.60 an hour. Aside from that this was a fun job working in Attractions. 99% of my coworkers were amazing to work with. The hours could vary from early morning to late at night, sometimes as late as 3am depending on the event or park hours. I was sad to leave."
good,"The people are amazing, it's fairly easy to move around, and the work life balance is pretty good.  The pay could be better but at upper levels it increases appropriately."
good,"Management is a joke and only a small few managers actually care for the cast-members. My coworkers are what kept me coming into work, otherwise I would've left long ago. Overall it's a decent place to work but you have to have the mental health to pull it off with the amount of customer service involved with the guests."
good,"I got started with Disney as part of the Disney College Program and honestly the work environment can be very stressful and hectic at times, but as long as you anticipate it you will be fine. I know many people who were not able to make it to the end of their program because they couldn't handle it but for me I did alright. As long as you have a good work ethic and do your job you will be fine."
good,"Disney was a good entertainment company to work for. The work life balance is decent and if you live in the Glendale area or Burbank area, it is a good commute."
good,"Full time hours are cut back due to fiscal year"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I participated in the college program it wasn't too exciting. Got paid 10$/hour and left after four months. I don't really have a long enough work period to rate the company effectively.
good,"Even though the job is stressful and at the time, compensation was not at its peak. This is a great place to get your foot in the door relating to all sorts of media."
good,"I did not work fo rthe disney company.  The school I worked for was the Walt Disey Magnet  school and named after Walt Disney."
good,"I was apart of the Disney College Program and worked at a resort doing quick service food and beverage. My coworkers weren't the nicest people to work with and made it difficult for me to feel comfortable at work. Extremely fast pace environment and a lot of information thrown at you at once. Also dealing with a lot of foreign people who aren't the kindest and hard to understand. It had it's okay moments, but for the most part I couldn't wait to be done with my internship. In the end it was an extremely challenging job, but rewarding because it's a great resume booster. All in all, I'm glad I did it and stuck it out."
good,"The work itself is very great and enjoyable, working with guests was always my favorite part of the day. Coworkers are amazing as long as you keep them as just coworkers. Lots of drama in the location I worked at but easily ignored if you just focus on work and the guests. Some managers were definitely better than others but the one that was in charge of cross training was amazing and helped me out so much."
good,It is a great company to work for you deal with people from all over the world and you get to be part of something that they have saved for a long time to do. You get to be part of their memories.
good,"As a Area Coordinator, I was constantly moving around throughout my location. I enjoyed being one of the first people guests saw as they entered the park. Being in the stroller/wheelchair rental area, I was able to help make guests day in the park more accessible and more enjoyable."
good,"Once you're in, it's a fight to the top. There are people who have been waiting for their shot for years, so keep that in mind when you arrive. However, they do appreciate external experience with Disney knowledge."
good,A wonderful company to work for in this position as a freelance content writer/editor in Employee Communications. Writing articles for other employees was fun and satisfying.
good,"The job is really fun, unless you want to move up. The culture of this company cannot be beat. It's a unique job and an amazing conversational topic. This job is fantastic for those in college. If you're looking to make a career here, it can be tough."
good,It was a good job for some people. Pay wasn't that great high stress and bad and scheduling. there were some employees who had more than 1 job and was on call. but you had to call in on the times they did post to see if they needed you or not. it was during winter so was crazy busy and only 2 tills open and 8 on floor
good,"Ambiance de travail agréable, équipe très jeune. Mais après avoir volontairement mis fin à mon CDD pour reprendre mes études il y a 2 ans, impossible de réintégrer l'entreprise après presque un an de passage d'entretiens réguliers .. pas de CDI à la clef. Décevant"
good,"The company does treat you well, even for a Contract Gig. But it likes to remind you that you work for Disney, and they use it that to prevent any type of compensation. The work is usually pretty balanced, the life at the company is well with regular company outings and events. The Campus is beautiful, and a lot of people, while under appreciated, are extremely hard working and very very great at their job."
good,Fun place to work with great perks for employees. The company is very positive and encouraging. The culture is very guest oriented and making sure every guest has the best experience possible.
good,it is a good company to work for if you pass probation. Great benifits 401k mad and dental. get into the park for free plus printable tickets twice a year.
good,I worked at this store along time ago so I do not think my experience is valid or current. That said I enjoyed the experience. High level of training.
good,"If you work in corporate or for Walt Disney Imagineering, full time, then it's great. They've been known to do mass lay offs though. If you get hired as a contractor or an intern, very rarely will you stay or ever become a blue badge employee. If you are, and you get hired as part time-on going, then you get very few benefits."
good,"As is often the case with such giant companies, growth can be predicated on timing and leadership. Everything trickles down the chain and will impact everyone in some way, shape or form. These traits can create a sense of futility and stress. The face of the company is, as could be expected, very different than the reality of working within it. "
good,Helped develop my customer service and sales skills as well as food and cash handling. The hardest part of the job was during show transmissions and waves of people rushed to the kiosks and bought food or merch
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"My Goal was to start at the bottom and work my way up the ladder.  I soon found out that it is a lot harder to move vertically within the organization.  Horizontal movement is encouraged and sometimes forced, which prevents a lot of vertical movement."
good,"Great company with tons of different career options, people and development opportunities.  Different lines of business have various pros/cons.  All depends on the area."
good,"A typical day at Disneyland is interacting with guests from all over the world and doing your best to deliver the ultimate guest satisfaction. I learned how to be in charge of multiple locations at a time, how to deal with unhappy guests, and how to be there for my cast members"
good,"It was a fun job."
good,"Helping guests, answering questions, and providing an excellent experience to all that come from around the world.  It is extremely hard for anyone that cannot handle stress.  People come from all around, and sometimes even spend their life savings just to come.  If you do not provide the experience that they expect you find yourself in the middle of a battle you cannot win.  This job is not for the weary, but the life benefits that you can gain from working their far out reach the company itself."
good,"If you are working for disney part time for fun and the benefits this is the best job you can have. If you are working for the money it's hard, long, slightly underpaid hours. The friends you make working there are amazing, the experiences you get working there can range from amazing magic to as low as dirt when you are yelled at by guests."
good,"it's Disney, literally EVERYTHING is Disney. You have to have a Disney catch phrase and you ALWAYS have to be happy. They always give things away, even if you are lying."
good,"Buena experiencia, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Working for the Walt Disney Company can vary dramatically depending on the role that you are in. Overall Disney pays average or below but includes other incentives such as theme park admission and discounts.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo divertido, horarios flexibles y buen trato"
good,"I worked inside of the parks. While I enjoyed my job, not everyone else did. The pay could be better and sometimes it feels difficult to progress inside the company."
good,There was a lot to learn but only if you're wiling to put in the work. Not a lot of official guidance so the internship is what you make of it. It's very rewarding to be able to build something guests will experience.
good,"L'activité est très différente selon les jours. "
good,Enjoyed working for Disney - I learned excellent customer service skills being a cast member. The management at the call center was great.  Was disappointed when they close the center down
good,"As a whole they are not bad, however as individuals the same can not be said. As someone who had the chance to work in some good locations while employed by Disney, it only took one to send it all to the drain."
good,The day in the life of a ride operator can be quite fun yet can be extremely stressful.  You interact with MANY types of people throughout the day. I am happy with it.
good,"Love working at Disney, great company. I don't really want to review my current company, just want to see what other options/jobs are out there. Always good to keep options open."
good,The store was a fun place to work. The customers where always smiling and so was the staff. We miss the stores. Families could travel to Disney with out having to leave town.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I learnt lots of things. How to work with a multicultural team, guest services, how to solve problems with the rides or with the guests... "
good,The company taught me many things that I carried into every job I have had since. Great place to work and tremendous room for growth and advancement. Managers were always fair and helpful.
good,Nice place to work. It has a friendly environment where manager is approachable. It got very good HR policy and come off as well. They give theme park passes.
good,"The benefits and perks of working within any section of the company are totally worth it. The people are usually really fun to work with (I've never met anyone who didn't have at least a few friends where they work). Of course it's just a job, but it's entertaining."
good,"it's hard to not say this was, by far, the most fun job I've ever had! apart from that, there were some management politics that I didn't agree with. When it came to advancement, it came down to who you know and who likes you rather than what you know and what you can do. The pay was fantastic, however was too low for the area you would have to live to get to work due to it being a high vacation spot."
good,"The Walt Disney Company has some of the greatest workers in the world and without them I wouldn't be the hard worker I am today. The only issue I had with the job was the constant imaginary brass ring the held up saying you could get there and when you reach their goals, instead of promoting you, they put another ring to reach for. It always seemed as if I were reaching rather than climbing for the mountain top. The job itself wasn't to difficult you had to work with iPads and lots of computer programs on windows, deal with difficult guest interactions which sometimes could lead them to be upset but you had to do what you could to make them happy in the end. I believe the cast that works there is the reason people stay because it is like a family. The management on the other hand had been switched around so many time during my employment that I had a hard time getting meetings with them. I felt like no one knew me and that was part of the reason I couldn't advance in the role."
good,Busy work but people are generally happy and excited about their jobs. Lots of cross-functional collaborations and meetings. Lots of Disney-related perks.
good,"Working at Disney was fun, typical day at work was merchandising and presentation in the morning, open tills, schedule employees, paperwork and being on the floor the majority of the day selling to customers and filling in stocks. Management was good, I was an assistant manager that reported to main manager.  It was typical retail job for a small store, alot different than working for Daytons in Management, because there were not the human resource department or security etc.. we were the ones that did it all."
good,"Pleasant place to work but management somewhat unwilling to try new things. Atmosphere is engaging, with artwork of Disney's media properties on seemingly every surface."
good,A great place to start a career or need a transition. They take care of their employees. Work life balance is maintained. Benefits package work in your favor and just not the company's.
good,"Started with prep each day and than set up stations for night shift."
good,"Always a pleasure to work in the beauty industry. it has been and will continue to be my desire to meet the needs of the public in terms of skin, cosmetic and haircare"
good,The Walt Disney Company has great benefits and you will be provided with rewarding and meaningful work. They also do a great job with getting the employees involved in giving back to the communities.
good,The internship was very rewarding few months with great insight as to how the Walt Disney Company works.  You make memories and friends that will last you a lifetime as well as gaining great business experience with one of the largest companies in the world.
good,It has been a great journey from day one with opportunities to grow professorially as well as network and develop long term relationships. If you enjoy a fast paced and challenging environment then this is definitely the place for your. Warning however there are complex politics involved and learning to navigate them can present a significant learning curve. Recent changes to the organization have only made this more challenging.
good,"Disney can be a great company to work for, depending on what department you are in. They do have great values, excellent customer service, and entertainment is a great job to have during school and other transitional periods of life."
good,"The benefits package is outstanding, They micro manage every body and every thing, the pay is average at best.  The perks, free park admission, free guest tickets for friends and family."
good,"Getting to work alongside a team with varied cultural backgrounds has allowed me to understand how to better communicate with the world around me. Addressing guest concerns in a quick, efficient manner challenged my thought processes and has taught me that any situation can be overcome with a calm, positive demeanor. Handling stressful situations with a smile showed to be the most difficult aspect of my internship. However, seeing how you can positively impact a guest's day was truly the most enjoyable experience I took away from my internship."
good,"Was accepted into the Disney College Program were I worked in various settings with a diverse population. Received experience where I was able to gain an in-depth understanding of different managerial techniques utilized within a Fortune 500 company. While there, I was able to study Leadership, Marketing, and Sales through the accredited educational courses and seminars provided through The Walt Disney Company."
good,"Disney is a fun place to work, but it is not all fun and games. It is a lot of hard work, but the benefits make up for the hours and not so pleasant guests that you come into interaction with."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Briefly worked at Disney, its was a friendly and the staff where always happy to help.The project i was involved in was simple migration task."
good,There were lots of perks while working for Disney.  I learned so much about the Travel Industry and was able to utilize those perks with my family and we have many memories!
good,"Early work towards organization of the backroom, time sensitive. Helpful co-workers and inviting and interested management team. Company brings joy to a great deal of customers and workers. Enjoyed going to work for the open and energetic atmosphere"
good,"I did many things throughout my almost 30 years at Disney.  I learned so much about the Hotel Industry.  There are many good people that work there, too!"
good,"Great workplace, weather can take a toll on you. A typical day consists of meeting with the team, attending a brief to see what is happening within the day and your shift. Followed by going to get your equipment and heading out to your location / venue."
good,I work the Finding Nemo show at Animal Kingdom. Originally I loved working there because the job was simple and if I needed to get rid of a shift it was easy. It is a little bit of a drive for me. They have now extended us to help out with Guest control for the new Jungle Book show. I like everyone I work with for the most part. I really wish I could have one on one time with the Guests. I usually see mass amounts of Guests at one time. I do love when I have short shifts. They used to all be 10am-4pm hours which was nice.
good,"The Walt Disney Company is just as moral and good-doing as they portray themselves to be. The senior leadership remains relentlessly focused on gearing all employed persons towards the ""right"" thing. In addition the goal really is to provide a satisfactory (in fact, above average) experience to all who experience their offered products/services. The nature of the job working in a theme park carries some stress and lack of ""desirable"" schedule. Their was great satisfaction in being able to meet and interact with so many different walks of life. Overall, I enjoyed my employment."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because it gave me the opportunity to work with all kinds of people. There were multiple opportunities to really get to know and interact with not only co workers but guests as well. Working there truly made me feel like I was making a difference.
good,"A typical day at Disney/ABC is filled with maintaining schedules, unforeseen tasks and managing various responsibilities."
good,Overall Energetic and fun culture. Values employees and provides room for growth by supporting their employees when promotional opportunities occur
good,Was constantly traveling and never home. I loved my position there but never had a home life was always connected answering emails.
good,"The hours may be busy and the shifts may finish late but to be able to learn from one of the top companies that pride itself in excellent customer service is amazing. Workers and managers may differ from location to location, but for the people I worked it, it was fantastic and such a pleasure to be around. I also gained valuable skills here in teamwork, cash handling, stock take and learning to work under pressure in a fast paced environment."
good,"The company seems to want to take care of its employees, but the finance/accounting area I worked in was not decorated nice like all the other floors in the building.  They do have a cereal bar which is nice."
good,"It is a great company with wonderful ideals, but it is such a large company that you can get lost in the infrastructure. It is difficult to advance within certain departments and the compensation is quite low for the work that I did in my department."
good,"Disney in general is a company that is great to work for to gain experience.  It is extremely competitive and difficult to move up past entry level management.  I recommend to work there, but not plan on staying your entire career."
good,Great place to work.  Great people and good learning experience in both manufacturing and product development.  Managed quality and procurement concerns from the initial concept to production start.
good,"Hard work, long hours but rewarding. Very engaging company which taught me about the entertainment industry. Understood the market, how to prioritise tasks and create effective marketing assets. Very hierarchy structure."
good,there were many positive aspects to the job including flexible hours and ability to work from home. the management team was helpful and knowledgeable when needed. clients as a whole were enjoyable and receptive to treatment ideas. there were some challenges with the school system as well as setting up regular appointments with clients. the constant travel is also a huge undertaking and at times could be overwhelming. the team helped to teach different techniques and give other perspectives to the clients treatment.
good,"•	Provided the best components of the Ruby-on-Rails to deliver high quality solutions to customers at maximum speed"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Walt Disney es una gran empresa para trabajar, una multinacional grande con muchas oportunidades de aprendizaje.  Un equipo humano muy bueno y yo tuve la suerte de aprender a trabajar dentro de la excelencia ya que mi supervisor así lo exigía cosa que agradezco. "
good,I loved every second of this internship. The only reason I did not pursue Disney as a career is that i changed where I wanted to be industry wise. I would return to Disney in a heartbeat.
good,"Was able to do my job without a lot of out interference because I worked remotely."
good,"Learned a lot from the company, but growth opportunities were slim. Great place to learn about the person you want to be before you become that person."
good,"best experience ever, fun work place, the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them"
good,I have been working for Disney for over 7 years got my BA in management and am working towards leadership as this time.  I have trained many cast members in a serving role and have enjoyed providing my services to better assist where needed.
good,"Good place to work. Smart engineers. Technical challenges, Appreciative good ideas. Very bad management. No work stability nor vision for Disney interactive division. Not sure Disney Interactive would survive as an independent unit"
good,"Productive and fun work place with many different sections and opportunities to grow. Networking is key and will take you very far within in this company, it is a great place to gain experience in many different roles"
good,"Working for Disney is a lot of fun and a lot of hard work. You must adhere to their stellar work standards and ethics at all times, which was never a problem for me. My co-workers were all great and engaging. The children I worked with were the highlight of the job. The benefits were also great, whenever you had a chance and energy to use them. All in all a great experience."
good,"This is a great opportunity to learn and excel in your craft. However for the hours worked and the amount of duties, I feel and a lot of workers feel we should be compensated much more at least $2-$3 more."
good,"Enjoyed working with the kindergarten students, played games in order to sneak in therapy.  Each turn was preceded by an articulation production.  Loads of fun and a great supervisor."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I liked the hours that were given to me and also the ability to work overtime. The management over my department could have been better but for the most part I came to work, did what I was suppose to do and went home."
good,"The Walt Disney Company has taught me professionalism, creativity, and how to have fun on the job. If you truly care about Disney and what it has to offer, you should work there while you're going to school or trying to improve yourself for something better in the future. When I first started, it was amazing and I'm almost getting fired because of a point system they have. I have had to call-out personal or sick due to personal issues and actually being ill. They do not care about your needs outside of work and expect you to work long hours almost six days a week."
good,I was a lifeguard at DIsney's All Star Resorts and it was a very enjoyable working experience. You get to earn money while living very close to Disney World and have free entrance into all Disney parks.
good,Very generous company.  Nice company culture.  Gives importance and hear employees.  Has Summer Outings.  Activities for charities.  Sportsfests.
good,It's a great place to learn new technologies.  People are extremely help and it helps foster a fantastic team environment.

good,Disney's Wide World of Sports brings athletes and fans from all around the globe to participate in highly-competitive and friendly events.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Perks and benefits of working for the company are pretty good. You get to meet a lot of different people and learn about the company. Working in the parks has its ups and downs, but you can be assured there's never a dull day."
good,"tasks were boring. weak planning, far from a commercial software shop. heavy on agile. manager is not experienced. culture is ok."
good,"I had the unique experience of accepting an hourly position at a quick service food facility at the beginning of my Disney career.  I studied the company and was excited to learn of the relative ease of moving from one position to another.  Within the nine and a half years I was there, I worked for Parks and Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, and Disney Imagineering.  This ability to design my unique career path is one of the best things about working for Disney."
good,Teaching English in a fun and creative way with regular trainings-both personally and professionally.
good,"The Walt Disney Motion Picture publicity department is a busy, productive place. Everyone loves their job and it shows."
good,"I work an 8 1/2 hour work day."
good,The most enjoyable part of the jobs I've held in The Walt Disney Archives is that there is something different to research every day. I've also enjoyed coordinating museum and Disney Parks loans of our costumes and props for domestic exhibits and international exhibits.
good,"Job allows you to learn problem solving, guest relations and team work skills. It is a fun work culture where it is easy to make great friends in your work location. The down side is terrible pay and the job is very repetitive. Also, the schedule is never ideal."
good,It is fun working for this company because you're part of a bigger picture every day to make magic for guests.
good,An excellent creative vibrant area to work and learn the animation business from a production and financial framework.
good,"i started in QSR food and beverage at Disneys Animal Kingdom, there i prepared food and drinks for the day, and brought back what was used. i would deliver food, drink, and stock for the day if needed. answer guest questions when they ask for it."
good,"Very bust place to work, can be fun, great room for advancement."
good,"I love working here, the people and the environment are ideal. As far as a part time job goes, this is about as good as it gets."
good,La magia de trabajar en Disney. Comprender los procesos internos y aprender de un personal altamente cualificado.
good,i never had a problem with this job everything was wonderful to be a part if there team just sad i moved around that time and couldn't be apart of there team any more
good,"Very enjoyable job fast pace environment, coworkers were pleasant."
good,"Was a temporary there a few weeks. Very nice people. Nice culture, a would have taken a full time job there if offered."
good,"A typical day at Planet Hollywood consisted of opening side work assigned based on a servers section number."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"escola de porte médio, meu único empenho em procurar outra empresa é devido salario baixo, pois na empresa eu faço de tudo , ajudando na administraçâo, limpeza, cozinha, alunos pais  e professores. Gostaria de uma oportunidade onde  poderia vir ganhar mais"
good,I rather not say at the moment but a definete place for advancement.
good,Wonderful experience so far. Everyone is very kind and mindful of the learning curve for new employees and interns. Everyone is nice and works well together well and efficiently.
good,"Fun environment, talented developers."
good,You really feel the magic come to life in this plac eof business!
good,I work in shippingband receiving. I was to pull orders and place them on the shipping dock.
good,work happy all the time fun eat together make bakery for costumer and help each anther
good,"The pay may not be what most employees work for, but the environment and the incentives make it all worth it!"
good,A great company who does things well in every aspect of business. Workers and customers are all overjoyed to take part.
good,"it was a great experience, fun, i did learned so many things such cultures, attitude.. from people all around the world. the management was excellent, and my co-workers because we worked as a team and nothing take us down, i can say the hardest part of job is when we have miss communication or miss understanding between us, but the most enjoyable part of the job is when achieve together the goal."
good,Great place to work if you are retired or just need part time work.
good,"Act as assistant to stage manager during parades.Remain the primary liaison between Costuming and Performance departments."
good,A typical day began at 7am and ended about 5 or 6 depending on how busy the day was. It was challenging in the beginning because it's a very diverse company so balancing everyone needs to make everyone happy was quite the ride for me. I had great team always there to help and teach me on days when I had bumpy rides. They made me think out of the box which I really enjoyed and most of all everyday was a learning experience.
good,"It's such a fun environment. It does get stressful at times, but I feel rewarded with the outcome.  I enjoyed every day of it."
good,"Responsible for overseeing all scheduled episodes and annual specials transmitted to Argentina, Mexico and Brazil for Cartoon Network."
good,"Walt Disney Company hires only the best, and expects the best from its staff."
good,"Working at Walt Disney World was a very unique and fun experience.  As a Cast Member, You get to be a part of the magic as you strive to make your guests stay as memorable as possible. I enjoyed working at the Magic Kingdom because of how excited the guests were just being at your store. Which makes chatting with them very easy and enjoyable. You also get many perks as well like free admission to all the parks and many discounts as well. Management was very helpful to me as well as my co-workers, they made it very easy for me to adjust to the very unique environment when I was just earning my ears. Overall I liked working there and will do it again if I had the chance."
good,The people from this crew were some of the funniest/well informed people I meet. Everyone wanted to bring their best to the table and did it with a smile on their face. The cameramen loved what they do and the associate producer was a complete lifesaver when it came to showing me how to file my paperwork. I can't say any more good things about this team. 
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,A great company but can be a revolving door. The company combines all the skills you have to coordinate effectively with each project.
good,"He aprendido mucho en esta compañía, hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo e importantes beneficios sociales"
good,Great family culture. Nice people. Best marketing staff in the country. 
good,"Good company, but they have tendency to lay off workers every five months, when I worked there. Friendly and easy people to get along with."
good,Depending what location I'm at I would come and grill cook or work outside carts or stock carts. on weekends I will at 3 diff locations check and put away food from delivery truck.
good,"Disney presents a challenging, but fun, workplace that is ever-changing. Guest-centricity drive business strategy - a great place to learn!"
good,Great experience and oppourtunity to gain many valuable skills.
good,"I enjoyed to the connections that I make with my managers and colleagues. However, on average I worked 30 hours a week at minimum wage ($7.80). Then $100 was taken out of my check for housing. You do the math! I only recommend Disney Professional Internships.."
good,"Met lots of different people and interactions with guest was fun when they weren't complaining about things. Most management was great to work with, but tend to favor certain workers a bit more. Hardest part of the job was telling people not to do things for safety reasons."
good,I think it all depends on what your job title for you to like working here. Some positions could get boring while others never have a dull moment.
good,"A typical day at work, placing orders for guest, and tracking orders. What I have learned, is how to turn a bad situation into a good experience and taking care of the guest. My co-workers are fun, and enthusiastic. I really wouldn't say there was a hard part of the job, its more of learning something new daily. There's always new things to learn whether its among the cow-workers or our Disney Guest, The most enjoyable part of my job, is making a dream come true for the guest. We want them to have a magical experience when we interact with the guest, whether its placing there order, looking up items that they are interested in or just general questions about our online website. We strive to make each and everyone of our guest have a magical experience."
good,"International internship working with the industry leader on many fronts including, guest relations, guest experience and hospitality to name a few. Lots of different branches within company allow for endless possibilities regarding job roles etc."
good,Disney is a very powerful company. It has a lot of very smart and hardworking people working together to make Disney what it is today. Be prepared to work hard.
good,"Burbank studio specializing in Motion Capture animation, Interactive media, and gaming. Full service studio facility."
good,"Gary Disney, CPA is very active in a small community. The firm works closely with local small businesses, individuals, and trusts. There is also high quality bookeeping and payroll services at Disney."
good,A typical day at work consisted of me sitting and answering incoming calls from many of Disney owned affiliates. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy every guests. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.
good,"As an unpaid intern I completed tasks such as reading scripts and writing coverage, copying, filing, organizing, and covering desks when the producers' assistants were absent. I met some good people while working there and made good work connections. The hardest part of the job was reading the large amount of poor scripts that needed to be covered daily."
good,I worked on the Toy Story 3 project with the video game design team. Each day we worked together to in order to continually improve the product. We used an network system in defining and reporting bugs and problems in the product. It provided challenging tasks of detecting and reporting these problems.
good,"Well, who doesn't like to work for Mickey and Minnie? The properties are great and have a huge legacy behind. I knew my position was not going to be a challenging one, but it motivates me to work for one of the most recognized brands of the world. The hardest part of the job was understanding I had to develop a low profile position and making the decision to leave and look for a more challenging position with great growth opportunities."
good,"Helping multiple people with their accounts. Sales, orders, payments etc."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of contacting several project team leaders who completed their tasks to open Storybook Circus. I learned how to talk to people and to ensure I am using the best form of communication to follow up with everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to see Storybook Circus open to the general public in Magic Kingdom and see them ride the rides for the first time. The hardest part of the job was to learn what form of communication works best for certain individuals. While some enjoy reading an email, others prefer talking over the phone to provide a project update. My co-workers encouraged me to always keep going and to always ask questions when I did not know the answer."
good,great company to work for
good,The commissary made life much easier.   There are a lot of layers of management that sometimes made things a little more difficult than they needed to be.   But I would absolutely work there again
good,"Great company to work for if you’re in college. Managers play favoritism big time when you want career advancement. They offer great activities for sports such volleyball, softball and canoe races."
good,"culture d'entreprise trés présente."
good,"It was hard, but a great learning experience. You have to really love guest service, and be open and willing to learn new things. This is the place where you say yes to every opportunity presented to you."
good,"I learned a lot more about customer service, met some great people, and felt supported. However, the job did have its downside. I have been physically and verbally accosted."
good,Lots of perks; however poorly managed in multiple aspects. I enjoyed working there. It was a great experience. I was unhappy with the management team; as they were often inconsistent.
good,"The hardest part was troubleshooting  the computer, their systems were so old that it would always crash (especially during sells) and the guest would call in to place orders and it would crash for us to,  also the system  would some how charge the guests card  twice for the same purchase which was also a common issue."
good,"This job was fun on numerous levels, but the best part was getting to serve the guests and make Disney Magic! Being able to be a part of the magic was the most fulfilling part."
good,"Positions are largely dictated by unions, so advancement is challenging and often undervalued. You will compete against someone less qualified, but higher seniority for everything."
good,"Glad I had the opportunity to work here. TWDC takes care of their employees by offering many benefits, but only if you can get full time status...which is difficult to get. The company is also pretty stingy on pay, but in exchange you get free access to a lot of their perks. Kind of like pick your poison. There were many co-workers of mine that loved working there for the security aspect, but also had to make majority of their earnings by another means (or 2) of income..."
good,"A nice place to work. Beautiful physical environment when on property in Anaheim, California or Orlando, Florida. Great support from the parent company."
good,"You get to go into the park for free which is nice, as well as discounts on merchandise and in the park on food and beverages. The people you work with are nice to."
good,great experience would highly recommend their work to college students or anyone looking for a part-time job. Management was also very caring and respectful.
good,Created a 'magical' atmosphere which in turn helped make the job a fun and safe environment.
good,"The work-life balance as an intern isn't great regularly, and especially not as a culinary intern. Prepare yourself for long hours, hard shifts, and (at the Grand Floridian at least) people who will absolutely stab you in the back to keep their position even after you explain you have no interest in working there past the end of the internship. You have the potential to make new professional connections and friends and see things you've never seen before, or even work through a hurricane, but you also have potential to have nervous breakdowns a lot."
good,"Working for the Disney Store will forever be one of my favorite memories. I loved interacting with the kids and my fellow cast members. We were all a big happy family. However, Disney unfortunately does not offer any medical benefits for their cast members nor do they offer full time hours. Sometimes they make poor decisions (IMO) with management hires and seem to prefer hiring from the outside rather than promoting within. Overall, this job was fantastic and I would recommend to anyone."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I love where I work and the people I work with. Benefits such as park access and merchandise discounts are amazing. Management does what they can, but you can get lost in the paperwork if you don't keep up with them/hold them accountable. I get to meet so many different people and help them enjoy their vacations! The major downside is that, at least from my experience as part time, it is very hard financially. When I started I was typically getting scheduled about 30 hours a week. I have always given full availability, but I understand Full Timers get the hours first, and the pay was enough that it was definitely sustainable - enough to afford rent, groceries, and gas at the very least. My hours have been cut dramatically without notice (12 hours a week) for about a month now, so it's been a bit rough, but it's still not a bad gig at all."
good,"Disney does offer great work life balance.  They do absolutely take into consideration employee's personal life and are accommodating."
good,"was one of the most fun places to work with great people.  however very limited career advancement opportunities and low compensation.  however, most decide to stay due to its brand."
good,General day to day was a good experience. Coworkers are very professional but will also have fun when the time comes. Occasionally will have hackathons to challenge creativity.
good,"At the time of my internship I was still a student, and I had a lot of fun. Overall working for the company is around an 8 or 9 because you work long hours standing, and the pay is not that much for what is left after everything is deduce. However, it is in indeed a great experience to try and to grow!"
good,"Disney relies on their name when it comes to having a professional job. The perks (free tickets, discounts, etc..) are meant to outweigh the fact that you have to support a family.  The pay is not equitable compared to a similar role on the other side of Orlando."
good,"Disney World is a fast paced, noisy, and strict place to work. You can get fired pretty easily because the customer is always right and if they say something is wrong you can get in trouble for it. I was working 30 hour weeks making $10 an hour and it was barely paying my bills. Even with all that said, I enjoyed my time working there and would work there again if I got a job offer."
good,"This company is a great place to work for. Fast-paced, fun, well-rounded opportunities (unless, of course, you are there for a short amount of time.) Management is great as well. The pay is not worth it though."
good,"Infraestructura moderna, que genera ganas de estar ahí."
good,"There is never a dull moment on the job here, especially in Recreation. A typical work day is 8.5 hours and I am always on my feet and interacting with guests in one way or another. I learned how to provide exceptional guest experience to all age groups and how to clearly communicate directions both orally and physically. The different levels of management are always around and available for questions, to help with a task, or just to have friendly conversation with. The culture of Disney's Recreation is a fast pace fun environment where each cast member provides their own unique personality which cascades to provide a memorable experience for guests.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up morale when you have been working outside in the heat all day. However, we fall back on each other to pick each other up and get us ready to create Disney magic. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the smiles and laughs on the children's and adult's faces when you create that special bond with a family and you know they helped make their vacation memorable."
good,"A typical day is dealing with guests, answering questions, making sure they are safe, making sure we are stocked. Hardest part of the job is dealing with guests that don't listen. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a family have a great day by doing something so little for them."
good,"If you are looking for a company that offers great benefits, this is the place for you.  Work life balance is tough, depending on your position and department."
good,"Great company culture, learn from the best of the best in the industry. It's hard making your way up the ladder in a timely manner and not paid the cost of living for LA. Overall great experience."
good,"Note: As I was under contract I cannot base my review on benefits or other items not offered to contractors. "
good,"I loved working at the Walt Disney Company, everyone was always great and managers cared about how their employees were doing. I worked part-time, but I heard it was difficult to be moved to full-time"
good,"a empresa tem produtos muito bons de serem trabalhados e a cultura da empresa é boa e preza bons valores."
good,"I enjoyed my year and a half at Disneyland, working in QSR and outdoor vending. I loved my area and the people that I got to work with, rarely did I have to work with someone that I disliked. I didn't have any complaints for the managers, working in outdoor vending you wouldn't see them that much until closing time or the random times they'd stop by to check on things. This was a place that I wanted to work at when I was younger but working there while going to school also worked out for me. I'm just glad I had the opportunity to work there even if it wasn't for too long. I enjoyed working night shifts and every now and then I'd work an early shift. The changes in schedule helped take out the routine out of life and my schedule always worked with my school schedule. I got to see some coworkers grow in the company, which proves with self determination and good communication one is able to move up in the company."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I love the brand as many do. I will forever be passionate for it.. with it being such a large company there are a few teams who don't like change and don't like newer ideas.
good,"Fast paced, fun environment but no advancement opportunities. Pay and benefits very low compared to other service industry jobs. Schedule can be very flexible, but everything is based on seniority."
good,"It was fun working the Disney Social Games. I used to work in a dynamic team. We used to develop social games with Disney and Marvel IP's for Facebook, iOS and Android platform."
good,I was offered the opportunity to be the communications intern at WDI and loved every moment of it. Everyday taught me something new and the company treats their employees well. Those who want to work there in the long-run either have to be hired at the right time or work hard enough to have the company rely on them.
good,"Working for the Walt Disney company was very entertaining. The hours depend on location. We did not receive a lot of hours in my location which made it difficult to pay for living expenses. As a plus, I got to enjoy the Disney Parks as much as I could and all that they had to offer. they had wonderful discounts for cast members."
good,"As an intern be ready to work upwards of 60+ hours a week with 12+ hour days. Fun and great experience. I would definitely do it again. Not the best with management as they manage hundreds of people at once, but all very nice people."
good,"If you're looking to teach in China, this is a good gateway. "
good,"This was several years back, but it was a great company and I would have loved to stay.  Back then, I guess the assistant to an executive was considered ""his"" so when my boss left the company I was out.  Unfortunately, I had no idea he was leaving.  NO ONE TOLD ME.  One day, I was just called in to HR and they had me hand over all my passes, badges, etc without any prior notice -- really not cool."
good,"Disney was a fast-paced, dynamic environment in which to work. Due to many reorganizations, the work environment never gets stale or boring as duties and responsibilities constantly change."
good,"The job culture is steady and slower paced, with cooperative efforts made but not exceeded by coworkers and management. The atmosphere was relaxed and not very stressful, however, room for advancement seemed limited."
good,"It's a great company that has a very developed and well known brand. I enjoyed getting to work with a variety of people from all walks of life and getting to meet and interact with guests from all over the world. "
good,"Typical day is busy and fast paced filled with many guest interactions. The perks of free entry into the parks is great, but the reality is the pay wages are not livable for Southern California."
good,The Walt Disney Company was a great company to have on your resume in for an experience however it is very political there and unless you know the right people very hard to get a promotion.  They hire within the company more than outside of the company so if you have already worked there before and would like to go bag and are in good standing you have better chances of getting a job.
good,It was hard to get promoted within the corporate offices. Job openings within the corporate offices were not really disclosed to employees working within the park.
good,"Disney is a powerful and influential company. It demands the highest quality of professionalism to where anything less than 100% is not good enough.  "
good,You get what you give. Disney is an amazing place to work so long as you give 100% to your job. Management is dependent on your location. Interacting with nice guests made the hard days worth it.
good,I was a Disney college program intern and I typically worked 10 hour days. The park was usually pretty slow until the weekends and holidays. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and the wear and tear on your body.
good,Working at Disney as a contracter was a great experience. I learned a lot and was able to contribute to some great projects.  I enjoyed working with some of Disney's most iconic characters.
good,"I loved working at Disney World! I got to work with different people each day since I was seasonal and did not have a strict location. Meeting new people every day from different points of view and different countries was an enriching experience. My managers were always there before we all started so we knew what was going to happen and what we should be ready for, and they always made an effort to check on our area during the day. Walt Disney World allows college internships from the United States and out of country as well,  so working with different people from different cultures was fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job would be to fulfill peoples expectations for their vacation, but the most enjoyable was when we were able to create a magical moment that they would always remember."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Being in an hourly role at Disney Parks was an eye-opener. It made you realize how easy it was to fill in your role. It was a fun but stressful work environment especially if you have a family to care for. Minimum wage in California is especially hard to live with. I luckily was not in that position, I focused a lot of my energy on making my team happy and in itself was draining."
good,"Of course working for a company as well known as this is always amazing. But they expect a lot and pay very little. The odds are you'll be running around most of the night. Managers and co-workers are very nice, they're always trying to make it the best place to work, doesn't change how fast paced everything is."
good,The track into management is very back stabby.  They pass it down to us.  Regular cast members are enjoyable. Some guests take it too personally when you are unable to help them.
good,It's no secret that The Walt Disney Company has always believed in paying the lowest wages it can get away with. It's a cultist atmosphere where you work there because of the great benefits and free park passes. They have very high standards for everything which is great if you can uphold to them.
good,The hardest part about working at Disney which is not too difficult is staying magical when dealing with difficult situations that you cannot change. The most enjoyable part is meeting people from all over the world and making their vacation that much better.
good,"Working for the mouse is fun but constantly working with guests can be stressful if you don’t have good interpersonal skills. Other than that, no day is the same and there’s no odd day."
good,"I always loved Disney while I was growing up. Once I got a job at the Disney Store, I was so excited. It was a bit underwhelming for a few reasons. They make you study every Disney movie, Disney show, and know all of the character names, which was extremely difficult. The pay was only $9 an hour. When you're closing at night with one manager, they never help you clean, so it's just you cleaning poo smears out of the princess castle, vacuuming the rug, organizing the stuffed animal mountain for the 50th time of the day, etc. They also expect you to come up with corny lines on the spot to say to kids like, ""Howdy partner!!! Are you ready to round up some rodeo with woody?"" And you would get in trouble if you didn't do this. They also expect you to be unrealistically bubbly throughout your entire shift. I had to quit because I felt like I was in a cult."
good,it is a fun way to get paid and travel to some exotic places. working for the company I was able to gain advance knowledge of technical production. meeting people from all over the world and experiencing their culture is next to none.
good,"It's a great company to work for, but you will give part of your life to the company.  You will be compensated and the weekly parties are great.  You are expected to meet all your goal, and if not there will be issues."
good,"management could use some work, pay could be increased, but overall fun and fast paced place to work. time off is hard to come by, especially for college program participants, but they give everyone a fair chance"
good,"The day to day operational tasks are varied, which I like.  The processes / methodologies are non-existent or very flexible/fluid - not as structured and formal as some other companies I've worked for.  This can be advantageous in avoiding bureaucracy and speeding time to market, but detrimental for controlling quality and raises questions for some junior staff that try to navigate the ""system"" without a roadmap."
good,"worked at the Disney tore inside a mall "
good,"Tive a oportunidade de vender os produtos de Home Video da Disney, desde o inicio da Distribuição no Brasil através da Abril Video da Amazônia, em 1999 a Disney resolveu criar um Departamento de Vendas próprio, fui contratado e permaneci até 2016, quando a empresa resolveu desativa-lo."
good,A day at work requires you to help and serve customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can show a little bit of you inner child if you love Disney.
good,Great team work environment. Leadership in this department is great. The other castmembers are friendly and helpful. They are very flexible with work schedule.
good,"Great place to work, if you are not contracted. The people here are friendly and the environment does not get dull. The QA teams are the best and set the standard as Quality Assurance"
good,"Γενικά οι συνθήκες εργασίας είναι αρκετά καλές, οι άδειες αρκετές, η πληρωμή γίνεται πάντα στην ώρα της (μισθός μου ήταν 1.200 ευρώ) και οι υπερωρίες πληρώνονται κανονικότατα. Ως υπάλληλοι – ή αλλιώς CastMembers σε Disney όρους-  είχαμε έκπτωση 25% στα εστιατόρια και τις boutique της Disney και 50% στα ξενοδοχεία ενώ μπορούσαμε να επισκεφθούμε δωρεάν τα πάρκα αμέτρητες φορές. Επίσης διοργανώνονται πολλά events,διαγωνισμοί και γιορτές για τους υπαλλήλους και τις οικογένειες τους.Από την άλλη όμως τα ωράρια της δουλείας δεν είναι σταθερά (για παράδειγμα μία βδομάδα μπορεί να δούλευα 7-15 και την επόμενη 17-1) κάτι που δεν σου επιτρέπει να έχεις ένα πρόγραμμα όσον αφορά τα γεύματα σου, τον ύπνο σου και τις δραστηριότητές σου. Επίσης είτε δουλεύεις στις attractions, στην έκδοση εισιτηρίων, στα εστιατόρια, στις boutique  ή στα ξενοδοχεία, μετά από ένα σημείο η δουλειά γίνεται αρκετά ρομποτική-επαναλαμβανόμενη και κουραστική. Τέλος οι ευκαιρίες εξέλιξης είναι αρκετά μικρές και απαιτούν πάρα πολλά χρόνια προϋπηρεσίας στην εταιρεία."
good,it is a fun place to work at and also has a very friendly environment and the managers and team leaders are friendly and the job itself is very easy compared to other warehouses.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"My typical day at work was fairly easy but monotonous. I just drove guests back and forth. I met some interesting people, but had to force small talk with quite a few more. They have great benefits, but I was part time and therefore could not enjoy them. Over all it was a good experience, mainly because of the fellow cast members."
good,I have made some of the best memories here and met so many interesting people. The environment is fast-paced at the store I worked (World of Disney). Had a wide range of responsibilities which made it a great learning experience.
good,"Working as a front line cast member is not for the faint of heart. The hours are long, the work can be exhausting, but no matter how bad of a day you are having, Disney is a truly magical company to work with. The values you learn from not only Traditions(day one of employment) as well as through continued employment are things you will take in every job, as well as other real life situations. As tiring as it was and as awful as the commute was for such a low pay, I don't regret one minute of working there."
good,"Disney is very much an in-between job, unless you want to move up into management."
good,"Typical day at work is with 30,000 to 50,000 people in the Magic Kingdom..You learn how to deal with others and solve issues quickly.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers who dont seem to care about what they do.  The most enjoyable part is watching people smile when they meet their favorite character or see the castle for the first time."
good,Greet every single customer with a smile & sell items to customers. While ensuring not to over charge the customer or be short on your crash drawer.
good,"ABC/Disney was a fun place to work with a great team of co-workers. There aren't many that can say they enjoy gong to work. I enjoyed processing the payroll, the shows, keeping informed of the news and news events and not to leave out the summer concerts and the perks at Disneyland."
good,"The Walt Disney Company has the most exceptional guest service skills. I work with guests on a daily basis anticipating their needs and making sure they have a pleasant interaction and experience while visiting the theme park. I learned that the guest is not always right, but it is my responsibility to make it right for them. I have learned to maintain a conducive work environment and working in a team. As a trainer I am the first person the new cast members meet for their new positions and location so I must make a positive and productive impression. I guide the new employees in the Disney values as well as teach them our daily tasks and work ethic. My co-workers became my second family and we all work together to achieve a common goal. I thrive off of interpersonal communication, and I enjoy making a personal connection with guests and cast members alike."
good,"Strong CEO and executive leadership. Unfortunately, until you pave your way through the ranks, you will deal with lots of poor leaders."
good,"good place to work, not much room for advancement. you can work 20 years for Disney without any advancement in your career."
good,Was a good company to work for and the benefits were great.  Great for trips to Disneyland Paris.  Location of the company is in Hammersmith and not a great location in London.
good,Good place to work great brand but limited progression in my area of expertise. I would recommend people to work here. Management is good.
good,"Corporate accountant for nation wide homebuilder with Corporate office in Hollywood Florida. Maintained balance sheet, reconciled Intercompany accounts, assisted in preparation of 10-Q and 10-K for publicly traded company."
good,Great camaraderie. Learned that people want to work for you if you take care of them. Management and Co-workers were fun. Not showing favoritism was hard. Enjoyed laughter with peers.
good,"I learned many systems such as Siebel, DSCS, Outlook, DREAMS, etc. I also learned how to master multi-tasking as there is always something to do and new things pop up multiple times a day. My co-workers are friendly and get to interact with them daily, both in the office and onstage at resorts and the parks during ceremonies and receptions. The hours are great, and the atmosphere is fun."
good,I have had a great experience working for Disney. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"All in all, the people you meet at Disney are fantastic.  The benefits were great, including free admission to the parks for you and Guests.  The only negative is so many people want to work for Disney that advancement is difficult.  Once people get to where they want to be, they’re not leaving, so moving up the corporate latter is a struggle."
good,"A typical day involves lots of guest interaction with such a high capacity of guests coming in and out. From the guests who are there for the first time, to the ones who are going to have a rotten day no matte what, there is always an opportunity to make a magical moment."
good,"Une journée comme les autres elles se suivent avec heureusement un bon relationnel, rigueur, motivation, efficacité, sécurité, animation."
good,"i guided the people to their places. the company was very nice with the team, the customers in this time was childs and they are very exited and very cute."
good,"Worked as a Graphic Designer for the film ""Step Up: 3D.""  This was a short term, freelance gig that involved illustration, set and costume design, and storyboarding.  Worked from home in San Francisco while the film was shooting in New York, so I had very little interaction with the rest of the staff.  But the job was fun and went by fast, and the pay was good."
good,"Working from a brief with a copywriter, generating ideas to present to the client, Working on designs to produce an effective advertising campaign, Commissioning specialists, such as artists and photographers, to work on projects, Managing projects and working within a budget editing the final results for presentation to the client."
good," You meet great people and every day's different. However it's very hard to have your work schedule mesh with your school schedule, and there can be leads and managers that play favorites."
good,"Keeps me busy, learn new areas of the job. Maintain the property interior as well as exterior"
good,"Exceed guest expectations and stay in ""character"" at all times while ""on stage"". I enjoyed working there and assisting families in having a magical experience."
good,"9/10 hours work a day, fast paced photography environment, health and safety set up rules and guidelines. Zero tolerance policies."
good,I have learnt a lot here. I have always been surrounded by good and experienced people.
good,Projetos interessantes para desenvolver porém muita burocracia para aprovações.
good,It gets a little worn out when you graduate from college since you are looking to get started in a career. The enjoyment is strongly based on the department you are in. I do have some great memories working there and it has really taught me how to be a patient person and know how to help others. Learning about the different backgrounds of people and life stories is something that cannot be overlooked being here. Making a person or family's day by just doing little is what still brings me back here.
good,Great place to work for an internship. Offers the time of fun while still working. as much fun as it is tho i would not recommend staying there much past your internship.
good,this was an internship and iwouldnt be right for me to judge them only being there as an intern
good,"I work the 3rd shift, over weekends. Being a ""permanent Temp"" I do not get to work 40 hours a week.. The hardest part of the job is the fact that I don't get sufficient work hours."
good,Kul och utvecklande med höga förväntningar. Varierande
good,It's a great place to find friends and it's more of a family friends environment. Manager or lead support is not good. Sometimes some leads support you and other times some leads will let you fall on your butt.   This job has its pros and cons but overall I've enjoyed my time at Disneyland
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Lead activities focused on environmental conservation awareness"
good,"I learned a lot at this company in regards to customer satisfaction. That I'm never supposed to say no, but instead I can find the answer even if I don't know the answer. The best part of the job is being able to welcome guests to the Disneyland hotel and make their stay and overall experience at Disneyland memorable."
good,"I was an ODV cast member as a part of the Disney College Program. The job was not hard, but the hours were long and it was completely outside. I had no choice in my location (when I accepted the position, I was only told that I would be in Food and Beverage). It was fun and I made quite a few friends. However, I was doing just as much if not more work than my fellow part- and full-time cast members, yet I was being compensated less. On top of that, I also received zero benefits. This is a great job for someone who just needs a semester break from college or would like to get their foot in the door with Disney, but I wouldn't recommend it for any other reasons. I had fun, but I wouldn't go back as a cast member - only as a guest."
good,It was really fun working at Magic Kingdom. My job was pretty difficult but it was worth it seeing smiles on people's faces everyday. The one thing I did not like was that it often felt like our voices weren't heard as cast members and that guests could run all over us.
good,"The only issue was the progression and salary package. This was lower in comparison to similar companies within the industry. Culture, people, projects were all really great."
good,"Keep your nose clean and it will pay off. its a great learning opportunity. if you get bored, you can transfer to other departments. Over time is available in food and beverage,"
good,"Working attractions/operations is extremely high paced as you would expect. A typical day is 8-10 hours with plenty of opportunities to get overtime. There are plenty of opportunities to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits, almost unlimited access to the largest theme parks in the world."
good,"The job requirements and expectations were in line with what I expected and manageable. However, the workplace environment posed problems. My immediate manager created a hostile work environment that extended to others around our department and caused tensions to run high. However, higher level managers were supportive and wanted to help advance my career."
good,"I worked at Disney several years ago.  My team has disbanded and spread all over the place, so my experience isn't relevant anymore.  The people there were good people."
good,they put you a basic small amount of hours they can when you first start. as you are there longer they will advance you. its a good company and they work with your school schedule.
good,"I loved the job, helping guests build memories and interacting with them and characters. But the job is very tiring and strenuous. There are long hours standing in the same location, out in sometimes brutal heat. Be prepared for less than great leadership who don't listen or care when you address problems."
good,"Management makes sure you are completing Disney's 5 Key goals every second you work. While completing these goals, we made sure that our working environment was clean and welcoming to all customers. Outside of work we had many benefits such as free entry to the park, discounts around the Orlando area and more."
good,"It's a great place to work if you are not worried about how much money you make. It's rewarding emotionally, but not financially. There are some cool perks, like free park entrance."
good,Disney has been a great place to work. Strong Disney culture with many policies and rules to follow but if you embrace the change it is a very happy place to work with improving income oportunities
good,Couldn't stay because the walk from the parking lot to my location was 45 minutes and I had to drive 45 minutes to get there. You need to really really REALLY want this ladies and gents.... but you'll have fun. Stick with it and smile :)
good,You only move up if someone moves out. Try to learn as much as you can and then start looking for work elsewhere. They pay horribly but their benefits are amazing.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"My last role at Corporate was a wonderful experience. Very smart and decisive leaders.  They were approachable and helped guide my career, but also let me make decisions about my job and its impact.  I was part time and they let me make my own hours knowing my work was always complete. They seemed to have a very transparent work place as people could tend to their personal  and family issues freely without judgement. I was at Corp and felt it was a much more structured and formal business unit vs my time at Consumer Products, which was a bit more relaxed. I did sense after being there over 20 years that the culture seemed to be more of a fear based company with layoffs looming all the time."
good,"It was a great environment. The leaders were great most of the time, but two did not show great work ethic. They often yelled at other cast members or took advantage of the company's resources."
good,"Great leads, learned a lot about customer service. Got paid to go to Disneyland. Fun shifts but at times stressful especially during the summer and the holidays. Hard to get the days off you actually want or need. Parking is not onsite, cast members have to wait about 10-30 minutes for shuttles. Have to arrive with enough time"
good,"Overall a fun work environment. The hours could be long during the holidays and guests could be tough, but getting to make magic in someones day made it worthwhile."
good,"I have worked for Disney just short of 5 years.  I have greatly progressed in those years to help become more patient and understanding of the many different needs of a guest to make the most magical vacation possible.  I have also increased my knowledge of the many types of guest services, that can be utilized to assist the many different cultures of the guest to exceed the expectations of Walt Disney World."
good,I worked at the N.Brand Building.  I found it a tad stuffy in terms of culture.  The work day was pretty demanding on a daily basis with not much room to breathe; a little too much for my taste.  I found the people to be nice overall.   The money was competitive but the work/life balance not so great.
good,"Good place to meet people and build friendships."
good,"Many employees are fiercely loyal to the mission and culture of Disney."
good,"Work place culture was positive, team-based extremely informative, rewarding,  and fun. My coworkers felt like family. I was trained on everything necessary to understand the demands being a part of a promotional team for special events including school assemblies. Most enjoyable part of the day was seeing the smiles on families'  and childrens' faces during our events. Hardest part of the job was the very low pay. Management was great. Typical day was arriving early to load the van w/ equipment( speakers, lights, audio system) tents, tables, etc) working on a dance routine, going over the schedule/plan for the specific event, role for each member during the day. setting up at the event, tearing down, returning to the radio station and unloading."
good,Is a fun place to work but not long term employment with little chance to grow within your role. you would need to stay with the company for years in order to get some sort of recognition
good,"Bonne entreprise pour débuter une carrière, mais horaires décalées, travail les jours fériés & week end, Management aléatoire mais souvent qui prône le copinage. Salaire corrects quoique en dessous de la norme."
good,"Every day was a different experience while working for the Disney company, especially with my location around wild animals, but at times it was emotionally taxing to continually deliver a ""magical"" experience for every guest. Alongside dealing with a less-than-desirable pay and lack of benefits, leadership was a bit inconsistent. "
good,"pay was too little, fast paced, looks good on resume. discounts were great, free admission to disney parks, recognition was given a lot. coworkers were great"
good,"Most mangers I had were rude. The overall job was fun though. I got to work in many different places in the resort, A very different work experience that helped shape me into who I am"
good,"Worked hard, great benefits. The things that I learned when I volunteered within Disney. Management was okay, even though they were on a different coast."
good,"DVC overall makes your role difficult because its based on surveys by the members and even if you go beyond expectations if they had a bad day they rate you low and they know this. The company overall is fun and you can move from departments based on experiences and who you know. Love Disney, but the company does not pay the employers enough for the work expected of them and some of their policies are ridiculous. There is no sitting allowed unless its a sitting position and sometimes these positions you stand for very long times until you are relieved. Some mgts do not follow the Disney look however expect employees to follow, they should lead by example. However there motto is always if your not happy, there is always someone out there that would love to take your position. Benefits are great though."
good,"I enjoy working for the company, but when it came to personal situations Disney was never there to help. If you had a large family emergency (ie. family death) they would give you the proper amount of days need by law, then immediately would be upset if you had to miss more time."
good,"loved the job, but a 9 month contract-to-hire position turned into the entire department and project being shut down after 2 months, 200 person layoff"
good,"Working for the Parking Department, the only time you saw a manager for displintory reason or if you got an award, but solemnly did the management come out and check on staff. Managers did have their favorites and made more time for those they favored."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Had the opportunity to meet some amazing people from all over the world in my role. I loved working here for the most part. Being able to make a guests day was worth everything.
good,"Hard to make a living, but I made amazing friendships - great part time job if your in school! Would like to see them pay more to cast members that have been there longer than others."
good,"Great company with good benefits."
good,"Walt Disney is a fun, friendly environment to work in. IT provides you with many opportunities to better your customer service. IT allows you to grow and gain knowledge about the company."
good,"- the are always doing events and different things to bring everyone together, customer and coworkers are happy and amicable. I didnt like that we didnt have set seats. Every day we alternated if someone was sitting in our seat by the time we got there."
good,"The Disney Store was a great place to work and it's all about its customers having the most magical experience. The only real con I found was that if someone is not cheerful, preppy, and smiling all the time they are not considered a good worker."
good,"Not every role in the Disney Parks will be for you, but the experience is still worth applying for. Based on my time in two programs, it's clear that the company values its workers and wants them to stay. Speak up and let management know what you need, and the leaders who care about their work will do their best to help."
good,working for TWDC is an emotional roller coaster followed by a physical marathon.  however once you get passed the hardest parts of it the benefits of working for a prestigious company are worth it in the end.
good,Overall great job but very low pay. Meet great people and work is always constant and always fun. This is definitely a job to have throughout college. I will definitely miss it but need something with much higher pay.
good,"This Company is great to work for there is pros and cons just like any other company. Lots of chances to move up in the company or move to different locations. Great Benefits and health care. Just make sure you attendance and other reason you can get points docked off in check. Some locations have great leaders and some have bad management. Parking is very fun, and everyday there is something different."
good,"Liked it more as ESPN.  Disney was big and it was apparent that there were metrics that for one to win someone had to lose. Overall, it was a positive"
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo. Buenos compañeros. Buenos beneficios
good,"Fast Paced environment, Repetitive routine,friendly staff, friendly managers, long and difficult hours, no extra pay as intern during holidays, overall a great experience."
good,"très bonne expérience professionnel , beaucoup d'opportunités"
good,"The benefits are great, the hours not so much. You're allowed to create a ton of magic for guests and that is honestly the best part about this job. Career advancement is there, but its extremely competitive and hard to obtain depending on the role you start in."
good,"My co-workers were great!  My immediate supervisors were great!  Never miss a shift or complain.  When it is busy, it is REALLY busy.  It is wonderful to share joy of guests!"
good,"Some of the issues that Disney that it is many different kinds of companies rolled up into one giant corporation.  It's an entertainment empire, obviously, but it is also a hotel and resorts and travel company.  It is a cruise line company.  It also has a lot of talented engineers that invent things all the time.  Tying it all together is an IT infrastructure that includes games, hotel reservation systems, and useful apps for your iPhone or Android, and a bunch more.  So this can lead to an identity crisis for it's employees, and sometimes decisions that would have been great for a media company or a hotel chain doesn't translate well to creating great software.  Disney has made great strides in rectifying the situation but there is still a long way to go."
good,"Shifts can start and end at any time of day.  Some days can be slow or very busy.  There are a lot of different opportunities at one's disposal.  However, it takes long to move up.  The fellow Cast Members are some of the greatest people you meet.  They are the reason you want to go to work everyday.  The environment can be very fun."
good,"It was fun working there, but at times it was stressful. Especially the hours you'd work, which meant you would be extended past your scheduled time quite often. The other cast members sometimes made it feel like I was back at high school. Even our higher ups"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Touring with the Lion King was an incredible experience.  I got to travel and live abroad.  The money was good and the skills I learnt were job specific and incredibly interesting.  It is a reknown company to be associated with.  I struggled with the work life balance and missed a stable home life and down time.  I have learnt personal improvements, learnt to deal with high stress environments and developed an incredible work ethic."
good,I am very proud to be a part of such an entertaining and diverse environment.  There are plenty of opportunity to work with all different types of people and environments.
good,"There was nothing particularly unique about the workplace or culture. It was however amazing to work somewhere so ""magical"". To leave work knowing you helped create happiness is one of the best feelings!"
good,"You learn how to meet every guest's individual needs, and are required to go above and beyond in everything you do. The managers at my specific workplace, Tiffins, were great, but the coworkers were not. They lacked skills and were very brash and rude to guests and fellow coworkers. There is a lot of diversity, guests coming from all around the world, so you have to be patient or willing to learn so that you can communicate well."
good,"All in all Disney is a great place to work! You can very easily advance your job title here and job security is high here you don't have to worry about much! Just have child like faith,smile and have a blast!"
good,"Low pay, lots of work, good coworkers.  I would only suggest working here if you enjoy working with a lot of people and can handle high stress, as your constantly working throughout the day"
good,"Working at Walt Disney was interesting in that it was creative and offered students the opportunity to express themselves as individuals and enjoy the fine arts as they worked hard at their academics.  "
good,good place to learn guest service skills if your just starting out. Also is good for extra income if you already have a full time career. The perks are a great part of working there as well.
good,"Disney has a wonderful legacy behind it that'll make you proud to tell your friends and family you are a part of. However, for the work you do there are places elsewhere you can make more which means you will never be paid what you think you should. With that said the benefits more than make up for it in the long run with discounts all throughout the world and a place where more times than not it feels like you get to play."
good,"Disney Store was more fun, energetic, even magical. Unfortunately, Mouse Gear in Walt Disney World's Epcot, was dull. It wasn't the same atmosphere. The best cast members I have ever had the honor to work with that were dedicated and passionate to the Walt Disney company and cared about getting to know their guests were from the Disney Store.  They made the guests feel like they were in one of the Disney Parks.  Unlike the cast members at WDW."
good,"It's the most magical place on Earth, but also the most chaotic. Can be extremely stressful at times but your coworkers make it worth it. You have to love Disney for it to be worth the low pay and long hours, in my opinion. I love Disney so to be able to play in the parks on my days off was all I needed to be happy."
good,"I have literally been told that ""I would not have jumped the gate if it wasn't locked."" But many cast members are willing to help no matter what department they are in."
good,It was an okay job to have! For coming right out of culinary school it is a great way to get the much needed expierence. i would love to come back once i go home and finish up business.
good,"Even tho the pay isn't the best, the benefits and discount are great.  They are opportunities to grow with the company however it is a slow process.  It is an enjoyable place to work and the cast member are a real team"
good,"if youre a disney fan then this is the place to work, one of the funnest places to work. the staff is friendly and warm. you defiantly learn alot about Disney and the brand."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is world-renowned for its quality entertainment and its standards to create such content. Working for Disney means being surrounded by great people every day who also embody the values representing the Company. As an Imagineering intern, I was still treated as a valued member of my department and my opinion was always respected and considered in meetings. My supervisor was quick to give me advice in the right direction when I needed it but did not provide complete solutions for me. This gave me space to grow my thoughts and ideas and apply them to real world applications."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"For every tourist that comes to Disney, getting a magical experience is the one thing they want to get above all else. And for us employees at the Walt Disney Company, we really do our best to provide and care for that magic. Not all, but most of us. "
good,.Have To Talk In A Cheerful And Respectful Manner Help Customers Books Rooms Help Set Up Their Payments .Tickets .Taking Incoming Calls Only (Inbound)
good,"Great company. Good people. A bit of politics between different technology divisions."
good,"The Walt Disney Company as a whole is a great company to work with. However, I have noticed that the salary is low for finance at the Walt Disney Imagineering and Disneytoon Studios."
good,"Great benefits are provided.  Compensation/Salary is just so so."
good,"I was on a management internship. I felt lost in the beginning, there was very little guidance. The best part of the job was working with guests and my cast members. Management left me to fend for myself."
good,It was a wonderful experience getting an opportunity to work abroad for a reputable company. Your able to travel and meet so many people from all over the world.
good,"Call center environment; inbound calls; headset; calls and employees constantly being monitored. You learn how to book travel vacation packages. The management was fair. Workplace was a relaxed environment. Hardest part of the job; feeling like you are stuck. It was an enjoyable job; venders would often come in and bring goodies; also there were incentives too; you could win amusement park tickets, airfare, hotel stays. Best of luck!"
good,"It's a pretty based pay, you get paid weekly which is pretty cool. But the company does demand way too many stuff from you on your part, but if you need a job to barely get you by this would be it"
good,"First job in retail, great learning experience for high sales volume in a short period. Learned the basics of a sales position and a customer service mindset"
good,"Disney allows me to cover a lot of ground as a creative.  I am an editor, camera operator, and utility.  Working on set and in post.  Long hours and dedicated teamwork !!"
good,"I always loved Disney, I mean who doesn't? "
good,Great place to work.  The team likes to work hard and play hard.  I was encouraged to learn new tools and to expand my role.  The workplace culture was a mix of the typical tech companies around the area with a dash of Disney themes on each floor.
good,Walt Disney is awesome at getting contractors to want to be employees. But they pay contractors so good so they can remove them and bring them back on a whim.
good,I was with the company for 20 years and experienced all types of people.  The culture is one that some days is magical and others it's trying.  The culture is mixed with those that have been there for years and those beginning their career and not experienced with the corporate culture.  They think everything will be right out of the school books.  Then you have those that have been there for years that don't want to change.  Most enjoyable thing is working with the community with the Disney name backing you.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"One of the coolest places to work in, without any doubt. No fixed dress-code. Work timings are great with 5 days a week. Plus, you get a lot of perks and incentives. Friendly environment."
good,"Loved the people I worked with! That made my job! BUT with any job you have your ups and downs...pay in low, but it is a job you do because you love it. NOT for the money!"
good,"A typical day is very chatty everyone knowns your business wether you like it or not, i learned how to use online chat and Disney's facebook page. "
good,The best part about working for Disney is the opportunity to enjoy the park with your friends and family when you're not working. Wearing a costume at first was my least favorite part but its less laundry and its part of the Show.
good,"I had the chance to learn many new things. My favorite part of my job was to make caramel dipped apples and mickey cake pops!"
good,"In our call center, we supported Magicbands and everything they do. By the time I left, there was an increased amount of pressure and decrease in job satisfiers. "
good,This job gave a great opportunity for travel.  Gave me all required documents for living and working in China.  Most enjoyable part of this job was free time to explore and learn about China
good,"High expectations.  Always set a high bar.  Long hours, but learned a lot.  Fun. Tremendous changes are routine.  Large employee turnover rate."
good,Una vez aprender el protocolo para realizar correctamente el trabajo es muy sencillo y agradable. Hay que ser amable con la gente como en cualquier trabajo cara al público. Ambiente muy bueno entre compañeros y en el trabajo en general.
good,"Working at Walt Disney was challenging and fulfilling as well.  "
good,"Working at Disney is a great experience because there are a lot of different opportunities, including ways to volunteer and participate in extra curricular activities.  A typical day at work for me is providing the best customer service possible to the many guests that visit Magic Kingdom and helping them with any questions they may have, while maintaining good ""show"".  I work in attractions, so a lot of my job is very fast paced and safety critical.  I operate both Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain, perform safety checks, monitor the rides and ensure that everything is running properly and in a timely manner, greet and welcome guests, and act appropriately during medical emergencies.  I have learned a TON about how Disney works as a company inside and out, and I have learned how to be even more open with talking to people and being patient."
good,"While overall a fantastic company to work for, the events department is extremely stressful as clients/Guests are passed on to different departments through the Sales to the Service stage. As a result, Guests can have flawed expectations of type of event they will receive or how it will actually be executed. It takes great partnerships and precise communication to the event staff to successfully pull off events at Disney."
good,"Management and co-workers are all very nice people."
good,"Les personnes travaillant à Disney ne sont pas libre de choisir les horaires de travail en fonction des moyens de transport. Ils doivent se plier au planning. Parfois les transports font grèves, des travaux et les employées doivent se débrouillés pour rentrer chez eux même si c'est pas avant 6h30 du matin, alors qu'ils finissent à 23h. Ce serait sympas de penser un peu aux gens n'ayant pas de moyens de locomotion."
good,Good solid company to work for.  Great training.  Decent benefits.  Within the best pay range for the zoological field.  Great atmosphere to work in.
good,Valoro mucho el ambiente de trabajo.  Hay mucha interrelación entre las áreas que ayuda a la buena comunicación y al buen rendimiento laboral.
good,"-a lot of guest interaction"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,El trabajo puede ser bueno si tienes un equipo de trabajo excelente
good,"Overall, Disney is a great place to work. Co-workers and supervisors are some of the best people I have had the pleasure to work with. "
good,The job was interesting just working by the ocean. only bad thing was that we never had a lunch break. if the employees would've ate then it would've been a lot more productive.
good,"-I never know, build engineer, software product teste or documenting things"
good,"I didn't like working here because I am not a ""Disney"" person but its actually a pretty good job.  Everything is based on seniority so don't expect to get any holidays off the first year or two you work there and don't expect to get weekends off or early shifts regularly for 5+ years. You can always request certain schedules when you need them and the scheduling team always tried to work with me.  The pay is pretty good and advancement is pretty easy to a point but its based on your record so just make sure your attendance doesn't suck.  There are also a bunch of rules on what you can and cant wear and it seems to be a college job for a lot of people so expect to have at least on coworker who is just there to start drama."
good,"Travel sales in a call center for a Walt Disney World vacation.  I feel that I have learned so much from the company as well as out guest on the phone. I loved my job  and enjoyed making people happy. Different management styles, depending on what team you were on."
good,"TWDC is an excellent company to wok for. They continue to make changes to improve the work/life balance. I worked in the same department for several years and built lasting relationships with both internal and external partners. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, and the most enjoyable was the interaction with all levels of management."
good,"Working here usually consists of helping guest that is the main idea of Walt Disney World, I learned all about guest recovery and guest customer service I would say I learned the skills to adhere to any problem or situation a guest would have. The management specifically in my area was not the best, I had tried to reach out to them to further my career and they were semi-helpful. The hardest part of the job is long hours I had to work sometimes until 5 a.m. The most enjoyable part of the job is of course the magic you get to make for guests. It is amazing the people you met and love you feel for the guests after you have helped them and talked to them for a while. Overall this is a great place to work the people I work with made me love my location. The worst thing about the job is the pay rate is not very high for the amount of work you do."
good,"Easy to move up and move around if the talent and drive is present, difficult to challenge authority and process if it's already set in stone. Benefits take time to get (sometimes unfairly obtained), but difficult work can lead to problems with health if you're not careful (easily overworked)."
good,"Sailing on all 4 Disney Cruise Ships"
good,"Good company to work for, hours a little strange but overall good employer"
good,My overall experience working at the Disney store was very positive until I stared going back to school and was not able to be flexible with my hours
good,"A typical day at work involves dealing with a large volume of people, including co-workers, and performing basic food service skills such as: cashing, guest service, and minimal cooking."
good,"Working at Disney Interactive was a fantastic experience and I strongly encourage everyone who is considering to apply to go for it."
good,"Typical day includes constant communication with Brides, Grooms and families via phone and email to create wedding events customized specifically for the couples' wants and needs.  Work with various internal and external vendors to create a flawless experience for the wedding events."
good,"Working for the mouse was fun, but moving up is a a challenge."
good,"School of Life"
good,"I really enjoy working at the Walt Disney Company.  Over the years I've worked in various roles within the company and have come to understand that you don't necessarily work at Disney because of the people, but because you simply love Disney.  Management in some locations are great, while others not so great, it's pretty much luck of the draw.  Co-workers become like your family because you all put up with the same stuff on a daily basis.  But ultimately my favorite thing about the job was being able to make magic for guests."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I generally like my experience here.  If there is an issue, even if it takes a while, managers and higher ups are usually pretty good with responding. "
good,Great company to work for. I have a great pride to work for such a long standing company and what they stand for. I
good,"You meet a lot of people from around the world that are traveling to Downtown Disney. Some are great, some not so much. The pay is standard for a basic retail store. Not too many opportunities for advancement. Good college job but not a career."
good,Disney is a wonderful place to work however there are very few advancement opportunities and not very many places to go.
good,Loved working here got great hours and great benefits. loved that i also got in disneyland for free
good,"I have stayed with the company for fourteen years. The overall company is good to work for, good medical benefits, good pay.  The cast member benefits have changed over the years, some have improved and some have been taken away.  Each department varies with the type of experience each cast member has.  Some departments will help their cast members advance, where it seems that some do not.  I stayed with the company while I finished school, since I am done, I am looking for another position, since it feels that I am not able to advance within my current department."
good,"Established company. Great location, fun environment. Enjoyed meeting new people from all over the world."
good,"Clocked in, cleaned station, helped guests, assisted other staff, stocked the shelves, re-cleaned station, clocked out."
good,"great place to work with a lot of opportunities to learn a multitude of different  trades within one company. vastly diverse culture of employees. get to meat people from just about everywhere in the world. advancement can be slow but possible. Disney tries at least to recognize and hour good and long time employees. over the years most jobs are internships ,college program or foreign exchange, they don't have to pay them as much or give them any real benefits. great if you can get something other than seasonal."
good,"A typical day at work, it is a day where you would smile all day long and have fun at work. The management is great , they make you feel like family member."
good,Coordination with various Functional Departments for smooth execution of the Production schedule 
good,I'ts a good company to work for since it's the number one vacation spot in florida. There's lots you can learn and experience working for this company.
good,lavoro sempre interessante sia per i contenuti sia per le mansioni. Ampio coinvolgimento tra reparti e notevole condivisione con i colleghi di problemi e soluzioni.
good,monitoring store trend and liaise with store manager to understand store performance
good,My favorite Job to date!
good,Learned a lot about the entertainment industry from a very helpful and knowlegeable group of employees. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to be a part of the Disney experience.
good,"Opening team: Responsible for the training and scheduling of cast members within my department, as well as running attractions, handling guest services, providing guest safety, and performing opening and closing procedures. Dispatching of ticketing and attractions manager, technicians. Control of all personnel in and out of the facility, ensuring the security of the cast and of guest."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Good environment and culture, very demanding and in may cases under resourced people wise. Not a lot of career opportunities or promotional opportunities in certain departments but still a great experience!"
good,"Benefits and pay outstanding.  Many roles you can apply for.  You can move from role to role if you find yourself not enjoying role, or to advance.  Lots of locations."
good,"Literally every type of job industry is available in this company. If you start at the bottom and work up, you make less than if you get hired from the outside into a higher level position."
good,"The Entertainment department is hit or miss. Overall, the people are nice and flexible with work/life balance.  There is plenty of opportunity within the company to advance your career if you are ambitious and motivated to do so."
good,"Working as a cast member at the disney store provided me an engaging measure that goes above and beyond with there customer service and priority in enveloping the guests in an almost theatrical quality. Though, retail is still retail and it comes with its cons as well as lower pay quality."
good,Great workplace culture with a collaborative environment where they challenge you to grow your skill regularly and look for opportunities to improve process and procedures
good,"Friendly work environment, great perks including free entry to the parks and guest passes. They are always hiring. If you are willing to work custodial or quick service food and beverage, you are highly likely to get a job."
good,"The Disney College Program is a great way to start your career at The Disneyland Resort. However, if you are accepted into the college program, you are volunteering yourself for 40 hours of work on top of you school obligations."
good,"I worked as a professional intern for Disney for one year and in the College Program for six months. I was so extremely excited both times to have this opportunity, and I really did learn a lot and meet a lot of lifelong friends. However, working for the Mouse isn't all pixie dust and magic. They have very strict policies to follow regarding dress code, social media, timeliness, everything. "
good,"A typical day of work involved being on your A game every day. Every guest that came into our restaurant was to be treated as if they were your own family. This was an extremely difficult job, but with great staff supporting you, and being able to interact with guests, you often forgot you were working."
good,"I have had very good experiences working for Disney with the exception of one manager who had poor management skills with the team."
good,Estar en una empresa como Wlat DisneyCompany es una experiencia inolvidable y enriquecedora a nivel profesional y personal
good,Interesting place to work.  Tons of work to be done.  There are many opportunities for change and growth. A bit disorganized at times.  Informative. As a contractor we seem to be left out of the loop quite a bit to the point of all FTEs attending a meeting during one of our regular meetings and only leaving the contractors left with no knowledge of the the other meeting overriding.  This is frustrating at times.
good,"At disney you have incredible benefits and with the union a very safe job.the only downside to working for disney is the work /home life balance regular schedules are hard to come by and working overtime is pretty common. So if you find your role to be fun you will really enjoy it,but if not this is not a typical 9-5."
good,"Working for the largest entertainment company in the world has its tolls. From the high volume stress of guest safety, to memorable guest experience. Being able to make an positive impact on families vacation is such a rewarding feeling. Is all about retelling the story of the kid inside you to bring those magical experiences  come to life for other guest."
good,"Some days work was really repetitive, but others you couldn't get enough of the atmosphere. We didn't ""do our jobs"" we ""made magic"". The hardest part was being underpaid compared to other departments because of union issues with the company."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney creates a very fun place to work. Everybody has their own role to play. Teamwork is important for success. Interpersonal skills, communication and use of technology are important for success too."
good,Great place to work for a short period of time. Advancement is constant but job promotions don't equal the financial compensation that you should receive with the promotions.
good,"I worked in Disney's Animal Kingdom for a full year on the Disney College Program. Overall, one of the best companies when it comes to training, they prepare you for almost anything that can happen on a normal day. I had leadership that was understanding, and respectful of me as an employee. I could potential work up to 60 hours a week, so the job was demanding, however it was rewarding at the same time."
good,"TWDC is a great company but you have to love what you do to really enjoy your time here.The benefits are great and they have really great perks for their Cast Members. Everyday is a different day which is never a dull moment. Patience is a great quality to have because of the clientele that comes to The Disneyland Resort. The hardest part of the job is having to work around change because it does happen quite often here. Overall, the company is fun and always room for improvement and moving up within the company."
good,"As a host, I greeted people and served their food. Disney is a nice environment. Scheduling was always so easy thanks to the number of people that work for the company! Although you can forget having holidays off and during peak season you could be worked like a dog. Overall a nice experience, I would not mind working for the mouse again!"
good,"Great Place to work at BUT schedule was never consistent, the pay is getting the better but not great, very stressful and professional environment to work for. The best part was being able to make magic to guests. Worst was not a consistent schedule so hard to get a second job."
good,"Working for this corporation, you get absorbed by the culture and spirit of which Disney sets their standard. As one could imagine, they have very strict methods of consumer satisfaction which the entire staff must abide by. This may cause some stress to cast  members, regardless this can very well be the most fun work experience one might have in their professional career."
good,"Working for this company is a hit or miss. Which is kinda sad when you think about it, since its supposedly the happiest place on earth. Joking a side it is a nice place to work when it's not a rush hour. You make friends and people are willing to help/work with you. Just know that all rules must be known and read."
good,"Great company in general, but very much depends on the team. Teams can vary from awesome to horrible. Company prefers to hire contractors. Way too many contractors."
good,Theres no place on earth like working for the Disney Company. Truly not a job but a home away from home. Everyone is family there and your treated as such. For most big companies you can feel like just a number to that Company but not at Disney the truly care about each cast member.
good,"My schedule was typically about 40-50 hours/week and I volunteered to trade for different work locations around property"
good,I absolutely love everything about the job. The work environment was magicial as expected and quick paced as I like. I went as an intern and only disliked my experience because of roommates.
good,I was a College Program cast member and they over work and under pay. If you're just the average cast member they don't give you too many hours and it seems like a cool job. The problem is the college kids were only paid $10 an hour while all their coworkers are paid much more. We also usually worked between 40-50 hours a week while most other cast members only worked 10-20.
good,"The college program was definitely a rewarding experience. However, sometimes the workload was distributed unfairly at times. when addressing this to management, it was obvious that they didn't care."
good,A lot of hard work goes into working for the Disney Company especially at the parks. It is not for the faint of heart. It is great to be able to get into the parks for free though. It as also awesome to do magic moments to help out families have a wonderful vacation.
good,Disneyland was a great experience for me overall. It provided me with critical customer service experiences. And the lead role provided me with managing experience.
good,You definitely need a thick shell in order to work attractions. You are expected to create a memorable experience for guests and they will take out their frustrations from other departments on you.
good,"Too many rooms to clean properly for the amount of time given. Do not send you help if needed, was told they hope I have friends. I would not recommend housekeeping to any one, but a lot of people love working at the parks. The restaurants seem to be ok to work for also.The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the kids faces when they came back to room and saw animals I made for them."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I loved working here but sadly I was only a contractor. The managers are great and the employees are just amazing people. I only wish they had more options to join the company.
good,"Working at Walt Disney World can be as good as you make  it. If you internalize ""making the magic"" it can be the best job ever and you can spend your life working for the mouse. However, if you want to grow in the company or learn more than just your current role, that makes the magic run out. Disney does not like to move people, they would prefer it if all 72,000 employees stayed in their role for the rest of time."
good,"-The Culture for Costumer Service is very good. It is a permanent "
good,"Working for Disney is a very engaging, collaborative environment.  I learned a lot as an Intern, as I was able to soak in what was going on, and how the organization operated.  Management was pretty competent, and they knew how to treat their employees day to day with dignity.  "
good,"Loved the people and work. Gets very busy during the busiest season, requires a lot of team building and organization. A lot of different opportunities for cast members."
good,"Although working at Disney was something that I will always cherish, there were a few complaints I had with the internship program I participated in. I was well aware that I was an intern, however, even interns deserve to be treated with the same respect as other employees at this establishment."
good,I would clock in.  There was a meeting at the beginning of the day.  We would arrive at the workplace and have a small breakfast break and immediately we would start to clean the rooms assigned to us. Then we would take a half an hour break for lunch.  I enjoyed because I met many people that was the most enjoyable part of the job. It was stressful when the supervisors arrived unannounced.
good,"Excellent place enjoyed the work, but advancement past hourly nearly impossible. Hourly employees can not make a living. Great experiences and people met."
good,"Working for Disney is fun, but you could be there awhile in you wish to climb the ladder. The pay isn't the greatest, but the culture is very fun and hard to leave."
good,"Started with the Disney College Program, and stayed on after the program ended. It was a very educational experience to work alongside so many different people of diverse backgrounds, and to assist hundreds of guests on a daily basis. While I can't say this is a perfect work environment, you certainly receive what you put into it, as there are many opportunities to network, advance, and learn more about practically any line of business at the Walt Disney Company."
good,"Really difficult to work full-time or get a position outside of the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The great thing is there is transfer opportunities, but It seems that those that have done the college program and do the same jobs as other cast members have better opportunities with the company."
good,"Cast members are the best, people treat each other fair. I did however get yelled at by guests a lot due to the requirement of height checks and asking them to walk around the park by following the one way path while the fireworks were preforming."
good,"A typical day for at work is started by checking calendar for the meetings of the day and planning both where to be and when to be there along with determining what information to gather. Next is checking email for any high priority emails from key individuals and determining what action items are required for those emails. If there are new requests from the BU then I will begin to look at those requests to see what work will be required to complete these requests. Lastly, I will scan through the emails for any unusual notices or requests for information. Through a regimented process I have learn the basics of time management and I have developed some useful organizational skills. The rest of the day is typically spend responding to emailed or verbal requests for information and fulfilling the BU requests. On designated days, There will be time allocated to direct communication to and with key individuals within the BU to better understand their current and upcoming needs and wants, also to provide status on the active projects or to discuss any potential blockers or issues.  The most difficult part of this job is trying to balance the challenging needs of the BU with the amount of process that is now required to do the job. Usually when the BU comes to me to let me know that they need something, they usually needed it last week, not next week. Managing expectations in all directions can be a bit of a challenge at times.  Learning about new or different technologies and how they are applied to achieve real world goals is interesting."
good,"Great experience as an intern, however it would be difficult to work here full time with the salary compared to cost of living in the area.  Supportive cast members and management."
good,They have lots of fun activities for cast members to do to help break up the stress of the job but it is still a stressful job.  I loved helping guests make their dreams come true.
good,It was a happy place but more money driven than customer service oriented. There were days they offered overtime as an option but most of the time it was not offered.
good,"On a normal workday, you can either deal with massive headaches to a relaxing day. I learned how to take care of employees and guest on a day to day basis. The management at this location is great, but I had questions about other location. it is a very diverse work environment. the hardest part of the day is having to take care of guest that won't listen to you trying to help them. the most enjoyable part is the cast you work with, without them the days really drag."
good,"Consumer-focused company with a lot of great perks, but can be a demanding and high-pressure environment and expectations are set high.  Can be tough to advance unless someone vacates the role and you are selected to fill it."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"You work long hours, sweat all day and your feet kill you after a few hours... but none of that matters when you see a 5yr old or 75yr old having the time of their life. Getting to go to Disney is a privilege many families do not get to have, and when they finally make it there, you can see the excitement and pure joy in their eyes. An it's all thanks to those who work there."
good,A typical day in the theater for wardrobe require you to be organized and a problem solver.  Preparation for each show starts early in the day and is usually a team effort.
good,"Great place to learn and start a career. Majority of employees are contracted, which stinks for full-time work. If you want benefits you have to be an executive."
good,If you love Disney World you will love working for them. The hours can be crazy at times. some weeks you will hardley see your family. But the benefits are amazing.
good,Disney outputs a great product but jobs are so silo-ed that the responsibilities become very confined and little upward mobility. The quality of the management team is great but underutilized. Plenty of analysis done with little action taken.
good,"Both in America and overseas, Disney cares about its ""cast members"".  It's a ""happy"" ""magical"" company that shares that magic with its customers. I would recommend Disney to others."
good,"It's fun and fulfilling on a personal level, but not a financial level. The benefits included free admission to the Disney parks, which is awesome. But again, you can't make a living on this job. It has to be a second job."
good,"its a great place for retire ,students or partimeres I enjoyed my employment meet a lot to different people and just had fun at my job, at time it can be a little overwhelming but once you live some one that magical moment that they did not expect its well worth it"
good,Try and set goals for yourself to make the most of the internship. It can be tiring and hours are long but the people are great and help make the day/night shifts worth it.
good,"Awesome Opportunity "
good,"They are a good company to work for, if you get benefits. There is too much drama and politics and the pay isn't spectacular, to be honest. I do miss the people(fellow cast), but not the management in general. It seems the higher up you go, the snobbier they get. Most(not all, mind you) managers could care less if you lived or died. You are a number. BUT, to the fellow cast and guests, MAGIC can be found!"
good,While a member of the Disney College Program I worked on the attraction Star Tours.  It was extremely fast-passed but still a fun place to be.  My fellow cast members were awesome and really nice.
good,"The overall company culture and benefits made it an extremely enjoyable job that I looked forward to going to. However, they disregarded the fact that I was a full time student and continually scheduled me during classes."
good,"Lots of great people, but yet I've seen lots let go!  Like all companies, it depends on where you are working for fun and advancement.  I've seen a lot of departments that had to stay flat in costs from the last year.  The key here is that so many people in this world want to work for the company, and the company knows this.  Pay reflects, and they promote the other benefits to lesson the blow.  The best part is the proudness and awareness of saying you work for the company.  Immediate awareness and instant conversations anywhere you are.  The bad part is that outside candidates look more desirable than internal candidates in openings and opportunities.  Best to prove yourself and be sought after."
good,"If you don't enjoy Disney, don't bother applying. Its an absolute must for them, trivia is part of your interview. If you get hired, its extremely competitive to move up. Working with people who have an obvious interest as you, makes it easy to work together. Relaxed as long as you were diligent about helping customers and making it the best experience one could for them. Stressful during holidays while trying to keep the shelves stocked. Generally a really fun and exciting place to work."
good,"It was very fun to be apart of the magic and work at Disney. The only downsides were that it is very impersonal. You don't really know your managers or who schedules you, you switch around where you work so you are constantly working with different people. I am sure after a bit of time you will get to know everyone but due to it being so corporate you don't really know the people above you. It was fun to serve guests and provide a good experience with ordering food."
good,"The Disney College Program granted me an opportunity of a lifetime. A typical day at work consisted of serving guests at the resort by various means, such as ensuring the dining area is well maintained, serve quality food and making sure the guests have that Disney magical experience. In my case, answering questions about the various Disney Dining plans that were available, food recommendations and assisting with food allergies were a part of that experience. I learned about the four keys that Disney employs for the best guest experience possible: Safety, Courtesy, Show, and Efficiency. These keys built a mindset that revolved around optimal guest experience, including performing the role of a concept artist with food. As for those in management, they were overall fair and encouraged us to do a good day's work. In addition, they were always available to assist us in situations where I needed their help. The workplace culture was one of collaboration. Teamwork was the only way we can serve the guests the best we could. There was never a moment I felt like I could not ask for help from my fellow cast members. The hardest part of the job was the constant movement and lifting of objects that it required. There was rarely a moment to rest, so often I would become exhausted with the workload. However, what makes the hardest part of the job worth it is when you have the one guest who deeply appreciates all help that you gave them. Usually, they came in the form of a genuine smile and ""thank you"". Overall, this was a worthwhile experience that I recommend to anyone who is looking to"
good,"Há uma grande preocupação e respeito pelo consumidor final. "
good,"Fun place to work if you love Disney.  Hard to grow within the company as people never seem to leave. Great internal programs for employees, such as mentoring programs, and brown-bag lunch meetings."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Lavoro stimolante. Grande spirito di collaborazione da parte di tutti i ballerini.
good,"Working at home as a Disney customer service representative was flexible and fun. We logged into the software/website and took inbound calls to help customers make reservations or change existing reservations. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to people from all over the world, and a few times I had to talk through an interpreter. The hardest part of the job was  having to make changes to reservations that sometimes resulted in the customer not being as happy at a different resort or with a different package."
good,I learned a lot about the Disney company that I would have not anticipated when applying for the job within the college program. Cast members are generally extremely underpaid and not well-respected. The manual labor was the most intense part of the job. What I learned most about working there (and how I benefitted later) was my customer service skills. Working for Disney puts you extremely out of your comfort zone and become a leader in many ways. I loved making magic for families everyday when I can and being someone who could make their day with even the smallest of acts.
good,Bonne expérience pour débuter ma reconversion professionnelles.
good,"Good work life balance with work from home options."
good,"I was happy to have spent a year with the Walt Disney Company in Orlando for a year! Knowing it was a 1 year assignment going in, I am not disappointed that the experience came to an end. I learned an awful lot about service and 'customer service' in particular. Understanding and executing the Disney service best practices will benefit me at every stage of my career!"
good,If you like the Disney magic and atmosphere this is the place to work at to start your career. It is best to start at a young age or have management experience.
good,Entreprise qui prime l'excellence chez ses employés. Beaucoup d'autonomie.
good,"Working on services utilized by the enterprise that impact all Disney segments, guests, fans and viewers was very unique and challenging.  Teams are very well supported to continually improve and provide cost effective features and processes.  Turnover a bit problematic as knowledge investment is threatened due to contractor pool and temporary full time positions (project hires) are finite in assignment length."
good,I worked for Disney as a paid college intern. I learned so much working there. This job really taught me all about customer service and what it really meant to be a team player. I would never take back the amazing work experience and memories I made there.
good,"Worked in several areas at this company. Managers and leads were fun and caring. But some of the directors did a lot of favoritism at some of the departments. A few directors had controlling personalties and a too proud attitude. Somewhat of a I""m better than you personality. All in all, I do reccomed"
good,Love working here the only downfall is that i have to work upwards 60 hours a week to afford my bills. Yes the benefits are wonderful but working so much i rarely get to use them. It can be stressful at times when it is busy.
good,"I met people from all around the world at Disneyland Resort, and it gave me a great sense of understanding and compassion for those around me. It's a lot of fun to work with friends every day in an environment that is all about making magic."
good,"Being a busser/steward at The Walt Disney Company was very easy, as you are only expected to do your job. Almost all of your coworkers are fun to work with as well."
good,My only wish is that management would support the cast more often than giving the guests everything they requested. It was all too commonplace to see a cast member verbally assaulted by a guest with a manager standing nearby doing nothing.
good,"Disney English required me to have teaching experience to earn a Visa, but not experience teaching English as a foreign language. I am very grateful of their training program, but it can be stressful teaching in this new field without a good support system."
good,"Company culture, training, resources and job perks are fantastic.  "
good,"Fantasies of fun! Managers good but make one small mistake and you're out the door.  Good location, but everyone is situated on top of each other, too noisy."
good,"Having worked in the parks and an office, they are two different worlds. The parks can be very demanding and I feel it is harder to progress with the company unless you know the right people. However, when I transferred jobs and was at an office it was much easier to progress within the company because it seemed more focused on your performance versus who you know."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Good Place to learn and build on skills. Many positions that are available to advance in other areas. I would recommend to look at the career site and get an idea if the job fit your skills before you apply.
good,"équipe agréable, très bonne ambiance de travail,  bien que très agité en période de fêtes."
good,"Disney is a pretty good company to work for. They have snacks and throw parties for the office when a new release comes out. Since Disney is an older and well established company, there are definitely corporate politics. Much like most entertainment companies, Disney can be very volatile with a good amount of layoffs."
good,"Disney Interactive is a fun and creative environment. Loads of interaction with numerous departments within the company, providing exposure and insight to the Walt Disney Company as a whole."
good,I was an intern in the Disney College Program. The work is not unreasonable and it provides an opportunity to learn and apply transferable job skills. There is opportunity to advance even from a blue collar entry level position.
good,"The company is great for networking and meeting new people. It can be physically and mentally draining at times, but the workplace culture greatly makes up for it."
good,"You are compensated well, and hours are always available. However work life balance does not exist and management is generally cut throat and terrible."
good,"El clima laboral en TWDC es excelente. Se trabaja en equipo y existe respeto y cooperación entre los colaboradores de la empresa."
good,"Fun yet, very busy place to work for. Although there a few weeks in the year that are slow season. Monday's were quite busy. Clients call to pay their dues on Monday for some reason. Coworkers are friendly enough, but very much Disney fanatics. Managers are hands on, when available. They had mandatory overtime during peak times, which is basically 9 months out of the year. This was seen as good and bad. Extra pay check, but very tiring and making plans after work were barely possibly."
good,Great company to work for. Advancement available for those who show great work ethic. I advanced after 4 months to restaurant supervisor. Great hours if you're not going to college.
good,"Work virtually"
good,Wages tend to be a little low but the company has great core values and there is a ton of opportunity for advancement. Work hard and follow the guidance of your manager and you can get ahead fairly quickly.
good,Good Working Experience with the Team. Acquired lot of knowledge during the work process. Well established Circumstances to work with the different Teams. Indulges in different Activities after the working hours with the Mates.
good,The day will start as typical as other jobs with only employees running to start the new day. As a park greater you are the first faces that the guest will see. It could be a little overwhelming sometimes when they ask you so many questions at once.
good,"TWDC is a good company to work.  It may take some time to understand the working culture, but once you do - you are there for life!"
good,Great discounts at stores/parks.  Holiday set ups were fun especially during Halloween season. Was literally a magical experience
good,"selling toys and items from the shop, learnt customer service skills and cash handling whilst working on the till, the management was good and they had a structured team, the co-workers were great people to be around, hardest part of the job would have to be constant work when busy, it was non stop at times and the most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting many new great people"
good,"What a great experience working for Disney.  They are known for their world class service... and they training you receive on how to have that level of service with every encounter, is worth every sacrifice I made to work here.  The benefits are pretty good, the perks are amazing."
good,"A day at The Walt Disney Company is challenging."
good,"Totally out of this world, a magical place where all cultures come together to be one, each and every day brought a change to my professional life. Excellent guest service was my core role amking sure that everyone felt safe and welcomed. team work was equally essential hence the need to work on the gift of language or communication. the hardest part of the job was language barrier but always had to find a way to assist everyone."
good,"y'a une bonne entente entre les collègues ."
good,typical day at work is planning fun activities for children. I learned time-management and organization skills. Management team needs consistency. My coworkers are hard working and fun individuals. Lock of time is always a challenge for completing paperwork on time. most enjoyable part is interacting with children and parents.
good,"I have learned a great deal through the Disney Storytelling Workshop, producing high quality content for various stories is something that has taught me many things."
good,"Overall, working for Disney provided was quite the experience. It was a wonderful opportunity to have; however, would have enjoyed more compensation than was given. Other than, I enjoyed my time and reveled in seeing the ""behind the scenes"" Disney."
good,It is a highly recommended place to work. The work environment is beautiful and workers are treated with respect and dignity.
good,"Disney Interactive was a very fun and productive workplace that came with a game room. All of the Testers, Lead Testers and Supervisors were very helpful when it came down to working on projects together as a team. There was no question that wasn't answered. Plus at Disney everyone believes in team work. When it was time to have my break or lunch I had a big game room to enjoy and release some stress."
good,"Blizzard coworkers are like family and you will not find a place that you can be closer to the people around you. Hardest part of job is staying attentive and not getting mad at guests, but overall I enjoy dealing with people there."
good,The role itself had time sensitive deadlines daily since we worked with the East Coast.  Commercial paper would have to be traded before the stock market closed.  I definitely learned a lot about Disney's Accounts and how to invest money so that it does not stay in the bank over night.  The job was difficult but the people and the company perks make it all worth it.
good,"So many new products and people to work with every day. I love  guest service and making customers happy, and management proud."
good,Working at the Resort was definitely a fun time in my life but it also was my very life. The schedules are so wacky that you could be working all morning shifts one week and then graveyard shifts the next. There was no consistency whatsoever. Job security looked good for those who put the effort and attention in. Very nice management team who really puts on the appearance of caring.
good,"It always depends on what area you are in.  Managers move around a lot, and they don't care about you too much.  Cast members are EASILY replaceable."
good,"aprendí a controlar una pequeña tienda, a tener un buen trato con las personas, a desarrollar distintas habilidades como decorar la  tienda, aprendí hacer inventarios dentro de otras cosas. La parte mas difícil del  trabajo era el horario de colación ya que teníamos que almorzar dentro de la tienda. Lo que mas me gusto fue el poder compartir con  distintos tipos de personas. En la tienda eramos dos personas las que  atendíamos lo cual lo hacia mas entretenido y con horarios mas flexibles."
good,"Ambiente di lavoro stimolante e flessibile "
good,"Disney is a great place to work as a retiree or intern. You get thrown in a melting-pot of personality and culture that you can really grow from. The pay isn't the greatest, but Disney opens a lot of doors for future opportunity."
good,Operational & technical phases of television for domestic and/or international production.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"overall, not bad, but everyone I cooperated with had the same complain- work is too intense at times, but the salary doesn't go up(("
good,"weekends required, no room for growth in this department."
good,"i learnt to adapt myself very fast in a new environment and a new country."
good,"Though it is called ""The Happiest Place on Earth"", the Disneyland Resort would not be able to say that without its employees. It was not an easy job, as most people assume it is. "
good,I picked and packed items from invoices for customers who ordered merchandise online.
good,"(Only College Program Intern to be promoted to the position of General Teller)"
good,"Depends on where you work and the people you work with. Both times I worked there I feel two different ways about it. The first time I was in Housekeeping, it was a lot of hard work but the pay was nice. The second time I was in attractions, it was really laid back but the pay wasn't all that great. "
good,"This is a center for Disney employees, so you do get some benefits like main gate pass and comp tickets 3 times a year, but that is it. Since the company that runs the center is owned by Walgreens you do get discounts to other companies as well. You are not considered a Disney employee. Pay is good. Management is nice along with everyone else that works there. Does have growing pains, but I do enjoy working there. Problem is, if Disney decides not to renew contract you are out of a job."
good,"Everyone is going to have a different experience when they get a job at Disney: some hire in because they love Disneyland and others will be there just because it pays them and was the only place that called them back."
good,Great place to gain some experience.  Hard to move up the chain until someone above moves along.
good,Trabajar en Disney es muy gratificante e interesante por que cada día es diferente.
good,"Enjoyed working for the happiest place on earth, as far as co-workers they weren't always so happy. I loved meeting new people from all over the world and constantly had people coming up to me for help and just loved to help them and see how happy they were when I did. I constantly got complements about how well mannered, and respectful, and helpful I am."
good,I work in an inbound reservations call center where I  take calls for guests wanting to visit the Disneyland resort.  I've learned that providing great customer service should always be a priority and that one needs to be their best for each guest every time. I enjoy working with my fellow cast members.  I believe that the most difficult part of my job is taking a call for a guest that wants to visit the happiest place on earth because it will most likely be their last.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to help make magic in their vacation plans to see Mickey Mouse.
good,"Great job for a high schooler or first job while in high school/ college, not great for full time"
good,Every segment of entertainment that you ever cared to work for. This company has something for everyone.
good,I like to work the training was great but the downfall was the pay rate.
good,"Its a great job if you like to be busy every hour of the day. Whether you are in the back handling shipment or on the stage floor restocking the shelves, you cant help but feel like an important worker Bee in a small hive. With co-workers and managers always friendly and having employee discounts on everything in the store, what more could you ask for?"
good,"Overall this was probably the best experience of my life. You learn so much about one of the best company's known to man in the world. Yes, I can say that the pay and hours weren't ideal but the friends and experiences you get out of it are worth it."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"-No day is every the same"
good,"Good, stable work environment.  Decent pay but not great by any means.  Benefits are great and they are very flexible when it comes to scheduling.  Its great getting to meet people from around the world that are excited to come to Disneyland! "
good,Very professional enviornment.   Networking across the various segments of the company is a plus.
good,"Disney is a nice place to work, but the advancement potential is low."
good,journée longue mais agréable
good,I learned a lot from this company. The compant took great care for my family and well being. Could have been managed better on a local level.
good,"I was able to establish good customer contacts, through good product knowledge and excellent customer service."
good,"Fun workplace, Foosball table and free drinks , learned about Disney products and culture. On typical day i would get there get a drink and walk to my desk. The project lead would then tell us what we needed to work on today. From there i would start working on my assignment. The assignment would change from day to day. the coworkers were a lot of fun we all had a sense of humor and we got along."
good,Great company brand.
good,"Loved most of my time at Disney Interactive. Smart, passionate people working on projects featuring the most beloved characters and properties in the world at a company that values its employees and provides solid benefits and fair compensation for work well done. My only criticisms are that over the years we had transitioned to senior leadership without strong communication skills and who believed that the path to profitability would be led by extreme cuts to resources and acquisitions that seemed to have little to offer to the Disney brand."
good,"The day was very busy and always hard work, but overall new skills were constantly developed. I do feel there could have been a better focus on personal development in various tasks for individuals who needed more training."
good,This is a magical place where you are able to make someone's dreams come true.
good,"its a very busy work environment, fast paced. stock runners are not given enough time to complete the ammount of stores that they are given."
good,I enjoyed working for the Walt Disney Company very much. The company is very family-oriented and provided me with ample opportunities to grow my strenghts and contributions.
good,"Good Place to work. Management was a bit disorganized and not always present in the office.  But, my peers were hard-working and intelligent. Sometimes management6 failed to keep us busy."
good,"Excellent company"
good,"I enjoyed working for The Walt Disney Company as each day consisted of making magic for guests, but we were overworked and not properly compensated. As a participant of the college program, I was not paid a livable wage with the high cost of the provided housing. Nonetheless, the job itself does balance out the lack of benefits."
good,Really enjoy my time working at The Walt Disney Company. There is so much IP that touches so many people in magical ways. It is wonderful to be a part of that.
good,"Your h Urs are set, schedule is set.  Make those marks, it is a call center environment. Typical office environment. Fun experiences to do for knowledge"
good,"If you are looking to advance your skills in Hospitality, then there is no better place then the Walt Disney Company.  The skills you learn fro Disney, will be with you for life."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,You can make friends easily there with co workers but after a while you see it is a bit cliquey and people tend to stay close to whoever was hired around the same time they were. When I left the management was amazing but the system was very cut throat not a lot of room for errors. Since leaving I know they have changed both management and the system.
good,"It is a hard job, but very rewarding at times. It is a fast-paced work environment. There is little opportunity to grow within the company. It is a company driven by guest service."
good,Enjoyed my time here.  Overall a pleasant work environment.  Lots of diversity.  Benefits are very good in comparison to other companies.  Time off and flexibility very good.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking a character designer's rough drawing and building it in Maya, adding materials and lighting, then over to Photoshop for textures and facial features. I was pushing the boundaries of what the 2D artists were doing by using Maya as an illustration and visualization tool. The art director really appreciated me going the extra mile. On the whole, management was pretty cool, though this industry can get very political and clicky if you're in with the wrong crowd. Overall, I found the studio a fun and enjoyable atmosphere, with very talented and friendly people. The hardest part of the job was putting my best work in while learning new software that was not really part of my job description, but I felt I had to learn it to be competitive. The most enjoyable moments were seeing my efforts on screen and of course, winning a game of ping pong."
good,"As an executive, I was afforded good benefits and I enjoyed leading a large group of experts in support of all Disney's Enterprise Data Center Facilities."
good,It always fills my heart with joy seeing how happy people are when they come into the parks. I will always remember leaving work with a smile on my face.
good,"Disney is a great place to learn and for some, to live out their career as there are so many areas of Disney that transferring and trying new things is possible. At the end of the day it's a HUGE corporation and you are easily replaced. I wouldn't change my time with Disney, I loved it and learned so much but I don't think I would ever go back."
good,I really liked working there. They have really great benefits considering how expensive it is to go to Disneyland. Most people who work there are very friendly and supportive.
good,"Pay is minimum wage but the benefits are what make working for the Walt Disney company for me. 20% off most food and merchandise and a special store where we can buy very discounted merch that was on overstock called company D. 16 sign ins a year plus two complimentary tickets and we can get ourselves into any of the Disney parks(except Tokyo) almost ant day of the year. The main reason I work here is for the Aspire program, which most people do not take advantage if. Disney pats for up front a bachelors and a masters degree and all of your books through Guild education."
good,"The company creates amazing content to leverage for licensing. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are seeing the families coming into the store to shop and seeing their faces every time they first walk into the store. Every child that walks into the store always comes in with a big smile on their face and are full of excitement and energy and their parents are also coming in with smiles and are happy to see their kids so excited.
good,"I have never worked for a company that had such a great company culture as this one.  Training was very fun and you will probably never experience anything like it. We spent a day per park and hotel to discuss everything and anything about it to ensure we were well aware of what Disney had to offer to their guests. Then you spend a couple weeks in a classroom environment to fill in the blanks.  Lots of perks of working for disney but even more for the Walt Disney Travel company.  It is a high volume call center so you do have to take calls back to back however disney focuses on customer service and the ""magic"" that guests experience so they tend to be happier than most call centers customers. Schedules are a little chaotic and inconsistent.  All based off seniority.  It can be difficult if your trying to balance school or a family.  Benefits are terrible."
good,"Good Work/Life Balance and Compensation/Benefits"
good,"Overall I've been having a good experience.  Aside from some stress from the workload, the benefits and the culture at times is rewarding.  I just hope for more diversity within the team leaders."
good,"It was a good place to work, however there was not room to growth and there was a lot of work place politics in play and after working there for 20 years it was time to move on."
good,New and different guest everyday.  Great Place to Work. New and exciting. Helping Guest to enhance there experience by make sure that my help would make the quality better
good,"You're expected to know your role when training ends, and you should. You're given more than enough training to get it down right and trainers stay with you for the first few days to answer questions or help with strange experiences, they'll also quiz you to make sure you pay attention."
good,"After being with the company for 6+ years I left knowing the only way to move up was to become a manager and I did not want that. A typical day would be to park in the cast parking lot, walk a half mile into work, be in hot weather for hours at a time, be harassed by tourists, work late and do it all again the next day."
good,"Fun and greet customers"
good,A company with great benefits and room for growth.  Challenging at times because of the fast pace environment.  Talented and knowledgeable employees.  Amazing resources and access to innovation.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Not what I expected, but learned a lot. Disney isn't as magical as they all say, but it is definitely a once in a lifetime company to work for. I suggest to work here if you are a fan of Disney."
good,"I believe their is plenty of opportunity to grow, some departments can be a bit qlicky and seem like college or high school all over again but if you focus on your goals and seek out other cast members to help you, those goals can definitely be achieved. I’d say the pay is better but some departments still have older contracts and get paid a lot less than others. Schedules are decent but it is union so hours can be slim at times and vice versa to where they can conflict with your schedule. All in all working here can be a blast and meeting so many new people is an awesome experience. Lots of Disney perks."
good,"There is so much passion for the brand, there really is no other place like working for the Walt Disney Company.  We all are (were) there to help keep Walt's dream alive. You can feel and see it throughout the workplace, whether you were in the office, out at the parks/hotels, or in the stores."
good,"Collaboration is a big key when working with Disney. You can make great friends out of it and get your hands on great and big projects."
good,Walt Disney Company brings happiness and joy to many families and children. The workplace culture is amazing very positive. There is no hard part to my job I enjoy everything about from opening to the interaction of the guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is waving to the guest and making them smile.
good,Quick paced with an average of 8 working hours per day. The culture of Disney is world renowned and the compensation is adequate. Learn a lot of customer service and collaboration.
good,"I started off in basic retail in Disneyland and eventually moved up to a special role for visual merchandising. My coworkers were basically my life source when working there. I made life-long friends working there and enjoyed perks on my own, with friends, and with family."
good,"-Overworked and under appreciated"
good,Not a bad place to work but not a forever job unless you plan to move up within the company. It is a very fun atmosphere to work in but also stressful.
good,"It all depends on where you are in the company and your team, and it's such a large company that it varies, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. There are great benefits to being in such a large company, with the downside that it's easy to get lost or miss opportunities for advancement. Like anything else, it's what you make of it - but I have very fond memories of my years at the Walt Disney Company."
good,Great company to work for! Every bit as fun as you'd expect from Disney. Everyone is expected to pull their weight (as it should be). There were organizational changes very frequently and often caused a lot of anxiety amongst everyone not in the know (which is most of the staff).
good,"This company helped me find what I'm passionate for to keep working towards, as well as enhancing my work/people skills. They care a great deal with owning Guest situations and helping you use your resources to enhance Gues interactions."
good,"Helping Walt Disney company understand the requirement of the market and the demands of the customers."
good,I really did enjoy my job there and I never intended on leaving what they lack in pay they make up for in benefits. u have your options if u take them!
good,The walt Disney Company is a great work environment
good,As a Contractor I will not recommend it. Too much job insecurity. There is not training process in place but they expect you to learn on the fly. My Disney management PM was awesome.
good,The culture is like no other. Your co-workers will become your family but the pay is ludicrously low for what you have to put up with. Management is terrible. They almost never have the cast member's back. Which is why your co-workers turn into your family. You rely on them for emotional support because you won't get it from your managers. The guests will use any excuse to tell you that you personally ruined their vacation and you have to deal with all of it for a dollar over minimum wage
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I enjoyed working at WDW. A large portion of their workforce is college interns, most of which aren't reliable in showing up to their shifts and don't work very hard, but the retirees who pick up shifts at your location make it enjoyable. No benefits as a full-time worker, but it is pretty easy to trade/give away shifts if you need off and getting into the parks for free is an amazing perk."
good,Walt Disney world is a fun and comfortable place to work. A relaxed environment filled with happy co workers and managers. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the guests.
good,You typically expect it to be a stressful environment based off of the high maintenance required. It really is not when you enjoy the culture of Disney.
good,The management team was absolutely terrible but working there was amazing. Every day I got to go to work to make people laugh and smile and feel things. I got to have fun. It was when management decided they wanted to change things when it was a bad place to work.
good,From the classroom door in was a pleasant work environment.  Unfortunately the center director was under qualified and made the teachers idea's her own.
good,Professionisti con la P maiuscola che rendono giustizia al nome dell'azienda.
good,"Great peers, great management, wonderful working environment, opportunities are endless."
good,There are so many sections of the company and so many people with opportunities but those doors rarely open as people stay in the same role for a long time! Which is great for a company but hard for the young people that start in the company as it is hard to move around to something you might want to do.
good,Disney is a great company to work for and rewards its employees on a performance basis. It has a very team oriented company culture with lots of team building activities.
good,"I've only worked there during the winter season after high school and it was fun.  It was a good place to start learning about sales since it was the store that I have worked in, not the park so I guess it didn't really carry the stress.  The two managers that I have worked with at that time were great and I was asked to consider staying and working there."
good,"It is truly physically demanding, a place where you need to be your cheeriest self no matter what is going on behind the curtains. Mid management do their best to keep Cast Members from crushing under pressure and to ensure everyone gets at least enough hours to go by, altho this is not always possible. If you need to fully support yourself or a family, this is only a second job type of employment since income is not steady."
good,I had a productive period of my career at Walt Disney World.  Met a lot of good people and established my career foundation with this company.  Would like to come back one day.
good,"While, working for Disney World is not nearly as glamorous as visiting as a guest, the joy you get to bring to those visiting makes it all worth the while."
good,"Travailler pour Disney c'est travailler pour Mickey et véhiculer aux clients l'esprit de la magie de l'entreprise. C'est être positif et vivre au pays des rêves."
good,Great benefits and perks. Pay not the greatest. High expectations for quality of work. Similar jobs at other companies all pay more. Large company with difficulty changing roles.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"- a typical day would be a team meeting in the morning to understand what everyone is working on and deadlines. Then alternate between brainstorming meetings and working at our desks to get actual work done."
good,Over my almost 20 years with the company I loved almost all of it. The cast members (employees) is what makes this place so special. We have the ability to make dreams come true on a daily basis and see it first hand. 
good,I usually start my day obtaining my equipment to check for any issues while I listen to the meetings that inform us of what is happening throughout the day. I normally know where I am going to be standing at to take the pictures and what I need to be aware of when around that location like the Main Street vehicles or times where it is crowded. We are trained to look at where we step and it is necessary to understand it because I might step on something that could make me trip or step on other people's items. We also need to know the entire park since we are everywhere and people know that we know more than the rest of the cast. We talk a lot wherever we are and we deal with guest issues and recovery almost all the time.
good,A fast paced and challenging environment but the co workers made it pleasurable to be in that environment. The office is adequately staffed with very competent customer service representatives.The management style can be viewed as satisfactory as far as giving out work assignments. Advancing to be part of the office management needs to be more inclusively and less cliquish.
good,"Training for task not necessarily suited to your skill set...you are put into a position where needed, not where you desire. Management does not share info between shifts, limited pay and overtime, shift bids keep you on a shift for months/years"
good,"Great career opportunities, potential for advances. Terrible managers at the location I was at. Very fasted paced at all hours mostly worked late nights"
good,"This is a great company if it's your first job or your pre / post retirement job.  In the interim you will need a second income just to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of living in California. If you can do this, you will like the company."
good,"I worked at the Walt Disney World Company in Orlando, Fl. for over 25 years and was a bartender for over 20 of those years. What a great honor and privilege it was to serve people from all walks of life, from all over the world. I worked for the number one tourist destination and had the opportunity to learn and grow with some amazing leaders and fellow cast members."
good,"Good company to work for, great people, culture, and leadership. Worked as a contractor, however the full time retention rate is very high. Would love to work for the company again."
good,"I enjoyed my 20 year career at TWDS but was laid off before I was old enough to retire.  They do this frequently and replace the experienced employees with younger, cheaper employees."
good,"If you love Disney, you would love working for them! It is a wonderful and fun company to work for with great benefits. When you work for Disney it is not just a job it is a lifestyle."
good,"Really fun and vibrant place to work. Great fun working with children although can be manic and hard work at times, especially on busy days. Staff discount is good, especially handy if you have children."
good,"working for the company allowed me to make a small, but touching, difference in the lives of families and kids. Becoming part of their experience was truly fulfilling and my favorite aspect of my time there."
good,"Loved my time working for Disney, and I would truly like to return some day.  I left for a non profit position that seemed right at the time.  The team also went through some major changes during my time, but I still value my time with the company."
good,"Working in parks and resorts can have a good amount of waves of growth and then shrinking business, depending on the economy and factors within the company.  Training and management philosophies are strong.  Sometimes development is lacking, but the culture is positive and supportive.  The company is very professional, though the compensation is not as competitive as others."
good,A good place to learn how to interact with people of all nationalities. Giving people a magical experience involves us being creative and learning how to act in a professional manner.
good,"Answering incoming calls from all over the world booking hotel, and dinner/breakfast shows reservations for Disney Company. I learned international communications, problem solving, and helping customers enjoying their vacation planning arrangements. Supervisors were very helpful with questions and issues presented. My co-worker were very competitive and less social among each other. The hardest part of the job was not receiving any type of rewards or extra hours. I enjoyed talking with people from different countries and using my bilingual languages skills to help them."
good,The Walt Disney Company was a great place to work for. It taught me a lot about life and about myself. I had many opportunities for advancement. I would recommend working here to anyone .
good,The people that work here are amazing. My only complaint is that they hire temps instead of hiring full time. The temps get treated like trash by the permanent employees.
good,This division of Disney Entertainment Arts is no longer in operation. The shop closed after 9/11 and the decrease in Disneyland attendance. Too bad it is gone!
good,My time spent with the Walt Disney Company was very hit and miss. I worked in Attraction during my entire time of employment but moved from different parks. I loved my time in Epcot and had very supportive and wonderful managers but when I went to Magic Kingdom it was a different story. It was not the place I saw myself growing.
good,"Every day is different from the next... you never know what to expect from the guests but I have fun with them.  They can make your day.  The smile on the kids faces make coming to work worth it.  "
good,I believe this company is one of the greatest company on earth and do believe that you will be happy there.  It is very traditional and so be ready to continue traditional values.
good,As lead engineer I have to manage my team of engineers on a daily basis to ensure the projects being designed are completed within the given time frame and that quality valued engineering practice has been applied
good,"To be honest, working for Disney is a great way to see the good in people how ever Security is not security. Its complete politics and Security doesn't have the authority to tell some one they can not do something. If it wasn't for the fact that when I go to work I get to look at those smiling faces and have parents and kids come up to me and say ""Thank you for what you do. Thank you for making me and my family feel safe"" I wouldn't go to work. We as security aren't security we are guest services. we cant prevent anything from happening we cant use physical force when needed. Example: two patrons getting into a physical altercation, we as security officers can not step in and break it up. "
good,"With The Walt Disney Company you get what you put in.  While working at Disney I was able to participate in many events that allowed me to cross into other departments.  I worked with many different people at all levels of the company and had so many experiences I will never forget.  The Walt Disney Company, Resorts in particular, are known for their excellence in customer service, and rightfully so.  As a Lead and Trainer in the Merchandise Department I was able to work closely with new and seasoned Cast Members to insure that these standards were being met, and to help inspire Cast Members to create Magic Moments every day."
good,"Era muy divertido el día a día y todos conocíamos el funcionamiento del departamento y como iban las cosas a la perfección. Mi director de ventas era muy cercano y además de las reuniones que tuviera con él para la gestión de algunas cuentas clave a nivel online, había reuniones todos los lunes donde todos compartíamos el estado de todos los lanzamientos, competidores, y todo lo que se iba planeando se conocía por cada uno de nosotros, así como cifras de rentabilidad."
good,Disney is full of high energy driven employees who have a passion for creativity and results.  It is a fun environment and one of the more professional media companies in LA.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at WDW. My managers were very supportive and helped me learn new skills within a few months of working there. I wish that my schedule was more consistent, it was difficult to have a life outside of work."
good,Disney is a great place when first starting off. They teach great fundamentals when it comes to guest services. The show you all the thing you need to learn while creating a fun work place.
good,This job is very fun. but very stressful. the customers were very rude  and did not have any respect for empolyees. One of the manager was kinda arrogant and rude and really didnt want to help with training. but overall i think its fun most of time but probably will go back if i had the chance.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I absolutely love and adore my job! The people I get the honor and pleasure to work with each and every single day creates happiness for me while I get to create happiness for all the Guests. I'm a very bright and optimistic person and I'm glad that I get to spread the positive energy each day to my cast and crew. This is a company I would gladly recommend all to apply for. Because honestly working for Disney had to be one of the greatest opportunities that I never knew I needed. My day is always eventful, there is so much opportunity to grow, and you get to connect with some amazing people. You never know where this company can take you."
good,"Awesome was able to meet people from different counties, play with the toys watch movies. enjoy my coworkers they were all friendly and fun liked it because I was able to merchandise the the store."
good,"My time there was short lived since I was a college program participant. Overall, the experience was good, and I would like to be a permanent employee of the Disney Company given the opportunity."
good,"I am under a very strict confidential information act, so I really cant describe my work day, or management tactics. I will say, it is very important to be professional and skilled. Management is fair and safety orientated."
good,"liberté d'action, confiance de la part des leaders, lieu de travail agréable, bonne ambiance, flexibilité des horaires"
good,"If given the chance to work for the mouse, take it!  Pay isn't anything amazing but the experience certainly is.  I met people from all around the world daily and that made it worth it.  "
good,"It is fun to work for them, but it will be long hours and high stress. You do get free access to the parks, but you might not have enough time to visit all of them."
good,"I have worked in several different departments. I've always enjoyed the work I've done for the most part. However, periodic insecurities about job stability. I've been laid off twice but was able to get into another department. There is a tendency to hire big and bring in a whole crew of people...then lay most of them off a few years later when the project fails. I've seen that cycle over and over again the years I've been with them."
good,I loved working for the company. They were understanding  and made sure I was satisfied with the job. You just get tired of the guest. Some guest are just not happy at all and take it out on you and act like spoiled children.
good,"The Disneyland Resort helped me grow out of my shell. Its a fast paced environment full of fun, and Magical moments. You grow to know your co workers like family, especially after spending all of your holidays with them. Management (not leads) can be hard to get a hold of, but once you do they are helpful and understanding."
good,"I was consulting for Disney to help them implement their Data Management Platform (which enables targeted online advertising). This was a really interesting project and I learned a ton about online privacy, data collection methodologies and the broadcast industry."
good,DATG is a great company to work for. They are at the forefront of the latest technology. I have learned a lot from my colleagues over the years and they helped make my job more than just a job.
good,good people to work with and a good environment. management was good. I have good co workers. the most enjoyable job is the cleaning and meeting guests.
good,"Very corporate atmosphere. Excellent benefits. Not a lot of internal promotions, but if you get a job there you will probably love it."
good,Learned how to work with guests from all over the world and how to communicate better with guests. Co-workers were all very happy and friendly which provides a very enjoyable work environment.
good,"I love to inspire the imagination of Guests and peers through storytelling, ensuring a memorable experience. Also, As a Cast Member, my interactions with our Guests allow me to bring animated films to life while sharing the legacy that Walt Disney has left behind."
good,"Big company bureaucracy and corporate politics aside, this is largest a fantastic place to grow and develop your career."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"great place to work , the  great benefits the management was great , the people in this work place were  always happy it was nice place to work at."
good,Had plenty of exposure to upper management.  Provided with autonomy to design application the best way that I saw fit.  Fun environment that celebrated the completion of the project and worked closely with users.  Led and supported users to accept new application and methodology even after the main stake holder left the company insuring that department would gain full benefits from the project.
good,"Work hard, get paid and protect the product with your life. If you can do this you will excel otherwise why bother?  You have to be tough and smart to succeed, I did so can you..."
good,"I'll start with the cons, which are fairly typical for the AAA gaming industry. The crunchtimes were long and brutal, and the pay was hardly competitive. However, if you can stomach long hours, the environment and work itself was well worth it. The project was large and complex enough that testing was never the same thing every day. There were always new features to play with and new areas of the game to help out on, so boredom was not a danger. If you were working late you could expect a well-made free catered dinner. Management was always receptive to new ideas for test plans and personal requests."
good,"Un excelente ambiente de trabajo, todos los días se aprende algo nuevo. Es una industría que te enseña la importancia de la marca, las relaciones públicas."
good,"My main job responsibilities are to take room service orders via phone from the guests, form guest checks for each order, then settle guest checks after orders have been delivered.  This is honestly a very easy and laid-back job most of the time.  It does get busy from time to time, especially during breakfast and dinner hours, but this doesn't happen very often.  Most of my shift is spent sitting down in a small office at a desk just answering the phone when it rings and taking care of other administrative duties.  The most difficult parts of my job are knowing the complete room service menu, answering unexpected and unusual questions from guests, learning all of the room service cashier responsibilities (there is a LOT to learn and it takes a while to learn enough to feel comfortable in this role), and adjusting to the demands of a 24-hour work role (this role has both early morning and graveyard shifts).  Overall, I would say this is a decent job for what it pays, but I would not recommend it to those who do not feel like sitting on a chair for the majority of an 8.5 hour shift, those who prefer to work in a consistently fast-paced environment, or those who feel more satisfied in a role where you are communicating with guests in person rather than over the phone."
good,Every day was productive and fun. Everyone had one goal and that was to work as a team and get all daily goals accomplished.
good,"Ao chegar na empresa, realizava ligações e emails para fornecedores, apresentava produtos a clientes sempre dando dicas e sugestões."
good,"During the time as a certified trainer and attraction host, I was certified in the logistical and technical duties of the attraction operations. The complexity of the attraction established the ability to monitor multiple situations, coordinate a logical solution and communicate with co-works effectively. With a main goal of creating a memorable experience for our guest."
good,Guest service and Safety are the top two basics that we stress each day. I have learned that it's all who you know that will help you move up in the company. They do care about their Cast Members. Some managers have become too comfortable in their role and need to be moved or held accountable for their actions.
good,"Serving Guest in a Fast Paced/Upscale environment, multitasking while staying focused."
good,"Running all attractions within the five floors of arcade and interactive games. Very diverse workplace, which was very pleasing. Always extra hours available to work if needed be."
good,"Really enjoyed working here. Management was friendly and fun, work was interesting and fresh."
good,"I encourage everyone - no matter how old are you - to work at Disney for a period of time, say 6 months. It is once upon a lifetime experience."
good,Working for the mouse has been the best experience I've ever had. Getting to meet people from all over the world. I learned a lot about myself and what Im good at.
good,"NDY is a very highly regarded name in the industry. It is a diverse company which works across a variety of different sectors. "
good,Great place to work for if you want to network. Schedule is set and must call in before work if you are late. The company is very strict on punctuality.
good,"Everything about Hollywood Studios was great, except they never scheduled enough hours to make a living."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Great Resort to provide high-end service, while still providing the fun and magic that Disney guests have come to expect."
good,"No day was a typical day at the company,  we always had great opportunities within the company from Digital assets to offering a Captain America event! In addition we worked to involved the clients objectives with corporate initiative's that included healthy living, STEM education, and safety.  Also, we helped clients messages get directly to their potential clients which were normally Moms and families within a safe environment.  I learned a lot about balancing the integrity of a huge brand and business development. "
good,"Let's not fool ourselves into believing this is the perfect company; it isn't.  However, out of the handful of jobs I've held in corporate America, it is abundantly clear why so many companies want to learn how to be more like Disney and even more companies who should begin considering the idea.  Most of my experience was at the Walt Disney World Resort and with Disney Cruise Line.  The Disney culture is fostered and lives brightly among most of the tens of thousands of employees that make magic happen on a daily basis, rain or shine, holiday or weekend, day or night.  I would indeed consider accepting a position with this company again."
good,Disney is a fun place to work at. I have meet people from around the world. They come to me telling stories of their trip or there life. Sometime is very touching stories. I work on the rides and is a never dull day at the Resort.
good,"This job was an internship, so I can't speak about it a whole lot. The only reason I did not care for the job was because it was in Florida and I missed home. Everything else about working for Disney was great. They are strict, though!"
good,"A typical day at work would always consist of smiles and creating magical experiences for guests. Whether it was from just simply telling someone happy birthday, to helping someone who just came home from the military and surprising their family, it was truly an experience I'll never forget. While working for the Disney company, I learned what it's truly like to never leave your inner-kid behind and just be happy. Management was always on top of things and I felt like I could always rely on them. And for my co-workers, we always worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job was the amount of multitasking that was done in one shift. It was easy to overcome with a clear mind and pushing myself into working as hard as possible to get everything done. The most enjoyable part was definitely being able to create the magic and happiness that the Disney company revolves around. It was an experience of a life time."
good,"une culture d'entreprise forte"
good,"I loved working at Disney interactive a very fun first job, but i really want to move forward to bigger and better things. I learned a lot from working at Disney interactive , the managers were very nice and responsible. The hardest part of my job was the fast pace, but i got used to it after a year of working there. "
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,"A great culture and wonderful people to work with. However, print is dead. Secondly, the digital products they offer are nothing special. There are way too many companies in the digital vendor space. What makes MNI a better option for an agency? They are not competitive on CPM and minimums are too high for most new clients. MNI just cannot compete with Centro or Specific Media in this market."
good,"Clean and reset Disney California Adventure Park, I also covered the Downtown Disney area.  Maintained a safe, clean and positive environment for guest.  Some of my duties included but are not limited to: sweeping, mopping, deep cleaning and sanitizing restrooms/kitchens.  I diluted solutions of various types of cleaning chemicals depending on the task at hand.  I worked in a union environment; therefore reporting daily, to my lead, any issues that may have come up.  Found it difficult to adjust to 3rd shift while trying to attend school"
good,The management team has the team running smoothly. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a keeping up with the fast pace environment.
good,"Because Disney employs thousands of cast members I can't speak for each department, because each is run by different management under different unions and each department sort of hold it's own personality."
good,High pace but great company to work for. Lots of smart coworkers
good,"Walt Disney has been preeminent in the field of family entertainment. From humble beginnings as a cartoon studio in the 1920s to today's global corporation, The Walt Disney Company continues to proudly provide quality entertainment for every member of the family, across America and around the world."
good,"Gave pre-shifts and updates to co-workers and cast."
good,I looked forward to working at the office everyday. I loved to work for my supervisor. Loved to look at the projects being built from scratch and the end of result
good,"A typical day at work entailed the following tasks:"
good,"True DISNEY Fans worked here"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Stocking and ordering of DVD/Blu-ray movies for Disney and Buena Vista pictures. Large territory and made my own hours.
good,"While the presence of many opportunities reside throughout the various lines of business, I find a lack of interest in providing education about other departments outside of formal events.  Castmembers cannot take initiative on their own to learn, they must wait for some kind of formally-sanctioned event."
good,"The most enjoyable part of would have to be visiting the parks and seeing people of all ages enjoy the hard work you have done. The hardest part would have to be field work. When the deadline to open an attraction is close, schedules get very tight and hours get longer."
good,I worked extensively on new vehicle projects for attractions. Interfaced with engineers on a daily bases. I would head out to an attraction to review issues with new mechanical systems. I helped with field installation of vehicles and power system during test and adjustment phase. I assisted with training of maintenance team for new vehicle restraint and power system.
good,"Trabajar en Disney es diversión. La temática, los compañeros..."
good,"The best part of workers at Disney would have to had been my coworkers, they made work pleasurable everyday. Although Disney is always busy and there is always problems arising, having the pleasure to work with such an outstanding company was a highlight of my life."
good,"O atendimento era realizado com grupo de crianças e adolescentes. Alguns casos eram estudados separadamente durante reuniões semanais com os profissionais e a responsável pelo estabelecimento. Havia pouca oportunidade de encontrar com as colegas, devido aos horários. Por ser conveniada com órgãó público, às vezes o salário atrasava alguns meses. Não havia oportunidade de melhoria salarial ou mesmo promoção. A oportunidade estava na convivência e aprendizado de quadros e síndromes raras."
good,"Worked on payroll and HR projects, ran and balanced payrolls, cut off cycle checks."
good,Nice place to work. Management was exceptional. Management took care of the team and was always looking for ways to improve moral.
good,"I worked in the area of Food & Beverage with professionals culinary, inside in the kitchen, on register and attending table keeping all clean. It was a fun work because I learned how to treat the guests, help them and do all possible so they can have a great experience and enjoy our service."
good,"If you love a job that you can interact with new people every minute of the day, this is the job for you. You have amazing opportunities to move across departments and expand your knowledge. It is a hospitality job so don't expect to celebrate every Christmas at home. If you do your job right you are rewarded with a long career. You have to have the mindset of a company of this nature. If you are a person that get irritated easily, do us all a favor and do not come to work here."
good,"Working for Walt Disney world was a great experience. I got to see all the backstage magical and I was a part of it. A typical work day would including spreading a little bit of pixie dust to make each guest feel important. My coworkers were like a typical job, some were hard working while others were lazy but together we were a team and got things done. My most enjoyable part of the day was getting in the parks free on my off days."
good,"Radio Disney was the dream job, worked at my own pace, made my own schedule, spoke w/ all kinds of non-profit organizations. Hardest part of the job was doing interviews w/ people who didn't have much of anything to say, so that cause a lot of dead air in my interviews that I had to fill in. I learned that interviewing/speaking w/ people is what I was born to do."
good,"Typically at DRC I answered phone calls from travel agents who were needing more information for their clients to book vacations at WDW in Orlando. I learned what Disney is all about , where it began . My direct manager was a helpful part of my daily progress. She monitored calls and helped me when I would get stuck with some information . The co workers at DRC were like family to me . If one of us had a bad day we did what we could to help improve moral and sales . The hardest thing at DRC was the LONG over time they sometimes required . The most enjoyable part of DRC was the family and friends . Making a good impression with the travel agents I talked to often ."
good,It is a magical place to work so long as you are a patient person whom knows how to stay in character on stage as well as knowing how to manage ones time well.
good,"The Walt Disney Company was a wonderful opportunity to build my base in learning about HR, interfacing with all levels of the organization supporting businesses within the Corporate division"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,This is a great company to work for. It's constantly evolving. They have a great work/life balance. Great benefits. They also offer major holidays as well as floater holidays. They are very flexible if something comes up to take the time off.
good,"I worked for a Disney employee and enjoyed being an external part of the  team. It is a very safe, and inspiring environment full of driven and talented individuals. Hardest part of the job was having to be accessible 24/7."
good,The job I had was very fast-paced and gave me the opportunity to interact with people all over the world. A typical day involved working in several booths around Epcot and providing excellent service to Disney's valued guests. It involved a lot of work without supervision and a routine-like closing. The management was all very nice and wanted to make sure we were all treated fairly and ensure we all lived up to the Disney standard. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the relationships I built with my coworkers and the guests.
good,My time at Disney was great. I was able to try out different roles and meet a lot of people. Advancement is difficult and the pay is not worth the commute or time commitment to have to park so far away from home base. It is a unionized company that is very much run cookie-cutter style so it is not possible to get raises based on performance. Management was decent in most places.
good,"location, work-life balance, challenging environment, variety of products and opportunities, supportive coworkers, and many many more fringe benefits, fun place to work."
good,"I worked as an intern through the Disney College Program. I worked in bell services as a dispatcher in the resorts. Overall, this experience was very valuable to me. As a future speech language pathologist, this role did not specifically connect to my major. All of my previous jobs were in childcare until this one. I spent half of my shift in the bell stand in the lobby of the resort. Some of my responsibilities included interacting with guests and other cast members, giving guests directions, printing boarding passes, arranging transportation, and assisting guests to whichever cast member could best fulfill their needs. I spent the other half of my shift in the luggage room. Some of my responsibilities included answering phones, using multiple softwares to access guest information, enter orders to a computer system, dispatch orders to bellmen, lift, store, and organize luggage, and assisting guests as best as possible. I learned so many customer/guest service skills as well as communication skills. I learned more about collaborating with others and group problem solving. I met so many people from around the world of different ages, ethnicities, beliefs, abilities, genders, sexualities, and more. Being an intern is one of the most difficult things I have ever done, but working for Disney was an amazing, once in a lifetime experience that I am forever grateful for."
good,En el turno se realizaba trabajo de carga a los vagones y distribucion de lamercancia seca para los difrentes parques de disney
good,Super agréable.Une expérience très enrichissante et tellement belle.
good,I got lucky with great bosses and leaders leading our team. Very open to 1:1 discussions and always open for improvements. Sometimes you can get caught up on too many meetings so you must learn to manage your time well.
good,"Disney has a very formal structure for I.T. project management - similar to an Agile process with meetings almost every day. Development is done off-shore in India, but the process works and everyone is very professional."
good,"I've really enjoyed my experience.  The benefits are great, along with the people.  The company could be a bit more diverse.  Once you're hired here, you never leave so a lot of a salaried jobs are harder for younger people to get because no-one ever leaves."
good,"I enjoyed my time at The Walt Disney Company.  I appreciated how every cast member really believed in the magic the company brought to everyone.  I don't think the cast members were compensated correctly, but overall, I would recommend a friend to work here- depending on the role."
good,"Excellent opportunity to work in the Information Security organization.  Worked on a number of programs and interfaced with great, knowledgeable resources."
good,"As a part time cast member at Typhoon Lagoon , I enjoyed a laid back and friendly job culture with wonderful coworkers and supportive management. I loved helping guests and contributing to the Disney magic. Unfortunately, the hours aren't reliable so its only a good option if you don't 100% need the money."
good,"The Disney College Program gave me an opportunity to work while still gaining college credit courses through Disney University. In the typical day on the job I got the work in all four of the parks doing a variety of tasks from retail, food and beverage, guest relations, and even working with ESPN during the cheer leading competitions they host annually. I got to interact with people from all around the world while living in the DIsney sponsored housing that have all the internships working during that time period. The culture at the WDC was amazing and they mainly focused on customer satisfaction, making sure that the guests as well as cast members feel like they are visiting the friendliest place on earth. The most enjoyable part of my journey here was meeting life long friends that I still keep in contact today."
good,"• Worlk with clients and internal contractor to schedule the project, giving estimates of the number of hours and resouces needed."
good,One day while working a customer called and was going off about been over charged and I had to refund the customer her money back. She was highly satisfied and talked to my lead/manager and they honored me with lunch.
good,I met some of the best people I know at my time with the Walt Disney Company. It was a great environment and my team members were willing to always help to do whatever it took to get the job done!
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"It's a great internship to apply for especially after college graduation. The guests are great! My trainers were super helpful. Yes, the hours and the heat are grueling, but the supervisors make sure you rest while outside."
good,"It is a fast and fun place to work and learn!"
good,"great, fun energetic place to work. there is always work to be done, making magic moments happen for both children and adults is the best part of this job,"
good,Working for Disney World will always be a dream come true. The best way to enter the work field! Great opportunities and growth in the company as well.
good,My time at the Walt Disney Company was very fun and rewarding. I loved working with the guests and getting to interact with people from all over the world. I learned so much from working here and plan to carry that new knowledge with me where ever I plan to go in the future.
good,"Working for Disney is difficult. A lot is asked of you for very little money. However, making magic for children makes it worth it. The kids are so happy with everything you do even if it's just food service."
good,Typical day at work is pretty chill you just do what is required and answer guest concerns. We have a big management team so I don't really see my managers too often. Everyone is young so there is bound to be drama but that is no surprise. Hardest part of the job is working during the summer because sometimes you cannot take breaks to cool off because of the work. Most enjoyable part of the job is the perks and being able to go into disneyland whenever you want. Meeting a lot of people is fun because you get a change of perspective.
good,Great team supporting you. Fun place to work. Company offers a great training regimen and makes sure company direction is communicated to every cast member efficiently and clearly. Truly the only hard part working there is the pay.
good,They are very Disney theme company everything is related to a character. Fast pace work environment and time sensitive. Always having great training classes. Pays well as a contractor.
good,Treats employees very well.  Creative and exciting employer who supports employees in all their efforts on behalf of the company.  Fosters team work and creative thinking
good,Ok company to work for. Depends on what you do Parks vs Professional you may not get paid that much. Benefits for professional side is great good price.
good,"It is great experience! I don't feel openly share about my daily jobs and work experience in public. I', really enjoying it and it is a great place t be."
good,Fun place to work full of opportunities. Job security is really high. Managment is good and friendly. Scheduling usually isnt a problem and the benefits are ok.
good,"It depends where you're placed within the park. Managers designate different areas, so your experience will be different. If you're considering employment, look into reviews that range the different parks and lands. And Co-workers are either great or completely mental... the environment backstage can be like a middle-school campus. I'd suggest keeping a mature co-worker group and try enjoying the park. But remember, you will be on their time."
good,"I love working at Disneyland and have done so for many years. Any applicants should expect a fun, friendly, diverse and entertaining work. The challenge is that the main work times are completely opposite from a normal day time shift-work job. This means nights, weekends and holidays. If you like that, I highly recommend it! "
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for the company and I would do it again. I personally worked for Disney on Ice not Disney, but at the end of the day it was the experience that counts."
good,"Lovely place to work.  I had a great experience at the Walt Disney Company.  While I do feel the salary could have been higher,  I would recommend it to anyone."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,At my current job you do not do the same every day. I love working with people and they provide the tools for you to help the guest to the best of your knowledge.
good,Well I loved this store but I'm sure they did not enjoy me. I was younger and immature at the time and in some ways did not live up to Disney code. It was fun to see that they took the Disney experience very serious. Its important to them and they try yo teach you along the way. When I worked for them the pay was $10.50 an hour but I'm sure now they pay more. Its a bit hectic with all the kids and parents throwing everything everywhere but if you like everything Disney and like taking the extra step to make people happy while doing your job of fixing everything around then this the place for you. Also the benefits down the line are pretty great. If I remember correctly it had a lot to do with cruises and them parks and paid vacations. I think they have a 401k as well. They encourage you to be a good worker and advance in the company.
good,"Met some amazing people there, had lots of fun had had an amazing experience."
good,"Given that the Walt Disney Company is so large, the opportunities and room for growth is what you make of it and highly dependent on the employee if they want to make that extra effort to connect with others. "
good,Very fun and productive place to work.working with this company has made me a better person today.taught me howvto manage my time and be efficient.Wonderful company
good,"Enjoyed working for the company very much. The role I had had a great deal of independence and various responsibilities. One day I could be working on a very active area, the next I would be working an inactive area. I had to learn how to manage my daily tasks, some days I got done what I had to. Management of the resort I worked at was excellent and they worked closely with staff. The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily quotas, but that was doable. The thing I enjoyed the most about the job was that I got to meet a lot of interesting people, as well as the interactions I had with them. Overall, a great company that I would recommend to people who love Disney."
good,"Fast working environment, pretty much everyone is very nice to work with and keeps the job very professional with no violations. But the hardest part of the job would be the consistant fast walking pace."
good,This job gave me a lot of real world experience as well as teaching me how the Walt Disney Company operates.  I was able to learn about the hiring process and what it is that The Walt Disney Company recruiters look for in applicants.
good,"While at ABC Studios my experience was great. Day to day activities were always different, but my usual responsibilities included office orders, event planning, errands, desk coverage, reception, high amounts of online and verbal communication and knowledge about the entertainment industry, production, and finance. Loved the people I worked with, the benefits, and the consistent schedule."
good,The diversity of workers and skills that were brought to the table enhanced the workplace experience. The creative process was appreciated and supported allowing for self expression to flourish.
good,"When the leaders are good and listening to workers life is good, but leaders can affect the job experience. It is a lot of work but you are aware of the expectations."
good,Besides scheduling doing whatever they want with your schedule even i you have told them your restrictions an most management not being very helpful its awesome to work here.
good,I enjoyed my time working here. I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. Cast members are treated very well here. I had other learning opportunities with additional classes and seminars.
good,Helped me became a more independent person. Great first job. I just did not like the fact that they were not willing to work with my school schedule and the need to study especially for a full-time student.
good,"Fueron casi 10 años de desarrollo, aprendizaje, crecimiento y trabajo para contenidos realmente exitosos. Me senti muy comoda liderando el marketing de canales de television y ser responsable de exitos como Soy Luna, Violetta, Topa y liderar la campaña de #Mickey90 en la región, elevando el standard creativo de una empresa lider."
good,"An opportunity to make guests excited about their Disney vacation"
good,All good every think is ok I don’t have more work to say omg all is go well  amazing love there not complaining talk to much you can ask me the questions and
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,As part of the Integrated Retail and Licensing division it is my responsibility to create and deliver account and category strategies for all Landmark Group concepts across all categories. This includes delivering the licensing sales targets and closely coordinating with retail marketing.
good,"Une entreprise qui sait accueillir les futurs employés. "
good,"I can't speak for other teams, but I learned a lot here to grow as a civil engineer. "
good,"A typical day at work would start by coming in at least 1-2 hours earlier than my shift starts, do a bit of Lobster Ink, then look at the days forecast."
good,"Great benefits and schedule if working full time, the company is amazing, but as a part time employee I was on call and received my schedule by 6am daily- whether I was needed or not and which classroom I was in (I worked for their day care). The other employees gave off a hierarchy vibe which was very unwelcoming, but other than that it was great."
good,The Walt Disney Company is a fun place to work.  Great benefits and an awesome opportunity to make magic for guests.  A very fast paced environment but very fulfilling.
good,"Lots of different things to do, lots of cultures to introduce yourself with. Benefits are alright, hours and shifts are good. Job advancement could be better but an all round place to work"
good,Working for the Walt Disney Company is an experience that I will never forget. My co workers became like my family. I was able to share my ideas. The leaders are always there for you and are always open to talk.
good,"I loved working at Disney.  The perks were the best I have ever experienced in the entertainment industry.  I represented Disney a lot on campus and at different recruiting events and it was great to have the brand recognition.  The only downside I will say is that it is a VERY relationship based company.  If you want to make any changes, you have to socialize it with a lot of people.  So, it can take a long time to make impactful changes and improvements.  It also has a very heavy meeting-culture.  You can spend your whole day in meetings if you don't manage your calendar well."
good,"Disney was a great place to work.  I learned a lot of new skills, and had a great management team! Even with tough days we made it about our guest!!!!"
good,all way something to do very good job a lot of walking to get to where you have to go some make sure you leave a little early just in case you can not make it.
good,"In my position, there is a lot of speaking with guests on the phones. It can be fun to help people plan their vacations, especially first time visitors. The benefits are definitely great. If you love Walt Disney World, you will definitely enjoy the free admission to the parks. I wouldn't go to Disney if it wasn't free and I enjoy a lot of discounts there. However it's still customer service and people do yell at you. Yes, it's raining in Florida and no, the park isn't closing and no, we're not going to refund your money. There is not a ton of variety in the work, but it's not like I bring my work home with me at the end of the day and I likely will never speak to the same person twice. The base pay is no longer enough to get by, and the incentive bonuses seem to be decreasing monthly, with harder metrics to meet them. There is no advancement except being a team leader, but there can be opportunity in other departments. I have gotten to experience working in other departments and continue to apply to openings, as I would like to continue with the company."
good,"Excelente empresa a nivel internacional, una excelente servicio al cliente."
good,"great team environment - leadership willing to work within your personal issues if needed - great opportunities for job advancement, training classes - company provides great recognition for Cast Members"
good,"On the recruiting side, I loved the management, the team, and the groups we got support. However, when it came to the salaries we would able to work with, it made it very difficult to attract top talent from companies like Amazon and Google."
good,happy environment. having made a kids magical dream come true. training in different areas of the company. Very concerned about the well being of their staff members.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I'm grateful to Disney, I think it's a solid and good company to work on."
good,Constantly met with guests and worked with many cast members to provide happy experiences.  It was incredibly fun and the managers were always around to make sure you're doing well
good,"I only worked for Radio Disney Denver for three months before it was shut down, but I enjoyed it while it lasted! The projects in which I was involved were exciting and fulfilling. My main job was to set up and take down events in parks, shopping malls, and fairs. There was a lot of interaction with children and we would be in charge of giving away free items with the Radio Disney logo on them."
good,"I learned a lot about how to handle customer service. The hardest part of the job was definitely the guests, but you adapted to the certain scenarios. The company and job were very rewarding and I wouldn't trade that job for anything else. You really make a big impact on people while working at Disney."
good,"Walt Disney work is like living in dream, we work on disney world,"
good,"It's great working for this company. Very fast paced and friendly.  Can be slow and lack of days to work.  Other than that, no complaints. Great atmosphere."
good,"The position and company has ups and downs like all positions. The ups are really positive, fun, life-changing. The downs, are low - frustrating, stressful, and sometimes not alleviated."
good,"Your biggest perks is getting into the parks for free, which is fun to do on your off days. I worked in quick service and it was just like any other restaurant job."
good,"A fun and safe environment to be in, surrounded by genuine people which is the most enjoyable part of working there. the real definition of hard work. Management are exceptionally kind and are harsh when need be, which is rare. All around great place to be."
good,"I love what i do and the environment I work in, I just can't afford to live in the area based on the working wage I earn. You find yourself caught up in the company, and it's an incredible company to work for, minus the politics behind the amount of money you make for the amount of work you put in."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is such a special, rewarding, and iconic company to work for.  Although their wages are competitive with similar companies, their wages are still very low for the hundreds of billions of dollars that the company has to their name.  "
good,"Working at Disney is for individuals that can withstand extreme weather conditions (hot, cold, rainy, sunny,etc). In other  words, not for the faint of heart. Must be team player and meet sales and location goals. Must also definitely be people person."
good,Disney is a fun place to work. In spite of being stressful. I don't think I ever had a hard day at work. I like working around people so I enjoyed every moment of it.
good,All employees on finance team are extremely sharp.  The environment is casual and the work/life balance is strong.  Most seem to take pride in working in Disney.
good,"A typical day at work/what I learned - answering phones, assisting the administrative with work flow, data entry, responsible for calendar to the conference rooms"
good,"Really enjoyed it. Big company but still organized in a way that each unit kind of feels like its own small business, so you have a sense of ownership over projects and goals."
good,"Was great working for the mouse. The hours were bad and the pay was awful. They expected you to work long hours for mere pennies. Other than that, the benefits of getting into all of the parks for free was great. Discounted hotels and tickets for family members as well."
good,"Collaborative environment making new and innovative attractions. Great campus and on-site social events. When it comes time for the field installation, expect long hours with no time off. Always crunch time before opening day, 30+ straight days at work."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,The Walt Disney Company is a fast and fun paced work environment.  It can be very competitive and intense at times. I would recommend working here for the ability to learn and create new ideas.
good,"Roligt jobb med super härliga kollegor!"
good,"I loved working for PSAV. Always looking for the next big idea and willing to listen/PSAV without any doubt will give you all the tools you need to succeed. They will almost always provide hotels with the proper equipment and labor support for events. What they will not always do is help you when you're struggling with any difficulties in your line of work. They sometimes will expect you to find the solution, under the premise of ""being your own boss""."
good,"Lack of advancement in the department.  It's what you make of it in your role, but you tend to run into brick wall after awhile.   Had to leave to seek for better opportunities.  Most people tend to stay put is because of job security."
good,I would come to see how many cast members that I had and work the areas that where short handed.  Clean bathrooms / streets.  I enjoyed my job due to the guest see the magic.
good,Overall it's an okay job the magic doesn't exist in the background as much on the stage. However pay and benefits are great as well as the turnover rates.
good,Disney pays for you to get your AFO certification and you learn a lot about how specific pools operate. Its a job that keeps you busy so your not looking for other things to do. Full time employees get great benefits.
good,This was an excellent opportunity to work with a quality company who cares about its people.  Carried out multiple tasks during my time spent there.  Mentoring and collaboration was excellent.
good,"Its a tough section/department of the company to work in. Very difficult to advance. However, if you love Disney and are interested in security, investigations (etc.) it is a great opportunity with a great company."
good,"It's difficult as a summer temp because so many people are added to the team that you get very few shifts unless you're better at adjusting to the work environment. It was my first job so not everything stuck the first few days on the floor, but I was still expected to remember everything I learned despite only working once every other week, which was very stressful as every little thing I forgot at the register was entirely placed on my shoulders."
good,"I began working at Walt Disney company several years ago. The company is safe and there is definitely security there. I highly recommend it if you are a working parent. There are great discounts at the company. There is not much mingling between divisions, so do not take a job in one division if your desire is to move into another. It is very difficult to move to another space once place in the company."
good,"Overall, there are many opportunities to move around/across the company. "
good,Company with rigid specifications and strong work ethics very focused on work force.USPH regulations met with to the fullest.The most enjoyable part was to see the smiles of our guests and interactions on a daily basis.
good,At Disney my typical day would consist of picking out products from a list given to me by my manager and i would have to scan the product then pack the product into a box then seal and label the box. The management system was fair. The workplace culture was a enjoyable environment to work in and the other employees were great to work with as part of a hardworking team. I really enjoyed working as part of a large hardworking and motivated team.
good,"Worked merchandise in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Overall it was hard work and the pay was low, but the people were amazing and I learned a lot about the company and how to move forward. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of upward movement in jobs at Disney so it was hard to stay."
good,"It is a place to work if you value the family atmosphere, fellow cast members are driven by a desire to be part of the legacy of Walt Disney and are very much involved with the ideals the company espouses."
good,"Coworkers are great, everyone is extremely nice, but the job is stressful because guests are mean. It's rewarding to get to make magic but I work a lot of hours and it is pretty repetitive, and while the benefits are amazing, we don't make all that much"
good,"I did luggage Assistance, Greeter, and dispatcher. They have a good system there and would be happy to send people there. Many of the employees are rhe best"
good,"This was a very fun job! I loved it A LOT! I would have stayed at this job but the hours weren’t enough and the hours that they did give you weren’t promised either. I would definitely work here again just for the discounts to go to Disney. But do not make this your primary job if you have “grown up bills” because you will lose everything. 🤷🏽‍♀️😂 it’s a great job tho, definitely miss it!!!"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,The Walt Disney company is a fun and exciting place to work.  They have an amazing discounts not only within the company but also with other affilates
good,"Fast Paced call center. As many hours as you would like per week. Yearly reviews and merit increases, Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits, as well as Discounts throughout  the Disney Brand."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is a great please to work, you will gain a good experience, there is a balance between the work and life, and give a competitive salary"
good,Come into work and sit down at your seat. I learned to properly assist customers with orders. Management was great always there when needed. Great environment met new people. The jobs was very easy. Best part about the job was knowing I helped people out.
good,I was one of the lead coordinators for my volunteer group for the Disney 1/2 Marathon. It was a fun experience. I can't say much about the company because I technically didn't work for it though. :(
good,"Though we sit on Disney property, we have the opportunity to work with partners throughout the entire company in all segments & countries.  This may be exciting, but also brings in barriers as partners do not communicate nor behave the same."
good,Being able to work at Walt Disney world is a once in a lifetime opportunity that i would recommend to any college student that can possible to it.  I learned incredible skills here that has made me a better worker and human being.
good,"great workplace with amazing people. "
good,"excellent career exposure and opportunity to work with a talented team.  Worked closely production, finance and marketing on product launch.  Free Movie premiers."
good,fun place to work and always have the team helping each other out and always leaning something new with your teammate. the pay is ok but nothing much to do
good,Here I had an opportunity  to work on Microsoft Project. I have closely worked with business users. It was fun loving environment. Work culture  is good
good,"As an intern, I was able to work on some of the coolest and high-profile projects that Imagineering could offer. In meetings, the interns are often treated like full-time employees, depending on the projects."
good,"Bon ambience de travail, avec pro et contro du cas, satisfaisante d'accomplir a les tâches confié."
good,Every day is a little different and you are able to interact with people from all over the world. Opportunities for advancement and fair practices. In the off seasons there aren't as many hours available.
good,Obviously working for Disney is very fun and has its great benefits. But working retail doesn't always give you the best hours. Typical day is greeting guests and going above and beyond making sure they get the best Disney retail experience. We do a little bit of everything here from cashier to greeter to doing in store events. It's definitely a fun and exciting place to work. There isn't much room to advancement in this company and some management definitely pick their favorites so it makes it that much harder.
good,This wasnt a career this was an association a was part of while working at the Walt Disney World Company. Its a great organization and helps those who need it most.
good,"Every day is different at Disney and it can be lots of fun, but there really isn't much room for advancement and you definitely won't be raising a family on a Disney salary"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with (management included). Working there is relatively easy but, can be challenging as it involves working with people (thousands) from all over the world on a daily basis."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I loved working for the Disney company. The company didn't pay the most but it did offer great benefits and gave free tickets to employees every year. I was a fun environment to work in.
good,A typical day at the Disneyland resort pools can be challenging but rewarding. Depending on the season our pool deck can be busy or practically empty. During the busy days we must work together to keep the pool deck clean and welcoming for guests. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone inside and outside the pool is safe during the busy seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests on the pool deck and making their stay and experience with us a more enjoyable one.
good,"I great place to learn about Walt Disney and how the came about. Great place to keep your energy and stay enthusiastic about guest service. As a manager everything is structural, so you really can't step out side the book. They have old ways of doing things which makes it difficult for one to go backwards instead of forward. Other than the operations piece of it, it really was a great place to work."
good,Unfortunately this company was shutdown but was a great place for learning all the employees were super smart and different experience in gaming domain.
good,"GREAT people who are very proud of their work, being a part of TWDC, and the Broadway community.  Great leadership but not always easy to move upward."
good,"Bonne ambiance de travail, relatons avec la maison mere americaine pas toujours optimales"
good,Everyday is an opportunity to learn and accomplish something new with a great team of people that are dedicated to making the Walt Disney experience worthwhile.
good,"Working for WDC is fun, and you learn a lot. however you are not always brought in for the position you have applied for. Working in a union is great, but some draw backs are that its hard to report employees for inappropriate behavior."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of either dumping trash, or sweeping a designated area as I was in the Custodial department. I learned that we as Cast Members are putting on a show for the Guests, so we are to always be happy, so that their experience is magical. For the most part, the management was excellent, but being young, I was more naive. I had the best co-workers! Everyone was extremely genuine and happy. Everyone knew each other as we were always working different areas in the park, so we easily became a true family. The hardest part of the job was working in over 100 degree weather, because it was important to stay constantly hydrated, and to work smart as to prevent injuries. The most enjoyable part was doing pre-parade. I am naturally an energetic, positive, happy person, who enjoys putting on shows for our precious guests. I recall a buddy of mine and me doing sweeping tricks down Main Street on a hot summer's day just to give our guests a magical experience, and help them with the treacherous heat till the parade came."
good,It was a great place to work. Working for one of the biggest industries in the world was very rewarding and wonderful to work for. Every day was a learning experience at work. There was never a dull day at Disney. People were always happy and willing to work as a team.
good,Working at the Walt Disney Company is a fun and energetic workplace. You meet people from all over the world that come to visit the parks and also that come to work for the company.
good,"Working at the Disneyland Resort can be a dream come true for many, you get to experience the ""Magic"" first hand. You get several oppurtunites every shift to make a guest's experience from good to great to spectactular. It is an amazing company to work for"
good,Working with different people learning all that I could along the way. Everything and everyone was easy to work with .Management was great and very understanding. Co-workers were great people. everything was enjoyable with this job
good,"Fun working at Walt Disney, using new tools making application work faster. always customers satisfaction top priority."
good,Always an interesting day at work anything can happen. Pay isn't the highest but full time benefits make up for the pay. While working you have to accept that you can't make everyone happy
good,Great management. The Operations work very well. Hardest part is working every weekend. I have learned how to work with so many different guests and cast members from all over the world.
good,"For many this can be a place where many dreams come true, and working for this company I did find much friendship and happiness in my time there. Unfortunately I also had some bad experiences. Disney works very much on a seniority basis, the longer you've been there the more benefits and oppurtunities you get with the company. Starting from the bottom however is not much fun. I also noticed that they need to work on their treatment of their employees. It is a very large company so it is possible this isn't everywhere but where I was it was very bad."
good,"the whole work there was amazing even the staff, i took alot from that and use still today in daily life. that job taught me a lot about myself as person and how to handle issues but also how to enjoy work like its not all bad"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"It was challenging but was the most fulfilling exciting experiences. I will highly recommend individuals to apply at Disney English as it definitely is a Fun, exciting , stimulating environment."
good,Disney truly is the happiest place in the world.  A very innovative company where job advancement is possible.  Pay could be better but at least great people to work with.
good,"The nature of the work at WDI tends to be project based and thus, the company tends to swell and shrink based on how much the company is looking to invest in new themed entertainment at the moment. "
good,There arent any words i could put here to explain the multitude of hate i received at this company. i was highly disappointed when i started there and found it was nothing like what i was told.
good,my daily work contains up loading off loading product to were is needed counting stocks I learned about taking orders that's needed to order product at the right amount the hardest part of my job was the seeing part. Became very difficult due to eye vision the must enjoyable part of the job was riding the golf carts threw the Disney seeing all the beautiful land.
good,I have worked for the Walt Disney Company for more than nine years. I am grateful for all the leadership training and experience they have provided me. I have not left the company or have plans on leaving. I like to keep my resume posted to see what positions may come up.
good,"worked as a contractor through temp agency Romac Inc, excellent place to work, implemented new system Mac network and linked to Network."
good,Great place to work if you're a people person. Other jobs within the company have it harder than others but it's ok at the end of the day
good,"Great coworkers, and you have the availability to meet and talk to people from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job would have to be working with the heavy guest flow that can become really sporadic at times, but for the most part working here is really fun and for the most part they have worked with all my scheduling requests."
good,"Un día típico en el canal era estar pendientes de todas las noticias de los deportes en general, estar siempre al tanto de los últimos acontecimientos. Participación de todos los trabajadores para recopilar diferentes informaciones que sirvan para los distintos programan que sintonizábamos."
good,Disney ABC is a good company to work for.  Work/life balance is really good and appreciated by the employees.  Coworkers are nice and easy to get along with.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Disney.  The benefits are great, and working on some of the greatest brands on earth is an amazing opportunity."
good,"ambiente lavorativo che stimola all'evoluzione all'interno dell'equipe, flessibile e multiculturale"
good,"Fun work place with strong instructional guidance on daily basis work"
good,Fun exciting call center I loved working there until the days that they closed the doors. I couldnt have asked for a better working environments and staff.
good,Day starts with a nice cup of coffee speak to colleugue about the day plan what we have to do today and then get set go in the evening we again do a meeting whether the task is over ; I have learned a lot of new thing in my carrer still in persue of learning; Management is good co-operative; Co-workers are supportinve; the hardest part of my job was ; From my work if i can make someone smile then i am the most happiest person on earth.
good,It was great experience to work for Disney Corporation. Management recognizes potential of its employees and allows for advancement to take place. I truly enjoyed working for the company.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"nice co workers, we helped each other when it was necessary.  the best part was the day after the payroll was locked. management was strict about getting all entries in before the payroll was locked."
good,"A typical day at work was always serving the guests  and their families and giving my best costumer service. Learned a lot bout costumer services, gained a lot of work experience, had a lot of fun and loved working there."
good,The management is highly innovative and creative. They provide an extremely good working environment for each employee. The company objective is always well-communicated.
good,I am glad I am able to work at this company because they offer diversity and stimulation. This company has given me the chance to grow and deepen my skills.
good,"I assisted consumers with all inquiries about their cable accounts.I learned how to take guest payments or concerns and handle them accordingly, Peers and management are both great to work with. hardest part was trying to sell products to upset consumers. Best part is overcoming their objections and sell them the product."
good,"During my internship, I have learned park operations and show awareness in which we protect the integrity of the product. I have learned management and leadership skills through courses Disney provides with many individuals speaking about how to become successful. I got along with many of my co workers and learned many cultures in doing so. The hardest part of my position was dealing with the amounts of pressure of daily operation during busy peak seasons. What I enjoyed most was dealing with problem solving in which we have a changing routine."
good,Rode dirt bikes jumped ramps in a routine controlled environment learned from the other workers great place to work for
good,"A typical day at my job is checking in/out guests and making sure their vacation is magical.  "
good,Disney is a fast-paced data-driven environment. We pride ourselves on differentiated instruction to help individual needs.
good,Disney is a great place to grow professionally and allows individuals to get exposed to multiple industries without ever needing to leave the company.
good,"As the opening teacher my typical day at Disney was getting the classrooms ready, setting up provocations, greeting parents and performing health checks. During the day the children would make choices as to what they wanted to get involve in; whether it was going outside, working on art projects or working in the various learning centers. My co-workers and I would make sure we served as facilitators and researchers. We worked together as a team and having a good communication was always a priority. During my stay at Disney I learned the importance of celebrating diversity. I learned about so many cultures and their holidays. I would involved the children in all the celebrations by dressing-up, art projects, decorations or listening to music from the culture we were focusing on."
good,At Thompson Prometric I assisted with so many avenues and learned so much. I was able to see how nurse aides were certified from start to finish. I saw how the tests were created and how secure it all has to be. I worked closely with fellow co workers to make it all seamless for the nurse aides or the nurses proctoring the exams. It was a great experience.
good,This is the most magical place on Earth and it definitely holds up to it. Work can get a bit chaotic but you are happy to be there even though you are working at minimum wage. Management is very helpful and there is plenty room for advancement with the company.
good,"Teamwork at its best with all aspects of IT resources and departments. Also great perks working at the Disneyland Resort. After major restructuring (outsourcing) IT teamwork became individual ""it's not my job"" silos. But working for Walt Disney Co was better than working for the outsource company."
good,"I do not want to disclose my work experience. "
good,"The Walt Disney Company is a place where dreams do come true. Being part of the IT team where technologies are used to bring a smile to everyone. I am incredibly proud of the creativity and innovation that are synonymous with the Disney brand. I am fortunate and privileged to be part of many great moments at Walt Disney World as I managed (Quality Assurance, Test Data Management, Finance, Vendors, etc.) several projects and brought them to fruition."
good,Chances to meet so many families from all around the world and interact and make their visit a positive experience isa real pleasure. Creative opportunities are endless in this company that is world renowned for a wide array of imaginative family entertainment.

good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping customers on all levels. I learned how to communicate with customers on a face to face level. Management was ok. Co workers were great, fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was handling requests that was beyond my control. Most enjoyable part of the job was creating long lasting memorable impressions on our customers."
good,A typical day at work consisted of generating payroll reports and filing returns on a quarterly basis.  Also helped figure out discrepancies and amended returns.
good,Great to place start and get some good experience. It is what you make of it so make the most of it.
good,The culture speaks for itself. Probably the best place to boost morale. Made life long friends and a great experience overall.
good,"Cashier, burista, and runner. Hardest part of the job was balancing school and work hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was all the benefits"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo

good,Create Marketing solutions/promotions for clients based all over the country using the various verticals at The Walt Disney Company India  Pvt. Ltd. Support the sales team by creating properties and working on client briefs for incremental revenue.
good,Walt Disney was a joy to work for. Everything you can imagine in an employeer.
good,"hours were and salary were not enough but the job was great. co workers were great, guest were great."
good,"Ce fût une expérience humaine et professionnelle enrichissante, car j’ai pu travailler au sein d’une équipe sensible"
good,"It was a very productive work enviroment. I learn how to process international product and drive fork lift. Management was alway on the floor and available. The employee help trained and would help in anyway need. The way easy, I found nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed coming to work so that I could collect dollar to shop at the warehouse store before Christmas."
good,"It's been great working at one of the most dynamic Entertainment Company in the world.  Disney is full of culture, and they care about their employees.  Work environment is great, as everyone seems to be very professional.  It's a great plus when you work in the Studio lot, you really feel like a big family here."
good,It was an ok job I really enjoyed working there everybody was cool
good,Being able to have fave to face interaction with the guest was something that i really enjoyed.
good,Ensure that every guest have a unique service and have knowledge of you work place.
good,"Great 1st job! Pay is just above minimum age, but it is super fun for something part time! "
good,"Disney's a desirable work location that is well known for stability and security... however that comes at a price.  Wages are lower than market and the benefits package is fairly weak; the company places a lot of financial ""value"" in the discounted offerings of its own products/services."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking thousands of pictures a day of many different people. You learn a lot about tolerance and a lot about people being that there are so many different kinds of people from all over the world. All 20,000 cast members work as a team. The hardest part about the job is trying to maintain your character on stage when you're greeted by a Make A Wish child or adult. The best part of working at Disney is making magic. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking 3-10 inbound calls per hour (depending how long each call lasts) in a call center environment, taking guests personal information, either reserving reservations, modifying, taking payments, or answering general knowledge questions."
good,The Walt Disney Company is constantly changing and evolving. I have learned so much by being able to contribute to different segments across the company.
good,The company is big so there is room for growth if you are prepared with education and experience.
good,Good company to work and learn many things
good,"no trabalho o bom e lidar com pessoas a tratar as pessoas melhor ,tendo em frente uma boa direção que de força para enfrentarmos o dia-dia e também ter uma boa equipe ,e para mim no inicio era enfrentar o publico mas agora não tenho mas isso comigo e a parte melhor de tudo isso e quando vc acaba o expediente si sentindo realizada com que fez ,e que no final deu tudo certo."
good,Stayed connected with the company by promoting the internship to other college students.
good,My experience with the Walt Disney company has shown me that there are limitless possibilities within the company to do whatever it is you want to do. Opportunities for advancement are everywhere all you need to do is decide what you want and go after it.
good,This was the best job that Ive ever worked I was so upset when they closed
good,"I miss Disney. The experience, the people, the job security...all amazing aspects of this job. I still miss it, but not enough to go back. I would rather just keep the memories and friendships I have made and move on, unless I were to get an offer in management or in corporate somehow, then I would consider it. The only thing I had a problem with is Disney's attendance policy. I understand the need to show up for work, but to expect someone to clock in 15 minutes early---without getting paid for it---and then give them a reprimand for being one minute late isn't fair. You get points on your record, and they never leave. It's like your employee credit report, only they never go away. You pretty much have to sell your soul to the company. They pay you little then work you like a dog, but on the upside, I think out of the 2 years I worked there, I only really had 1 bad day. Also, I think they exercise too much control as far as their policies with health services are concerned. If you are okay to work, and your doctor says you can work, then you should be able to without having your area leaders or a health service cast member make those judgement calls for you. My complaints are few though...I love this company and what they stand for, and the benefits are unmatched. They treat their cast members exceptionally well!!! If you are looking to love your job and have constant fun, then you need to work here. Everyone deserves to experience something truly magical and I doubt you will be disappointed :) Plus, if you do work for Disney, you can literally get a job anywhere! At least,"
good,guests luggage to and from room. to get along with all
good,Working at Disney's Animal Kingdom was enjoyable. Making everyone's dreams come true and making their day by doing the smallest gestures. Especially when interacting with the kids that come to experience the magic. Surrounded by the nicest co-workers all there to help in any way possible. With plenty of advancement and Managers that were willing to help.
good,"A typical day would include first prepping staion to par. Learned a lot about French cuisine. Management was more like personal trainers, they were great. My co-workers kept a nice atmosphere for the most part."
good,When I first start working at New Breed Disney it was the best thing ever because I like the hours I was working and the people ingthat I work around and the hardest part of my job was nothing because everything went smooth and easy like they told me . I also learn how to check the upc to make sure it match up with the same skew on the boxes .
good,Love working with my team. Never worked with a team as such. My team is my second family and the reward of being able to work with international students and such a positive team at Disney is PRICELESS.
good,Fun place to work. Very educational and everyday was enjoyable. learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Flex time and work from home optionsi management is great and a lot of opportunities are offered,"
good,• Guest/Customer Service
good,"Disney is, as a company, working to keep their, and your, data secure. The attitudes of the security teams are proactive and look toward new ways of identifying the vulnerabilities as rapidly as possible, then remediating them."
good,I absolutely love my job and every guest interaction I hold. My fellow cast members and managers make working there feel good and not stressful. I only wish I would get more hours.
good,"At the end of the day, you're working for Disney. The perks and benefits are awesome. The pay is not. Managers are hit or miss and I was blessed with awesome managers."
good,C'est une entreprise où il est très agréable de travailler. Avec des valeurs saines et un environnement de travail collaboratif.
good,I really enjoy working for this company. I got to meet people from all over the world and network. I never would have been able to do this if I hadn't worked for the company.
good,"Great benefits but there's a bit of lack of communication between management and employees , and lack of proper response by management to resolve problems."
good,"I love feeling a part of the ‘Magic’ at Disney. Diversity is important. It’s very important to be punctual and cheerful!  An excited and eager  attitude help tremendously in the interview. ), Disney park access is a big perk. Be prepared to be called in and asked to work if you are part time. If you make yourself available, you can get lots more hours.  To me, it was worth it. I love Disney and to enjoy the parks on my days off was worth it! You do work hard and be prepared to work in some inclement weather."
good,It was a fun place to work but it has a very demanding overtime schedule and it is quite far from my residence. If you don't mind long hours it is a pretty fun job.
good,"Working at a gift shop, this was a typical retail position without the added pressure of commission and pushing sales. The training is great and the work environment is enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyed my time with them, only spent a week between Melbourne and Brisbane. But everyone was nice and helpful. We showed up and were given a rundown of what to do and what to expect. They had high expectations and were supportive if you made mistakes."
good,"It was a good experience, with good perks. Good management with a view to ensure hard work is recognized. People are friendly, and quality of work is excellent. Ability to try different types of work"
good,"Amazing company to work for with several incredible opportunities. Because of how many locations there are at Disney, you are always able to find a place that best suits you and your goals."
good,"You are assigned a station and are responsible to set up and prep your station for service. The workplace was very diversified, team oriented, and professional. I enjoyed the experience and knowledge I gained during my time with company."
good,"During the DCP, you meet a lot of amazing and diverse people and personalities and create a lot of unforgettable experiences. You are able to go to the theme parks an unlimited amount of times and enjoy a hefty discount as well. Although, when you are not scheduled to work, unless you're extremely dedicated to going to the parks, you will most likely be trying to catch up on sleep and laundry."
good,"Working in the parks, its a hit or miss with management. Some are kind and care a lot about how happy you are working there, some don't even bother to learn your name. The former group also obviously cares more about the guest experience while the latter only cares about their own personal advancement within the company."
good,"Disney is a great place to work. Work life balance is encouraged and they offer a ton of flexibility with hours and ability to work remotely. Management is for the most part good but there is a lot of variation in experience. The workplace culture promotes a lot of autonomy - but changing priorities often comes in the way of being able to truly innovate. Overall, working at the Walt Disney Co has been a positive experience for me."
good,"Working behind the scene is a dream come true. You get to make the day of a guest special, great benefits and discounts all over property for all employees. Great work culture."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,The company made you feel important and allowed you to make decisions. Numerous company events that you could attend. Only negative is pay was low and not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Not much to say that isn't already known about working at Disney. Park entry perks are great, always a positive environment to work in, but the earning potential is minimal unless in certain roles."
good,"Great place to work, great culture, great people and leaders. I would have loved to stay at Disney, but the benefits and loyalty to employees are slowly being chipped away by some short sighted executives. Be mindful of the glass ceiling and high level of bureaucracy, but it is also a great learning opportunity to navigate through the politics and potentially impact global change."
good,"Loved working for the company.    Pay could've been better.  There were so many ways they play the metrics, so they aren't in your favor like releasing promotions the last couple days of the month, so you're only getting revisions and not new reservations.  I'll work for them again some day.  I got to ride in a private jet because of this job AND got in free to the parks."
good,productive and fun working place with many pop-up events. I learned how to work under pressure and how to network throughout the company. The workplace culture is great and welcoming.
good,Both magical and not magical moments working for the Walt Disney Company but such is life. Wages are not the best but Disney makes up for that with the discounts offered.
good,"J'aime travaillé sur le parc, les employeurs sont très aimables"
good,"This job teaches you many skills including, next level customer service, patience, and an incredible ability to problem solve. It had very inconsistent hours for anyone who is not full time, yet wonderful benefits including unlimited access to Walt Disney World and all of its theme parks. The management differed immensely between locations."
good,This was the most fast-paced work environment I had stepped into at this point and it taught me a lot about a sense of urgency and customer service. It was a great work experience for myself and I'm glad I worked there for and long as I did and met great people from there.
good,"Great for diverse cultures, languages and nationalities."
good,"Not just the happiest place on earth, Disney is a well managed financially driven business which offers a reasonable work/life balance.  Each business unit has it's own culture and there is very little collaboration across them.  Some areas are extremely political especially the higher you go.  Being part of the ""magic"" as they say is a big benefit and overall comp is fair though known not to be competitive with like competitors in the LA market because some people just want to work at Disney."
good,"Wonderful brand to be part of and proud of, working in teams with very fun, talented and smart people. Fast paced work environment with opportunity for advancement for those willing to put in the effort."
good,"Expérience inoubliable , une équipe formidable , des conditions de travail magique ."
good,"There are no typical days here. Every shift comes with new and exciting possibilities. From the time you put on your costume and go on stage until the time you clock out you will encounter any number of things. From simply giving guests directions to taking the company vehicle and delivering forgotten luggage to a guest who already checked out. The one constant is Disney culture which consists of exceptional guest service, efficiency, safety and show."
good,"I was an associate and promoted to a specialist. Generally, agents get to talk about Disney vacations all day which is great if you love the product. The training was VERY thorough and included trips to the property to get to know the product. Every now and then characters come into the office for photo ops, or there is free food/snacks, and with the release of a movie comes a special treat. You get a small commission from the total sales assuming you do well with customer service, accuracy, and efficiency.  Sometimes you can do great on a call, but if a guest rates you poorly it affects your bonus.  If you have to leave, you will not receive any bonus from the previous month.  Cons: a ton of people cheat the system and take a ton of time off.  Colleagues try to manipulate sales calls but eventually, they all get caught, which is great.  Tons of room for advancement.  My hours 215-1115 pm never got to change (wasn't there long enough), and the Friday-Tuesday work week made it hard for me to see my family.  All of this being said, this was my dream job and I would do it again, I had to leave due to relocation."
good,"Ambiente piacevole, la cultura aziendale rispecchia la realtà di una multinazionale americana."
good,There is great room for expanding your role in the company. Management is excellent and there are great perks to the job. It may be difficult to apply for full time status or have a reliable schedule.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Working the internship was an amazing life experience.  Certain places in the resort are better to work at than others.  While most of the management is wonderful, some unfortunately are not.  Overall,  a great experience that should be taken if possible"
good,"Rewarding workplace with terrific benefits. Awesome to get to meet people from all over the world and a great feeling making their ""Dream Vacation"" one that they will never forget."
good,"The company is very solid, but we feel that work is never safe, they have a secret shopper if for some reason you did not did say all the story time they you are in trouble"
good,TWD company is totally committed to delivering what is right for the customer. They are very protective of the service they give and the experience received.
good,"Depending upon the location all work tasks, environment, compensation, and all other benefits vary. Overall, a great place to work and gain experience."
good,"Overall the Walt Disney Company has been good to me.  Depending on where you work in the company though will determine how well you are treated overall.  I enjoyed the staff and children at the childcare center.  It was nice seeing everyone's smiling faces, it helped to brighten up my days."
good,"Great experience working at Disneyland. It is almost always constantly fast paced, from working the front of house, at least in the restaurant setting, to working the dinning area and helping with the other cast members. Most everyone was a blast to work with, despite sometimes not really having time to really talk with other cast members."
good,I LOVED my managers and fellow cast members. This was honestly one of the best jobs ive ever had and i created life long friends from working here. Wouldn't trade the time I worked here for anything in the world. They truly brought more magic to my world.
good,"No job was the same, no day was the same.  I have enjoyed over 21 years with The Walt Disney Company and wealth of experience I gained, the friendships I made and the connections forged are those that will last a lifetime!"
good,Very enjoyable place to work with a lot of variety and opportunity. Positive work environment! The ability to move within lines of business allows for new challenges to seek.
good,Fun experience learning about Disney's culture. Really is the happiest place on Earth. Some areas have great managers and others do not. The perks are worth the not great managers.
good,"I have no complaints about working for Disney.  I have been proud to work for such a prestigious company who time and again dominates the entertainment media industry by focusing on quality.  People that work there are passionate and really enjoy what they do.  Management by and large makes smart decisions, and the work culture has been great.  Being in the entertainment business, job stability is much more chaotic."
good,"Zeer enerverend bedrijf om voor te werken, zeer leuke collega's, tot op heden nog steeds in contact en nog diverse kleine opdrachten aangenomen."
good,I worked from home for Disney Dining and I loved it! they pay was good and I got to choose my own schedule! the only thing was we got no discounts for Disney as much as I love them.
good,"Disney paid a competitive salary including housing, travel, medical and dental.  The work week was Thurs- Mon. and expect to work 10 to 12 hour days on weekends.  However, the weekdays were around 5 hour days.  The lessons were already prepared but instructors must prepare class activities surrounding the lesson plan.  I enjoyed my 14 months teaching English to students and I really enjoyed traveling China seeing all the sights."
good,posto stupendo sia con cliente sia con colleghi l'unico peccato che era uno stage il quale sia finito
good,"Great Company to work for, like family.  Industry is challenging but rewarding.  Every day was a new challenge. There was career opportunity within the company."
good,"During the days in Walt Disney Company, though the main work is to support the authorized manager, there are still a lot of activities. The company not only provides lots of intern training, but also gives us opportunities to attend the Walt Disney's sales meeting, annual meeting and CBME to know the future development of the company."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I would recommend anyone who loves Disney or children to work for this company.  It was one of my favorite places to work.  The support we received from our management team was wonderful.  The training you receive is above and beyond any that I had ever experienced.
good,"A typical day may vary based on the job required. Training is typically 24 hours spaced over three days. This is the time in which new hires or cross training at the attraction is done, teaching individuals how day operation is ran based on an operational guide and Disney Four Key standards. As a floor Lead, you are to lead cast by example, perform performance and show audits, and act as a supervisor for the attraction. When necessary, provide guest recovery as well as provide coaching for cast members on inappropriate conduct."
good,"Disney has a melange of people coming from different professional backgrounds."
good,"This is a great company for people and has a family/community feel.  There is lots of opportunity to move to affiliated companies as well as any of the other theme parks around the world.  There is room for management growth, even if you don't have a college degree. "
good,"I made many memories for not just our guest who enter the Disneyland Resort but also our business side. I have learned many ways of how to manage our daily operation as well as our special events. During my time, I networked with many individuals who have brought our company together. Such as Walt Disney Imagineering, Walt Disney Studios, and PIXAR. During my scheduled shifts, I would act if I was a leader and made many suggestions and helped plan out daily operations. The hardest part of my job was to plan accordingly during our changing schedules for appearances for characters and photographers. What I enjoyed the most during my time was interacting with our guest and cast as we made everyday an enjoyable experience."
good,Disney was great place to really enter a world of fun and safety. The cast members there are amazing and I loved being there! Wish there was better pay and more hours but still fun!
good,"Overall, Media Networks Inc. is a nice place to work. It is a fun atmosphere and every worker is kind and courteous. Management does well in fostering a friendly and less stressful work environment."
good,"A typical day involves planning the activities for  the children and ensuring that the activities have been done well. During my experience as an assistant I have learned many practical aspects of children as compared to my academic experience. I have learned that children should never be dealt with on the basis of their abilities because they are different in every aspect. Generally the management at Disney Stars Academy is excellent and they show organisation in their activities. In dealing with young children I have worked with four co-workers who are ladies as well and all of them married. I have learned a lot from them and enjoy working with them. The hardest part of the job that I have discovered is that sometimes you may lose your temper on some naughty children of which one has to be tolerant as much as possible. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is that children are very great and intelligent young people with much to learn from them."
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed guest interaction. Led a team of Boat Captains with a fleet of 8 boats holding 100+ traveling between Epcot and Hollywood Studios as well as 2 vessels inside Epcot moving guests across lagoon.
good,"I always loved coming into work on a laid back day, because on days with less guest flow, you can get more personal with the guests and talk to them and hear about their vacation to the happiest place on Earth. It meant the world to me."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Disney New Breed. The staff was nice and friendly and flexible when it came to work schedules, hours, and time off. I would love to work for the company again if I lived in Memphis."
good,Stagnant. little opportunity for growth and development.
good,Fun and challenging place to work.  Involves working with multiple employees across various lines of businesses to accomplish shared goals/projects.
good,"during a typical day, we would produce cupcakes, brownies, cakes, of all different types. I learned how to work with large equipment like the spot machine, dough sheeter, and large kitchen appliances. I liked the different desserts we were allowed to make that each went to a different restaurant/ area in the Hollywood Studios park and resorts. My co-workers and managers were very helpful and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was working with mass quantities, which was a good skill to learn. The most enjoyable part was that it was all based around one mouse, and it was always incorporated into each dessert."
good,"I help bring the "" Magic"" to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure Resorts. Everyday is different one day I'll be helping fellow cast members into their costumes and bringing the Disney "" Magic"" the next day be supporting the Pixar Play Parade. Helping Disney's characters to be show ready and be that "" Magic"". I enjoy the fact that I help bring smiles to Disney's guests even in the smallest of ways."
good,I really enjoy my job my employees are fun and funny but we work hard and we get the job done. My supervisor is nice but not too nice. She helps me out when i need and she does what she can to look out for us. she doesn't show favoritism to any of us. management do what they can to make the work area as comfortable as possibly. the pay is ok but it not enough for me at the moment. thats why im look for a second job. Ive been working here for almost 3 years and i do see myself a this job longer. all in all its a GOOD job.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning as well as interacting with the guests. I learned how to interact with the guests and to never point with one finger due to it can be an insult in some cultures. Management was great, they always made sure I was doing good and always asked if I needed anything. My co-workers were friendly and helped me out if they had the opportunity. The ""hardest"" part of my job was 'killing' time waiting for occupied rooms to clear out or take their Privacy door signs down. While I waited I cleaned and got the checkout rooms ready that I did not have to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to gain the experience of getting to interact with guests from different cultures."
good,Playdom has good working environment. co-workers are cooperative
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I enjoy what I do and the perks of being able to take my family to Disneyland for free is amazing. I just wish there were more opportunities for advancement. Currently working part time, and would like to kick it to the next level."
good,"Worked as a Data Center Migrations Manager for Disney. Its a massive organization with multiple sub-companies still it lives upto one Disney brand. The work culture is fun filled, offices are lively and project teams are always cheerful."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Not being able to park on property is a con, but a small one. Works well with your other schedules, but you do get some late shifts. Benefits are great, like getting into the parks for free. Obvious job security, possibility for advancement, but sort of rare. Management team is great, with a few exceptions."
good,"I am self learner, learn new system called American Contractor.  Benefits are not good but ok. The company does not get any contract so there is no job security."
good,I was contracted as a Network Engineer by CNS/ACS to aid KerPoof in the migration to Disney’s network.  I helped trouble-shoot and test both wireless and VoIP devices and connectivity.  Responsible for layer 1 work with regards to Wireless PolyComs and Cisco’s VG204’s.  This is a short-term project which includes any and all network needs and problems related to the Kerpoof/Disney Network and is classified as “hyper-care” work.
good,"I enjoy working at Spring Foods. The days are a bit slow to start, but they tend to pick up later in the day towards closing time. It is not very challenging as everything is pretty easy to do there. Co-workers can be a bit hard to work with. There is really no hard part about this job. All the tasks can be completed in a timely manner."
good,"Ótima empresa para se crescer profissionalmente, ótimo plano de carreira e ótima para desenvolver seus conhecimentos e adquirir novos."
good,assisting customers with call in orders or inquires from the disney catalogue. Also handling guest relations.
good,"low wages, stick around because of good people who you work with"
good,"The typical day at work started with a group meeting indicating which specific position on the parade route was your responsibility. Each meeting the manager on duty was responsible for speaking to the group about the proper way to be a Disney employee. For example making the experience for all guests a magical one, and going above and beyond for each guest. I learned a lot from the Disney Program, how to work with all different types of people, the background of Disney, but the most importantly I learned excellent customer service. Disney taught all employees the proper way to handle all different types of situations, from unhappy guests, lost children to medical emergencies. My co-workers came from all around the world, from Puerto Rico, London and China just to name a few. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unhappy guests throughout the summer time. My job was Parade Audience Control and our purpose was to make sure all guests were abiding by the safety rules during parades, and if there was a safety issue it needed to be handled immediately and properly. For example I had a situation where I was in charge and a man started to have a seizure right in front of me, I immediately got medical attention and maintained a safe perimeter around the guest so other guests would not interfere. Even though the hardest part of the job was dealing with guests the most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was interacting with all the children and families. Seeing the children mesmerized by their favorite character was priceless. Through my program I have several families"
good,"Enjoy working with the Disney store, most important i love working with kids and making there welcome unforgettable and making there dreams in the Disney store come true. It was a fun environment to work with co-workers and managers."
good,"I completed the Disney College Program. Disney is organized, responsible, and has much to offer their employees."
good,Great place to work if you loved Disney as a kid. Strict rules though.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Solid strategies and market share. Fun environment and work/life balance is encouraged.
good,This job is not for the weak at heart.  It is fun and fast-pace and the individual must be able to balance work and personal life well.  I walked about 8-15 miles a day so it is very physically demanding.  I learned how to always have a smile on my face.
good,"Schedule was never set in stone, so you could work mornings all one week and then closings the next. Management was always willing to help, never hard to get a hold of. Hardest part was dealing with guests whose requests could not be met, as a cast member we could only do so much. Most enjoyable part was also the guests, because it was extremely rewarding to put a family's trip back on track if it was going awry, or just to make it better."
good,Each day you encountered different guests (either to the park or your own employees) and were cultured in many ways.  I was able to grow as an individual over the three years I was employed by this company.  I would still be working for the company if the cast members were paid wages that are livable - not being forced to find numerous roommates or work 50-70 hour work weeks to get by the skin of our teeth.
good,"Incredible experience learning about the diverse people who come to experience Walt Disney World, to create magic and instill people's dreams. Not only getting the chance to have new opportunities, but chances for grow amongst yourself and change for the better"
good,"1-Involved in a  project on building and designing a car model using SolidWorks. My role was finding the best model in shape that can have less weight in order to get more drag force inside a wind tunnel. Teamwork was a key for this type of project and it helped me to understand the importance of a team. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Working at Disney was a lot of fun and enjoyable. The people are kind and the job rewarding. The benefits are wonderful! Management can be a challenge and getting time off is very challenging.
good,"In my division specifically, great working culture and work/life balance. Senior management treats the staff with respect and fairly. We just do things right."
good,Disney warehouse was my first job as an adult. This job taught me responsible and a lot about myself. It taught me to work hard and get the task done . I picked up a sewing trade also .
good,"I worked for the WDTC for 7 years. The beginning was hard, trying to get full time or even enough hours to compensate for benefits, but once I “paid my dues” whatever I could do and wanted to do, I was able to apply for and work for. The Cast Members I worked wit and for were amazing. This was truly a dream come true. The position wasn’t what I was “dreaming” for, but one I relished and enjoyed thoroughly. As with any job, you’ll have co-workers that aren’t willing to pull their weight, or management that isn’t uk to par, but I feel like most of the standards put into place, took care of the people that weren’t meant to be there. This has been the best job I e ever had and wish I could come back on so many occasions "
good,"If I could afford to live in Orlando on what Disney paid me I never would have left.  "
good,"Great place to work, managers are always nice. Co-workers are fun to be around. So many areas to grow and move up to a different department. Would work here again."
good,a good fun work place with decent benefits and decent scheduling. only problem is that its always busy year round and harder to get time off during holidys.
good,Enjoyed working there. Disney had excellent benefits. Was able to earn a lot of vacation time fast working overtime because it was based on how many hours you worked.
good,It was nice working with Walt Disney.Work environment is very good to work with.Sometimes it was very challenging to work and sometimes it was fun to work with.
good,Most of the staff I worked with were great. I made life long friends. The benefits offered for cast members are wonderful and their service and training is outstanding.
good,"The project was great, the team was very good, everyone know what to do, the brief given to me was detailed and there was a follow up on everthing. So overall great experience."
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits and employee discounts.  Many high standards to live up too but if you just do it not a problem.  Overall great experience."
good,Working for Disney is all about balance. I learned a lot from my leaders and head chefs. Being apart of Disney made me become a better chef and taught me new skills and teamwork most importantly.
good,"cashiering, playing with kids, organizing, making magic were things I looked forward to throughout the day. I learned to have great customer service and have fun while doing my job."
good,Gran desarrollo de actividades internas para mantener el buen ambiente.
good,It's an amazing company to work with. They offer an incredible experience to learn customer service and retail experience. I highly recommended to those in the Hotel Management Business.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I worked for Disney for the limited 18 months as a temp with the promise to get hired on.  Unfortunately there is the maximum temp rule of 18 months.  I did my job really well, loved all the people I worked with, and was given many more responsibilities because of the future of becoming a full-time employee.  I loved my time there and would love the opportunity again."
good,It has been the start of the position but I am hopeful to learn and grow within the company.  I have slowly learned new things and look forward to growing.  I enjoy the team and the opportunities offered.
good,"A typical day as a Banquets steward was to get dishes, hotboxes, and food out to party venues in a presentable and timely fashion. The management team for the Banquets department are a wonderful and delightful bunch of people who you have the pleasure of working with because they are always trying to help and see if there is a easier or more efficient way to do a job/task. Hardest part of the job would be the schedule, it changes every week. Example would be two days as a morning steward, next day as a night steward, and next two days would alternate between day and night. But the most enjoyable part of the job would be to see the joy on the guests and the staffs faces after a well planned and executed party."
good,"Working at the Walt Disney Company was a great experience.  It gave me the opportunity to grow and learn the business of entertainment and production in the theme-park industry.  The company has a great 'brand"" and will always bring great product to the world!"
good,"Very quick paced which is what I like and also very friendly. The environment is calm and professional. As for the staff, they are respectful, hard working, dedicated, and very prompt on time management."
good,Worked in the kitchen doing food prep. Schedules can be inconsistent. Long hours on your feet and can be tough on your whole body. Prep things can take awhile to get use to it but other than everyone is helpful.
good,"Aria lavorativa perfetta, sempre disponibili dallo store manager fino all'ultimo arrivato. Negozio bellissimo e gestione lavorativa turno/ore perfetta"
good,"A lot of room for growth and a lot of support from higher-ups."
good,"The Walt Disney Co. es una empresa reconocida por muchos gracias a su parques y caricaturas. Tuve el privilegio de ser parte del equipo de trabajo de uno de los parque llamado Disney's Hollywood Studios. Donde la cultura organizacional es muy diversa por la varidad de nacionalidades que laboran en el parque. Un tipico dia de  trabajo contiene mucha organzacion para el ofrecer el servicio, mucha interaccion con el visitante y constante comunicacion con los gerentes y supervisores para lograr las metas. Mi experiencia dentro de la empresa fue gratificante  ya que pude ser parte de los procesos gerenciales del establecimiento en donde trabajaba."
good,"The Company,  the Prestige,  the Management,  The sales representatives and the support were so amazing.  I was leading sales in the Southwest Region when I lost my job.  I was so so so bummed I was calling on big accounts like Toyota AND Lexus that were spending an Average of 400k annually.  These were great times and I was calling on clients that wanted to to see you in person and hear what you had to say. Management was supportive and positive and willing to help you on anything that you needed."
good,"Check resort for fallen palm fronds and Irrigation leaks, water potted plants, Learned how important costumer service is. Management was fair and understanding. The Hardest part of job was dealing with unhappy guests and most enjoyable part of job was making those unhappy guests happy again"
good,"Culture is important with Disney. If you have a passion for the brand you will find success. They love to promote from within, I started as a cast member and within my 9 years with the company I moved up to an ASM position. I walked away with management skills and strong metric skills. It isn't all fun though, the Holidays is the biggest time of year, people tend to think its lighthearted and easy, but you really put in work during the holidays. I truly enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"Great Benefits"
good,"I had a good experience in my role, but it's a big company, so I can't speak for everyone within the organization. Unfortunately, with so many roles I'm not sure if I am representative of the average employee."
good,"My job would be greeting all customers and serving them aswell. handling money such as handing them back change and using great manners. Giving kids their toys and seeing them smile, receiving feedback from customers about your manners and great customer service."
good,"Working in Disney theme parks is hard and fun work. The pros are: you get to meet people from around the world, help in making kids and adults days magical. It's not an easy job, but you learn how to interact with new people everyday."
good,"C'est une entreprise énorme. Il y a tout type de poste possible. Il y a également des opportunités de développement. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"My day at work start with filling the maps and cleaning the turnstile, preparing the park for our wonderful guest to enjoy. i learn in Disneyland that our Guest satisfactory is our mean priority.  the management in Disneyland is one of the best if not the best, very supportive and stand by you even in the time of misfortune. i work in a supportive workplace, every cast member respect each other differences and culture, no idea is neglected, but approach every idea with a good critical thinking skill. The hardest part of the job is dealing with troublesome guest because sometimes they will push you or call you names, but as a good cast member, i always try to find ways to calm them down and try to know why they are angry and also look for the solution of the problem if possible. my most enjoyable part of this my job is seeing the smile  of the face of my guest when they are leaving my turnstile and their recommendation about me, that alone give me a great joy knowing that i did make someone happy."
good,"Disney is an all around great company to work for. On the other hand the position that I worked was too much for a woman, but overall nice, good benefits, friendly environment."
good,I work at the hotels which are never slow. It is very fast paced and you look out for yourself. The management is not too helpful and you are encouraged to do things yourself. You find your own solutions. I love assisting the guest throughout their whole vacation. The hardest part are the guest that just want to complain.
good,"Not much I can really think to say at the moment. My favorite part of the job was that I immediately became friends with a few other coworkers and we always would assist each other with cleaning rooms so we could all finish in a reasonable amount of time. However, when they left the job and I was by myself I struggled due to lack of emotional support. It was great learning experience anyway."
good,"Great place to work. Everyone in the department I work in are very nice and helpful. It's a very cooperative environment. Disney Studios has fun events for special days, including a Halloween party, Holiday party, Easter egg hunts, special treats for Mickey and Walt's birthdays, etc."
good,"I worked for Disney in FL at two separate intervals. Each was different, and presented their own set of challenges; but both were rewarding. I was a bell services cast member both times, and I took classes through the college program. I enjoyed both the rewards and challenges of being on a team in a constantly busy environment . I feel that the greatest skill I took from my time with Disney was problem solving under pressure. I was treated no differently from any other college program student, a price I willingly paid for the opportunity to work for the company. I would do it all again for a chance at joining the Walt Disney creative team."
good,The time there was a blast. I really enjoyed myself and the work there definitely set me up for success when I joined the military. I would definitely work for Disney again if I had the opportunity.
good,Working at Walt Disney World was a dream come true. I was able to sharpen my skills as a retail worker and create magical moments for our guest. I always felt welcomed and encouraged to try my best every day. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my guest find the things they need and finding out more about them in the process.
good,"Although I was only hired to work the holiday season, the core cast members were welcoming and fun to work with. The work itself was not necessarily hard but learning and incorporating the ""Disney language"" into every guest interaction was challenging. For me, the most enjoyable aspect of this job was the sing-alongs that we did with the younger guests. You can't not smile when all the cast members in the store randomly bust out in song!"
good,I worked for the Disney Store for 5 years. Like any job there was bad with the good. I was lucky enough to have worked with great cast members and an awesome management team. The only downside was the weekends were mandatory and during the holiday season you weren't allowed to request any time off. Its mandatory to work on Thanksgiving and there was no employee parkings so trying to find parking was hard. Besides that the perks alone is worth it.
good,"Magical company, for artists, and executives alike.  Tremendous open minded culture, and content creation tools available."
good,"No day was like any of the other. It would always be busy and you could count on a little competition. Your day would be filled with magic and the relationship between every single collegue was amazing. Even though everyone were friends, there were a certain respect for managers."
good,the workplace is amazing. it has its setbacks from cosmetic issues or frustration with the systems. But for the most part its great for the people you meet
good,"You have to be super energetic to be a cast member at Disney, and over all enjoy creating magical moments for guest of all ages.  always put the guest first but also make sure that you all complying with all the Disney policies."
good,"Although I was part of a huge, sudden lay off, I am not in any way upset at TWDC. It's what to expect when you work for such a huge corporation. "
good,"Disney gave me experience and confidence to start my life as a professional. Don't need previous experience to work in Disney, as this company trains you very well to get the job done. Excellent cast member benefits"
good,My experience working at disney was a great one. Typical day assisting guest on sales floor as well as dealing with hard lines and soft-line material. Every day was a memorable day seeing the guest happy as well as the name itself made it fun
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Wonderful experience and great introduction into the theme park and hospitality industry. My start here was in quick service and gave me a great perspective on what it was like working for such a big name company, specifically in a normal ""unglamorized"" role. At first I was sad I was not able to make it into the entertainment side of Disney, but later on I realized I could never be more grateful. I gained so much more valuable and applicable guest service experience from my College Program with Disney, and even did so well that I was promoted to a trainer which doesn't normally happen. From there I only gained eve more valuable experience in what it was like to be in charge of training other coworkers, which was something I truly loved and enjoyed. Teaching and helping others is something I'm very passionate about, and not only that but becoming a trainer gave me wonderful experience to take with me and put on my resume as well. The hardest part of this job was honestly just that pay and the fact that the college program has become a way for Disney to take advantage of cheap labor more than anything else these days.I appreciate it so much for what it did for me, but now it just frustrates me as it steals away hours and opportunities from full and part-time cast members that actually live here and depend on their jobs at Disney."
good,"Disney has an amazing, happy and creative work culture. I loved interning there, and hope to continue working with the company in California."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is the best company I have had the privilege to work for hands down.  A typical day at work is between 8 and 11 hours, with 95% being customer facing.  As supervisor I was able to join in many activities including dancing with Stitch, doing crafts with Tinkerbell, or even making messy science with a crazy professor.  I would also check regularly for allergies of children in care, as well as make follow up calls to parents regarding care, behavior or other child related issues.  Being responsible for up to 350 kids at a time is certainly challenging, however it certainly taught me how to be an effective leader in delegation, trust and true team work."
good,"Trabalhar na Disney World, não é nada menos esperado que mágico, o treinamento da empresa, suas visões, missões são coisas que permanecem você após o período de trabalho na empresa, acrescentando tanto no profissional quanto no pessoal. Como uma empresa que representa a magia o grupo de coordenadores e gerentes mantém uma harmonia ótima durante o trabalho."
good,A great Group of Leaders and Cast with a sense of pride like no other! The cast is extremely friend and take feedback extremely well. The spirit of Disney is instilled in every aspect of this resort.
good,"typical day would be moderate-heavy office work,  guest concerns, planning events/meetings, tours, assisting employees"
good,"Like any large corporation, there will be ups and downs. Stay flexible. Go with the flow. And always put yourself out there for new experiences, this will help you advance."
good,"Every time it was great, you meet a lot of people all around the world and you are the person that makes them fell comfortable all time."
good,"-Love my co-workers"
good,"Interning for Disney was an amazing learning experience. Although the hours were long. I was able to explore, interact, and create dreams for people all over the world. I worked in Downtown Disney at W.O,D (World of Disney) as a merchandiser. The store has over 13 different locations in one and I had the chance to work in all of them. while interning there I learned about teamwork, product display, and from the inside out about the entertainment business. I work with over a thousand employees, coordinators, and managers. Most of my co-workers are CP's (College Program Students) like me. They were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the Job is the ability to move around. Sometimes it would be so packed in the store it would be difficult to help find something for someone through the crowd. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I had the opportunity to help make a family's experience there a memorable one. In fact, I remember we had a game we would play in the store called ""Finding Nemo"", where I would hide a stuff Nemo toy in the store and recruit guest to find it. Seeing the look on the kids faces as they go running looking for the toy made my heart smile. The parents would enjoy it as well, sometimes join in on the fun!"
good,"Working for Disney's Guest Connection Services was a great experience.  I enjoyed helping Guests with the challenges they encountered on their vacations.  Often it was as simple as making a dining reservation, other times I offered compensation on a case by case basis.  My job was always a challenge!"
good,"learnt to do bay dispatch pick rework, always had people to help if needed friendly co workers but always made sure that the jobs where done and ontime as it was nightshift"
good,"         My job in Walt Disney Company was sale representative. I worked at Outdoor Food. Everyday I was moved different location in the Hollywood Studio. I learned how to communicate and make customer happy. I had a good experience during the time when I worked at Walt Disney Company. Employees of Walt Disney Company are diversity. Some of them came from French, some of them came from China and so on. I learned difference of different culture.The hardest part of the job is ensuring customer's satisfaction. "
good,This was one of my most benefiting workplaces. Very structured and professional.  I learned a wealth of information and techniques while working here.  
good,I was in high school at that time and looking for a summer job. Disney couldnt be any better fit for me at that time. 
good,"great work culture and a great company to work for. "
good,"Disney provides excellent resources for learning and career exploration. If I had decided to continue working in advertising sales, I would definitely continue on in the company. "
good,"I really enjoyed my department, my coworkers and managers were patient and really wanted to make me feel apart of the team. My manager was supportive of intern activities and open to negotiating my working ours."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"i enjoyed my time at the company. i learned how to work with a team as a team. the best part of the day is when production is high and co-workers is smiling, it does or was days where things wasn't good as others,but that's a part of the working field"
good,"Working at Disney Store is just amazing. The opportunity that you have and all that you learn at work is massive. Not only are you having fun at work, it is really a good experience, but you also learn how to maintain a high-standard-wise environment, and to serve guests (customers) with 100% efficiency."
good,"A typical day at work mostly consist of many guest interaction mostly handling any issues, selling tickets, checking in and out guest and making sure guest are satisfied with there stay. I have work many different kind of people that has given many new experience and learn new ways to deal with different situation. If a situation comes along that is to much for me to handle my leaders are always there eager to assist me. The hardest part of my job is when our system is not working correctly and caused guest to be unsatisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a guest telling you how much they enjoyed there stay because of you and the reason why they keep returning is because of you."
good,"Working at Disneyland Resort while finishing bachelor's degree. Excellent opportunity, very flexible low stress environment. Co-workers are fantastic, most managers easy to work with and eager to promote advancement within the department."
good,"Días relajados y jefaturas permisivas. Buen sueldo y muy buenos beneficios, gran ambiente de trabajo. Pero lo más difícil es la ubicación, que es la razón por la cual me quiero ir, estoy entre Costanera Center y la torre Titanium y los tiempos de traslado son demasiado largos y los tacos de terror."
good,I am a hotel  Custodial worker and most of the task we do are simple and the work load is enough without being overwhelming. Basically do your job and go home.
good,"WDW has a rich company history, I enjoyed my whole internship. However, there was not much space to grow for college program students, especially for international students."
good,"great job to learn new skills and to see all aspects of food an beverage service. you learn to be efficient and how to be exceptional at customer service. although there are varying types of roles, if you're motivated you can cross-train."
good,Making 'Magic' all day long does not seem like a real job. Mostly a young crowd and they will give you as many hours as you need -- possibly (and most likely) more.
good,"Working for the Walt Disney Company was such an eye opener and a real opportunity for my personal growth. I self developed while working there for the one year more than I had in any other role. "
good,"The perks of working at disney were amazing. i took my family whenever and had a blast but over time you get over the park and depending on your management, it can hold you back from advancement."
good,Really enjoyable internship experience. Coworkers were great and always willing to help. Being a part of the magic and being able to help bring joy to people vacationing at the Walt Disney World Resort was incredible.
good,It’s a fun place to work if you love Disney . I learned to be able to talk about the products that are barley coming out and show the guest the best experience necessary.
good,"I was there abouth three months,very nice place to work. I working as a paker. We packing all items to senders frome Uk and international orders. I liked this job."
good,"Fantastic company to work for-from benefits to the quality of people who become your partners day in and day out, the company is one where you can spend your career and enjoy working."
good,Demonstrated proper sanitation and safety while working with food and beverage while also acting as guest services and processing payment. Workplace was a great environment and management was helpful as well. I met so many people working for this company and enjoyed working with everyone and working for the company.
good,"Store sales targets and expectations were general knowledge and expected to be achieved on a daily manner. Prior to each shift, footfall, UPT, AGS and up-sales (Talkups) were delivered to each member of staff before starting shift. With the high expectations of sales, the image of the company must be held at all times. The company would call this ""keeping in character"". Disney referred to the staff as ""cast"" and the shop floor as ""stage"", and to ""break out of character"" was to present an image which was not proactive, engaging, happy or knowledge full. Personally, I found that the high turnover of management proved to be distracting as each manager expected different qualities from all their cast. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to young and enthusiastic children about their favourite Disney films and providing new and exciting facts that they may not have heard before. The hardest thing about working here was achieving time off. This was due to the weeks being listed from Sunday to Saturday meaning, if you wanted a weekend off you'd have to book two weeks off. Otherwise you'd have a Sunday off and the next Saturday, so if you wanted a weekend off you'd have to book two weeks off, thus part timers would have two to three weekends off a year."
good,I loved working for Disney. My managers were amazing and I never felt like I was doing a poor job. They always tell you when you're doing well. They give praise where is needed. Great work environment
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Disney is a great company to work for because of the great team put together. The work is fast paced and can be stressful. What makes it all worth it is the smiles on the guests' face. This job was a lot of fun.
good,"Great company.  Disney relocated me and gave me great projects, but the level of the position did not meet my career goals and there was a lack of opportunities for advancement."
good,"Amazing place to learn from experts in the industry. Culture is lighthearted but focused, and coworkers are truly invested in the brands."
good,"Working with the Walt Disney Company is a wonderful experience where you can meet new people each day either locally or from a different continent. It can become difficult detail-wise when management is not communicative with their employees, but luckily I have amazing co-workers who all support one another in times of need or just to make the other smile. "
good,Collaborative and high energy with a fast pace can do attitude. Multiple projects and standard work make for the days and weeks to pass quickly. Supportive team allow for creative solutions and effective results.
good,"Excellent work-Life balance. "
good,"The company as a whole provides cast members with so many areas for growth. The standards are very high but it provides cast members with a purpose to obtain and exceed these expectations on a daily basis. If you take everything you can away from the experience you will transform professionally, very quickly. The company has a very strong presence of networking, so its important to get to know everyone."
good,A typical day at working at Epcot's Flower and Garden Festival is awesome. I work with the cast in an efficient and fast pace manner. Management is very flexible and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with certain guest whose expectations are not met and we try to meet their needs as best as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the people I get to meet and work with.
good,I love working here so much The company always tries to support its Cast member as much as possible. The benefits are great and whats better than free Disneyland entrances!! So sad i have to leave but the distance is getting a little to hard on my medical treatments. 3 hour bus rides for a year was totally worth though.
good,interesting workplace with supportive co-workers and i develop my skills about this job. for me everyday challenge every concept and everyday develop my skills.
good,"Coworkers were careful to make sure I went home on time, felt able and checked if I felt comfortable with my current level of creative input. I absolutely LOVED the people I worked with. Worklife balance was strong, and coworkers took care to take short breaks to refresh from work. Facilities were incredible, and pay was great."
good,"A typical day at work being a Disneyland custodian is a hard one, but also a very magical, unique job. Not many people can say that they can talk to guests as part of their job and give away stickers and get paid to make someone happy. The work is very hard and dirty at times, but it is a very fun job because you are free to roam the park and make a kid's day special."
good,Who wouldn't like working in the place Where Dreams Come True?  Working at Walt Disney World was overall an amazing experience.  Sure there were some bad parts but I still walked away with nothing but good things to say.  Each day was different because each day you encountered different guests from all over the world who had different stories and different perspectives of the world.  The hardest part of the job was having to work outside for most of my days in August due to the heat but the management did a wonderful job at making sure we were taking care of ourselves.
good,Disney College program was a great way to meet a very diverse group of people from around the US and around the world and get a feel for how different cultures view the world.
good,NDY is an international engineering firm which not only provided work life balance but job security and advancement opportunities locally and internationally.
good,"As a temp, I was able to communicate directly with many directors and managers who have served as excellent references and leaders. Disney runs a tight ship, and there is little room for slack in the Taxation department."
good,A typical work day was usually fun because we welcomed our guest by phone like we were at Disney world. I learned that some customers will be nice and some will be firm and mad but you have to keep your same attitude. The management team was awesome. The co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was satisfying an upset guest. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping our guest happy.
good,"Very organized company, Great people to work with, good trainining system. I really learned a lot from there."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I love working for Disney. I love creating magic and making people happy. I love troubleshooting the website and mobile application. I am just not happy with the level of pay because I am unable to pay my bills. This applies to 90% of the Cast Members.
good,"I worked for WDW through a recruiting agency. The job was really both exciting and challenging in the sense that expectations are high, and I like that."
good,At the Walt Disney Company you will be engaged in every shift. Good customer service is a must but you can also work the night shift when there are no guests. You can start at a low position and slowly work your way up or you can decide you don’t like doing one thing and change positions completely. The possibilities are endless and support from the company is amazing.
good,My experience at Disney was very positive and rewarding. A perfect storm of creative challenges and skill development. I learned a great deal about my strengths and weaknesses in the production process and how to best play off of each. My mentors and fellow artists were encouraging and driven by team success over personal glory.
good,Working for Disney can be challenging but fun at the same time. A lot of room for advancement and really good benefits. They give you 2 days off a week which is nice to have for family time and time to recharge. The only thing is that they don't pay much and staffing is short a lot of the time.
good,"As anyone would know, Disney is the most magical of all companies to work for. It is fun, exciting and ever changing with all the new movies and character releases."
good,nice fun cool place to work loved it easy to move up in the company great vibes and help full management lots of opportunity the worst thing is when you get bad guest
good,"Les journées chez Disney store sont toute similaires; située en pleine avenue des Champs Elysées, la boutique attire beaucoup de clients et plus particulièrement les touristes. C'est une grande boutique où il n'y a pas le temps de se poser car il y a toujours quelque chose à fairz."
good,"Your day is never going to be the same working at the Walt Disney Company. Your constantly interacting with guest from around the globe and of different backgrounds. The company encourages creativity and growth within the company as well as personally. With in a day you can expect to work in your home area, on a parade route spending time outdoors, be in an office for meetings, and your going to meet amazing people whom share personal stories that move you. Working with such a large number of people will be challenging and rewarding all in one. Being rewarded with some of the most amazing benefits you could imagine tops off the lifetime memories."
good,"Truly the time of my working life. Whilst the employment benefits are not perhaps the worlds greatest the team, the jobs and the challenges were the greatest."
good,"loved working around kids , an amzaing experience ... very chill job , just show intrest at all times and keep a possitive out look on the job"
good,"A typical day at Disney started with coming in checking updates, closures, upcoming events. Then you start taking calls assisting guest with planning vacations. Making suggestions for restaurants, rooms, and recreational activites outside the parks. You learn that sometimes the vacation you are planning is someones once in a life time vacation and to have patients when they become upset when they cant get in to do something they had their heart set on. The people I worked were wonderful. Disney makes the job fun and gives the opportunity to go to parks and try the new rides and resturants before they open to the public."
good,I was very happy at Disney Interactive. I would work for them again if a contract or permanent job became available.
good,I leaned a lot a Disney and it was a life changing experience for me. I know now what its like to have great Guest Service
good,"Its was pleasure working with Walt Disney, work wise, manager all were super, Got to learn lot professional. Working as on behalf of the corporate level, i really enjoyed the culture, the reply and corporation given by the other employee are really good."
good,It was a good experience. I worked at Epcot and Magic Kingdom with quick service food and beverage. It provided me with opportunities to grow in my work skills and confidence.
good,There's no better job than this to me you basically getting paid to travel and see the world. The job is as easy as you make it litterally. But you have to keep a calm vibe because there are rude customer's
good,"Work here on contract. Was told it was DevOps but was siloed to daily on call 5 days a week."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"A typical day would be a one surrounded by engaging people, providing outstanding customer service while allowing my outgoing personality to shine. Taking time to create lasting memories and passing that on to everyone that I encounter during my workday"
good,"They were nice and understanding about every situation. There were 4 managers and then the lead management came in once a week, which is when everyone started to act on their best behavior"
good,Love working at Disney good experiences and many memory's I believe all my earnings ended up going back to the company in one way or another.
good,"Empresa en constante cambio buscando siempre la mejora, desarrollando negocios alternativos al ""core"" del grupo. Grata experiencia de conocer una empresa tan grande a nivel mundial."
good,Era un muy buen ambiente laboral pero por estar contratada por una empresa externa no tenía acceso a los diversos beneficios que tenían las personas contratadas directamente por la empresa titular
good,"la meilleure expérience de vie faites, mais pas possible a long terme"
good,I have been a fan of Disney since I was a little girl. Becoming a cast member was one of the biggest dreams I had. I wanted to make sure everyone left feeling the Disney magic and excited that they went to visit us.
good,"I greeted customers ,folded clothes,hung up costumes,stocked man items.I learned to love cartoons  .The mangement was very helpful and responsible.The work place culture was standard.The hardest part of the job was standing on a high ladder get snowglobes and putting the in the store.I loved greeting costumers and helping them find what they were looking for."
good,"There are SO MANY places to work at Disneyland. If you don’t like where you’re at, transfer! Some managers have your back, but remember, there are millions of cast members... you are replaceable."
good,After working with the company I found myself wanting to go back. The only reason I left was due to poor management. It was like working in an elementary school environment.
good,"Working on the Shanghai Disneyland Resort was an extremely rewarding experience in that I had a chance to experience cultures outside of Western normalcy, and helped manage and drive production design through to the delivery of amazing final products. Work/Life balance is very disproportionate, as compensation for local hires is extremely low, but overall a very rewarding experience."
good,"Love it! I encountered a lot of professional baseball, basketball, football and boxers players"
good,"Disney is a fun job to have if you don't expect much from them in reference to salary and hours offered. I enjoyed my job there but I could not afford to dedicate all my time to them, which was required, if they could not insure that I have a certain amount of hours per week. The pay is very low for the level of responsability. The interaction with the guests and other Cast Members is what makes working for them worth it. I loved the experience and would work for them under different circumstances."
good,"In the Quick Service Food & Beverage industry, it's fast-paced and a lot of physical labor. At my location, I was in a hot kitchen all day, working about 10-12 hours a day, and about 60 hours a week. It was extremely exhausting and difficult work. But it was worth it to get to network with engineers higher up in the company, as well as learn the ins and outs of Disney Engineering."
good,I myself am in the loss prevention team for stores at Disney resort. It's a great place to work with other people from different walks of life. Our Management team did the best they can. I enjoyed my time with the company and feel now is the good time to move forward in my life.
good,"For a college kid with nothing to do between finishing a Bachelor's degree and anxiously awaiting the beginning of law school, this was a perfect fit. I was able to work and play in the Happiest Place on Earth. It was a very happy, magical time full of travel, bus routes, and lifelong friends from all over the world. The job itself was stressful most of the time with long hours and 100% standing on concrete floor all day long with the exception of running (more like walking with purpose--safety first, kids) everywhere!!! If you are dedicated, determined, and have a passion for all things Disney, this is the temporary job for you. Cons to this job include: pulling 60 hour weeks at minimum wage and no benefits with people screaming at you in the Florida humidity"
good,the managers are to involved in the personal more then professional and conflicted with the work that needed to be done.
good,"While I worked at Disney warehouse it was very exciting, to come to work and the people were very friendly. I also, liked coming to work, because it was fun and tangible, for my benefit, as an employee. Next, I liked working there because the environment was real calm and the people were always helpful."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"you really begin to see another side of the guest when you work outside wethier there just coming back from a cruise, or the park or heading back home. a good experience to learn and understand that you must have tolerance to be able to have good customer service."
good,"Ambiente di lavoro unico : stimolazione continua, novità, ambiente in continua evoluzione. Viste le leggi vigenti sull'immigrazione, non è possibile per chi non è americano di passaporto perseguire una carriera nella compagnia."
good,"Good company"
good,I worked in a environment where I had to bring excellent costumer skills to a volume of people each day. I represented the company and made sure our guest were satisfied.
good,"customer service with guest, and compliance with their needs,"
good,"....you can find the right group to work for at it. As a company of roughly 120,000 employees, this is more challenging than it may seem. In some cases, you work for a group that is a profit center and run by subject matter experts who have gotten to where they are as a result of merit. But not all lines of business at Disney are as respectable. Regardless, if you look at the company from a holistic standpoint, I would say it is the single greatest company to work for in the world."
good,"Not perfect, but better than in the Eisner days. But too many layers, too many problematic people who survive the system yet drain the organization of morale and effetiveness."
good,This company includes great benefits which also included company perks. The culture is very friendly and family-based mission and vision.
good,"always learning something new, No tips allowed and the pay is not enough"
good,"Great flexibility. I like the company, but customers were sometimes very irate, and you had to ask them to fill out a survey at the end of each call."
good,"I was contracted through Disney to be a Production Assistant (PA) and grip on a shoot that was on reforestation amongst California State parks. Seeing as how i have had prior experience in the independent video production world, I fit right in and had a great time working with the crew. The hardest part of the job was lugging film gear and equipment up Cuyamacha peak. I really enjoyed this experience seeing how it was the first time I was contracted to be on a professional video crew and I learned a lot."
good,"as energentic as i was at the age of 16, this job fitt me very well especially with the people who i worked with. no one was ever left behind. everyone worked together somehow even if we were in different staitons. we sang appy birthday every morning, and danced throughout the shift even if it was a food and beverage food court. and we still got our work done no matter what."
good,The environment and management were too up tight. I felt it hindered my progress and abilities. I think the company expects too much from their employees. My co-workers were great.
good,"la experiencia fue agradable sin embargo por la experiencia en el area el cual me desempeñaba fue imposible el cambio de area e incluso para estudiar no era posible por los horarios rotativos en los cuales yo laboaraba,  el sueldo era muy bajo la compañia demora para lo toma de decisiones  existe muchas burocracia para el aumento del salario por los diferentes sindicatos que alli operan. Asi como tambien las oportunidades de promocion no son por evaluaciones sino por el trato con el gerente de turno."
good,"The Disney College Program was a lot of fun, but it was a lot of working and long hours. It was a great way to experience Disney as a Cast Member and was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I made a ton of friends and was able to meet a lot of people. However, all of my paycheck was basically used for rent and living costs, but overall, it was a fun experience and definitely recommend as a summer job!"
good,I liked to work in Disney but I needed a permanent job. I like the way they do the trainings are very complete. I want to work at Celebration in Disney main building. It is my dream.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"It's been great working here and learned lot of things.I have been working more then 3 years as DBA and gained the experience in DB2."
good,"I loved every bit of my time with the Disney College Program, would highly recommend it. Every day was a blast and there was always excitement. One of the best parts of my college career."
good,"Todos os managers são realmente super eficazes ensinam e tem paciência, a simpatia fenomenal. "
good,Work and life balance was great. Career advancement is only okay if you're minority- typical glass ceiling/glass wall company. Not much diversity.
good,Extreme Creative Environment. Freedom of Schedule. Management Freedom.
good,"exellent leadership "
good,Great company to work for if you do your job right. Good benefits and decent pay. Most departments try to foster a culture of inclusion and positivity.
good,Lovely work environment and coworkers. I've worked with the Walt Disney Company for nine years and had the opportunity to work with some of the best talent on Broadway.
good,"Provided a pleasant work environment, variety of patients and always willing to assist when needed. Always answered questions readily with no delay or being made to feel the questions were not warranted."
good,I worked here for a while and it was nice. The call center reps were nice. I worked overnight so I felt safe being there while patrolling the area. I had to leave due to religious reasons but it is a perfect job for students to work overnight in the weekends or even during the week and go to school during the day.
good,"Great company to work for, if you’re life is all about Disney, than this job is right for you. You’ll enjoy the benefits that come with the job position as well. So many perks and new experiences everyday."
good,"Working for the Walt Disney Company has truly been a unique experience. I have been able to communicate and interact with guests from all around the country. Through working here, I have also been able to enhance upon my quick solving problem skills."
good,"The work environment is great and the people there are very nice and hard working but also have a lot of fun with lots of activities, e.g. games. A typical day at work would mean helping my clients resolve their desktop and laptop issues."
good,Great work experience and hours. Positive atmosphere and management. Fair pay and proper training. Customer focused company and zero tolerance for employee attitudes or misconduct.
good,An awesome opportunity to grow and learn about different guest service skills from a Fortune 500 company that is arguably the most prestigious in the entertainment field.
good,Working for the Walt Disney Company was truly inspiring for my career and tied everything together. When the culture is collaboration and it is fostered each day you cant help but be inspired to drive hard for the team goals!
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Lo mejor de Florida y los Estados Unidos no se puede pedir algo mejor
good,"Multinacional com foco em resultado, ambiente competitivo, burocrático, com boa flexibilidade."
good,Le monde de Disneyland est très dynamique. La plupart du staff est jeune donc c'est super sympa.
good,The job was cool and laid back. The work was very manageable.It was a good experience.I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a nice place to work
good,"Productive and fun workplace, which allowed me work with various lines of businesses to utilize my engineering skills.  I would highly recommend this company."
good,"The hardest part of working in Orlando in the summer was the heat. However, as part of your day, you rotate positions within your role to produce some variety and more excitement in your day."
good,"Great company with creative people. At times, could be a bit bureaucratic and hard to get ideas across to upper management. Overall, such a great place to work at."
good,It was so much fun. It was one of the best experiences of my life and would 100% do it again! I would recommend and internship with Disney to anyone who is passionate about the company.
good,"It was one of the best experiences of my life. The atmosphere, the people, and the structure Disney has in place helped me to succeed and have fun. Would work there again."
good,"Terrible work environment.  Leads are very strict, and do not care about employee well being.  Only cared about the needs of the business.  Often treated like dirt."
good,Really great workplace. Really great processes. Really great people. I was a support engineer and never felt overwhelmed. This job taught me a lot of things and really expanded my perspective on asset management.
good,"Amazing job with an amazing team, perfect schedule, free meals and perfect job. "
good,Disney is a great place to work. The culture is great. The only issue that I had working there is that the culture is very corporate and this made ti sometimes difficult to do my job.
good,"As 3rd shift duty manager my day started at 11pm. I would get to work, greet my Cast and relay the important events of the day to my team. Creating magic there for 28 years I have learned the skills and ability to always go above and beyond, Solve for Yes, and preserve the brand Walt Disney is known for. The hardest part of the job was being the only Leader there. There are no other Leaders to bounce off ideas or collaborate situations. I had to make choices that would greatly affect the Guests and Cast on my own.  Creating the Magic and reliving the memories I had as a child was the best part, along with being able to assist families making their memories a reality like mine."
good,"Working for the Walt Disney company is great! Amazing people, flexible hours, the best benefits ever! But... Being a Steward and working as hard as we work the pay could be way better. But none the less its a good work experience."
good,"I've worked for the Walt Disney Company and its affiliates in California, Tokyo, aboard their Cruiseline, and in Orlando.  Every experience was uniquely rewarding.  I cherish my time and memories and would love to find another position that fits my skill set in the future!"
good,Very good work atmosphere learning new cloud technologies from the cloud architects.I have learned a lot of things from my pals and architects dealing with the troubleshooting of the issues.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney is a great place, mostly because of the products and the peers I worked with. The culture is very inclusive and promotes a work/life balance. The work and culture vary between segments... and they can be very different. It's not hard to imagine that employees at ESPN are different than at the parks. I worked there for over 7 years and sometimes wish I could go back (moved out of the area)."
good,fun place to work friendly people and good managers everyone works together and supports each other to reach 100 percent guest approval everyday......
good,Team members are highly skilled and enjoyable to work with. Good leadership provided and provided everything to perform my work effectively and efficiently.
good,"Working for Disney was OK , but the hourly requirement was not brought to my attention in the begging and when it became a problem no one said any thing too me they were just planning on just removing me for not working enough weekends . which i could do if i would of known it was a requirement."
good,I was an extra for a Disney film in London and it was a great experience. They were friendly people working with me and I would do it again. Disney is a great company
good,cool place to work. nice environment. comfortable. easy to learn. fast pace. get along with everyone. easy to move up in the company. great benefits. great location
good,"I was a contractor - wanted to become a cast member STILL good job. Typical work day, I learned about my manangement style for the next time I am employed there. The hardiest part was my manager was new and so was I so it was difficult to understand what was needed. I loved my team and I still keep in contact with them now."
good,"I worked on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and it was a great environment to work it."
good,Best experience in a time when Home video was booming. Great experience working in a retail marketing environment and partnerships. Lots of fun but job/life balance was not very balanced.

good,I loved this program! With the ideas they taught us to further our careers it was such a good choice. I make livelong friends from all over the world.
good,The Disney store is an amazing place to work.  It makes a regular retail job just a little more magical and I have not encountered a sourpuss yet.  The managers always have your back and are very encouraging and supportive about your future endeavors.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant guest interaction. Getting to meet people you would not normally have the chance to meet on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed working here it was very prodtice meaning very workful and a lot of people had helpful atttitudes and they worked together as a team well. wages were made on a timely setiing and they paid great.

good,Scheduler handling the production of the weekly schedule of the crew working at the parks. Staffed over 700 employees. Handled schedule by seniority and pay rates in a union based environment. Handled day to day calls of shift trades and call outs.
good,"I worked there as a college student. It was a fun job, but the hours were often very long. The pay was very low, and offered no benefits."
good,"Disney Children's Center was amazing and I wish I did not leave the center looking back.  I was commuting far,  but they gave incentives for that like paying for part of the monthly train ticket.  Especially if you have a family, the benefits are amazing from free park entrance to discounts on merch. They pay was higher than most but not the highest out there and the campus is beautiful.  Typical preschool teacher diversity and struggles one might deal with, but overall a great place to work."
good,"I was of the 10 percent of students accepted to be a part of The Disney College Program. Through this internship, I worked with a team of diverse cast members to create a seamless guest experience."
good,I really liked it here. I got to do a lot of fun things on the job and because Disney has money I got to go on a few business trips for work as well which in my field you don't normally get to do.
good,"Tough schedule and hours but the perks you receive and the people you meet from all over the world make it worth it."
good,"Great place to work, managers recognize talent and seek to elevate employees. Plenty of opportunities to move forward and upward should you seek to do so."

good,"Days were short, easy going, and fun with a family friendly environment.  Loved the benefits of being able to visit parks and perks for free or discounted."
good,Great place to learn about guest service at the highest level.  Workplace culture of safety is unmatched and leaders and cast members take a true interest in working together to provide the best experiences to the Disney guests.
good,Colleagues and working environment is so professional and yet casual. The working environment is so clean and in order all the time. The organization of each department is always on the top.
good,"Clean and fun please to work. Very fun meetings every Holliday.  Rom to grow in the company.  Have to use company uniform or "" costume "". Very busy during  the holidays."
good,"While working at Disney World is definitely stressful at times, it is always fun and exciting. It can be hot and crowded and constant running at times, but management does what it can to reward the cast, and guests more often than not make your day."
good,"Trabajo interesante, tuve la posibilidad de aprender y actualizar mis conocimientos computacionales."
good,"Working at Disney was a wonderful experience, the office is lively, colorful, and always decorated with Disney merch. Everybody is friendly and welcoming and you never feel out of place, even when exploring other floors of the branch."

good,A typical day at work would consist of working for no less than 6 hours and interacting with thousands of guests daily. I had 7 area leaders and all of them were awesome to work with.

good,"I must say I truly enjoyed my time with this company. I was a CSR for the online store. I did what I do naturally...talk on the phone. I would assist customers that were online shopping with placing, finding, correcting orders they have put in and during down time I would then assist customers via customer sent emails. I learned quite alot working in a call center. I would do it again."

Getting to spread magic and work for Mickey Mouse makes me happy every day, despite challenges (such as the expectation from external audiences that everything we do has to be perfect).

I loved my co-workers, they were so sweet and it was great working with people who love Disney just as much as I do. The hardest part of the job was just the stress of it being a busy time of the year but it wasn't all that bad because how could you be stressed while you're surrounded by your favorite things! The most enjoyable part of the job had to be interacting with the kids and getting to use the discount we'd get.. you'd think I were 6 years old by all of the things I have!"
good,"I actually worked for a subcontractor at Saratoga Springs, so this review is not for the resort.   Beautiful location and friendly staff though.  You'll love eating at the Artist's Palette."

good,I loved working at this company. Great benefits! Great values!
good,"Fun place to work, and the people are like family, wonderful benefits and perks.  A very productive place to work.  I supported my boss for just shy of 8 years.

good,"Working at Disney's Polynesian Resort as an intern was an enjoyable experience that also taught me as much as possible about all areas of the resort. I started out as a day-time housekeeper, which was the hardest position I took on. This job helped me build my time-management skills because I was given a certain amount of rooms to clean in a certain time limit and I had to be able to complete it without assistance of any kind. I also worked the ""turn-down"" shift which allowed me to assist guests with anything after all housekeepers left from their day-shifts. Other areas that I had a chance to shadow and train in were front desk, curb-side, runner, and rooms ready operations. All of these positions put me in areas that gave me the chance to interact with guest's which was the most rewarding part of my whole experience. Housekeeping was independent work, but being able to create ""special touches"" throughout the day to surprise the guest's when they came back from a long day at the theme parks made it very rewarding."
good,Always something to do. Its hard work sometimes but you're not just left to struggle its a hard working family managed business they're fair.

good,"loved working here. Everyday was a blast, enjoyed every day at work"
good,"Working at the Disneyland Resort taught me many things; how to properly guest service, patience, and work life balance. As one might imagine working at the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" is VERY focused on guest servicing. The guest is always right and it is important to go out of your way to make sure they leave happy. Management here is very attentive to their cast members and I liked that. The biggest challenge I faced at this job was a work life balance. While working at the Resort I learned that whatever problems you are facing outside of work cannot be visible once you are on stage because it affects not only how you service your guests but their perception of the Resort. If the cast member is not happy it shows and that is unacceptable. Overall working at the Disneyland Resort was a great learning experience for my life at the time."
good,"A wonderful place to work, everyday you'll feel like a kid. A typical day is fun, and full of new guest that you get to make feel like a star. Being able to get on little guest level and watch as they experience everything for the first time is the best part of the job."

good,"- schedulers work with school schedules, so that you can work while going to school at the same time."
good,"Its a fun and exciting place to work, every day is different. Its so nice and fun to make a magical moment for guests. The one bad thing i have to say is they are on a point system. If you get 24 points you will be fired. its not hard to do either because calling out for any reason is 3 pts and if you are late due to traffic or anything its 1.5 pts."
good,Provide and ensure the safety of guests in designated areas. Direct and implement recreational activities for children and adults in various Resorts. Lifeguarding.
good,"To have the chance to work and play in the same place is a dream come true. As a Front Desk Agent, I learned first hand what it was to have direct guest contact. How to create, plan, and surprise guests special moments in their lives, was just priceless."
good,"Typical day at work for a Disney Store Cast member is to bring stories to life. I made sure I engaged all store guest at their level, and that I was sound in knowledge of stores in-house merchandise ready to sell. Bringing Disney Stories to life at a retail level requires engulfing the Disney core principles and brand! Growing up Disney help to prepare me as a dynamic cast member. Daily I kept the store guest ready, communicated with management on any new changes and hosted special events with Disney integrity."
good,Disney is a nice place to work. They really take care of there employees. Disney always has a lot of events and special days planned for there employees.
good,"Great experience working there, learned lots of things about the corporate world."

good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"You either LOVE or absolutely HATE working here, regardless of your position. Lots of hours available if you want, but they are not very understanding or considerate of your outside life."
good,"Definitely lots of good benefits here, however some people aren't the happiest. The pay could be much better, higher for sure. I would work there again if the pay was better."
good,Disneyland is very high paced but extremely fun place to work. The hardest part is dealing with adverse weather conditions wether it be heat or at times rain
good,A joy to come to work. This was a temporary position but was treated like I was a permanent employee. Really loved showing up to work. Family culture there.
good,There's definitely room for growth within the company. Management isn't always consistent but honestly most of our work was based on a team effort so we managed ourselves.
good,Everyone is Happy and likes to come to work.All the guess are happy so that gives everyone a smile.Plus having all the bathrooms and rooms clean they are happy
good,"I came to the resort as a retiree and it was great fun-"

good,Amazing experience. Made lasting friendships and learned a lot not only about Disney and their culture but about creating the best customer experience possible and how to get so many guests to return.
good,"A magical experience, you will enjoy working for this wonderful company! Many attributes to learn from managers and supervisors. What you put into the company, you will get out."
good,"It was a fun job for a limited time. Days at work change because of the rotation of positions which helps the day pass by quickly. Learn how to deal with difficult customers in high stress situations. Think quickly to adapt to different problems. Management isn't perfect, some managers are better than others but usually a cohesive unit."
good,"Very fun place to work! Often hard being the busiest theme park in the world. Some days I would see 78 thousand people, some days I would see 23 thousand.  I would not trade working there for anything!"
good,"Very fast paced environment, can be interactive with guests, the guests can make your shift easy or hard, outdoors and dealing with the weather, standing on your feet for long hours"
good,"This review is applicable to the benefits of a seasonal cast member."
good,"I absolutely LOVED working here. Was it the best paying job? OF COURSE NOT. I worked here when I was 19-20 years old and I had the best time. You definitely need to want to work there because it's customer service 24/7, even when you're walking out of the parks. If a guest sees you in costume with your name tag and has a question, better believe they'll ask you. There are also downsides to customer service as anyone that's worked in that industry knows but the amazing people you meet and interact with cancel out all the bad ones. The best perks were being able to get into the parks for free and bringing your family and friends for free! Not to mention the amazing friends I made while working there."
good,"I started working for the Walt Disney Company many years ago during the Disney College Program, where I worked in custodial sweeping the parks. The journey to Walt Disney Feature Animation was a long one, but well worth it."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,steady workload with computer support. clean organized. plenty of space to organize work. fellow workers most supportive. friendly management and lead managers.
good,"SAS is retiring from disney world company in marketing team, because Adobe is taking over. but i am concerned that Adobe won't be able to complete the marketing campaign as 100% well as SAS based on my prior experience in other companies. The management might switch back to SAS, at least partially."
good,"Too many, ""you ruined my vacation"" moments. Too much mandatory overtime. Not enough interaction or ability to interact with others. A typical, stressful, call center environment."
good,"Let me tell ya.. After all the excitement of moving in, meeting new people from all around the world, learning about the culture of Disney in traditions / orientation, exploring the parks for the first time, and learning where your role is, what you'll be doing and how to do it, you'd think that this is truly what life is all about and that it's the most amazing thing to ever happen-- which it is. It really is like going to college again in a nutshell. So many new, fun, exciting experiences with new and fun exciting people like yourself. For your own sake, if you're considering, DO THE PROGRAM!* Most rewarding experience within a small time frame you'll probably experience for a long time."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is a market leader for all the right reasons.  With such strong and valued brands, they only attract top talent, but that also requires considerable dedication to long hours and a deadline-driven environment.  This dedication pushes everyone to the next level."
good,I would recommend working for Disney for a temporary position. I would only recommend long-term if you are willing to accept low pay for many years before advancement.
good,"Being part of the magic and talking to so many people is a great thing, to help them make a custom plan for a vacation with an extra touch to make it unique for them"
good,"Great role for an outgoing person, met a lot of fun and new people in this role...great partners with dispatch and drivers to ensure guest transport safely and effectively"
good,"You tend to lose the ""magic"" when working for the mouse... seeing things backstage or ""behind the scenes"" put a damper of things ""on stage"". It's better to be a guest at times, so that you don't know what's going on."
good,"Coming into the biggest entertainment company in the world is challenging yet rewarding. Unfortunately the pay is not adequate and the hours are limited. After working in the parks for over a year in a variety of roles I have discovered that this is a great company for entry level workers and retirees, but if you are looking to make a livable wage, it is in your best interest to avoid the grind of working in the parks."
good,Hard working staff puts forth a real effort as one working together to accomplish goals. Mgmt is open to new ideas and works hard at getting people who are motivated to move up in the right positions.
good,"Good company ...Good working experience.. its Good place to gain knowledge on new trending technologies."
good,This was a very fast paced job. Having the opportunity to work and be trained by the Walt Disney Company was amazing. I moved to Sarasota and that is the only reason I left.
good,Very busy days efficiency is a must. How to give exceptional customer service. Management was not always a available and I had a million different co-workers. The most enjoyable part was making magical memories for families.
good,Speading the Magic on a daily basis for the Walt Disney Companies. Selling Vacations packages for families and businesses alike for California and Hawaii Disney properties
good,"Being a custodial for Disneyland is always fun and exciting everyday. Each day we are assigned different assignments in different locations throughout the whole park. Through this job, I have learned and improved on my communication skills and work ethics."
good,Great company to work for if you have a family and want to take your kids to Disney and afford being able to stay on Property. no balance in work to life ratio though and in the tampa callcenter no growth is possible unless you move out to the Orlando site
good,"It was a Great Park to work for the hours were great because"
good,"-Typical day started with me making coffee for the office and making sure everyone (and their assistants) knew what was going on in the office that day.  I was also responsible for ordering and setting up meals, taking notes during meetings and scheduling hotel and air fare accommodations. "
good,"If you enjoy the public and stay in an hourly non management roll, you will love it."
good,"alot of the details were from artists sketches and not from drawings"
good,"I worked as a Finishing video editor and Colorist for Little Airplane, an animation production group partnering with Disney on a children's animation show"
good,Highly recommend working at this company. You will learn how to work in a high paced fashion with innovative people. Would recommend the Walt Disney Company buy would not recommend staying there longer than 3 years.
good,"I have been a Cast Member for almost 4 years and an assistant manager for almost 3. I have seen the worst of the worst of people in both customer service as well as in employees and fellow managers. You have a lot of pressure to perform your absolute best but you are supported if you happen to fall. There are a lot of good things about the company and the way they support you, and they are the best in customer service and setting up their Cast Members with new opportunities."
good,Intercâmbio de trabalho durante as férias universitárias.
good,"Working for the Walt Disney Co in their Parks and Resorts should always be thought of as a hobby job. This is why I remain Seasonal with the Company. Great Work and Great Fun, But no livable wages"
good,"Great place to work, absolutely fun and energetic. Plenty of benefits and discounts; more get added almost weekly if not daily. But be prepared to work very long hours and work with very hostile people. This is a theme park company, you will work the life of a theme park person regardless of where you work in the company (parks, resorts, off-site, corporate, etc.)."
good,Disney cruise line JD an amazing experience and I would recommend it to anyone
good,"Worked as an intern in the college program !! Defiantly worth it. Opened up so many other doors for me. It wasn't the easiest job, the customers were rude, it was hot, but made a little family with my coworkers and I would do it again."
good,I worked at my own pace & expected to be self-sufficient. The company  gave me the opportunity to experience TWC in it's fullest. A good place to work
good,"learned a lot and had a very special time working in the parks as well as on the Imagineering campus in Glendale.  Fantastic, brilliant Imagineers are the heart of Disney!"
good,"I worked for the mouse for over 12 years, and i learned a lot. However, you are just a number and not treated as a person. I am glad that I had the opportunity, but it can be frustrating at times. Also low pay."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I wouldn't mid staying because of the great benefits and great People. If you are someone who really likes Disneyland, Star Wars and, Marvel this is the best place to work. Free screenings of all of the newly released movies."
good,"If you're willing to put in the work and aspire to rise up the roster then I can say with confidence that you will have a good chance of promotion. Unfortunately, I was located in Mason and all operations were moved out that location at the end of this month (April 30, 2018)."
good,I worked for Disneyland for about 2 years now and it has its pros and cons. I am a big Disney fan so working for the company really made me happy. The benefits are cool but the pay is low.
good,my boss needed training.great company just the management in my department was horrible. poor judgement and lack of knowledge. other then that i enjoy working here
good,"Working at the Disney theme parks is an incredible experience, but it definitely is not for everyone.  You have to buy in to the culture of wanting to excel in guest service and into the art of make believe.  I saw firsthand how much the parks mean to guests visiting from all over the world.  At Disney, I met folks who became family, including my wife.  There is challenges to working at Walt Disney World.  The biggest being that you work, when everyone else is playing, meaning you work holidays, summer, your birthday, etc.  And it can be hard.  At the end of the day, you actually get to be the person who can create incredible memories for people of all ages.  It truly is like no other place on earth."
good,"Great place to work, great culture, competitive rates, would consider working here full time. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the different technologies."
good,very nice and fun place to work. Meet hundreds of people from around the world. It is very fast paced. It is very diverse. The College program was great and very fun.
good,"Disney is demanding, but they are good to work for. They know exactly what they want, which makes things smoother in post to streamline the process. Good company."
good,"Lots of fun to go to different events and to work with different people. Didn't pay overly well, but was fun to be apart of promotions and different events."
good,"Great Company, but the lack of advancement is hard to work through. The environment is second to none and the experience gained working for the Walt Disney Company is second to none."
good,"I loved working for Walt Disney World. I was only there for a 3 month internship program, so I probably left while I was still in the ""honeymoon"" phase, but I had a blast, learned a lot about the company culture, and loved working with my fellow cast members."
good,"Each day we strive to bring magic to all of our guests. Be upbeat and friendly, work hard to make sure that everyone has the best day ever, as if this might be the only time that they may visit the parks."
good,Fun place and nice to work with good people. Company is good. One of the those jobs you wish to work for long time. I enjoyed most. I am looking forward.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,"I loved working for The Disney company. Even though there are cons, I would definitely go back if the right position was to open up. I learned how to style better through all the great cosmetologists there & how to use better time management."
good,First time working in a call center and I really enjoyed myself. I learned a lot about sales and marketing. Met really great coworkers and Disney customers. It really was a happy place to work. The trainer assigned to our training class was the absolute best and made the job easier and fun to learn. When he was done with us we had no reason to not be excellent.
good,Great experience met people from across the world fun place to work eye opening from customer to employee do recommend for anyone looking for a great company to work for I mean come on don't want to work for Mickey
good,"Awesome establishment to work for during events, flexible hours, and great community to get to know. I learnt to shout loudly and convincingly. I met plently of young people my age and had a blast working with them, the difficult part of the job was how irritating the show was having to hear 3 times a day on constant loop was awful yet nostalgic to my childhood."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"The Walt Disney Company is a great place to work with. The MD and Vp's take a lot of efforts to bring up thier fellow employees. Somehow at lower level i.e project managers dont understand the efforts taken by them and compromise with company standards by hiring freshers from vendors on projects which actually need at least 2 3 years of good experienced candidate. dont know why such compromise is taking place might be the manager would be getting some perks from vendors for doing so. but the the outcome of this is the extensive efforts taken by higher authorities are not met as this fresher candidates are not able to give quality output in spite of being heavily paid to vendors."
good,"Nothing beats the magic of DIsney, it was fun, inviting and simply magical. The most enjoyable part was free entry to any disney park and the perks and benefits of being a disney cast member."
good,Bei der The Walt Disney Company bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem Praktikum.
good,Great place to work. Everyone is passionate about their roles and the content being produced is exciting. Feels good to produce something that is seen by millions of people every day.
good,"I love working at Walt Disney Co. in Anaheim. The people I work with make the days so much better. However, I don't believe we get paid nearly enough for all the work that we do. Sometimes I do the work of custodial, maintenance, and attraction cast members all at one attraction on any given day. Not to mention the constant strain on our emotional stability, especially since I've been attacked 4 times since I started working there 7 months ago, and no one even bothered to try and help me at work. I believe this job is worth it because making magic for children is the best feeling in the world. I just wish I had more hours, job security, and better pay."
good,"i worked at a restaurant kitchen, it is hot and fast paced. there are nights when you want to run off but other nights are really fun it all depends on the attitude and passion you put into it"
good,"Work is diverse and can be challenging. The benefits are quite extensive, but this allows for less monetary compensation. The company treats it's employees well and I enjoy working here."
good,The Walt Disney Company is an amazing company to work for and nothing like what I have experienced before. The company truly cares about its customers and employees. The customer service that is provided to customers is a critical component and employees are encouraged to be helpful and informative to make the best impression to guests on a regular basic. The calls can be very intense sometimes and it really takes a good listener to help resolve some of the guest concerns and complaints. On a daily basis you handle approx 90-150 incoming calls and every day is different. In this job you are learning new things on a daily basis and it makes the job really exciting if you can handle the pressure. I have really enjoyed working for the company but they are unable to provide full time employment at this time and unable to meet the minimum wages that I need.
good,"I loved my time working at the Walt Disney World Resort. The experiences I had and skills I learned are incredibly valuable, and will be used in my future career. I love the culture and the people I worked with."
good,"A good place to work , don't get me wrong at times there are tough challenges like most places these days but I enjoy a challenge the team are great to work with and it just comes naturally to me I get bored easily and also wish to progress to management or above."
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,"Each week I would work between 32 and 40 hours including 2 scheduled days off. Each day our schedules would be different, but most of the schedules remained the same week to week."
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company and everyday I continue to search ways to return and grow in a different market of theirs. I left my position to pursue my advanced education and move closer to that institution. "
good,Its a good program but you can not advance in the company because you are an intern. Some management are worthless but other than that you get to work for a great company. Housing sucks but its a roof over your head.
good,Data entry and data consolidation of multiple databases into one. I learned many skills while working at this company especially how to take on projects and find a solution with various resources.  As well as working with Executives and deadlines.  The hardest part of the job would be managing all the projects and tasks you have and making sure they are all getting done or worked on simulatenously.  The most enjoyable part of the job comes in learning new skills and information anytime I take on a new project.
good,"Best place to work for regardless of being a Disney fan or not!"
good,managers were great and coworkers were fun to work with. enjoyed coming to work on a daily basis and since its located in down town disney makes it more fun.
good,You're overworked and under paid but the benefits are great and your fellow college program participants are alot of fun. I've never had more fun in my life.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I come in and prep the bar and get ready to cook the meat. I speak to all my fellow co workers to brighten up their day and I continue prep for the head cook to come in and start the food before the restaurant opens up.
good,Fantastic opportunity to work in Walt Disney World. It was the best summer of my life.
good,"It was a Disney Adventure."
good,"Agradável para se trabalhar, boas condições de trabalho mais o investimento é pouco para o seu empregado."
good,"got to help make and prepare foods for various functions, and then got to help out serve in them. Got to meet great people and meet some amazing chefs from all over the world."
good,The days are 12 hours and we learned about rail cars.The management has been fantastic as far as delivering material and supplying tool and equipment.The wok was at an old Railyard and came with its share of hazards.How satisfying to know that the wok you do will be seen by everyone watching The Lone Ranger movie.
good,had fun working there the people were great learned alot and grew to no much about the plant itself
good,Best place to work at to learn anything. Exposure to many different people. Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Definitely a lot of perks. What I did:"
good,Great company to work for. Compensation is more than fair and it embraces a very inclusive workplace that prioritizes diversity and can often times assist in gaining a great work/home life balance.
good,Working for Disney is an exciting job to have. At times it can get exhausting but putting a smile people's faces is always worth it. If you're outgoing and love the fast paced life Disney is the right job for you.
good,I completed the Disney College program in 2018 and it was absolutely an amazing experience to be a cast member. I learned a lot of new things about the company and I learned more about myself as an individual.
good,Trabalho pesado mas a empresa tem uma cultura muito boa e uma ótima visão
good,"Good place to work on a temp basis."
good,WDC is a great company to work for.  The commute was difficult for me but showing up to a great workplace made up for that.  The onsite food was also a big bonus!
good,The enterprise is extraordinarily huge and dynamic. Everyone knows the vision and come to work to make it a reality. The management knows how to keep the vision alive in its employees. Things move slow in a giant which is understandable. Comfort is the main perk of this company as job security is paramount to the culture.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the constant need to learn and innovate to solve ever changing problems."
good,"Set up and break down after each parade "
good,One thing I can say about working for Disney is that they genuinely know how to run a business! I love the four keys and I love how everyone loves to work for the mouse. The only thing is if you work in a lower job you are more considered a number. I sometimes did not feel appreciated and that is something I search for in a job.
good,"This is a great company to work for. They really did a great job. I love to work here. Lots of perks. Tons of benefits, work from home was a really nice plus. There is always lots of other people willing to help out and offer advice."
good,"Fun place to work when you’re a student or it’s your first job but no room for growth. I graduated college and tried to apply for a position within the company and instead of helping me, they left me on my own even though they vow to help their employees grow from within."
good,"If you love Disney, than you will love working for the Mouse. Everyday you get to be a part of the magic and be apart of creating the magic. Great place to work."
good,It was a good experience and it did help advance my career although I was brought on just to work as a contractor they did treat their employees  very well.
good,He tenido una muy grata experiencia trabajando en esta empresa
good,"-Very busy but enjoyable"
good,Each day I get to chat and make vacation dreams come true. I’ve learned that I can make a difference and that I can share my love of Disney with so many. Managers are helpful since my background isn’t in sales. Great tips to help me improve. The hardest thing about the job is losing my voice - I talk a lot 😆. The most enjoyable part is hearing the joy and excitement in my guests voice when we talk about their plans.
good,"Disney is a great company to work for; they have a lot of different opportunities for changes in career and advancement. When working at Disney you have to be honest about how your work environment makes you feel. If one area is not right, they can find you another."
good,"It was tough because you needed to react to time critical situations, deal with unruly guests, and meet strict guidelines; however, the environment is fun and friendly."
good,It was a lot of hours with minimum pay as we were interns. It was exhausting. It was a great overall experience. I learned a lot and tell people all the time I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"Good company, great benefits and no ceiling. I would work for Disney again. I had good parking, great location and the finest news people in the industry."
good,Enoyed working at Dusney store.  There is not much down time which I love.  It is a place where you can engage with guest and get to share your love for Disney.   It is a place where you can make it fun and confortable for guest to shop.
good,"There is so much going on in the company that you can't every learn it all, and what a great experience to learn from. Certain roles and levels get more opportunities than other, but if you make the most of the chances you get, you can go far..."
good,"Definitely a fun place to work even just as a Christmas temp - the experience you get with sharing the magic with the kids is not something you easily forget. Typical day is mostly greeting guests and stock taking - the management were really friendly and I got along with everyone I worked with, it's very much about teamwork."
good,"I loved every minute working there, just wish the time could've been longer. Remember that because of their highly held reputation, the necessity to be spotless trickles down to the every last cast member, even if you think that no one cares what you do."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"It was over all a fun and productive work place, however it was very long hours on your feet. Apart from that fact it was very enjoyable with management being conduct very well and team members and other employers being very polite."
good,I actually really enjoyed working here and was let go for a situation that was out of my control. If I could go back I would. The pay is decent enough and I really liked what I did and who I worked with.
good,Fun company to work for.  I learned a great deal about teamwork and how to collaborate with others.  Meeting new people from around the world was exciting!
good,There is just something about this company that makes you want to work harder for them. I have never had a lack of motivation coming into work every day when I know I am putting a smile on faces
good,"Working for Disney is the single greatest opportunity I have personally had.  I have grown as a person and professional in more ways than can be stated in this format.  It could be said that they don't pay a living wage and that Disney in the corporate sense can be shrewd and unfeeling, but also it can be said that there is no greater opportunity for someone to grow, advance and learn about themselves and others, gaining skills to further them in life and Disney as a company really pours into their Cast and develops their cast in real life affirming ways.  They have some of the best benefits around and getting to go to the parks for free is a huge plus."
good,"Great company, I can really say anything bad about The Walt Disney Company. Many opportiunities to move up through the company ranks but very competitive."
good,"Busy , and sometimes difficult depending on the nature of the calls taken in the day."
good,"I had a different experience than most while working at Disney. I was apart of a company that was bought by Disney and we were able to keep our small feel culture for as long as possible. It was fun, but we were worked pretty hard."
good,Management keeps the work flow moving smoothly.  In the entertainment department it was easy to meet coworkers.  Reasonable hours.  Entertaining job. Lots of breaks and fair pay.
good,"I took part in the WDW College Program, and while it was a very challenging experience- it's one that I cherish. Regardless of what else is on my resume- people are always most curious about my time at WDW."
good,Loved working here. I worked mostly as management and it was my favorite. Hourly in the parks was tough but the Union takes very good care of the cast members. The pay and benefits are fantastic.
good,"My opinion that they should pay more is not exclusive to Disney, I believe all customer service industry jobs should pay more. Also, retail is a very stressful and fast-paced job to work and is much more involved than it seems."
good,You are always busy restocking toys or costumes helping people out or cashing out someone. there is always something to do and you interact with people a lot.
good,"A typical day at work would be more of dealing with the public and making sure that everyone is secured. I learned that there are many different people in this world and that no matter what you need to treat each one of them with respect.  "
good,"I loved being a Cast Member for TWDC, my typical shift consisted of working at a register and serving guests food because my role was Quick Service Food and Beverage. As always there were the occasional guest that caused a headache but overall it was a great experience."
good,"Other than being able to interact with guests every work day, your days off include free entry to any of the parks. The overall experience was incredible, and the only reason I won't go back is the distance from family."
good,"Work for Disneyland was super fun, you get to interact with guests from all over the world specially if you work in stores. Theres nothing in this job that's hard to do, every job in Disneyland is pretty much easy and enjoyable."
good,"Disney is a great place to learn and expand your knowledge. There is a lot of cool parts of the company because it is so large. There are also the obvious perks of being with Disney in general like pre screenings, passes to the park, etc."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Overall wonderful company to work for. Highly interactive environment, which is great because it makes the work day fly by. Only downside is the parking situation which gets a little ridiculous during the holidays or on busy days."
good,I completed a 6-month internship at Mickey's Cast Fitness Center and had an incredible experience. Leadership was great and benefits of free admission to the parks was a great plus.
good,I interned there in their Shanghai Branch. People are always willing to help and teach you. Learned a lot during my short time there.
good,"The Disney College Program is one of the most amazing things I've ever done. I worked as a custodian at Disney's Hollywood Studios, which taught me A LOT about humility and having a good attitude. I also learned a lot about customer service, and making sure that your guests are happy with their experience. Working for the Walt Disney Company, making magic for the guests is the most important thing. I got to be a part of that every day, and it was magical for me, too. I spent my days cleaning toilets, emptying trash cans, and answering guests' questions about various attractions or restaurants in the park. I developed close working relationships with my coworkers and my leaders. The working environment was wonderful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with negative guests. My favorite part of the job was the people- my coworkers and the guests."
good,"Fun place to work an lots of different opportunities"
good,"Em um dia típico de trabalho, eu era pontual no horário de entrada"
good,Great experience for someone just getting out of school and looking to learn a wide array of techniques from skilled chefs and co-workers.
good,"Working here can be fun, it just depends on your situation in life. If youre in need of a job now and need alot of hours, this place isnt typically right for you. "
good,"Fun work working for a great company. Never a boring moment."
good,"Working at Disneyland is everything you'd expect.  Plenty of opportunities to make people happy, and you definitely learn how to interact with all types of people.  The culture is very positive, but at times the sheer volume of Cast Members can make it difficult to feel like an individual."
good,Worked with the Change Management and Configuration Management team to process hundreds of IT changes for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The team worked well together and everyone worked hard to meet all deadlines and perform all required activities.
good,Disneyland was really a great place to work. Meet new people each day and got to make people smile. That was the best feeling.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, getting assignment and then go to your designated location and greeting everyone and start your shift. I learned that Safety comes first in all things you do because we want to ensure the safety of everyone as well as ourselves. Be kind and be understanding that circumstances that everyone deserves the same courtesy. Management was very understanding and willing to help, it was easy going to them when a cast member was in need or had an questions. Co-workers were amazing everyone was open and willing to get to know you and helped when in need; answered any questions you may have had. The most enjoyable part of would had to be meeting and serving the guest making sure that had a memorable experience."
good,"Loved working for Disney. Great job for anyone, Hard to get in and really need to know and understand the job."
good,Loved it!  If i was still in Fl I would go back!  You cant go wrong with Disney
good,"Worked 3rd shift which worked out well for child care. Place got my foot in the door for the IT field. Management, however, was lacking people skills, but were very nice on a personal level. They managed like they were following a manual without personality."
good,I had the best experience working here. My manager took a little bit of advantage of me and instead of doing their work passed it on to me but I was able to learn and absorb a ton as a result. Great people work here and creativity is encouraged. Lots of lay offs though and because of it a lot of people are fearful of their jobs.
good,"empresa jovem, com objetivo de crescimento visa muito o conforto de seu hospede"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I highly urge all young creative people to look into working for the Walt Disney Company. It can become a life career with great rewards.
good," Handled set up/break down for grand openings and main events for children. Ex: Colonial Golf Tournament; Hawaiian Falls, and movie premiers."
good,"Middle management needed training on how to be a good manager. Fast paced environment by the book, no room for mistakes high stress. Hardest part of my job was learning a new postion and not having a patient trainer. The most enjoyable was the people"
good,My time spent working for Disney was the best work experience I have ever had. I worked with wonderful people and got to meet people from all over the globe every single day. I admired the goals of the company which is to provide high quality guest service and customer satisfaction while always keeping a friendly and family oriented environment. Disney is very good at what it offers to its guests.
good,Great place to work. Dynamic workplace that provides various challenges meant to be overcame by a group of leaders working together in a meaningful way.
good,Training from The Walt Disney Company is one of a kind and state of the art. Their goal is to set you up for success and the rest is up to you. It takes time and dedication to move up the ranks at Disneyland Resort.
good,"I loved going to work every day, but upper management would always push something that didn't seem right to the employees and guests. I fully understand, that way orders are given but having employees fired for not agreeing with an idea, is rediculous. The pay was great but you have to earn it but becoming a lead or Manager. I would definitely recommend anyone to apply and try it out."
good,I treated others with respect and help others when help is needed! And the pleasure of working with a company that all my life as a child was a dream come true!
good,Fast-paced environment for sure. A lot of diversity in the group of people to work with and full of memorable moments for families and tourists. Great health benefits. Highly recommend.
good,"If you are looking to apply for the Disney College Program - do it!"
good,My typical day at work is busy and repetitive. Currently I work at Disney's All-Star Resort as a custodian. I have learned the different ways on how to properly handle and clean public areas. The management here are amazing. They want to set you up for success and always check in on you. The hardest part of the job is that you need to time your things correctly and always make sure you're attentive to your public areas throughout your whole shift- you are the one who makes sure everything is cleaned for the guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is the guest interaction. I see guest all week at my resort and I can build relationships with them and get to say hi to them while they pass the lobby or pool area.
good,I learned so much working for WDW company. It was a wonderful opportunity and encourage those thinking about it to apply to the Disney College Program right away. It provided me with skills I can use in life and other work experiences.
good,Highly recommended to anyone that is currently in school to try and partake in the Disney college program. Not only is it an eye opening experience it helps you grow as an individual.
good,"We often had moments where there wasn't much to do mixed in with too much to do. Guests often do not listen or obey instruction, the annual passholes are the worst of them, but most just don't understand until they see the instructions in action."
good,"Most of the people there are great to work with, others not so much. The guests are very demanding and you can only do so much for them until the start yelling in your face. Overall i  loved the benefit of working there, and i loved what i did."
good,"I honestly loved working for Disney and will think about going back multiple times. not only are you part of history, but you are part of a family and other people's family magical experiences. I would work here in a heart beat if I was in upper management or in the corporate offices. As that has been my goal since I was a child. I am and will forever will be a Disney girl through and through."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"good place to work, almost a family."
good,Work days were very structured. Everyone was assigned a track and went about their assignments. Breaks and Lunches were scheduled efficiently. Management was very friendly and knowledgeable about their area of work. You learned a lot about doing your job safely and how to keep everyone else safe as well. You are on your feet for an extended period of time and you got to interact and meet people from different areas of the park.
good,"My family loves it but we had to relocate.  They have alot of employees. That's how we keep the magic going with good castmembers. "
good,Great place to work and meet friends. The weather is kinda a plus since Cali has gorgeous weather. Free tickets daily is nice and saves money. They are supppeerrr strict  on being late so try not to do it.
good,"I worked at Disney as a paid intern through the DCP. While the pay was low and the hours high, the benefits you get from it make the job so incredibly worth it. You make friends to last a lifetime and you get so much customer service experience."
good,I did the Disney college program in college and it was a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend it to any college student looking to broaden her horizons.
good,"Disney is known for being the  happiest place on earth and that has proved its self with my entire time i worked, the crew was amazing. everyone was willing to go the extra mile. everyone wanted to learn each others roles and responsibilities."
good,"Overall my specific position was a lot of fun.  I never would have left the job, but it was shut down.  I miss it a lot, it was so much fun and the team was all great!"
good,"Apart from the usual negative guest, working for Disney was an experience that will captivate most, and leave you wanting for more. The story that comes with it will give you reason to continue."
good,I liked working there for the most part. I left to found a company. The pace at Disney was somewhat slow and I felt advancement was not likely. There were some problems in my mind in terms of diversity. The unconscious bias ran deep at this location.
good,While being a guest at Disney is all fun and games working there is much less exciting. It's still a job but it has been one of the most rewarding jobs I've worked. I loved every minute.
good,Hardest part of the job was advancement within the department as well as comparable compensation. But the benefits were a huge value with the employee theme park and resort discounts.
good,Loved having to work with kids and making their vacation so much better. Enjoyed meeting people from all over the world. Love the benefits of getting in the parks for free.
good,No real compliants... the two groups that my previous contract engagements were great.  I was extermely happy and fortunate to work the folks in BPT and Stores.
good,"Radio Disney provided me with a very fun, exciting and flexible internship opportunity that taught me a lot about the company. I was very excited to be apart of this team."
good,Although the pay is meant for people without bills or just want an extra income. The walt Disney company provides cast members with tickets for family and friends.
good,working here was good  like it a lot and learn a lot also  the most enjoy part of the job is to get the knowledge that i need to have in the position that i was working in and to learn my work
good,great place to work. easily the most relaxed call center ive ever worked at and i have worked at a few. they pay and comission is the only thing left to be desired but they do give you unlimited access to the parks and limited visits for your immediate family but its really fun and i loved my time there. management was great. overall great culture.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I loved working at this place. we have morning meeting that where very helpful for the day. My managers where very helpful and understanding for most of my problems and did all they could to help me when i needed to go take care of my wife.
good,"I loved working for Disney, it was a great environment, great co-workers, I had a chance to meet people from all over the world. I was just too tired all the time."
good,Disney is a great place to work and learn about dealing with work and people.The medical benefits are great but the pay is a little low. Management for the most part is very flexible and willing to listen to all concerns and they try to be flexible with needed time off.
good,"I worked for Walt Disney for 2 College Programs as a lifeguard and it was pretty fun. Good training, excellent discounts. Who wouldn't like going to Disney on your days off."
good,"Cabe resaltar el excelente clima laboral con el que se trabaja, con grandes compañeros y amigos. "
good,"I enjoyed working in the Disney College Program at Village Haus. I obtained good training and interpersonal skills with the guests. I did strongly dislike working in the kitchen though, I wasn't a very friendly environment but I've heard that's very common in kitchens. I loved working in the front of house though and it was very easy to switch my shifts. The one thing I would say that I disliked was the way scheduling was done. Because scheduling was done by an outside department sometimes it seemed like there were too many new people in one area and too many experienced people in another. That could cause difficulties for us in the restaurant."
good,"La cultura disney está en toda la empresa y eso realmente se siente, lo cual te hace sentir en casa. Lo malo es que no pagan muy bien, a no ser que sean puestos de alta jerarquía."
good,"is a part time job I love the people we are work is a good environment"
good,"I really enjoyed my time with this company. It was a really fun place to work and if you are willing to be flexible there is a lot of opportunity to move around and learn new things. The down side of this job is the pay, its minimum wage which makes it impossible to afford rent. The hours can be long and you'll have to work really early and really late, but it was an amazing experience and I would do it again in heartbeat."
good,"Disneyland was nearly as wonderful as a Cast Member as it was as a Guest. Fast-paced, collaborative, and lots of fantastic people! All but one of my managers was top-notch, and I would return to work there in a heartbeat!"
good,TWDC is a huge corporation so my experience does not reflect the company as a whole. My job and duties were great as it was a balance of corporate and public facing projects. It helped me get my start as a professional designer in entertainment.
good,"A typical day at Walt Disney was very busy. Disney was a place where you had to interact with many people and always make sure the guests were having a very memorable visit. Naturally I am a people person and I love conversations and interactions but, working at Disney it taught me so much more about great customer service and having a great deal of care with customers. Management however was ok. There was a lot of favoritism there and they had no problem showing that. The workplace culture was very spread. Ii worked with so many different people with different backrounds. I think that was the best part about the job. The hardest part about the job I would say was definitely the management. They weren't very polite and it was hard to see that they loved their jobs. Although one of the most important parts of all of our jobs was to have great customer service it seemed very hard for them to be great in that area. Lastly the most enjoyable part about my job were the unforgettable friends I made. They made everything so much better."
good,"Disney is like no other. I mean it is truly magical for both the guest and cast members. Regardless of where you work, be it backstage or onstage, even in the corporate structure, you are guaranteed to experience making a guest special."
good,Gli anni e il prodotto più bello della mia vita....
good,perfect for students. great discounts and free tickets twice a year(i believe) staff and managers are awesome. you always feel like you're  in disneyland very fun place to work even if youre a cashier. looooved working here
good,I am a Disney fanatic so working here is like a dream and my very first job. I enjoyed coming to work and wished I stayed with the company longer than seasonal.
good,"easy days in slow season"
good,The walt disney company is great place to work depending on which department you’re in. Most jobs are very stressful and your leads might have a high school attitude. Most cast members are friendly but there’s outliers that form a clique like a cliche high school movie.
good,"Interacting with thousands of guests every day in a collaborative food-service/restaurant environment. Met and worked with people from all over the world, and on my days off I was able to experience Disney Magic all throughout the resort."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I loved the ability to make ""magical moments"" and really go above and beyond to create such great memories and moments for guests. I enjoyed the quick-paced environment and the team work of the whole restaurant. The hard part were some technical difficulties with checking in guests and our reservation system being down, but management was very supportive and empowered you to use your best judgement to resolve issues."
good,"Assist Guests, opening and closing procedures, participate in Disney events, Maintain cleanliness of store amd replenish sales floor, operate cash registers"
good,"This company was very pleasant to work for. I enjoyed my time here. The hours were limited and hard to get, but I would recommend working for this company."
good,"Se trata de uma empresa de porte internacional, com um patrimônio imenso e uma enorme quantidade de funções e funcionários."
good,The place is not bad it’s the people who make it bad.  It’s all depend on your location where you working at the property some Chef are willing to teach you because they know that you are the future for this company and some treat you like nobody.
good,"I did translations from English to Spanish for The Walt Disney in Orlando as a vendor, on a temporary/contract basis. I was not an employee. The set up for payments was quick and professional."
good,walt disney is an awesome place to work in.There are no strict timings to report and leave.Add on benefits for employees are best in the industry.Switching to different job profiles is possible too.
good,"I worked here over 10 years and the growth opportunities were so hard to come by, and even if you did grow your salary never did. a typical day in the call center was like high school, micro managed and drama in the workplace."
good,"Loved working in such a dynamic environment with so many talented people, but a they make a lot of cuts post project completion which makes job security an issue."
good,i had a great time working there. I learned a lot form the chefs and coworker everyday. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a fast past job
good,"Everyone that I had the pleasure of working with always had a smile on their face, including how actively involved the managers were. Being as I was an activities hostess, my job literally meant playing games all day. The hardest part of the job was the low pay, however getting free entrance into the park whenever I wanted was great compensation."
good,"Due to the conditions of my employment being a cultural exchange program, there were many restrictions and conditions of my employment. However, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity that taught me the ins-and-outs of the hospitality and tourism industries. Some days I would work 6 hour shifts and other days I would work up to 13 hours. In this particular role I would start work at 4pm and sometimes not finish until 3 or 4am. I worked with people from many different countries and cultures, who ranged from 18 to in their 60s. "
good,"It is a team of professionals at the top of their game, and the industry at large. A wonderful group to be a part of. Only downside is advancement opportunity."
good,"Intelligent, dedicated, and highly motivational people fill the halls of the organization in every department I frequented.  Difficulty in advancement and communication given the sheer size, scope, and fiscal conservatism the company imparts. A very welcome atmosphere shared by all."
good,"A typical day at work is about 6-15 hours depending on staffing.I have learned a lot about how to deal with customer service and problem solving. Management for the most part was fantastic, but would always say there is someone that can re[place you. MAde you feel like you were not valuable to the company. I love this job and being able to create magic for so many people."
good,A great opportunity to enrich and enhance the lives of an under served target audience. Working within the Disney company provided amazing exposure and chances for advancement. As with any large company senior management can be a challenge as they often are listening to financial as opposed to the audience. Resulting in slow release and often behind the curve in core deliverables. All in all a very positive environment with expected shortfalls.
good,"I've learned many things throughout my years at Disney. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people in different countries as well as different shows, soap operas, news anchors, etc.The hardest part of the job for me is saying goodbye after so many years."
good,"Great people and projects. I learned a lot about film, video games, and writing. I loved working with the Disney properties and expanding my understanding and skill set.  Everyone was encouraging and hard-working. The video game industry is rough and the hours are long but the management and co-workers tried hard to make it enjoyable despite the hard deadlines."

good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Great company to work for. They train you and always go out of their way to make you comfortable. Seniority based company which sucks in the beginning because you get the bad shifts but it gets better. Hours suck during non-peak season.
good,Positive environment. Love putting smiles on all Guests faces. All aspects of how the brand could be affected is managed in the backend and that accountability made it a great place to be.
good,"*Learned management skills."
good,Freedom to seek out interesting questions and answers within available data sets.  No real down sides.  Will continue to do work with them.
good,Great company to work for with a lot of good benefits for their workers. Managers actually care about employees and are willing to help out whenever needed. also a great company to be at
good,"I love working a the travel Company for Walt Disney. The people, from the managers on down are there to help. "
good,"I started working for Disney just as they were closing down to relocate to Memphis, tn  but I really enjoyed working in the multis packing area. I also did material handler and forklift."
good,Creative environment that is driven by project work.  Lots of volatility and instability in the work.  Opportunity to be involved in multiple projects.
good,"Walt Disney Company es una empresa en donde reina la magia de sus personajes, y su enorme fuerza en los medios de comunicación."
good,"Good place to work, Decent amount of benefits and good, sensible co-workers. Lots of professional challenges are there, some good, some bad. Overall, good place with long term security."
good,A typical day at work was fast and continually busy. I learned so much about retail and customer service. The management there was amazing and they really wanted to help us benefit and also keep an eye out for the company. My coworkers became like family to me. I loved them all. The hardest part of the job were the long and rough hours. The most enjoyable part of the day was anytime something great happened where I could make someone smile.
good,"Working Attractions at Disneyland, I would go into rotation and dispatch vehicles into the attraction and insure that guests were all seated properly and the attraction was completely operational. This fast paced environment taught me to be calm and organized and efficient."
good,"Mon travail consistait à réaliser les boissons( cocktails, boissons chaudes...) de servir ainsi que d'encaisser mes clients. Un esprit d'équipe rendait le travail très agréable, il y avait une dynamique pour progresser avec des collègues formateurs."
good,"If Balancing is done by us to work and play within this company which I rate the best than everything works out just fine."
good,"Working with my Dept. was great experience throughout my years there.  Company gave many opportunities to employee to pursue"
good,I loved both management and my coworkers that I had and I loved the environment that I was in. I loved getting into the parks for free.  I loved how their guest services were as well
good,these job i love because of the co-working i have lots of good people but mangement is the worst other then that its a ok job
good,I learned how to give kids a big smile.I learned all about the back of the house and the front of house.At disney we all had to work together so it was team work.The hardest part of the job was to being stuck in back of house while i want to be in the front of house seeing all the guest.The most enjoyable part of my job was that i got to give the guest a magical day.
good,"A great working environment. I am perusing other job opportunities due to relocation, not due to the role or company."
good,"My co-workers in the many different business units were all very different people.  They have unique abilities and qwerks, however they all did have something in common.  They cared about the company and their jobs so genuinely that it came across as a positive work environment no matter the level of stress at any given time."

good,"ótimas profissionais, pessoas bem dinâmicas, os trabalhos desenvolvidos com as crianças é maravilhoso."
good,"Great benefits, commitment to professional development."
good,"5 different stores ; greet costumers, cashier,stock, make coffee and latte(cookie store)"
good,"Co-workers are like family.  We support each other BOTH professionally and personally.  For example, if a cast member gets hurt or sick during a show or for the day, cast members, who are affected by the insufficiency of the Cast, will accommodate their schedule for the day to help keep the show running.  "
good,"great company values, working with customers and co workers is very pleasant throughout the day. Internal support is excellent as well."
good,Working at the Disney resorts was quite a magical experience. I got to work with some amazing people. Each day we go out of our way to make each guests love their Disney experience. Doing so however can always raise its fair share of challenges but in the end we are always able to have each guest walk away with a smile.  
good,"Great internship, a lot of hours but in the end it was truly worth it my co workers were fun and I had a lot of people help me along the way."
good,"* Dinâmico, corrido, com grande fluxo de pessoas."

Dedication and commitment to the legacy that founded this great company is in the life blood of everything that's done. Guest experience is paramount with a focus on storytelling and experience delivery to surprise and delight the guests. Magical.
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar. Si existe inestabilidad laboral, empresa muy co dependiente del dueño y su estado de ánimo."
good,"lots to do make all type of chicken, cut fires,management they r pretty good but sometimes they yell at u, co - workers get alone with every one need to speak alot of spanish to unders stand there ways. the hardest part of my job is cutting potatoes with this real cool machine, cut about 1 pallet of 30 boxes that comes 145 potatoes during at night. the only thing i injoy about these job is it location downtown disney"
good,"This place is awesome, but every job has it's downsides. If you aren't in a good mood, or feeling good, being around guests can be difficult. It's a fantastic place to work, you are always around exciting people, and get to hear and meet people from all over the country or world"
good,"Work with various types of people in different environments each day. Learn communication and multitasking skills. Managers are generally easy to work with and fun loving. Co-workers are easy to bond with as you share this common experience. Big crowds and high temperatures can make some days difficult. But there are abundant opportunities to learn, network, enjoy unique experiences, and gain a once-in-a-lifetime chance."
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Radio Disney for over a year. The Road Crew that I worked with became really good friends. It was enjoyable bringing the Disney magic all over MA and RI to kids and families. The downside is that I only worked when there were events, which was pretty much on the weekends. There were no benefits with them medial or even any Disney benefits. Unfortunately, I did have to leave the job due to the Pawtucket office closing and I didn't even find out from my manager, I heard it through the grapevine. I was giving the opportunity to work with the Waltham office/team and I did for a little bit, but the drive was much too far."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"I loved my time with the company! I miss the family I had at the Disney Store! Not a lot of room for advancement though. When I moved to Disney World, I had a much different experience. Management is pretty poor, and it's still very hard to advance. It was a fun college job."
good,FUn and intense work environment. very busy.  Need to be fast and standing on feet all day. Meet people from all over the world. Good perks like comp admission to parks.
good,"I did the Disney College Program at Walt Disney World and absolutely LOVED my work area! The only downside was that I didn't get a lot of hours, which required me to be a bit more budget savvy, but it was definitely manageable. I think if I wasn't in Merchandise (tons and tons of older cast members), I would have had more hours, but it's still a great area to work in."
good,"Buena productora de eventos, preocupada de las necesidades de sus trabajadores y de brindar comodidad en las diferentes ciudades en donde se trabajó."
good,When you work for The Walt Disney Company you have the chance to literally meet anyone from anywhere. It is such a blast. And cast members get into the parks for free.
good,"Work began with about an hour commute. You are guaranteed your hours that you are scheduled. Within the internship program, participants are scheduled on the weekends and holidays which is an immersive experience within itself. Management always depends on your location. Within festivals, the management was absolutely fantastic. I felt cared for and was appreciated as a valued cast member my whole experience. I felt most challenged to grow in the area that would be learning how to work with a vast amount of personalities. The variety, gave me a chance to grow in understanding of differences. The workplace culture is valued in the four keys; safety, courtesy, efficiency and show. It would be nearly impossible to pick my favorite part of this experience because, it was overall an absolutely impressive. One highlight that I did enjoy was creating ways to make magic for guests both big and small everyday."
good,"I enjoyed being able to work from home, training was very detailed and right on point, giving me the ability to succeed with my position. It's amazing"
good,"I love my job but hated the pay. If they compensate base in the work at had, most people would stay. It’s a high turnover because of the pay. Most people lovers the job, just couldn’t make ends meet without working 2-3 jobs. I has to resign or I would have became homeless. It was heartbreaking to leave."
good,"I learned Disney courtesy, safety, show, and efficiency through 2.5 years at Disney's California Adventure. I made wonderful friends and had wonderful memories made working there."
good,"Working at a Disney Store gives you the unique opportunity to be creative and playful, while hustling through the busiest retail environment. Company policy and guidelines are clear, effective, and fair."
good,"working at walt disney world shape me better as a worker and as a person. i learned how to handle stress, work under pressure and get out of my comfort zone."
good,j'aurais souhaité intégré cette Société en poste fixe mais elle privilégie les missions d'intérim et pour le moment je n'en ai aucune
good,a typical day just consist of helping guests making their experience magical and learning a lot about how to make good out of any situations. The job isn't perfect but is sure is a great place to be.
good,"Work for The Walt Disney Company has been a great adventure. I started over a year ago, I have grown within the company. The support from the managers are great. Daily they ask how everyone is doing and want to make sure every single cast member feels welcome."
good,"This was a great first job to have. The only thing I wish is that the pay was better. But other than that the atmosphere was great, everyone was so helpful and great to work with"
good,"I'm being forced to write this by indeed so I have nothing to say really, I loved working at Disney and have nothing else to add to that so at this point I'm just adding words."
good,"Entreprise très formatrice pour un début de carriére avec un panel de métiers diversifiés. "
good,"Disney is a fun, and exciting place to work. The company is very welcoming and concerned about its employees. I remember there always being some form of contest, giveaway, and or putlock involving everyone."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Enjoyed working with The Walt Disney Company. It was a creative and fun working environment and we developed many successful campaigns in my years working there.
good,"Excellent work environment, a typical day at work, does not feel like work at all. A skill that I learned there was how to turn around an unhappy customer to a happy one. Thank you the experience Disney."
good,Great place to learn and get out of your comfort zone when delivering a magical experience.Every second was a day of joy and was an amazing culture to work from.
good,"I worked as an extra while in high school; it was fun but only a temporary summer thing. Typically it was a pretty laid back day, it was really nice that we also got to use craft services."
good,Working for Disney is something that is really a once in a life time experience. They really do put the guests first. Everything from the uniforms to the lighting and volume of music and tv screens are well thought out. I would highly recommend working here. Everyday was a fun especially around holiday from October to New Years.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar, voltada a resultados como todas, mas moderadamente comprometida com o funcionário. Excelentes benefícios."
good,A great position when this department existed. Lots of ways to collaborate and grow with the company. Everyday was different and came with new challenges.
good,"The training throughout the entire company is top notch. "
good,"Working at Disney is hard. They have high standards and expectations. They are one of the most recognized brands in the world and have gotten that way because they have HIGH STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS."
good,"Le lieu de travail est innestimable, l'ambiance au sein de l'entreprise est globalement très bonne, et y être salariée apporte beaucoup d'avantages."
good,"Long work days, that are always in the heat, but overall great experience. The company makes you work hard but rewards you in many ways. Other employers know the rigorous requirements of the company and respect them when they see that on a resume"
good,This job didn't allow for the best work/life balance and did not provide very many hours however that was made up for in the culture and benefits provided to each cast member.
good,Really enjoyable atmosphere and company ethos. Great  people with passion for the brand and some visionary leaders. The hours can be long but you get out what you put in.
good,Worked hard but there was always something fun happening. Not many long hours as projects are an ebb and flow in nature. Advanced in title but not equally in pay.
good,Great learning opportunity for guest service. Great management and coworkers. Awesome opportunity for advancement if you put in the effort. Able to shadow any job you could imagine.
good,This is a great company to work for and very collaborative. Executives are going to great lengths to be transparent and have a positive culture around the company. The pay could be better and it is difficult to advance through the company unless someone leaves.
good,Disney is an amazing and dynamic company with many opportunities. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a different challenge. There are opponents worldwide so there is always something new and interesting.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney has a hand in everything.  Because there are so many companies under the Disney umbrella, it's hard to say what it's like to ""work for Disney.""  I worked for Disney's Parks and Resorts (experience at ABC, Lucas, Pixar, ESPN, Marvel... could be different.) and it is a fascinating amalgam of old-school 'it's been done this way for forty years' stuff and bleeding edge DARPA-level tech.  I love it. "
good,"Creating magical moments, and interacting with guest of all ages, and from different countries. Get to enjoy the magic of Disney with your cast members, and guest who walk in."
good,"I absolutely loved working for the company it's a fun fast paced environment that is beneficial in so many ways. A typical day at work included being designated a position and carrying out its tasks throughout the day. I learned great customer service skills, how to run a business, and leadership skills. Managment was nice, they were stressed at times but they didn't mind to help with any issues that you or a guest would run into."
good,"Start the day, checking it is stock and ready to go, star doing chec ins and check out, assist guest with any questions, about transportation or tickets.  I learn a lot be patient and take care of the guest.  We have great group of leaders the believe in me and support me.  Culture guest are first and be sure, the do not go away unhappy, go above and beyond always.  When you are not able to find a room with handicap accesible, because we are sold out, or when the guest it is so mad, the it not matter how hard you try, there not happy.  The most enyojable time see the parents so happy, when we give books or made the kids smile, when they ask more a color MB and when give them one.  Additional to that when we help with the Magic bands, bus transportation to the airport. Cast Member love what the do, make a Magical day for the kids and the parents it is just another thing."
good,"TWDC te da la posibilidad de conocer, aprender, ser parte de una organización que trasciende las epocas con su contenido y que llega a millones de personas con sus productos y servicios. una experiencia hermosa, de crecimiento personal y profesional."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is one that I hope to return to one day. The hours in this particular role were highly unreliable, and breaks were monitored by phone logins. Ultimately, the wonderful thing about the work culture was a hands on management approach which allowed in my role a great relationship to succeed and thrive."
good,"Great place to work and do not plan on leaving Im not sure why any of this is relevant if I am looking to get some freelance work."
good,"Who wouldn't want to work for Disney?!"
good,"Disney is a fun place to work with a lot of good discounts. I like getting in for free and getting vacation days and sick time. I do wish I got paid a little more and had a 401k, but can not complain about getting into the park free and get complimentary tickets for friends."
good,"The Disney Store is a great place to work if you love being upbeat and love kids. I only left because I had a problem with one of the managers, but if I could I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,The Walt Disney Company offers a variety of wonderful opportunities  for a person to grow and learn more about themselves and where they would like to start their career path(s).
good,"Management takes interest in your personal growth and development. The culture is very fun working in a theme park environment. It's biggest downfall is that employees don't leave, therefore upward career growth can be challenging unless the company is in a period of expansion."
good,"I loved working for the Walt Disney Company at the Disneyland Resort. The managers have an open door policy, there is room for advancement within your area and outside of it, and fellow cast members are awesome!"
good,"Serve Guest \ Handle Money "
good,"Great place to work. High rating for efficiency and safety. The company is the best with their entertainment offerings. Great working hours, resources, tools, benefits, support. Great management."
good,Working for the Walt Disney Company is great. Working in foods is not. My managers were the greatest and some where not. Depending on your location I think that matters.
good,"Really enjoyed my time interning, however it is a bit of a shame that graduate opportunities are so hard to come by there. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Worked in the massive textile services facility at Disney. Made sure the bags kept moving on the overhead rails."
good,What can I say about this job. there  was no place else I would work.always a happy environment. all Managers very understanding. never had a problem there. This job was one of the greatest for me
good,"I have enjoyed working for the mouse. Hours can be crazy, but the environment and making magic for people makes it all worth it in the end. Seeing kids and families having the time of their lives and knowing that you may have played a small part in that is truly a great feeling."
good,"I was an employee for nineteen years at the Bristol, Ct. facility. I worked in both Digital centers with an emphasis on editing.  I learned quite a bit about nonlinear editing and server based editing. This is a fast paced environment and there are plenty of projects and events to keep you busy."
good,"Loved working here not only for the benefits but you actually have fun working. The happiness is contagious and the culture is strong and enforced. I like the communication with management and teams. Clear instructions and everyone helping each other.You can even see the ceo working by your side at times, it's an awesome company regardless of how big it is, it focuses on employees and making the customer happy."
good,"The Disney legacy sets a very high bar in terms of expectations regarding creativity, innovation and customer experience. I loved going to work there enough that the typical which arise from strong talented people not always seeing eye-to-eye were more entertaining than challenging. That being said, its best to remember that making magic is a blend of reality and illusion which requires trust and a suspension of disbelief.  Like any other company there is good and bad in the mix. Fortunately, the bigger goal and Walt's legacy usually wins out over the long haul. "
good,"I absolutely adore being a part of the Disney Story that the store creates for each guest. The unique use of guest interaction and Disney language creates so many memorable and magical moments guests remember long after leaving the store, and often remain the highlight of their day. I know I've done my job well when guests are having as much fun in our store as they would be having at Disneyland park."
good,Each day working for the Walt Disney Company was a dream come true! The atmosphere was welcoming and exciting! The work was rewarding and educational! The people were great to be around!
good,"A typical day at work would be checking in first time guests at Disney and preparing online check ins."
good,Strong training environment.  I have had SANS training and Plural Sight training.  I enjoyed working for Disney and have come back to the Company 3 times.
good,High expectations accomplished. As my first time working in such an important company i have to say i have learn a lot. This helped me out determine whats my specialty is going to be on the media field.
good,"Working for Disney was the best job I've had in retail. It is magical as one would say. There is plenty to learn and experience and can be as fun as you make it. I would be there longer if I could make a living off of it but that is retail for you. The perks might be worth it for some if you can use them. Great people as well. "
good,"Typical day is to start off with a Scrum meeting (Agile development practices), meeting with designers and architects to go over current and upcoming design needs. Make recommendations on feasibility of proposed features, and implement agreed upon features / gameplay."
good,"I enjoyed working for Disney. At times management seemed a little insightful, however they were always organized and expected the best."
good,"Best Corporate Culture with excellent work"
good,"A typical day as a PhotoPass Photographer was quite the experience.  I would get to work, go backstage at Disneyland and get all of my camera equipment ready.  You have a camera, neck strap, PhotoPass Cards, batteries, and a pamphlet to help out with guests questions.  After I got all of my equipment I would go to a manager or as we called a lead, and get my locations and time for the day.  Then I would go and stretch at my location with the other Photographers.  We usually went into a room and watched a 15 minute video to stretch before going out to our location.  "
good,"Great place to work and great company, good benefits and but not great compensation or management, good hours a week and a lot of training and certification over the company."
good,enjoyed my time while working for The Walt Disney Company as an attractions cast member. It was a great experience and had the best co-workers ever.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"As a college intern, you definitely get meet different people everyday. This internship is VERY customer service oriented. I worked at two resorts, one as a housekeeper and a food prep in a resort cafe. During my duration as an intern, I learned the value of professionalism and communication skills. Perhaps the most important skill I learned here was listening skills. This organization deals with thousands of guests from different parts of the world. With that, listening skills are very important."
good,"Great company with many benefits. However, you can't really have much of a social life during peak season due to work."
good,"Working for Disney not only is a rapid learning experience, but it also is a huge boost on any resume if you aren't sure that you want to work there for life. Working in the corporate offices means there is something new everyday and a lot of autonomy is given to make business decisions."
good,"It was the greatest job I've ever had, I wish I could go back honestly. I loved every minute of it."
good,Great place to work but full time positions are few and far in between. The work hours are extremely varied and there isn't much concern over time in between shifts.
good,"My job was great. I helped guests at the front desk. I was the start to their vacation. Their were times that guests were crabby or bad, but the next guest always could be the next best."
good,"A typical day involved a tremendous amount of cash handling as well as making sure your till balanced with your inventory at the end of the day. Disneyland taught me a tremendous amount of customer service skills. In addition to this, viewing the culture of employees at Disneyland gave me an impression of what a work culture should be like. especially in terms of management - employee relationships. The hardest part of the job was keeping up orders with an outdoor vendor cart as a stocker. This required making real time estimates of what a cart may need in the future, as taking its stock would require walking across the entire park, about a 30 minute task."
good,The team at the Disney car care center has been together for many years. It can go from crazy busy to ghost town in 5 min. Drivers look out for them self dispatchers are in there own little room. but at the end of the day we are a team.
good,A great place to work. You meet a wide range of people from all walks of life. Interacting with guests can be challenging and rewarding all at the same time.
good,Disney call center was a very happy place and the management was very professional. There was not a hard part of the job at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was when guests called in and they were very satisfied with the way that they was treated.
good,En esta empresa era muy divertido trabajar auque el trabajo era de alto volumen pues  estaba localisado en los parques  Dysney lo  encontre como una experiencia muy agradable
good,A typical work day starts with reviewing the shared email inbox for new shopping cart /PO requests. Team members dividing them among themselves. Reviewing my SAP consolidated inbox for invoices to be processed.  Follow-up with any AP issues. Organize the work flow for the day and process all request/payments within the Procurment Center of Excellence timeframe.
good,It was a great place to work at. Co-workers were very helpful and friendly.  Great Work/Life Balance.  Room for movement was very limited.
good,"It's always great to work with good reputed companies like Disney, so that as the company grow i can grow with in the company."
good,"I was an intern on the Disney College Program. Overall, I enjoyed the experience; it was definitely a lot of work in the Florida heat, but employees receive free park admission and you get to tell people you worked in Disneyworld."
good,"The network operations center was an extremely fast paced, technical specific, environment. Proactive response time to any outages was very critical. The enterprise network itself was huge with nodes in most of the countries worldwide, built on a Cisco platform. There were four major data centers in the United States and two in Europe. Very challenging job."
good,"Once i enter into work it's good energy, everyone is happy and ready to work. When working their you learn good communication skills and interacting with the guest. My Co-workers are NOT Co-workers they are family, hardest part of the job is really having that sense of urgency when the pressure is on. The mosy enjoyable part of the day is the Dj comes out because then you can really interact with the guest."
good,"Initially trained on back of house duties working in the 5 different shops, but quickly transferred to front of house cashier responsibilities. Built repertoire with guests by holding conversations and recognizing returning families and individuals, as well as creating magical moments for younger guests. "
good,It is a great culture and environment with high energy.  It is always happy and fun to take care of the guests.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo

good,"Working for the Disney Company has been the most successful and rewarding experience of my career as I have gained personal growth while expanding my skills."
good,"On a daily basis, I was able to interact with thousands of guests as they entered and left the theme parks.  Job had its perks and great benefits."
good,"Highly experienced team with very good leaders. Team members accomplished the work that should have been done by 10x more people. Everyone in the department was very supportive of each other and there were no egos. Everyone does what they need to, to get the project done, no matter how big or small. The attitude is as a result of the supportive management team."
good,"I had a lot of fun at this location. Very busy work days, 500+ arrivals a day. I had the opportunity to change job title."
good,"Everyday was always a new, unique experience. I learned how to stock, replenish/refill shelves as well as valuable customer service skills. The managers were very friendly and very helpful. My co-workers each had their pros and cons but overall they always did their best to give the customers a great experience. The hardest part would be on the days the store was lonely, it would make the day seem slow. Odd right? Anyways my most enjoyable part of the job was opening, even though I only opened a few times. Why? Because every time we opened we would have a special little ""opening ceremony"" with customers (the children mostly) and it would always bring a smile to their face. That to me is priceless, because I had the chance to make someone happy."
good,"Great place to work. Excellent coworkers. Meeting people from around the world and making magical moments. Can be long, hot hours in Florida."
good,"Fun place to be, loved that I could move around and experience different things in my 10 years.  Miss it very much"
good,"I started as a chocolateer making $9.50 per hour, and within a year and a half have received 3 promotions and have almost doubled my pay.  I am the first hourly manager within the company working part time.  Work/home life balance at this company has been amazing.  Management team works well together to make everyone's job easier.  Training/mentoring isn't very strong, so a lot of on the job learning is needed.  Also, to really advance, you must be willing to relocate to the Bay Area where headquarters are."
good,"La scuola dove lavoravo era estremamente stimolante sotto svariati punti di vista , la direttrice era sempre pronta a proporci novità sul campo di lavoro, era disponibile e cortese, ho instaurato un ottimo rapporto con le mie colleghe e sopratutto con le mamme dei miei alunni."

good,A The Walt Disney Co. (Brasil) é uma empresa de entretenimento multinacional americana que devido ao seu ramo de atividade propicia um ambiente agradável para se trabalhar.
good,"work in fun place traveling around the world"
good,A typical day at work would include  creating magical moments for the kids and providing great customer service. I learned a lot of the making of Disney and how to always be happy and not let anything overcome you. My co-workers and management team were great and if anything happened they would always be willing to assist. Their was nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable was being part of the biggest team in the world.
good,"Work day was long and hard with lots of retune and structured duties. Lots of financial and corporate responsibilities. Most of the training I received was OJT but it was very through. Hiring ,firing and human resource duties as well as profit and loss expenses."
good,I enjoyed my time at the Disney store.  I learned a lot and accomplished a lot too.
good,"The disney company knows how to put on a show, it provides an amazing expirience for students, and I'm thankful for the time I had with the company. Compensation is meger, but it pays rent, also keep in mind this is an intership for college students don't expect too much!"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney is a great place to get started, the training is above all else.  If you decide to stay promotions are very competitive and compensation is below industry average. "
good,"Guest Services, payments making reservations and building a vacation plan for them. Share the fun of the product with someone who has never been. Parking was hard. Your general manager was always there to help with whatever they could. You must meet strict guildlines"
good,"Very fast paced, and plenty of knowledgeable people to help you get started in the industry. Started the days prepping for the crowds, and then had the joy of putting out the great dishes for the guests to enjoy.....and enjoy they did!!"
good,"Great learning opportunity, but limited upside and overall growth."
good,The internship helped develop skills that I will carry on with my future positions in hospitality.
good,"It was enjoyable working as a talent supervisor for Disney Theatrical. Working on Broadway is an experience I will never forget. The people were hard working, detailed oriented, and fast moving."
good,"Each cruise we have about 1700 kids. I'm responsible for creating the schedules for 80 Counselors, shoreside and ship ordering, Guest interaction, and creating happiness and a Magical experience for all. We have 5 different Youth areas that I'm responsible for. I have learned a lot about working long hours, but doing it with a smile because you want each and every Guest to have the best vacation. I work on a management team of 5 others. We work very closely everyday to help run a successful Youth Activities program. The hardest part of the job is to work so many hours for 5 months straight. The people you work with are the same people you eat with and hang out with on the ship. Sometimes it would just be better to go for a walk and get away from work on your free time, but that can't happen. The best part of the job is speaking with the Guests and hearing how much their children loved our youth Activities areas and had a great vacation because of it."
good,Co-Workers and Management were very nice. Very inviting and comfortable working enviroment
good,"i enjoyed working for Disney, met alot of new and interesting people, very organized, co-workers were great, management was great when i worked for Magic Kingdom."
good,"Fun place to work. Great benefits fun place to work. Depends on where you casted to work, hourly rate varies from location to location. Quite a process to clock in for shift."
good,"Disney helps with college ! Let Disney show you your future , it does take time. In the end it is all worth it. You also can play in the parks for free."
good,I worked for the world of Disney that was on 5th ave in NYC it was amazing I miss my job. And coming  too the world of Disney.  It was beyond my dreams
good,A typical day at work involves many sales calls via the phone to sell the Disney films to the theatre owners.  I learned to deal professionally with others.  The hardest part of the job was often was deadlines and volume of some of the projects.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working as a team with other people and the satisfaction of a job well done.
good,"Wages vary greatly based on jobs and how long employees have worked with the company. For example, a Disney character's wage starts at $8.20 per hour, and maxes out at $13.59. Base pay for an entertainment technician, on the other hand, starts at $14.75 an hour and is capped at $21.60."
good,"I've always been a big fan of Disney, and working for the company as a security officer has only strengthened that admiration.  The Walt Disney company treats their cast members very well and there are great perks and benefits."
good,Best place to work the hours you need. Life does happen and they need to be a little more understanding when someone is 1 minute late coming in or coming back from break
good,Flexible schedules that work for students. Learned how to improve my leadership skills and enjoyed the relationships I built working there. I truly enjoyed working here
good,"La oportunidad brindanda fue enriquecedora ya que al tener un puesto de trabajo cob cotacto directo con personas de diferentes países me permitía poder practicas idiomas, asimismo. me gustaría destacar la gran cultura organizacional que maneja Disney World la cual está enfocada en brindar una excelente calidad de servicio viéndose reflejado primer lugar en la atención al cliente."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Absolutely loved working here! The management was very attentive to any situation from employees/customers. Each employee put the customer over themselves.
good,"Indeed one of the best companies i have ever worked for.  Great co workers, so much room to grow, company that fosters a good work/life balance, promotes growth, and fully supportive.  with a few bad apples through-out."
good,"If you love Disney it’s great, but the pay is minimum wage and advancement is difficult. Disney College Program is the best way to go to get a nice internship under your belt"
good,I lost the job do to being young and dumb. I wish I still worked there good company great benefits. It has a good chance to advance if you try to. Lotsof fun workers. The ability to go to the parks for free. Just a great job if you get it.
good,"- Changed into “Disney Look” "
good,I loved my job at The Walt Disney Company. Everyday was a new opportunity to make magic for a guest. learning something new and make lasting memories.
good,it was fun and busy but it was a very friendly environment. I always enjoyed working there because i could walk round that place with my eyes closed because i had years experience doing order picking and i liked looking at the different items that i was picking.
good,"I have been working at the Walt Disney Company retail at Downtown Disney for almost a year and so far it has been pretty good. During the holiday seasons, the stores get very crowded so it would be pretty intense for someone who prefers more calm and slow-paced work. I love working with my fellow cast members and checking out the new products that come out every month. Although we occupationally get some difficult situations, the leads and managers would assist us so we don't have to face them alone."
good,"Very friendly staff, technically sound professionals, relaxed atmosphere at the same time fast paced agile (we had two weeks sprints at the time) Overall I enjoyed working there."
good,"I really miss my job there. Best benefits, only issue is seasonal requirements were jacked up RIGHT as a switched from part-time to seasonal and my commute was now impossible"
good,"Disney Corporate, is an superior place to work, with challenging and varied projects.  Learning and development opportunities exist if you seek them out.  Frequent changes and re-organizations occur, due to Disney acquisitions.  Reasonable work/life balance and excellent benefits."
good,"Great job no complaining at all not to much to say just work hard , nice culture.  Employees are nice and will build a friendship with everyone.  Nice"
good,"Title says it all. While I greatly enjoyed the work I was doing and the people I got to work with, the management team was very withdrawn and did not support their cast whatsoever."
good,I was hired for this position within the company and based on my experience and expertise I was asked to come to this property to open this hotel within a Resort.
good,"Fun environment, surrounded by other employees that care about their jobs and really do work hard to give all guests a pleasant experience. I worked in Food and Bev QSR at California Adventure. There's a lot of walking, need to arrive to work about an hour early in order to make it to your location on time, disney provides employee-only shuttles around the park and to the parking lot and let you clock out 20 minutes early in order to account for the time it takes to walk throughout the park (you may be stopped by guests to answer questions). If I moved back to that area, I would definitely want to work there again. Only down side is everyone wants to be full-time but there are so many limited spots, will only get it if you've been with the company for years. Part-time isn't guaranteed 20 hours, sometimes I got as little as 8 hours a week. Good place to work if you're going to school, easy online portal to request days off and change your availability frequently. If you manage to get a job there and never plan on going to school, stay there as long as you can. They do give you opportunities to advance, benefits and decent pay eventually, just gotta put in years and years of service."
good,"Working here was an amazing experience. It teaches you a lot as far as being punctual, being positive minded and being creative. It also teaches you how to better interact with people on a daily basis."
good,the Disney culture is great and you team members end up becoming your family but the pay can definitely be raised for the pressure and standards put onto the cast member
good,It was a great experience with a good work environment with people from all over the world and learning how one of the largest companies in the world do business
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Disney will work you hard. I mean HARD. Full time is start to finish go go go. But if you enjoy Disney products, you'll still love the job. The benefits are regular and you very much feel part of the company, plus the actually company benefits. If you've wanted to visit every inch of Disneyland/Disney World, working for them is the way to go as you'll be able to go in almost every day of the year (except the busiest days, where you won't want to go anyways.) But if you're not an A type personality, or otherwise a nose-to-the-grindstone person, prepare to get drained. I was not the first member of my hiring group to burnout and I know I wasn't the last either. Strangely, I'd go back. I did love it, I just got exhausted."
good,"With the large number of guests who visit Walt Disney World, my time there allowed me to interact with various different types of people from all around the world. Fast-paced is an understatement for this job, but the environment was so positive and encouraging, it was hard to get stressed. I loved my time working for the Walt Disney Company."
good,A typical day always started with a brief meeting explaining how the day or night would go. You would help guests shop around and check them out at the register. You would try to up sell a product and wish them a magical day. There was always a magical atmosphere and the playing of Disney songs. You could help children pick out costumes. I loved that I could be myself and passionate about the things I was selling.
good,"Great place to work, everyone is like family! Lots of opportunities for growth, benefits are great. Very demanding in hours, only con is work/balance life for certain roles."
good,"I learnt so much working here and was definitely thrown in at the deep-end, although this was scary at first it was so beneficial to me to be given so much responsibility and respect by my team and manager. A typical day was busy with lots of meetings, content creation, liaising with Europe, The Middle East and African Disney Channels teams and planning content and strategy."
good,Disney is a Man that cared about Families and bringing them together. I respect Disney and LOVE working for that reason for Disney. I enjoy seeing the joy in families when they come and visit the Parks.
good,Overall a great place to work.    Worked with some of the most professional people I have ever worked with.     It was a little difficult to manage under California Labor laws.  It was like working with unions in the Midwest
good,"At the Walt Disney Company, if you do your job and handle tasks without being asked, you can become a star! As in every job. Someone who can work and deal with whatever's thrown at them will always succeed.  Attitude must be pleasant!  No one wants to work with a negative Nelly!  "
good,"When you work here, you are a character in the story of Disneyland.  People who live in Disneyland, whether it be in Fantasyland, Critter Country, or New Orleans, have their own culture and make sure that the Guests know that and experience the magic of traveling to a different place and time complete with its inhabitants."
good,"I am part of a Creative Team, which handle all the creative and graphic Designing work for there india operations. My job is to create Motion graphics and Graphic designing for there all channels in india."
good,"I have never had a more exciting work environment than being in the parks getting the chance to interact and serve guests. Management was amazing. Co-workers were a blast. Once you are trained you are thrown into your role as a cashier. You will do cash handling, cleaning, stocking products, and food prep. The hardest part would be having the occasional irate guest who has to take their anger out on you, but as long as you keep yourself together in front of the guest you will do great. You can vent to your co-workers on your break. Being in food as part of a union they are great at giving you 15 min breaks every 2 hours and you will never miss your 30 min lunch unless you're scheduled for a short shift."
good,Working at for the Walt Disney Company is a one of a kind experience. I have never had to endure so many complex situations and still come back the next day smiling. I enjoy every minute of being a cast member and would do anything to go back. The experience I've gained is phenomenal and I feel prepared for anything that can come my way. I miss it. I miss the job and the cast members that became my family. I wish I could go back.
good,"I give a 5 star rating to Walt Disney. Job, perks, benefits, work environment. "
good,"I worked BoardWalk Resort, Bih Thunder, p"
good,"As in any ""problem fixing department"", some days are VERY busy and others are not.  The current team was often requested to interview new candidates so we created a cohesive team that supported each other with work, training, and friendship.  "
good,Actuó desde los 8 años me gusta bailar me encanta vivir la vida como si fuera la ultima porque eso motiva a seguir adelante y cumplir mis metas que tengo principalmente le doy gracias a dios por esta vida y por la gran oportunidad que me esta dando
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Employees really invest in your personal welfare and professional progression. Everyone is friendly and willing to help - even at senior levels of management."
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment, Disney Culture and management partners. It is a great stepping stone and a highly competitive internship. Great learning opportunities are provided."
good,"I really enjoyed working at this company for the year and a half I worked there in Entertainment. Unfortunately, I put my two weeks in because I was going through a tough time in life and unfortunately, I am not allowed back as a cast member until I return my uniforms I failed to turn in at the end of my employment. I offered to pay off the uniforms that are missing and they wouldn't accept so that is a shame because I really enjoyed my job and not only that, I was good at what I did."
good,I love working at Walt Disney World Resorts. Awesome experience and you keep learning new skills day by day. Awesome perks and benefits (this varies per role and dept). Salary could be better. Overall experience I would give it an 8 out of 10. Hopefully I will return and things will be better for me. Take the opportunity and try it. It is an amazing place to work and awesome people to work with.
good,"Working for The Walt Disney Company is what you might expect.  Many people get to work on projects that everyone is talking about and if you're lucky you'll play a small part in ""making the magic."" You'll work with smart people from a variety of fields and diverse backgrounds. You'll also likely work harder than you ever have at any other job, have way too meetings in a day, and wonder where the time has gone.  It's difficult to balance work and life."
good,"Day started with sorting the files into the system and processing it within the 8 hour  shift. The management team at Disney is superb and supportive. The workplace culture is quite  entertaining and engaging with soft toys and marvel characters statues placed along."
good,"Imagineering provides the opportunity to work on spectacular projects with extraordinarily talented individuals.  You are surrounded by experts in their field which is exciting, and requires the best out of all employees."
good,"I started my journey with Disney in 2007. I have experienced many different aspects of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and I am grateful for all the opportunities. I have been blessed to encounter many amazing Cast Members especially leaders who I reported to. The most enjoyable part of my jobs, was creating happiness and giving guest the experience they  hoped for."
good,"Due to the size and scale of the company, it can be easy for an employee to feel lost or unnoticed. Also for this reason, it can be difficult to move up and advance your career."
good,I enjoyed my time working at The Walt Disney Company for the benefit of how productive our department was as well as the work life balance that played into that. Working for a company that has a good family culture background that really encourages family first.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for the company. My managers were very supportive of my personal career goals and helped me reach those goals through training and career advancement opportunities. I would gladly work for the company again in a new location.
good,"The opportunity to work for a global brand that exists to entertain and make people happy but is also a business juggernaut is not to be passed up. There are high standards here that are absolutely imperative for all to live up to and it raises your game in any discipline, any role, at any level. "
good,"The best part of working for Disney Imagineering was 1) actively supporting the effort behind huge projects, and 2) working alongside extremely talented and experienced team members."
good,"Solid people.  Job security. reasonable hour good benefits. Hey free trips to Disneyland? How can you beat that.  Good team environment.  A bit meeting heavy, but solid accountability.  Not too bad for a bureaucracy."
good,"enjoyed my time, brand is strong, people great."
good,"Excellent, ethical company; great service to the world.   Lots of great people to work with and opportunities to learn new skills to use later in important projects."
good,"Working at the Disneyland Resort means constantly working and interacting with guests from around the world, it is always a different feeling every day. Cast members get along well and the workplace culture is very enjoyable. My time at the Walt Disney Company has taught me different forms of leadership and guest service, bolstering my abilities both inside and outside of the workplace. This is supported by a strong management team and the constant learning opportunities that arise. I would say the hardest part of the job is not being able to please every guest and create a better experience for them."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Walt Disney Company as it offered many friendships, work experience, and challenges. Every day had its own challenges that everyone had to adapt to. In my typical day I would help guest get to the theme park in many different positions. I was always exposed to guest and every guest had their own story and I quickly learned that although the answer might be the same sometimes you have to give the answer in different ways for the guest to fully understand your message. The guest were an important part of my job, but my coworkers were as important. the culture was always at high energy and always caring for each other that made me feel like I belong there and looked forward to work because I knew it will be a good day with them. In addition, the management was also present giving us the proper leadership and keys to be successful."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Its great working here but I dont find it fair when after a shift is done, people that work there will be on their phone and when I was on my phone, I got in trouble for it.  Sometimes they dont play fair for all employees and it felt like high school.  The people thats been there only hangs out with the people they know and as far for us the newcomers, we're just there."
good,"Selected to be apart of the Walt Disney World Resort after a 3-step web-based & phone Interview process; 15,000 Applicants with only 7,000 Selected per season. High standards of operation. Comprehensive guest service"
good,Excellent place to work with flexible work hours and ability to work remote from time to time. The pace is a bit too fast at times but easy enough to get used to. A very good team of engineers.
good,"I was a college program intern for Walt Disney World during most of 2016 and loved the experience. It was incredible to work in the parks and be a part of the magic. I won't lie though the hours can be a lot at times and you don't get paid a fantastic wage, but you get a good living space and an opportunity of a lifetime. If you do the program my advice to you is to take advantage of everything you can from the discounts to the networking events that they have, as well as the education that they have available."
good,i loved this job! i have often considered working there again. It was a great and active place to work.i enjoyed helping guests and watching the faces of children light up when we had the toy they wanted.
good,"Incredible opportunity to start off as an assistant at TWDC and rise through the ranks eventually becoming SVP Talent, New Business Development and Marketing at Comcast Entertainment Group."
good,I enjoyed working for the Walt Disney Company. While I was employed I was able to me so many people from different backgrounds. The fun part about my job was being able to compete against other cast members to earn prizes and incentives. I also enjoyed working backstage with freight. Getting to see all the new products before they hit the shelves.
good,"Working for Disney provided the opportunity to embrace different cultures, ideas, and unique qualities, not only with the customers you serve , but the team you build. The closeness you develop with this team becomes practically familial which always leads to a better customer experience."
good,"The staff was friendly and supportive.  The environment was quick-paced, but never stressful.  This was a great working experience.  I was paid well and delivered.  I appreciate the team and would work there again."
good,get my job order and prepare program on company issued laptop with mastercam. self inspecting finish parts. setup the vision controlled bridgeport cnc milling machine.
good,"I clock in at 6am, then I start to process shipment. Once shipment is done I clean the backstage area. Making sure there are no hazardous items are lying around. The Disney Store has allowed me to grow as a person. I learned the best communication skills at the disney store. My manager is very patient and is truly a great leader. There is never a dull moment at the store. I think the hardest part of my job was when I first started at the company. I was fresh out of high school and didnt have the best communication skills, but 5 years at the company really got me out of my shell. The part I love most about disney is creating magical and memorable moments with all the guests that come into the store. I also love the that everybody who works at the store is like a little family and we all help each other out."
good,The Walt Disney Company was a wonderful place to work. It was a high/fast pace environment with a lot of activities to do. The hardest part is learning how to balance work hours with personal time.
good,"Each day duties included sales, demonstrating and teaching the techniques of Disney merchandise, displaying, organizing, revising of inventory of stock, signature holder and cashier."
good,"Disney does not pay competitively for your skill set.  They do offer great benefits for people who love Disney.  Having access to Disney parks constantly is a great perk for families with kids."
good,"Great job, I loved everyone I worked with. Amazing college job. They were able to juggle my school schedule with work. I never had an issue and I even had Navy Reserve activity to do."
good,"Working at Disneyland can be very stressful and sometimes repetitive, but most of the time you're able to make long-term relationships with some cast members. The pay depending on what you do in the company can range from minimum wage to making great tips in one night."
good,It was a great experience to learn ad sales side of the business. Every once was very welcoming to me as I was a contracted employee for Disney. I met some great people here.
good,"A great culture, where teamwork is key."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Magical place where there is only peace. really great really really great benefits for interns as well. Interns are constantly invited to parties, events they host at Disneyland or somewhere else."
good,A great company to work for and very exciting work. Competitive salary and opportunity to grow. The benefits package is very competitive also. Disney's work culture is where you want to work.
good,"I enjoyed everything there, I loved the happy energy that I felt when guest came in. Hearing them just ""Wooooow"" is like ""Yes!"" Of course we have a lot of Disney Lovers, i too, am a Disney Fan. I was able to be myself but i couldn't express myself. I understood that I was suppose to be Professional in the Disney Store, but that's the whole point of Disney to be yourself and express the magic on what it makes you."
good,"Whether you're on the freight team or on stage, you will feel like you're part of something magical. From the looks on family who walk through the door to the plush mountain, this is a great place to work."
good,Loved working for this company. They take care of their “cast” and have such a wonderful atmosphere for everyone. Never had a day that I left angry or upset while working here.
good,Overall it was a very fast paced environment.  However the people there knew what they were doing and you could put you trust in your fellow castmembers to support you.  Yes you had to work hard but you knew that what you were doing meant something and though things could get stressful they always ran like a well oiled machine.
good,"Great opportunity to prove yourself in the role. Leaders give you freedom to manage your own business and high visibility to Senior Executive. "
good,The Walt Disney Company was an amazing place to work. They created a safe and enjoyable work experience. There was proper training and I felt very comfortable going into work each day. The management was always there to answer questions and offer support.
good,A great experience for a college student.  Lots of opportunities to make magic and interact with guests.  Great management team and coworkers.  A really fantastic program to build your customer service skills.
good,Great company to work for.  The pay is not the greatest but the company's allows the flexibility to live a flexible life.  I have had very good management teams and learned a lot to kickstart my career.
good,"I worked in reservation sales. It was nice.  Indoors, great people, good pay, casual dress, and fun surprises now and then.  If you are a good fit, it is never bad to work for Disney."
good,I really liked the job if I could have got on permanently I would have stayed the job was very easy and it was really easy to get along with the other employs and upper management.
good,"Walt Disney Feature Animation (Disney Animation) may like computers, but it hasn't completely ditched its pens and pencils. The Disney Studios unit develops and produces the animated films for the Mickey Mouse empire that fall outside the Pixar banner. (Sister firm Pixar became a Disney subsidiary in 2006.) Historically a leader in two-dimensional animated films, Disney Animation temporarily abandoned its hand-drawn efforts after repeatedly losing ground at the box office to computer-generated (CG) movies. However, Disney has since resurrected the practice of traditional hand-drawn films, the most recent of which was 2009's The Princess and the Frog. It also releases CG films (Tangled, Bolt)."
good,"It is a lot of work for a pretty decent paying job. I would work at least 45 hours each week, usually more. The leaders in my location were awesome, but that is not the case everywhere you work for the company. Just keep in mind you are one of 60,000 employees."
good,I worked as a custodial cast member during my college program.  It is an extremely independent/laid back job with lots of guest interaction.  I made some amazing friends and would redo the program in a heartbeat if I could.
good,"I can't say enough about how much I like the people who work there and the friendly Disney culture. "
good,"loved working for Disney!!! Typical day was making Magic for the guest in many differnt ways!! "
good,I have loved working at The Disney Store these past two years. My manager is a pleasure to work for and my assistant managers are fun to work with. I love all of my coworkers and am proud to say that I work in the most magical store in my area.
good,sale vacation packages to Disney guess. inform them of new product program and experiences. Try to engage with them so you can use your knowledge of company product to offer the guess the best deal for their vacation plans.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Depending on where you work it can get absolutely insane. However, if you don't mind a very fast paced environment and have a talent for customer service I would absolutely recommend it"
good,You are always trying to find new ways to make a magical moment for the guest that walk through the enchanted gates of The Disney Store! The cast is always in a good mood which makes working there fun and easy going.
good,Great benefits for interns! Free admission to all the parks and great discounts for shopping and dining at Disney! It's a great place to do your internship!
good,I got to live and work with Disney everyday. I was able to work my way up from part time cast member all the way to an assistant manager. It was an amazing experience that I was lucky to do as I was studying film full time at UC Irvine.
good,"At the time when I was working at the disney store it was under the children place company. Now that it under the disney company again i bet it has that disney feeling again, Great hours, great workplace to be at if you enjoy Disney a lot."
good,The Walt Disney Company is a great place to work. They offer flexible  hours and weekends They offer excellent  company benefits and a welcoming work atmosphere to staff and Guests.
good,"Responsible for ensuring all guest have an entertaining, fun and dynamic experience by creating a high energy, welcoming environment, while providing excellent customer service. Upbeat but sometimes underappreciated position (at the time)."
good,Disney is a great company that believes in its reliance on using people to make their magic a reality. While it is a more traditional company it is also one of the most revolutionary
good,"I have learned many leadership skills while working along with a Technical director, Assistant Technical director and many other crew members."
good,"Depending on the branch of the company you work for, there can be room for advancement. Teamwork is essential for a company to survive and Disney has that covered. It is like a second family when you become part of the Walt Disney Company."
good,It was a great place to learn the ins and outs of television production.  Worked on high level entertainment and some remote sports as well.  Great group of people to work with.
good,"Although you work really hard and have long work days, it is a wonderful place to work at. You can only grow with the company through networking, but it is possible. Benefits are amazing and the perks are something that I miss everyday."
good,excellent work environment with thoughtful managers and directors that provide mentoring to all members of the company.
good,"There was always new things happening every day which was great so it wasn't the same thing over and over each day. I learned a lot about the business and what produces the best results. Management for the most part is good. The hardest part would have to be working with a different set of cat members each day, which is fun but you do have to cater to them differently. The most enjoyable part was learning all sorts of new things!"
good,"I loved my time in the ""Mouse House"". The projects were inspiring, the people are top-notch and unparalleled for their passion and creativity."
good,"Un ambiente stimolante"
good,He perfeccionado mis habilidades de estrategia financiera y desarrollo de negocios.
good,"Assigned as a Reliability Manager responsible to verify required maintenance or all major attractions, personnel management, safety, quality, and supply functions."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Everyone was just a joy to work around for the most part! Very fast paced job so you must keep up. Hardest part is trying to keep up with everything that is going on, cannot miss a single detail!"
good,"People are generally helpful and competent. Disney benefits and discounts are  very worthwhile, especially in SoCal/Florida area. Pay and other basic health benefits are a bit below average. Big company means you have to take initiative and drive own career"
good,"Working for Disney is something many only dream of. In this case, I participated in the Disney College Program; a work and study program. This is a great opportunity to network with young professionals around the world. At Disney, you get access to the parks and 20% off merchandise. Working for a fortune 100 company is great experience for any young professional in college."
good,This was one of the best jobs I have ever had!  It was always a fun place to work and the people I worked with were amazing.  I still keep in touch with some of the people I worked with.  The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing what the artists were going to create and I got to be a part of that.  It was so magical and it was truly an amazing place to work.  I was very sad to see that division be sold off.
good,"Seriously, it may be retail, but it was Disney retail."
good,"Who doesn't love Disney!"
good,Management kept me constantly aware of the goals that I needed to achieve.  Important to have a balance between sales and service.  Coached that there was touch competition within our are and to never get comfortable even if we were at the to of our game.
good,"Laid back, exciting work and a creative environment. Management that cares about you and career. Talented co workers who want to create the best possible product."
good,"I work at a call center for The Walt Disney Company. A typical work day, as imagined, is primarily answering phone calls for guests needing online assistance with their accounts. Our management team is outstanding and will support you in whatever direction you are trying to go within the company. The most difficult part of the job for me is having to sit at a computer all day, as I grew up being active and outdoors often. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the guests who call in, knowing that once we disconnect the phone call, they are taken care of and happy with the service I provided them."
good,Working for The Walt Disney Company and Disneyland is a lot different than you would think. My coworkers were the least enjoyable part
good,"A typical day of work at the Disney Store is fun, energetic, and impossible not to enjoy.  I've learned a lot about guest service in my time with them.  The management is great, though there are sometimes a few minor issues, mostly with scheduling.  My co-workers are some of the nicest people I've ever met, always able to bring a little more magic and fun into the days of our guests.  The hardest part of the job is juggling multiple responsibilities while servicing guests on our busy days.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a parent asks me to find something for a child and seeing the child's face when I found exactly what he or she wanted."
good,"A very accommodating place to work, with excellent work/life balance for a full-timer. The tradeoff is that office and business-unit politics can be arcane and far-reaching."
good,"It's almost like any other retail job except the training for guest service is AMAZING. The expectations the general public associates with Disney's guest service standards are very high--which has its pros and cons--but being able to say that you've received training/ have been employed by Disney is impressive, in my opinion."
good,"This is a great company that really takes care of their people.  As a part time job, I really enjoy getting to know Disney and all the aspects of the business."
good,"I have absolutely nothing negative to say about my time at Disney World.  The internship helped me find the career path I wanted to pursue.  If given the option to go back, I would return without a second of hesitation."
good,"évolution professionnelle"
good,"Happy to work, company divides the pressure equally without over stress and very helpful management staff and comfortable working timings"
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Une experience fantastique. "
good,Es muy positivo y  enriquecedor trabajar en la venta de productos de licencia y personajes.
good,Awesome! AWESOME! Fun place to work and great company with lots of history and heritage! It all started with a mouse and a dream to make family entertainment! It takes people to make a dream into a reality!
good,"It is a great job and it pays decent. Disney really is strict when it comes to work appearance and what they look for in your performance, but it is very worth it."
good,"good team, life time work experience missed team members, friendly management team, on time help, flexible hours and timely training"
good,GREAT leadership for the most part.  Very much care about their people and the development of their teams.  Interested in you as an individual.  Most leadership stands behind their teams.
good,Basically you get paid to meet new people. If you like working in customer service this is the place for you. The perks of working here are also pretty good.
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"Working closely with the principle director and the six assistant directors, lighting and sound technicians, continuity photographers, wardrobe stewards, makeup artists and props department officials to produce a product of international standard that is without fault and can be subjected to the most intense scrutiny without criticism."
good,"A typical day at the Tri-Circle D Ranch is unlike any other department at Walt Disney World. We get to interact with guests all day all while enjoying the company of the amazing horses that live there. Duties can include such things as giving pony rides to small children or trail rides for the adults, private carriage rides to small groups or public wagon rides for the larger groups or getting escorted to your wedding in style on Cinderella's carriage. The Disney family atmosphere is such an amazing thing to be a part of. The hardest part of my job I would say would be having to work outside in the grueling summer heat of Florida but everything is well worth it when you get to work around the animals that you love and make magical moments for each and every guest."
good,Fun taking photos of families. Kids photos were my favorite. Our lunch brakes would be so much fun. Always excited to go to work.
good,It was a dream come true to be part of the Disney College Program. I  created magic for guests and loved interacting with the little kids. It was an overall great experience.
good,"Participação em eventos especiais para proporcionar aos convidados a melhor experiência dentro do Museu Walt Disney. Nessa oportunidade eu tive o privilégio de aprender com dinamismo o planejamento, a organização e a importância do atendimento. Além de poder compartilhar com os colegas de trabalho a alegria de um ambiente positivo e trasmitir o conceito da empresa de trabalhar realizando sonhos."
good,"I would walk around and make sure the merchandise was stocked and folded. I would greet guest when they came into the store and assisted them with any questions or concerns. After my shift was over if I was there to help close the store I would vacuum, make sure everything was stocked and that all the other nightly duties were done."
good,"While working at Disneyland, you realize it really is the happiest place on earth! Everyone is always 100% positive and always ready and willing to work. Best part is seeing the smiles on the childrens, and sometimes even the adults faces."
good,it was amazing to see that your the one making lots of kids have the fun and magic that disney has and makes to show the love
good,"Disney Interactive is a great place to work, I get to work with the professionals in the entertainment industry also get to enjoy the culture of Disney. Advanced in my Microsoft Office skills, improved in efficiency in data analysis. Most important of all, I enjoyed the work place, and the people I work with."
good,"Multiple inbound calls in a call center environment that varied from travel, hotel, tickets, air, and rental car. I learned excellent and invaluable customer service skill. These skills where the foundation in which I have been able to carry with me and build on with each new opportunity. Providing quality customer service listening to guest needs and desire for their dream vacation. Management was always available and helpful. Hardest a special event was booked.Most enjoyable was being able to go the extra mile to provide a special dinning experience or share the best ways to make the most of their vacation. Booking character dining experience was great."
good,"I learned all about the Disney theme parks, safety, customer service skills etc. "
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Greeting our guest and making there experience at the park unforgettable. Verify that their appointments are at the right time and guide them to the attracction.
good,a typical day will involve wiring up control panels and creating them from scratch  which is really fun. i have learned many electrical skills from here. the managers are really helpful and and good laugh to have around. the co workers are really helpful and are good to have around. the hardest part of the job is sometimes meeting deadlines as some of the parts are not ordered or delivered on time. the most enjoyable part of the job is the experience you gain from the job and the people you meet and knowing that some of the panels and other equipments will be used on things like oil rigs and submarines ect which put a big smile on my face.
good,"I would clock in and start my job, everyday I get a new position. I learned how to be more productive in my work environment. I love my co-workers, we all work as a team. My management is good, they care for the employees and keep everything organized and efficient. The hardest part of the job was lifting some of the heavy boxes and trash bags. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers on the counter, delivering them their food and seeing the smiles on their faces. I also enjoyed prepping the food and making sure everything was in good quality."
good,"Working for The Walt Disney Company has been the best experience of my life and I regret leaving everyday."
good,"In my time with The Walt Disney Company, I was a Disney College Program intern. This means that I was given three-year seniority for hours and certain benefits were available to me that others didn't have. Therefore, I will be writing this review more from the standpoint of a basic Cast Member. I often heard of other Cast Members struggling for hours so that they could pay their basic life expenses. Also, the pay was just above minimum wage, which would be fine normally, but the people who work directly with Disney's Guests should be paid more in my opinion. We had to work in very strict conditions to uphold the kind of standard that Disney is famous for, and we had to do this while serving Guests that were worse than any other work location I've ever heard of. They were not all this way but several Cast Members were having anxiety issues from operating certain locations. For the people on the front lines, I think a company as big as Disney could have paid them a little more. That being said, Disney did have EXCELLENT benefits on the short term, such as free park access and many discounts on merchandise and food. I won't talk about health benefits, etc. because I left after the internship was completed and don't have any experience in that. The vast majority of the managers that I had were excellent, and several of the leads (supervisors) were as well. Not all. There were times, based on experiences withwhen I questioned how Disney advanced people and I was not the only one to think that. Every lead had their own way of doing things and it was often expected that we read their"
good,"Foi de grande prazer trabalhar na Escola Disney onde todos eram bastante educados, compreensivos, carismáticos, quando passamos a trabalhar com pessoas de personalidade diferentes aprendemos respeitar mais a opinião um dos outros, todo trabalho tem suas dificuldades seus dias difíceis mais o que era prazeroso chegar todos os dias e encontrar tanta criança sorridente e feliz por vê os educadores o carinho o amor das crianças é impagável sou bastante grata pela oportunidade ."

good,It was very fun to work in entertainment business in the number 1 Radio in Ecuador
good,This is an amazing company to work for.  I love having the person to person interaction every day.
good,I either worked 8-10 hour shifts in a specific area answering guest questions and keeping the area presentable by sweeping any trash.  Other days I had 12 hour shifts where I received anywhere from 2-4 bathrooms to keep clean throughout park hours. This was a great place to improve my socialization and guest relation skills.
good,"Loved working in the parks and with the many talented cast members I had the honor to work with everyday.  After almost two years, the magic and the wonder has not worn off."
good,good company good benefits good leadership good fellow employees
good,I was a merchandiser and worked as a independent contractor. I set displays to POG's. I installed standees for stores and theatres. I worked alone with no supervision. I was my own boss. I  really loved what I did. The hardest part of the job was making sure that there was communications between the job and the company that hired me to do the work. The fun job was setting the displays and the standees they were a challenge.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,It is really a excellent experience to be a part of the Disney family. They put magic on all the products and work they do. I am learning day by day and excepting to be a good Systems Engineer at the end of my internship.
good,"the shift would begin with cleaning, setting, and moving the tables within the restaurant, then the menus would be set up and ordered after which the reservation desk would be opened.  Each party would be seated and given menus as they came in to and any questions about the park would be answered. My coworkers were amazing people that gave the workplace the feeling of family."
good,"I understand better after working at Disney: Our work is not just about the money. Our jobs are not who we are, it is only what we do."
good,"Work always started at the exact time and ended on the exact time. No if, ands or buts. Working for disney meant, respected their culture and values, while respecting the benefits they offered, by following your schedule, dress code and all the other rules and policies. The most hard part about the job was not being able to greet celebrities who arrived at the restaurant. "
good,"The overall Disney vision is one team and one dream.  It's the business of exceeding expectations, and pushing Disney brand further and further.  It is a great place to get lots of exposure to the corporate world while getting some entry level entertainment experience under your belt.  "
good,"A typical day at work includes setting up for live events, interacting with a diverse group of children and parents, and promoting our brand all while making sure that everyone is happy and receiving a piece of the magic the Walt Disney Company has to offer. "
good,Disney is an excellent company. They provide an amazing work environment and give employees an opportunity to make the guest experience amazing as well.
good,"Fun, fast paced, worked individually and in a team to recruit students in the Springfield, Missouri area to participate in the Disney College Program. Conducted classroom presentations, group presentations, information tables, and posted marketing collateral around the 4 higher education institiutions in Springfield, MO."
good,My typical day at work would be testing different phones with new games and trying to find anything that was defected and try to send it back to the creators to have it fixed.
good,Learned how to put myself out there in the working environment and how to be successful.
good,"Small Canadian office, excellent balance between life and work. Lots of opportunity to grow professionally. People were fantastic and I have kept in touch with many I worked with."
good,Evaluated customers' issues and resolved them through standards and policies required. Management was always encouraging and supportive. Co-workers made our jobs more pleasant.
good,Working for the Walt Disney World Resorts and Parks was the best experience of my life. If you have ever been you completely understand that there is magic in everything Disney touches. If you have never been to Disney then I strongly encourage you to get some of this magic in your life. You will not regret a family trip to the resorts and parks.
good,"Working at the World of Disney NYC was actually great. I had gotten along with all of my coworkers and supervisors. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from different origins and countries, seeing the entertainers and the Disney characters walk around and impress the guests in the store, as well as the great merchandise and services we provided for the guests and the employees. There were no hard parts of the job, but that the position was only seasonal for the holidays"
good,"Possibly one of the best times of my life. During my internship, I had two different jobs at Cirque du Soleil in Downtown Disney. One was working at the box office where I sold tickets to the show and provided information about what the show consists of. The other was ushering and escorting guests to their seats while maintaining the rules and show procedures. Learned to deal with people from many walks of life and communicate with them in multiple ways. Multiple orientations and workshop classes to become a ""Cast Member"" of Disney was also very helpful to my customer service abilities. Also, observing how a larger-than-life company deals with such large quantities of people all at once in an orderly fashion."
good,Sales calls and supporting the sales managers in any way. Great youthful and diverse team.
good,"There is nothing wrong with working for Walt Disney World. It's what you take out of it that really matters. No one ever gets to the top from day one. However, there are those like anyone else in the field of the entertainment industry where competition amongst co-workers for better positions are always present."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Let me tell you, this was one of the best jobs I have ever had. I worked across the street at the Hilton Convention Hotel in Disney World, so I met a lot of different people, which I loved, and also learned a lot about the hospitality industry. My co-workers were the best ever and the benefits were awesome..."
good,"The Disney Store was an absolute wonderful place to work. If you are a kid at heart, like I am, no job can suit you better. Everything is about creating magical experiences for the guest. Bring stories to life, by helping each guest in their own unique way. Being part of the management team, I was constantly busy at the Disney Store. We received a lot of product, which myself and a few others, would sort through and put onstage and backstage. There truly was never a dull moment working there!"
good,This is one place I was passionate about working for everyday. I wish I had found this program when I was younger.
good,Loved my time on the Disney College Program! It was the perfect post-graduation experience. I learned so much about myself and working in the hospitality industry.
good,"Great place to work, excellent perks, great leadership. The hardest part of the job is going home at the end of the day. Wish i still had the pleasure of working for such an amazing company."
good,"Excellent welfare, good work balance."
good,"I truly enjoyed my experience at Disney. It taught me hard work pays off. Working in the happiest place on earth was hard work, but I loved every minute of it. Everyone was friendly and the culture of the company is what stands out the most."
good,"The people who work for Disney Interactive are amazing, hard-working and fun-loving. They strive to provide the very best customer service, and they usually succeed. Great place to work, with the drawback being that nearly all positions are contract, and there is not much room for advancement."
good,I made lifelong friends and gained skills I never knew I needed! I was able to make an impact on the general community. I would definitely recommend to a peer.
good,I deal with all sorts of people from around the world. Language barriers are there and makes for a great way to show how to adapt. Must have great people skills and helps interact with people of all ages.
good,"What stands out is the diversity within the company. Working with all levels of skills, abilities and backgrounds. Many opportunities to achieve other rolls. Learning and working on advance technology. Fun place to work."

good,Fantastic workplace. I enjoy the benefits and being around likeminded people. Highly recommend working here for a fun job and to enjoy going to work each day.
good,"Typical dat at work involved daily stands, creating daily reports and analyzing data. I was reporting directly to the director of content sales, and strategy and data analytics were my main responsibilities. Overall I learnt a lot at the company and started my professional journey with disney."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,I felt like a kid temporary working at the Walt Disney Company.  I love the environment and atmosphere.  I wished that I had become permanent.  It is a dream of mine to work for the Walt Disney Company.
good,I was in parades and entertainment it was exciting and rewardind I was able to entertain guest.   From all over the world I was even a canidater for ambassador of the world
good,"I worked for the company over 5 years and enjoyed it immensely. Everyone becomes your family and you feel supported, even with Guests. The amount of experience I gained in not just customer service, but in how to communicate with people in general, was wonderful and a personal growth I value. I can't thank Disneyland enough for the opportunities."
good,I enjoy working here. I love making magic every day. The benefits are amazing. I’ve made many friends since working here. Everything is a love so far for me.
good,I had a great time working in the kitchen at the Grand Floridian Cafe. I had extensive previous restaurant experience but learned so much from my coworkers. The Disney culture is one of a kind.
good,"typical day started with stretching and manager talking about current events, they passed out our schedules and we needed to get our carts ready and filled for the day.  Sometimes they didn't have enough carts to go around witch was  hard but, they would bring one within the hour. The most enjoyable time was interacting with the guests."
good,"I loved working for Disney, I would go back if they had positions available for me. The team I worked with was great and the culture of the company is great. I felt like it was a family and everyone cared for each other and wanted the next person to succeed."

good,"The day to day work really just depended on your team. I had one of the best teams I can imagine, so I loved my time with the Walt Disney company. At the end of the day you had to make the most of your time and the people who helped and supported me there were some of the greatest cast members on property."
good,I loved working for Disney. The only reason I left was the pay wasn’t where I needed it to be for the cost of living. I would recommend working there.
good,"Busy, fast pace and stressful. It was the most fun job I have ever had. There were definitely ups and downs but I made some of my best friends there. I did the college internship program. They housed us and we had lots of hours."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Disney. I worked at the Disney Reservation Center in Tampa, FL. I want to make it very clear that I am not a Disney enthusiast. And I did not drink the kool-aide. I know first hand Disney does their best to help their Cast Members who may be going through a personal or family crisis. The job is not your typical call center job. It's hard work with long hours. There tremendous growth opportunities as well as job opportunities. Their perks are outstanding! The have a very, very strict dress policy and other weird policies (no garbage cans at your desk). "
good,"Trabalhar em uma grande empresa possui o lado bom e o lado ruim, como tudo na vida. Uma experiência unica é trabalhar nesta empresa devido a sua capacidade de gerenciamento e respeito pelo trabalho de seus funcionários."
good,"it was beautiful because i was introduced to new technologies which i didn't know about it. learning it was beautiful experience, hopefullly one day i can i might go back."
good,"The Walt Disney Company is a very unique place to work that was built and inspired by creative minds, which keeps the business fun and inspiring. Every day was a new day and using our imagination with teams to find ways to be better is always the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I have worked for the Walt Disney company for just over three years, and have enjoyed every moment of it.  The people and management have all been extremely great to work with, and the work environment is very welcoming and enjoyable.  Some days are difficult speaking to angry guests on the phone and via email, however a lot of the time the guests are just looking for help with things and services they don't understand.  There are a lot of extra things the company does to ensure its employees are recognized and appreciated, and management is always as transparent as they can be.  While the salaries at the office could be a bit more competitive, they are sufficient for the work we are asked of."
good,"Worked at the ""Mickey: The True Original Exhibition"" in Chelsea. was an amazing experience, a learning curve, inspirational and fun."
good,This Job over all taught me a lot about customer service and the fundamentals of working in a successful retail business. It allowed me to grow and learn every position in the company.
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Good place to work at. Selling food during the breaks and before and after shows. Long days but in a good environment, making the work load bearable.."
good,"Again when I worked for Disney I wanted t work there it wasn't I needed a job I just wanted to work at Disney."
good,"Management was a delight to work with, always willing to work with you and help you out. "
good,"I love working at Disney. Everything is pretty routine and the cast members are all very unique. Disney has definitely thought me how to relax and be kind and friendly. It has also thought me how to smile even when a guest is yelling in my face. The hardest part of the job has to be the down time, we are not allowed to have our phones out so when its slow its super slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know each cast member and being able to make magic for our guest."
good,"Working for Disney is an exhilarating experience, and working at Disneyland itself (during the holidays, especially) is very high-energy and can sometimes be taxing. There are definite ups and downs: Cast Members that might make or break your work day, Guest interactions that make you grin or have to excuse yourself and cry, and leaders that throw everything down and help during a rush or ""help"" but actually make matters worse (or those that don't help at all).  It varies on your role and location, but it can be one of the greatest jobs of your life. Sometimes just making a Guest laugh at a Disney pun can make all the difference and turn your day around, and you know that you've probably helped them enjoy the magic a bit more just from that."
good,I really enjoyed all the magic that the team made happen onstage and off. I am a huge Disney fan so working there was a dream come true. The experience made me more aware in many different ways when I applied to new jobs.
good,Disney is a wonderful Company to work for. A typical day depends on your role/job. Everyday is different no matter what your role/job is. Depending on what you role is depends on what you learn and vice versa.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company while I was there for 6 years. The company is not close to where I live now. The people are very nice and they train you for every role.
good,Loved working with Disney. Always a fun environment and being a Disney fanatic makes the experience even better. Absolutely loved it and would work there again.
good,Walt Disney Company is a great company to work for overall. They offer Plenty of benefits and discounts and opportunities. Like most large companies pay is on the lower end but some would say compensation in the form of free park tickets and discounts and benefits make up for it.
good,"Working for Disney was one of the highlights of my working career!  Very fast paced environment with constant change which I loved being apart of.  The team there was creative, professional, personable and super talented!"
good,I was doing valet for a 3rd party company so we did not receive a lot of benefits from them. It was fun driving around to get and deliver car. But at some points  Disney wanted to cut down the amount of space that been giving for valet.
good,"One of the best places I've ever worked at. You are provided with the necessary tools to succeed and the culture is one of safety, inclusion and cooperation."
good,"The company as a whole is the greatest place to work. As any other conglomerate, you will need to bring your A game and be flexible to demands, ready for moving yourself forward when opportunities present themselves and continue your self-growth to keep current with business environment changes and demands."
good,"This is a great company. I have been with the company for 11 years and counting. Leadership is great, the people are great, the work is challenging but fair. For all these reasons no one leaves, therefore promotional opportunities are few and far between."
good,"While the job can be fun, it is tiring physically and mentally as you are outside most of the time in all kinds of weather and will be dealing with a large number of guests. Sometimes there will be repetitive motions and it can be taxing on your body. Interactions with guests can either be a bright spot of your day or can bring you down as you could get yelled at for many things out of your control. Overall, it's a great place to work with a lot of opportunities to pick up hours or to use the benefits provided by the company."
good,I absolutely enjoyed working from this company. Working at Walt Disney World improved my customer service skills greatly and it also taught me how to handle and communicate with people from all over the world.
good,"Had an amazing time while at The Walt Disney Company.  We created some stellar programs that I'm proud of to this day.  As of now, I believe it is becoming too much of a corporate behemoth and I hope they don't lose the creativity of the man who started it."

good,"I loved my job at Disney. I was very upset when I got sick, ended up homeless and had to relocate back to my mothers to better my health. I want to work for the company again since I’ve now relocated back to Orlando."
good,"I had an amazing time working at Marvel & LucasFilm.  Could not be more happier there.  Kid in a candy store is how I would describe my time."
good,"This was a fun internship while in culinary school! I met people from all over the country, got into any park for free and got discounts. Every manager I had was great at their job."
good,"Customer Service Representative"
good,"it was close to home, and was good to work for. A lot of goals and learned a lot. "
good,"I did my internship here and it was fun and exited to work there, but you do get some crazy hours, because you usually get the hours that the part timers and full timers do not want."
good,"Mornings are the best times, people are Happy! Even bosses have smiles on their faces. If you do your job, and you do it well, then you don't get bothered. The hard part is keeping the smile the entire day, because guests are getting tired and so are you. But, the best part, is getting over the mid day hour, and soon you are going home!!"
good,"Checking in guests, taking payment, provide information about parks, asigning rooms, Magical place to work, management was great with few exections, become to be Trainer."
good,"Life-guarding at  the Walt Disney company gives good benefits and trains a lot of valuable skills; including CPR, rescue breathing, treating for heat emergencies."
good,"From the beginning, I very much enjoyed working for the Walt Disney Company. My manager, supervisors and coworkers were all very nice people that I really enjoyed working with. I worked a job that was not in the main park, but within the hotels in the surrounding area for Disney. I was able to sit at most of the sites and there was usually lunch provided at these sites being that they were hotels. The pay I received was more than minimum wage at the time I was employed there and I believe it was a fair wage for the work that I did. The hours of the job though were not the best as working holidays, weekends and night shifts were required. Ultimately, the hours I was working led to my departure from working with Disney, as I was a new mom and had to either work and find someone to watch my son or not work and watch him myself."
good,During my time as an intern for the Walt Disney Company I learned a lot about company culture and standards. I really enjoyed my coworkers and management.
good,"Always came into work with a smile to make the children happy. As a cashier, while someone else is covering, I stand outside the gift shop to direct guests to where they need to go and entertain them by shooting bubbles out of a bubble gun. I've learned that if you have a good day here, the guests will also have an even better day. Management needed to be a little more organized but overall we did what we needed to do. Many different people work there and we all try to help each other in a timely manner. Hardest part is when a child gets lost and you have to hold their hand to make sure they stay with you so that you can take the time to let the staff know around the park that a child is lost. I loved the job overall because it was a fun place to be and I enjoyed seeing all the disney characters."
good,"My family make up has changed so I am in need of different days off."
good,"One of the best companies I've worked for. Opportunities to advance, fully automated employee resource centers, insurance options. There are some downfalls.No liveable wage for hourly workers the computer run point system doesn't account for situations on an individual basis and the operating systems are outdated."
good,Disney is magical and it was a magical place to work. A typical day would be very busy with guests and cast members. The workplace was a fun environment and the cast members were great to work with.
good,Excelente experiencia para el desarroolo de hábilidades en servico al cliente.
good,"It was a really nice warehouse to work at, very calm, encouraging and productive environment. The management team was very reliable and helpful at all times."
good,"Aside from the lack of conpensation, working at Disneyland was the grestest experience.  I met alot of amazing people from all over world.  I learned a handful of useful skills and enjoyed the perks. If i didnt live so far away i would have tried to stay with the company but financially it just wasnt possible."
good,Disney has alot of perks with wonderful co-workers.  WHilw working with The Walt Disney Company Disney was our oyster and it was great!  Entrance into the parks and wonderful discounts!  Employees are among the nicest I have ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"I, honestly, love working for this company. My role is always fun and it's never just ""an ordinary day.""  While my role is very tiring, it's still something I would recommend for someone to audition for if they enjoy ""acting"" and entertaining and being a part of the Disney magic."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Loved my internship with the Walt Disney Company. Though it's a fun place to work, the work is stressful and challenging. Overall, I really enjoyed working for the company, and hope to work with them in the future."
good,Best company to work with lots of learning. Effective team and helping managers. Always ready to solve problems. Good work life balance. Great environment to work.
good,Disney is an iconic brand with a global presence and that heritage lives on today. This is a company that values face-to-face interactions and thorough discussions before making decisions.
good,I will return one day. greatest place to work on the planet.The work culture is what keeps people coming back.Friendships are made here that will last a lifetime
good,Working for this company is nothing short of easy. Depending on where you are placed each job entails a lot but the reward is great. You meet many great people as well as working among some of the best. There are many tools at your advantage to not just make you a great leader but advance in your work ethic.
good,"Loved my time there, great company to work for.  A great place to learn about yourself, other cultures, and being a good person..I worked a kinda 2nd shift work day, since my QSR didn't serve breakfast..."
good,Amazing. Once in a lifetime experience that gave me more than just work experience. This program gives college-aged kids life experience and was overall a great program.
good,"It was a great company. Advancement is given to who ever works hard enough for it. Learned valuable guest service, sales tactics, and softwares. Constantly adapting environment to produce success."
good,"The work was challenging and the reward was great.  Free Disney entry at most parks, great discount at stores.  Good management, and the company was thriving.  Unfortunately as with most large company's, layoffs are imminent."
good,My time at Disney was an experience I will have with me forever. It was a magical whirlwind. I loved every minute of it even if it was a lot to take in. The only pit falls were the pay. I would spend so much time there and work so hard for so little money I couldn't my life anymore. But some of the benefits made up for it. getting into the parks for free was a nice touch. I still love Disney and if the circumstances had been different I would still be there.
good,"Day-to-day life in the Disney offices were fun, as an intern I had a handful of responsibilities. I was guided well by my manager, the position would be filled by interns annually but this gave little authority over the permanent creative teams who's files i was tasked at managing."
good,"Walt Disney WOrld is so vast of a company. There's a lot of opportunities for those who work hard and love Disney. It was a blast. Stressful sometimes, but rewarding if you love Disney."
good,Loved working for Disney because it indeed was a magical environment. The only bad part of working there is that you must be perky all the time with a smile on your face whether you mean it or not.
good,"Overall was a great experience. Worked at Disney under the college program. I worked for the Food n Wine Festival. Overtime was mandatory. Sometimes I worked from open to close (10am - 2am, two shifts). Management was very reasonable and understood that the college program students worked a lot. The college program brought college students from all over the world to work and I made life-long friends with people from Australia and Brazil and of course other parts of the country. The hardest part of the job was having to deny people entry into the park. But sometimes we were still able to with reasoning. The most enjoyable part of the job was just seeing kids happy and overjoyed."
good,"A life changing experience with a chance to learn from some of the best artists in the industry. As I am just starting out, this opportunity presented a chance for me to see what I could one day achieve. Managers were friendly as were the makeup artists, all were happy to support and teach me. Such a fulfilling experience"
good,"Cadre de travail agréable"
good,"I enjoy working at Walt Disney World, but hope to find a job that will use my college degree and training and provide more advanced career opportunities. I have learned a great deal from my entry level food service job, but I am ready for new career challenges."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,An awesome environment of creativity and superior technology . Advancement is present for those that apply themselves. The culture offers and environment of excitement and opportunity.
good,I enjoyed the third shift. You were your own boss. There weren’t many guests. It was a relaxed atmosphere. There were many benefits. The health insurance really helped.
good,I love my job great place to work great benefits only downside is when they lay of workers job security is not stable here but beside that great place to work
good,"It was also a good marketing company with a good management, i also learnt  a lot from the company they would support me all along.It was also a good experience."
good,"Empresa excelente na questão merchandising, muito apoio logístico e campo de trabalho"
good,"My work day is mostly positive. I have learned that no matter how fast you get guests on the ride, they are still waiting over 2 hours most of the day and it is not fun to get yelled at. I have learned to be more patient and understanding of the guests and what it is like in their shoes. My management team is nice for the most part, but I would like to get to know them more. I enjoy my job when I see the smile on the guests faces and knowing that they are leaving my attraction happy. My job is to make them happy and if I don't it is disappointing. I work at the most happiest place on Earth so I am determined to continue that."
good,"Great fun place to work"
good,Disney gives benefits but since we were 3rd party there was a limit. But great opportunity. Also very fun atmosphere due to the live music and concerts weekly.
good,"This company is great! The management of the store is fantastic, and their ability to communicate to use effectively is something I have never experienced before."
good,"It is a fun and energetic place to work especially if you hold Disney close to your heart. It is fun to improvise to guests by using Disney language and almost all the guests that come in to the store are excited to be there and see you. For some guests it is as close as they will get to Disney World/Land. Improvs examples: when our registers are slow ""those darn villains cursed our registers again."" Or if the line is long to check out ""we will be with you before the clock strikes 12."""
good,"slide operator"
good,greatest opportunity for growth as a person and employee. Those who work hard have opportunities to move up. Can easily change positions across the company. Overall great company to have on a resume.
good,"At Disney Direct Marketing we were a call center that handled the Disney Catalog, Disneystore.com, Disney Movie Collection, Disney Club and took dining reservations for restaurants at Walt Disney World.  The office was enjoyable to work in and many of us had no plans to leave until our center was outsourced."
good,"I worked in this theme park for 7 years as a sideman.  I never had a problem.  Typically I would work a 7 hour shift playing three different shows in the theme parks.  In two position I would engage in conversation with the guests and have fun with them. "
good,"I am working at Disney ABC Television."
good,I absolutely loved this job!!! The only reason I stopped working here was because I needed more hours and I was moving out of state or I definitely would've stayed. We put on various events throughout the Seattle metro area and also put on assemblies in schools. AMAZING!
good,You make your job what it is and enjoy it or you don't. Somedays are fun while others can be overwhelming to some. You have to have a strong drive in order to move up and good leaders as well
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,Disney was amazing. I worked a few different places at Disney but I have to say I always had a great time. From making families vacations better and just helping other cast memebres through the day was amazing.
good,"Working at Disney was a great experience.  I worked in Magic Kingdom and I found that the cast members are treated very well.  We often got free food and snacks at work, always had something exciting going on and a lot of the guests were fun to talk to.  My favorite part of the job was ""making magic"" and getting to make peoples vacations better."
good,"great work life balance, great staff and interesting products. Great work culture and opportunities to be creative. there was a lack of opportunity within the company however."
good,"The excitement of making magic is a rewarding, but the pay is not great for a career.  They do, however, recognize potential if you are willing to work extremely hard at what you do."
good,Très heureuse d faire partie de cette entreprise !
good,"I worked here as part of the Disney College Program, which is a paid internship allowing college students to work at and understand what makes Disney's theme parks tick. On the whole, I found that management prepared each cast member extraordinarily well for their jobs at hand (sometimes even to the point of overtraining!) and was similarly always available to help those in need. Taking care of our guests every whim was par for the course, and each cast member was well instructed on how to handle any kind of situation."
good,"Working at the Disney Store has been an exciting and fun journey. What I love about working there is the enthusiasm from my coworkers, and how Disney really makes guests feel appreciated and recognized. Working there you feel like a story teller since we are encouraged to interact with guests a lot and make them have a great  shopping experience."
good,"One of my best employers Ever"
good,"I enjoyed working in the legal department of such an amazing entertainment company.  The executives I supported were so intelligent and such nice people."
good,"The diverse culture Disney aspires is such a fun experience. You get to meet people of different personalities, religion, background and race and we all learn to put our differences aside and work together like family. Management is pretty on top of our company values and heritage. Probably the best part of the job is having the ability to make a guests day or even vacation. The hardest part of the job is to keep consistency of all the values and expectations of the company."
good,Implemented business kind of thoughts to give exact what the client is expecting. Involved in every aspect to prepare Architecture for the project.
good,"I loved working for Disney, if I hadn't of moved I would still probably be working for them. The only downside to work with Disney was the Manager Staff, it was chaotic and there was always drama. Other than that though it is a great place to begin your career."
good,"Working for Disney can be a dream come true,there is nothing better than making magic all day. But it is not all fun and games, it is hard work too. The hours are long and extend into 3rd shift sometimes but the atmosphere and colleagues make it worth it."
good,A passion for the Disney company makes the job feel like a privilege to be a part of the organization. A typical day in the retail environment is to deliver Disney magic to guests and children the same as you would in the park.
good,The environment of the store was always magical. Everyone there always had a positive attitude that was a requirement of the job and it just made things pleasant.
good,"A great second career. No guest should ever walk away from a Cast Member without a smile on their face."
good,Its truly fun place to work . Company has great benefits for their employees. They do care about their team's well being. even though it was one of the busiest place to work but you do enjoy what you do.
good,"Working for the Walt Disney Company is amazing. Duties vary per day due to the fact that I'm constantly moved around and placed based on my knowledge in locations and business needs. I've learned how to be extremely flexible and how to be open minded to change. Management and coworkers are amazing, but the company is so large that it's constantly being changed and solid relationships are tough to keep. Overall the job is great and inspiring to be able to make people smile each passing day."
good,Overall I really loved working for Walt Disney it was my commute that started getting to me I was driving from deland in volusia to disney in orlando currently my daughter works st disney but she lives in orlsndo
good,"Extremely creative day starts out with reviews with Graphics team and art directors. Strategic thinking always accompany creativity in our workplace.  "
good,I enjoyed working for Disney and being a part of a team of professionals that pushed each other to make the experience for the guest worth while.  The hardest portion of the job was finding the different locations across the complex.  Making the trip for a guest memorable was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"This Profile suites me more."
good,"I do wish the ""part time"" part of the job wasn't so obvious. I was only getting ten hours a week tops which meant I had to work one or two additional jobs to make ends meed."
good,"It's fun overall, just wished they paid better. can't have a living wage, you're basically paying for gas most of the time if you live far."
good,Definitely a fun job. There's always something new happening. Management is great and the job is a breeze. The only part that's bad is the paents not watching their kids
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Cast Member to assist the Cast Members and Management team during the busy holiday season. A typical day at worked varied, some days were typical and some were really busy with all hands on deck. My management team and co-workers were unbelievable, supportive and great at team-work."
good,The Walt Disney Company is indeed a company worth working for. I've learned so much about the outstanding service the company has cultured in our minds. The leadership within the company has been the best I've ever worked for and I'd do anything to make them look good.
good,"Great place to work, the work flow, however, is not stable, they have a ""feast or famine"" situation."
good,I get to help people from all over the world plan out their Disneyland Resort vacations. I have been given opportunities offered by the management team that I wouldn't have been able to experience otherwise. The hardest part of the job is working with the system that we are to use because of the timely processes that I have to deal with when processing passes or ticket orders. I love that I get to work my friends who have become like my extended family and that I get to meet people who come to me to help make their dreams come true. Whether that be helping a boyfriend set up a surprise marriage proposal for his girlfriend or telling a little girl that she is at Disneyland for the first time in her life. This job has blessed me with the ability to come out of my shell and do the job I was hired to do while being able to have fun and sprinkle a little bit of pixie dust for those who need to remember how to believe in magic.
good,Every day is different but it's great to make magic for our guests. Its important to have a great working knowledge and understanding of Walt Disney World Resort in order to continue advancement in the area.
good,"I would go into work making sure that i am ""show ready"" and greet all guests i encounter with. I learned how to work for a fortune 500 company. Management truly care about their employees."
good,It was a great place to work at and meet many new friends. I'll miss them all. Managers on one hand is another story. I think they all forget that they were cast members at one time. I would have gave them one star but there were one or two that made it enjoyable. The most memorable part of my job was making magic for guests.
good,"I had such a great time working and growing with this company. I was just so sad to have our team shut down. I would work for them again, if given the opportunity."
good,"Enjoyable work place, fast paced and exciting. Everyday was different but I was still able to exercise my skills to their full potential. Co- workers were all team members. What I enjoyed most of all was going in everyday and being able to perform masonry."

good,"The Disney College Program offered me a more refined, hands on experience in the guest service industry. I truly enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to any Grad no matter your career path."

good,"Great working culture, very knowledgable and hard working team."
good,"A typical day begins with going to our check in location to have a brief meeting with out managers about what to expect through out the day. We would recieve our assignment and get all of the necessary equipment for the day including radio,keys, and pan and broom. Through out the day if any problem or situation arised we were responsible for getting on the radio and informing a managr. I leard many important skills including, time management, radio signs,and communicartion skills."
good,This is a great place to do a college internship. Gain great customer service skills. Learn about different cultures from around the world.
good,The Walt Disney Company is one of the best places to work for.
good,dealing with everyday guest making sure their time here was a memorable one
good,Overall great company to work for. The only downfall is that sometimes they make you feel just like a number because it is such a large company.
good,"All the cast members' is helpful in helping each other accomplish their goals, and duties."
good,"Going to work every day did not actually feel like work. I enjoyed the people and the clients. I would recommend this place to everyone, I am truly sad that it will be closing down."
good,"My co-workers and manager love their job, and that is what makes this hotel a great place to work. The pay is minimum but the most enjoyable part is meeting people from all around the world."
good,Being part of something magical is a definite value-add to any career.
good,"In 2009, I attended the Walt Disney World College Program and I worked at Espn Wide World of Sports. I was an operation intern from January to June. I work 10 -12 hours a day, 6 days a week. A typical day at work at the Wide World of Sports would be: I would get to work around 7:00 every morning and start setting up for the event coming in that day. I learned everything from setting up, to running the box office for ticket sales for the Atlanta Braves Spring Training, to crowd control for National Cheerleading Events. I met so many people that I could consider my co-workers.But by working at Disney World, my coworkers were happy to come to work and they all were respected. The hardest part of the job was to take public transportation to work everyday. The buses were always on time but it took an hour and half to get from my apartment to work everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walt Disney World was meeting so many people from many different places."
good,"It is a great company to work for, but there is little to no room for advancement. The union is both good and bad. We are set at a cap off point on pay scale and once reached that is it, you are maxed out. I love being in the floor manager position and I have learned a lot."
good,The company is a great place to work! I truly miss the fast pace work environment.
good,Enjoy working at this company as the goals and values are great.
good,"The typical workday at DIMG included fulfilling creative work orders for retail level POS, POP and online content design solutions for sale teams. Management and colleagues were pleasant, professional, fully knowledgeable and a joy to work with daily. I learned a great deal regarding the gaming industry’s behind-the-scenes process. Acquiring design approvals from gaming vendors and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) were the challenging aspects of the job. The approval process tended to be cumbersome due to numerous revision rounds and correspondence. The most enjoyable aspect was seeing everyone’s hard work bring a video game property to life for national and international markets."
good,I absolutely loved working for Disney. I did the Disney College Program while in college and couldn't have asked for a better experience. I worked the front desk of one of the resorts and loved it. It was easy to make great friends and enjoy the job.

good,"Working at Walt Disney was one of the best job experiences I've had   so far. The best part is that everyone really is like one big team, there is a good mix of seasoned experienced workers and constant newcomers. So , everyone really new how to help others out and make sure things got done on time and the way they were supposed to get done."
good,"Great training to fulfill the guest perspectives, "
good,Working for the walt disney company is fun and enjoyable. Management is great and every employee is treated fairly.
good,"A typical work day starts with music.  You can hear music all the time.  From the time you enter till the time you leave.  Once clocked in you meet with the managers who go over the day with you.  Then you get to work with greeting the guest in the park.  You are having so much fun that sometimes it doesn't seem like you're working at all.  Everyone there, the guest and the co-workers are full of excitement and are happy to be there.  It is a great place to work."

good,"Disney is a great company to work for, I have been employeed for 13 years and enjoyed most of my experience with the company, we have un matched benefits and pay is decent for salaried leaders who preform well."
good,"As an Outdoor Vendor I sold various Disney merchandise and refreshments to guests in both Disneyland and Disney’s California Adventure Parks.  These items included beverages, food, balloons, etc. and I would also ""up-sell"" any promotional items that I was given.  As a Disney employee, I was also required to ensure the guests' experience at the resorts was the best they ever had; this included giving directions to the many attractions, a working knowledge of the parks, and always emanating the ""Disney Magic"" by helping to create a warm family-friendly environment.  When park restaurants were short staffed, I would be sent to help them by working as a “busser” by cleaning tables and keeping the dining areas clean or in the kitchen washing dishes or helping prepare meals."
good,"A typical day of work began with meeting with the various art directors I was working with at the time and keeping them posted with the work that I was doing for them.  While interning I learned how to keep with a consistent scale, a lot of architectural design, interior and exterior design, how to use AutoCAD and SketchUp, and creating color boards.  Management was amazing, they gave me the opportunity to design some of my own color boards and create spaces.  Co-workers were always a joy and quickly became close friends.  The hardest part of the job was working with some people who were more interested in function over form.  the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a project go from design to full fabrication."

You become their guide, their vacation planner, and their assistant. Guests from all over the world will come to you for all sorts of questions no only as to what time is check out but as to how to meet mickey and how can i get a birthday surprise and even how to order a pizza. Also, sometimes it gets fun when that guest doesn't speak English. I've learned patience and compassion while working here. Its a truly magical place to work . The hardest part where the extremely upset guests but you find ways to get a smile. "
good,"Exciting and motivating fellow employees. Management could be a little more involved in motivating, but it was a great way to see how the culture of Disney could be used to better other organizations."
good,"The work environment at ABC (division of Disney) was superb. Management was friendly, there was a good sense of team and friendship among co-workers. Management, while insistent upon quality and quantity of work, was not overbearing and in fact was concerned with the well-being of the employees and team-building. "
good,"Trabalhar para a Walt Disney Company foi uma das melhores e mais caóticas experiências de minha vida. Trabalhei no Magic Kingdom, o primeiro lugar que vem na cabeça de muitos quando pensam na Disney. Desse modo, todos os dias eu tive a chance de interagir com milhares de pessoas de todas as partes do mundo, e lidar com todas as expectativas que elas tinham da empresa. Durante os feriados (Natal, Ano Novo, etc), as horas de trabalho eram normalmente caóticas, devido à quantidade de pessoas visitando os parques, mas por mais desgastante que o dia pudesse ser, você podia sempre contar com os colegas e uma equipe de coordenadores que sabia exatamente como reconhecer seu bom trabalho."

good,"They are an amazing company to work for if you like Disney. Benefits are great for full time employees. They pay can be low but it more than balances itself out with the fun and rewards from working at Disneyland. Not only getting to be in the park to make the guest experience a more magical thing, but also the benefits of being able to come into the park as a guest whenever you like."
good,"Wake up at 4 in the morning and get ready. Go to Disney and clock in at 5:45 and start work at 6. Pull weeds and lay mulch and pine straw all day. Then clock out at 2. I learned how easy it is to meet and greet new people. The management of the job was amazing. Anytime anything need done, it was handled. All of the co-workers at this job were the best you could ask for. They were all friendly and funny. We all became like one big family. The hardest part of the job was That we were in direct heat for about 8 hours every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all of the new people that I was able to meet."
good,"Working At Disney Requires A Great Deal Of Involvement, Company And Product Knowledge A Must."
good,"On a daily basis I worked closely and independently with sales, external vendors and a large number of clients with a variety of needs, some requiring a very hands on approach, to ensure constant communication regarding current deals, upcoming sales, client needs and vendor performance. I was responsible for organizing at least one territory trip per year where I would meet with clients face to face in order to receive invaluable feedback on client expectations, customer service levels and to maintain quality working relationships. Additionally I successfully managed a large workload, balancing an inbox where I would receive up to 100 requests a day, requiring a high level of organization."

Management was excellent , they made sure I was comfortable in my work space and check in from time to time for any difficulties. The workplace culture was wonderful, everyone made me feel welcomed and was very friendly. If I had any questions they never hesitated to help. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with rude or angry customers. For the most part , overall I liked my own workspace and it was very easy going."

They all required constant vigilance and some required action to save or assist a guest on a more regular basis."
good,"Time of your life. Low pay. "
good,"A typical day at work is helping out guest and interacting with guest to make their visit to their resort a pleasant one.

I did whatever little jobs they needed me to do, from restocking the shelves to assisting shoppers in finding whatever they needed."
good,"I love love loved my job at the Disneyland resort. I have absolutely no complaints about it despite knowing many people who hated the job. Maybe it's because I'm a kid at heart or maybe it's because I've always loved Disney and have always wanted to work there, so maybe that it but who knows. Everyone has different experiences so maybe yours will differ from mine but I love it."
good,"Free membership into parks + employee discount "
good,"Fun, fast paced job that gives a lot of room for growth throughout the entire company. With easy to understand rules set from the start about how to conduct oneself"
good,Working for The Walt Disney World Company is an honor in itself. Walt Disney would be pleased that all the research and requirements he wanted his cast members to be held to a certain standard to. It is a high volume job which can lead to some stress. But the cast members in each role are one of perfect people. While working for the company each role that was assigend was viewed as just as important. Whether garbage duty or custodial to character you are valued and given the role of making magic come to each guest individually. I would reccommend this company to anyone and would love to be a part of the corporate Disney World CO.

good,"This was no doubt my favorite place to work. Had to leave due to unfortunate circumstance. The management and staff were very friendly, Easy to get along with. Always there for you if you need help. Not really hard part the job if you stick to quality control questions and you know something about Disney so that you can build that trust with those potential guests on the phone so that they will purchase from you."
good,"Fun guest interactions, getting to meet people from all over the world. I learned how to use the devices to manage the tickets, crowed control, etc.  The managers and leaders are very nice. The hardest part of the job is having to stand up for many hours.  I enjoy it because its out side I'm not working with money and I get to smile to everyone and interact with people from all over the world."

Everyone I worked with simply was there to make others happy, which made for such a positive, uplifting work environment. I gladly woke up to go to work in the morning.

The hardest part of this job was saying goodbye after my internship ended."

good,If you have the chance to do a Disney Professional Internship I would highly recommend it. As a college student it was great way to get sales experience.
good,"As a cashier, Disney trained me incredibly well and made sure I was ready to give the best service to the guests. Because I was trained so well and had the most competent co-workers a person could wish for I was able to do my job well. The managers were great too, although they do hover (probably because I was a new employee).  The job was not particularly difficult and the best part was meeting the kindest guests from all over the world."
good,A fast-paced work environment that flexes to accommodate personal life needs as long as you perform with integrity and deliver quality work within deadlines. It's a great culture for high achievers and attracts dynamic people with diverse backgrounds.

good,"It indeed was the happiest place to work at. Great team members, have learned a lot from everyone & had the opportunity to grow & move up the hierarchy."
good,I worked for the Walt Disney company for 18 years before I was let go due to a department reorganization.  My co-workers were amazing and we were busy everyday managing partners and internal groups.  The team was always ready to lend a helping hand when things got overwhelming.
good,Working for Disney was by far the most fun i've had ever. Of course there are days where it seems like every guest is purposely trying to annoy you but it comes with the job. My team and my set of managers were in my opinion some of the best the park has to offer. Would go back in a heartbeat.

good,"This was my second time working for The Walt Disney Company at Walt Disney Imagineering.  I was asked to come back to work on the Shanghai Disney Resort project in Shanghai, China.  I relocated to Shanghai in 2012 and after three years returned to California.  It was a great experience learning about Chinese culture and lifestyle.  I had the opportunity to hire 150 Chinese to fulfill the Finance, Estimating, Planning/Scheduling and Contract Administration roles for the construction duration of the resort which included Disneyland, two hotels, a retail/dining/entertainment complex, parking, area development and infrastructure for this 700 acre resort."
good,"Era agradável,  tinha um chefe  muito  bom,  participava de quase todos os eventos que a Disney fazia.  a família sempre foi muito respeitosa  comigo eram todos muito educados, aprendi muito com todos e acredito que tenham aprendido comigo também. O problema eram as baladas com os filhos ficava muitas horas trabalhando."
good,Testing in Mobile QA department. The work atmosphere is great while getting you involved in your work at the same time. My coworkers are amazing and very helpful when it comes to working on task.
good,"Most of the time it's a hectic busy day since its downtown disney. You get to meet a lot of different people from all over the world which was really cool.Sephora is all about have a great customer service and knowledge about products. We learned on the daily. You watch videos before you go out on stage so you know a little about a new product and its background and what is it used for and how to apply. Co workers were like family, you can always count on them and we got along so well. My favorite part was applying makeup on clients and I was a certified makeup artist there so I got to do 45 minute full makeovers. There wasn't really anything ""hard"" about working at Sephora."

Due to my role I meet a diverse range of people from all over the world in a daily basis - mainly with children and their relatives."
good,"Working at Walt Disney World is like working with a huge family of very diverse, entertaining, clever, and funny people. The best part of my work day is seeing my coworkers when I get there and knowing that they are as invested in helping fellow Cast Members as I am. Everyone works hard to make sure the guests have the best experience possible and management has an open door policy that they stand behind. Every morning, I drive to the parking lot and board a bus to get to work, I see Cinderella's castle, and I know it is going to be a magical day. The most difficult part of being a Cast Service Specialist is the volume of Cast Members who speak a different language and need assistance. On the bright side, I became very good at pantomiming. The most enjoyable part is helping Cast Members understand the Disney company, benefits, and how to navigate in the Cast environment."

We engage with the audience on and off stage through activities, dances, contests, prize distribution, etc."
good,"I worked Custodial Guest Services at Disney's Animal Kingdom. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed about my role was that it was a Global Role. This meant I could work at any park I wanted even though I was an Animal Kingdom Cast Member... provided I could find a shift to trade for or pick up. Management is rarely in your hair unless procedures aren't being followed and for the most part, you manage your own work habits and even your entire schedule if you'd like. The work hours could be extraordinarily long during peak park times of the year as well. A regular animal Kingdom shift would run between 9-13.5 hours. If there was an event that night and you were selected to work, expect to add an extra 5-7 hours to your shift. The events though were very fun if you could get past being tired. We had a very good management Cast during my time there. The MK West and DAK Management teams were some of the most helpful and guiding individuals I have ever met. Primary duties of the job included keeping the park in Show Ready Condition, providing Information to Guests (CUSTODIAL IS THE FRONT LINE OF GUEST SERVICE), and entertainment through Water Art which is pretty awesome."

Of my two managers I had during my tenure, one was phenomenal and one was merely great. My coworkers were all very, very, VERY intelligent and kept a good level of activity without burning up on lots of needless high priority but low importance work. The learning curve is a firehose, but if you master it you'll come away with a high level of knowledge and competence in whatever field you're working in- I feel like I'm very qualified to handle most aspects of the ad operations chain now. "

You will be surrounded by professionals who are experts in their fields and managers depend upon you to give expert advise on matters pertaining to your expertise.  The work environment is very informal and managers manage by results rather than hands on.  I found the work atmosphere to suit my style due to my level of experience.  Senior level executives often called me into meetings to seek my opinion.  There is a great deal of respect for professionals from the management as well as the executives.  The pay is among the top tier for IT professionals and the benefits are excellent."

I also have hit the wrong switches and recorded some pretty funny things over the years that of course had to be edited and rerecorded before it was ever used material. i can tell you that It got difficult at times the hours were long and having time for me was not part of the deal.

I moved from department to department growing and learning every step of the way.  From parade dancer to costuming, to shift lead, to assisting in the office, to scheduling, to payroll and HR, every day was something new.  After 8 years at the park, I moved up to the Studios to work in the Legal Department, assisting Attorneys and Paralegals in the Corporate Legal Department.

The environment and culture of treating each guest special is something I have incorporated into my daily life."

I would work closely with the character and the attendant to provide a fun but efficient interaction for the guest. I would be assigned to different areas depending on who needed breaks and what I was trained for. When on the street I became the character, joking and playing with the guests to get the best smiles for their photos. At the end of the day I would turn in my equipment and clock out. The best part of my job was working with the characters. They are fantastic and kids love them. Mickey in particular was the best. The hardest part was staying cool out on the street. The support managers would stop in to make sure our photos were uploading, we had good batteries, and plenty of water. The leaders would stop by every once in a while to let us know what we needed to do during specific events like the parades and fireworks. This expericence taught me a lot about the Walt Disney Company, more about the camera, and how to get the best photos."

good,"Checking in and checking out over 200 guests a day. Setting guests up with magic bands so they have access to their room, dining and tickets. The hardest part of the job is going home.

good,"Unfortunately the station is now closed in New Orleans. This job was a lot of fun, as you would expect from Disney. I was just a high-schooler when I came into the position. I learned a lot about teamwork and coordinating. The job was to essentially be entertainers at public events, much like other radio stations host events from car dealerships. We would have our smiles on, games setup and prizes to give away, no one left empty handed. The team of people that worked for the station were probably the best group of people I have ever worked with. Disney knows who to look for when hiring and it showed at this station."

Walt Disney’s vision for a great guest experience includes four key elements:  safety, courtesy, show and efficiency.  The Galactic Grill is the busiest restaurant in the entire park and even though the operation may sometimes get hectic, the shift managers will step in and help to alleviate any chaos or backup in line and mobile orders to keep the flow of guests moving forward with a maximum of thirteen windows open at any given time.

good,"I was on the Disney College Program (DCP) and it was a terrific experience. Every day was a different challenge. You are dealing with thousands of guests every day and each one presents a different challenge/opportunity. Throughout the program I learned how to interact with guests, cast members, and management. All while performing my job to the highest level possible. My managers were excellent and helped at every turn. I had a family situation and even though I was just on the DCP, they listened and provided me with anything I needed. The hardest part of the DCP was probably the changes that happen. You have your team, however, the personal changes throughout the day so you have to tailor yourself to their work style based on the position you are in at the time. This also is the most enjoyable part of the job because you work with so many people throughout the day. You may be working with a 20 year veteran and learning how they do things, or help somebody through their first day jitters. I may have been one of the lowest ranked employees, however, that did not stop the other cast members from making me feel like I was family."

good,"Working at the Disney Store is a great place to work at, we hardly ever get rude customers. Once you walk into the store you just get this positive energy from everyone. I have learned so much working here for the past three years but i think patient is the biggest thing i learned. Having to work with kids helped me be patient. The management team at the Disney store is great. She is there at work and outside of work always there to help us with a positive attitude. The hardest part of this job is probably keeping up with the Disney talk we have to do. Coming up with new and different was to keep the store magical. The most enjoyable part would have to see the kids leave the store happy and hugging you to thank you for helping them find their new best friend."

good,Consulting for Disney was a very rewarding and rich experience - resources were well utilised and communication with teams was easy and went smoothly. Research and recommendations were seriously considered
good,"I didn't work here for long as it was only a seasonal position for me. A typical day at work was great since everything would have to involve using Disney language. The benefits of working for Disney were amazing. The Ambassadors of our team would always reward everyone for their hard work. The hardest part of the job was to incorporate everything you would say into Disney language. But then, it could be really easy if the guests would also go along with the Disney language. The only con I could think of for the time being I worked here were the amount of work hours I would receive."

The management at Disney was incredible. They were extremely knowledgeable in their field and worked very hard to make sure the interns learned a lot during their internship. The people I worked around made the experience even better and are honestly one of the things I miss most. Everybody is excited to be working at Disney and conflict rarely arose within the team. The hardest part of the job was carrying all the equipment around to the different habitats. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with and making guests smile.

I was working here for over a year and in that time decided it was fun and enjoyable, however there are times where I felt as if were too much when the customers thought it was alright to almost dehumanize you and not take into consideration that their requests were not attainable for when and what they were asking for and because you could not make it happen, suddenly you ruined their vacation."

This company is interested in their employees, providing extra perks outside the realm of one's job, such as tuition reimbursements, child care, etc. The best part of the job was working with creative people, open to ideas, dedicated staff.

good,"My experience with Disney Dining was great. Through them I learned a lot of communication skills. It taught me patience with guests that aren't easy to deal with. Even though it was our job to keep a smile on our face, my co-workers were genuinely kindhearted. The job wasn't hard, the only time it was challenging were the times when call volume reached 80-100 calls waiting. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the magic happen for all guests, especially those who were agitated from the very beginning. Once they saw the hard work we put into trying to get reservations for their vacation their attitudes would change and by the end of most phone calls they would tell me I made their day. That was the best part of the entire job, guest satisfaction."

good,"Everyday is a different day working at Disney, each day unlocks a new adventure and a new experience. You can never really predict how your day is going to go and what obstacles your going to face that day. By having to act right then and there on the spot to correct an issue or to change the bad experience a guest may be having, is what makes my role at Disney very educating and eventful. Every day adds some of the best experience that I will be able to carry with me throughout my life. I work for not only a huge and successful company, but its truly my co workers and management team I have to thank for my success and having the ability to move up throughout my time with the company. The guest and tourist that visit daily are the ones that are able to turn anyone's frown upside down! It's the experience I am able to create for families all over the world and learn more about different cultures daily. My management and training team continues on daily basis to assure that I have the proper training and knowledge on any new products or events taking place.The best part of my day is seeing the smile on families and kids faces and being able to make there experience one they will never forget. Although some days are harder than others and is expected to be that way no matter where you may work, but for me its all about how I choose to let it effect me! And for myself I may not be able to change something that has already happened, however I can try my best to turn that experience around and make it better going forward.

good,"I highly recommend if everyone can to work for this company at some point in their life. They truly care not only for their guests, but their own cast members. It was an absolute joy to wake up every day and not have to ""work."" I learned so much from my managers and fellow cast members on how to be the best performer I could be on ANY day no matter the situation. The hardest parts of my job were the weather and the different cultures. Most days it was exhaustingly hot and you have to perform with a smile on your face no matter what. Even if sweat is dripping down your face, those people came to see that character and you have to act just as they would. Different cultures always threw me off because not everyone understood American culture about personal space, time, etc. However, all of that vanished when a small child came up to you and would give you the longest hug along with the best story about their trip to Disney world and how they came to see you. I truly loved my job and hated to leave the company. I hope to one day work for them again because of the impact they made on my life the year I was able to work for them."

The amount of people you come across from different parts of the world in one day is amazing and its enlightening to know that they travel long distances to visit your resort. That same idea made the job more enjoyable because you were part of a memory that was being created, and your impact on whoever was visiting the resort may last a life time. I learned a lot about customer service, and providing good customer service no matter what. Everyone who works at the Disneyland resort is very nice, friendly, and they want to see you succeed."
good,Working for Walt Disney was the most rewarding thing I have ever done. Everyday I was able to interact with guests from all over the world and help to make their vacation magical and leave them with lasting memories.
good,"A typical day was spent parading through the store with little princesses and princes while helping their parents find what they were looking for.  Sometimes it was hard though.  An example of a difficult day would be when multiple Brazilian tour groups of 80+ teenagers each would swarm the store.  Between trying to keep merchandise on the shelf and assisting guests that spoke a different language I didn't understand was definitely a challenge, but I never disliked it.  I love a good challenge.  I also learned that priorities are extremely important, and that you should take a moment to decide how you rank your duties around you in a timely manner.  Another cool thing was knowing that I was apart of one of the largest Disney stores in the world, and that I helped the store reach it's daily budgets of over $300k a day!"

I enjoyed playing with the children and making them feel that even though aren't at Disneyland that they can still have a magical time when they come into a Disney realm. At the Disney store i got to work the register, stock the counters with products and merchandise, I was above all though the customer service. I got to help the children and even the adults that were very passionate about Disney find their magical friend. I enjoyed working with my co-working because they all had very high energy and all were highly motivated to help and do team work when it came to a problem one of us had."

We used the Gus's program for all the scanning garments, ordering, preparing uniform for embarking crews and set out from the disembarking crews"
good,"I have had my fair share of jobs, six to be exact. But I have never seen another company be so self driven. So motivated and inspired to make guests feel more at home than the Walt Disney Company. I learn about how important customer service is, how important it is to greet everyone with a smile and willingness to assist. Although i work at 4 different restaurants in this company, i enjoy working them all. Whether its the ice-cream parlor, chili dog/hot dog stand, bakery or the cappuccino cart. I love interacting with people from all over the world and working with a team of people that all focus on the same goal.The most enjoyable part of my job is making people smile,laugh and get to learn new things everyday. The hardest part of my job is never knowing when the rush will end, the park could have 25,000 - 60,000 people everyday. So we always have to prepare ourselves with stock and mentally prepare ourselves. The management team are great when it comes to checking the location, but it lacks knowing the team members. They don't remember our names although we have seen them 100+ times. They don't call us to their office unless we are in trouble or they need to talk to us."

I've worked for different divisions of the Disney Company, but mostly as a freelance contractor. Walt Disney Imagineering was the only Disney company where I was permanently employed. At the time of my employment, I had good company benefits and perks. I don't know what they offer now in benefits. I enjoyed working at WDI. I especially loved working at the WDI division located at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. I got to do much more diverse jobs, and it was my job to inspect rides on a daily basis, early in the morning to check overall ride quality, the look (does anything need paint?), safety (does anything need repair?) but mostly to do with show quality, look, feel etc. Walt Disney Imagineering was a great place to work. I'd work there again if invited."
