rating,review
good,Need to be willing to work hard and fast. Need to be able to work well with others and be a people. Have to be able to bite your tongue when asked to do something u don't wanna do
good,A typical days work consists of 7 hour shifts. I would normally work the morning shift from 9 in the morning until 5 with a hour lunch. For the most part it was a good job. It gave me customer service skills and knowledge.
good,"The biggest problem is that promotions and advancement are given based on who you know, education and performance is hardly considers specially on higher positions; to get into above co manager you must have a ""sponsor"", regardless your performance they are going to look for someone to blame.Hard to work for company they are not willing to back. They play favorites and ppl who are dependable and hard working are left to pick up the pieces."
good,"There's an attitude that management is not at all concerned with employees, except as bodies.  They don't even hardly deign to speak to them.  And, if a customer wants to go higher with an issue, the customer service of middle management truly sucks, yet they want the emphasis to be on providing good customer service."
good,"there was alot of customer service"
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was awesome. I Loved my job, my position, work load and associates. What went wrong for me is one assistant manager. If it weren't for him I feel I would still be there."
good,Walmart customers are the highlight of that establishment. Walmart needs to work with and on the staffing.  Team building and reconfigure ther point system will probably help with the high turnover.
good,"Stressful!! Merchandise recovery can at times become overwhelming due to lack of staff. Also, no health coverage causes a problem due to the job requirements expected sometimes resulting in injury."
good,Walmart Was Great When I Started But They Work You so Hard In Don’t Appreciate Nothing You Do I Tryied My Best To Please Them In To Be The Sales Associate I Can Be But It Didn’t Work They Take You For Granted
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you just recently graduated High School and are going to college. I only recommend if you have open availability and nothing interferes with your schedule. Walmart may or may not work around your schedule and if you have limited availability you may get some or no hours at all. You may be cross trained in multiple areas depending on the store's needs and what department but overall is a challenge that can be overcome. There's alot of room for improvement and I recommend working your way up to department manager.
good,Great place to work for a first job it helps build good work ethic and skills. Flexible with hours and shifts. Fast pace environment. Benefits are great. The hardest part of working here would be standing on your concrete all day. Although you get proper breaks and lunches it can take a toll on your feet and back.
good,"A typical day at work would be standing on you're feet and checking people out. I learned how to work the registers and to match things with their barcodes. The CSMs were terrible, we even had one that would hide out in the bathroom."
good,"Typical day, workplace culture could have been improved. I enjoyed working in the pharmacy and learning about medications. Te work morale in the pharmacy could be improved. Teamwork could have more emphasis on it as well."
good,"My time with the company was fairly short for various reasons. However, during my employment I made a few friends and got my first real understanding of logistics on a retail store level."
good,"It’s walmart, it’s a paycheck. If you shop at a Walmart you kind of get the jist of how it’s going to be working there. You’re going to meet some interesting characters and you’re probably not going to like your boss but if you do it right, it’s only temporary. Great first job."
good,"If you're in the bakery, you can use cake decorating as a creative outlet. Management was good. They do reward you for your experience and good works."
good,"Environmental was an overall pleasant place to work. "
good,Walmart should be a company that pays people fairly for the job we do. Working in the unloading department dealing with heavy lifting some people just don't get pay enough. Rather than that is a good working place
good,For the most part it’s a good place to work. It’s always busy. When I was there there wasn’t that much help from management but it has improved over the years.
good,They tell you will get breaks but you never will. You have to beg them for a break and it sucks. I don't like middle management because they don't want to do their jobs.
good,Unloading trucks is fast paced and hard to keep up. Some items are heavy and need more than one person to move. Stalking is hard when the stuff is heavy. Some managers expect to much.
good,"I learned how to run a baler and a walk behind forklift. Also a typical day at work was pulling inventory off of trucks, stocking shelves, and helping customers."
good,it is not my first choice job to recommend but it is not too bad while you are there. i would not recommend staying their for more than a year........
good,workers at walmart are full of drama and awful to associate with. you can not trust anyone you associate yourself with. they have three faces and you can never do enough to get promoted to another unless you lick butt.
good,"Employees are great! Management needs drastic improvement.  Poor and inconsistent communicative efforts by management team as a whole. Overly aggressive, disrespectful and unprofessional communication styles.  Retail is expected to be competitive but not to the extent prevalent at this store to justify one's position or authority."
good,"Varies from store to store, some are good whereas others are minimalist, lots of drama, hard to make a career, uncooperation among coworkers, leaders, managers.   it's hit or miss as far as management"
good,It was a hit and miss when it came to employees wanting to actually work. Employees couldn’t take managers seriously and there was too much drama there.
good,A typical day is going to involve a lot of customer service. I enjoy helping as much as I can. Management needs to be fair and not have favorites. Best part of ANY day is the customers smile and satisfaction
good,can be very fast place to work. Need to be able to stand on your feet and have a good back.  Have to smile and be friendly and you would in any position....loved it but got injured.
good,"A typical day at work is very challenging, because everyday we learn and try something new or have to switch things up. The hardest part of the job is helping new employees."
good,Must be able to keep a strict routine and work at 100% capacity at all times. Accommodations are rare and the managers push you to do overwhelming amounts of work. The pay is above the national average.
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar y su gente es muy agradable.
good,"Busy, challenging, productive"
good,Pretty good job for either high schoolers or adults I wouldn’t want to work there when I’m older though or even for more then two years just because they mess around with hours a lot and don’t schedual good never really have there stuff together
good,I have been with Walmart for almost 9 years and I started out @ $8.95 per hour & I now make just $12.90 per hour.Pretty pathetic if you ask me.Unhappy at Walmart.
good,"It was horrible because of how I was treated and trained. The management was poor in the sense of support the had for there employees. But they had no intentions to pay workers comp, either."
good,Working at Walmart was demanding and fast paced. They provided benefits such as insurance and paid time off. It was a solid job but not much room for growth.
good,Good experience. management can sometimes be a problem. exposed to different kinds of people because of customer service environment. overall good experience.
good,"The typical day at work is usually run on specific processes. Verify freight, stock freight, bin freight, and customer service are the usual tasks. I learned new ways to approach people and how to handle them in different situations. The training they give did help immensely with how I act as a manager. For the most part the work environment was nice and family-like, but with so many switches in management at one time, the closeness of the store and it's people skills has diminished. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of higher management maintaining accurate and consistent work among their associates and picking up that slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is being left alone to get the job done as accurately as possible. Trusted their department managers with a lot."
good,most of the managers that I worked for were very good to work for but there were a few that would expect you to do more than any one person could finish in one shift.
good,Working at walmart as a cashier was a good summer job which landed me some pretty good experience for dealing with customers. The job itself was flexible as I would be used to cover for door greeters if not present and to cover cashiers in lawn and garden if not present.
good,"The overall experience was very productive. Managers had little job experience outside of Walmart, so they were less helpful than they could have been when trying to answer a customer's question."
good,"Promotions are limited to management jobs. If you don't go into management, you are stuck at the bottom of the barrel. The environment is friendly enough with the occasional ill tempered customer. Working overnights, you don't get much of a social life outside of work."
good,"Wal Mart is a culturally diverse employer. However, there is never enough staff to get the job done which makes the work environment difficult which does not promote productivity."
good,"My experience wasn’t the worst but definitely not the best. Management was not fair at all, they had their favorites. They would not acknowledge the ones who did actually work."
good,"Schedules changing too much, so you really cant do anything else."
good,"Walmart did not take into account my other two jobs. I was hired in as part-time but they scheduled me for 39 hour weeks, on third shift, so it was hard to work my other jobs."
good,Not a bad place to work. Workers with experience should be paid better. New workers with no experience were paid the same as people with years of experience.
good,Managers are somewhat decent but some are strict and don' care anything about you only the company. The customers are sometimes rude because they expect you to know everything.
good,"i was cross trained with multiple departments including register trained it was pretty stressful and fun at the same time i loved the associates who worked there they were also very friendly. the hardest part was working the fitting room and having to answer calls and the walkie all at once dealing with customers at the same time. but what made everything better was my manager, she was the best there."
good,"Seemed to be a hazing for every new employee.  Management is stressed under upper management and it all trickles down as in every job however, there could be better training for management in order to keep employees."
good,Hardest part of the job would have to be either the elements of working outside or working alone on a daily basis. Easy to get along with other employees and most of them are very friendly. The wages and flexibility are a bonus.
good,"Always prepare yourself before stepping into the workplace because everyday it’s something different. The employees are great, the customer are locals around the neighborhood, everyone know each other."
good,"Tough customers. Tough management. Management often sides with customers over employees, making employees look bad for following the standard policies and procedures taught to them during six months of arduous training."
good,"The only Walmart I worked at was a circus, no one knew how to put inventory away or organize correctly. I worked with several people that were older yes acted much younger. I can only base my review on my experience."
good,"a typical is stressful most of the time."
good,It is a good place to work but there is a little place for advancement. Positions will open but not enough because many people will apply even other people from other department. The negative thing is that holiday are not paid you have to use your own PTO.
good,"The job came with a lot of hard work and sometimes rude customers but the dynamic between associates is amazing. Even if you’re having a bad day, you’ll find comfort in the joy your coworkers bring in an attempt to uplift your spirit."
good,"Nice people to work with in all departments"
good,"Didn't really work there long enough to have an opinion, so....I guess it was alright. Stressful, of course. But it wasn't too terrible.  I just wished that it was more clear as to what I was supposed to do."
good,My time at this company was short. I had to relocate to another state with family. One pro this company offers is the ability to relocate to another store in another state if you have been with the company six months or more.
good,"Solo estuve tres meses ya que fue trabajo temporal."
good,Great job for a first or second job. Career opurtunities to move up are also available to certain employees. As you provide excellent customers service it’s a plus to meet different people from all over the area. You’re able to see how diverse our country is learning good judgement.
good,"good place to work"
good,Retail is a hard job to do so if you like retail then this is the job for you if you need daycare then maybe this is not the job you may be offered part time you may be lucky to get full time
good,"* very rushed"
good,"I was only hired as Temp. I enjoyed working for this company, If I was offered more steady and reliable hours it would of made me love it more, I was let go as rehire able and would not mind at all if I went back to work for this company."
good,Great starter job to get your foot in the door and to gain valuable customer service experience. It is a steady job that if you come to work you will get a paycheck.
good,"A typical retail position.  Walmart very strictly adheres to corporate guidelines, and carefully manages its departments to reflect this.  Managers are often nice and professional, but will micromanage particular aspects of daily function.  Can be extremely busy on weekends.  Walmart pays starting workers pretty decently above minimum wage, but has limited benefits for part time workers."
good,"While Walmart is a good company to work for, my experience working there has been mostly difficult. There is much favoritism and management has a tendency to bully their associates. My workdays are verily easy since I'm currently a cashier. One of my many complaints is having to stand on my feet most of the workday, but the customers at my store are always great, which make my workdays tolerable. Walmart has cross-trained me in many different positions at the company, I could probably run the store by myself if I was allowed to."
good,"Depends on on your store what your experience will be. Every store is different some have super nice managers, some have super mean, some in between. Your managers have a huge effect on your work experience. Also matters how well you are at dealing with rude customers because you get a lot of those."
good,"Visitas a clientes cadastrados em carteira, proporcionando atendimento porta a porta, aprendi a negociar , dar atendimento pré e pós venda, gerência dava suporte necessário para êxito de função,  "
good,"Working as a cashier for 2 years, I learned everything there is to retail at the front-end of any store. The job itself got too repetitive for me, and I just lost purpose of my spot on the “team”. Very very prominent system of hierarchy, the CSMs yell at us because they’re yelled at by the Assistant Managers. CSMs basically run the front end & they control you like a machine. You don’t have a say whether you’ll have your break 30mins into your shift, or 3.5 hours in. The store as a whole is a priority, not you"
good,"I'm not sure upper management is observed for being true to values of Walmart.  Regional positions are puppets with very little autonomy and base decisions on what someone higher up wants them to do."
good,"It was pretty busy most of the time. I would measure an cut fabric. Also do stock and put away overstock. I did a lot of zoning too, for other departments as well. The hardest part of the job was the slow days. it just made the time stop. I liked it when it was busy, because then I was always doing something. I love good days work. it makes me feel like I did something good. But the other employees I knew were really good people. they always helped if I was confused about something."
good,walmart is an ok company to work for. i know many beings who's been with walmart for many years now and would like to move up in the walmart company. the benefits are ok if ypu have a family or plan on having one
good,"pros:"
good,"walmart is a ok place to work. walmart want to only work u part time no overtime. they pay is ok but if u not gettin hours there no need. its a few ok manager not many, they want to talk to u anykind of way."
good,Good company overall  well established if starting out in retail management. You will put in many hours often being your days off. You are responsible for a large amount of sales and high turnover
good,"Get your work done in a reasonable time and you will have no problems. Find areas where you can relax a little more while still getting your work done and helping customers and management will not complain. As a Cap team 2 employee you are the backbone of Walmart you are also the dog of Walmart and they will pay you just as much as they pay people who do far less then you. If you show up do not cause problems and get your assigned work done you will never get fired from cap 2 they are always short on cap 2. They will never pay you overtime and you have no obligation to stay passed your time if they assigned you clearly too much work and never sent any help. Leave at your clock out time every day as long as you pick up your trash they will not be able to say anything as you are doing nothing wrong. If you do anything against any of this tho they will fire you before your 6 months are up for any little thing that goes against the rules. They wont fire you instantly but instead opt to wait till the day before your 6 months is over and fire you right before any benefits would have saved you. Work at Walmart sure, have a plan B tho as it is worth it to work there and can be a great learning experience, but Walmart is a business not a family no matter how much they try and drill that into your head."
good,Awesome place for a young adult to start off working. Great starting pay and there are many jobs an individual can advance to. Co-workers are fun and make everyday that much more enjoyable.
good,Some managers were excessively angry 
good,"Good place to grow your skills, but no one is going to hold your hand.  Many of the area managers are stuck in the I do what I've always done mentality, so innovation at DC level for some business units is stuck.  "
good,"I think Walmart can be better with their staff and train management on how to treat employees. Employees have feelings too. I am only speaking of the Northridge Walmart in Rockford, IL."
good,Fun eager to work employees who are more than willing to help you at anytime. The managers are very consistent with you schedule and work hours. This is a joyful environment.
good,enjoy the people you work with.  Get quarterly bonuses and have cookouts and lunches on accidend free days  willingness to move up in the company raise every year
good,Ive had mainly good experiences but it depends on what store and who is in management at the time. Walmart has a tendency to micro manage and have some pretty redundant rules but once you get past that its not that bad and it pays the bills.
good,"some of the managers are good to work with and will bend over backwords for you others could care less and will ignore your request for assistance. hours are pretty good, pay decent, its a stressful and physically and mentally demanding job."
good,"It was a good environment to be in, I do not regret working there. The staff was okay, but my coworkers were amazing. I made great memories and most importantly, I gained a lot of knowledge from the workfield."
good,I really enjoyed working there even though the pay is low.  However I dislike working one day of the weekend.  I never felt like I had a day off.  But Walmart protects their employees against unruly customers for which I was very grateful.
good,most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know your customers. Learned customer service skills. Typical day consists of helping the people of our community that shop at the local Walmart everyday.
good,"Great place if you like not seeing your family.  Management role is very business orientated.  Although you are given Paid Time Off, as a salaried manager, you are not allowed to take PTO at anytime as any other manager, making time off nearly impossible."
good,I was a cashier at Walmart half the time I didn't get my breaks and managers was rude. I did enjoy working with some of the people there and a lot of the customers was nice.
good,i would come in scan my back room  and 2 freezers. Scan my outs. Pull from back room (cooler) and stock. Unload truck. Restock. Rescan my backroom and freezers. Do price changes. Restock before leaving.
good,"Large store, very fast paced, long and hard hours. Management was fair. Most of the associates were friendly and hard-working. Bonuses were low and benefits were not  good."
good,"I enjoy working with the public. The experience was great. I enjoy the co workers that was working with"
good,working at wal-mart was ok with me. the hours were fine and overtime was for the most part voluntary. you could be relaxed at times and other times work does not stop.
good,I don't like Walmart just because of how they let me go. I think it would of been fair if they would've gave me my full pay. But some of the managers were wonderful to me.
good,I would work for Walmart without complaint because I believe in their company but the store I worked for was harsh and management was new and unexperienced.  Other stores are not like that so I still believe in them.
good,Walmart is a very fast paced job and very exhausting if they have you in the back of the store unloading the truck they want you moving very fast and want everything done as fast as possible.
good,"It is a good place to start out when just entering the work field. Management is willing to work with you on scheduling shifts which helps if you are in school. They do provide some work experience in customer service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers and managers. However, other employees make the job enjoyable and fun."
good,"Quality control, Inventory, merchandise stocking, time management, customer service, teamwork, organization, multi-task, set schedule, clean atmosphere"
good,What can I say? I mean don’t get me wrong I was in need of a job desperately  and Walmart was the first company to hiring me. The management at the store where I worked at was poor. They won’t listen to the employees voices. Overworked and under payed
good,Working at Walmart gave me the opportunity to learn more about customer service. It is a good job to have while I am working on my college degree.The best part of this job is the friends I made while working there.
good,I truly enjoyed working there. Just time for a change as advancement is limited in my current area of living and stepping down is not really an option for the company
good,"Enjoyable job you just are more likely to be successful on cap team 2 if you stay to yourself and work fast, there isnt much room for team work unfortunately"
good,"Depending on customers, it varied for work environment. I got to help patients pick out their frames and also children."
good,"My time here had its us and downs.I wish my position paid a bit more, offered earlier shifts, and more job security.  They also had started cutting hours."
good,"It was a nice place to work.  It was fast paced and multi task environment.  Breaks were never given at night to cashiers to close.  Lunches were given very late ,, ex. my shift was 3:00 p.m,. to 12:30 p.m. ....my lunch would be 10:30 or 11:00 at night.  In addition to that, there were only 4 closing cashiers.  It was overwhelmingly busy at a Supercenter Walmart with only 4 cashiers closing on a front end of 28 cash registers.  I was overworked without enough team manpower to help me close. Also the customers were still shopping after closing which was midnight. Management was quite unfair and had favoritism to associates that went out to smoke cigarettes with them.. The hardest part of the job was being left alone when other two cashiers went to lunch. This is a supercenter and there should at least be 8 cashiers available to close.  I enjoyed the customers at the job."
good,"Working at Walmart was always good. I have been there almost 15 years. just recently, they implemented a new scheduling system to ""better serve the customers and associates by placing the proper associates at the proper places to serve our customers at the proper times."" which translates to cutting hours and never having anyone where we need them and placing associates in departments they do not know so they can keep their 40 hours each week. On top of that, it goes based on how busy the store is which changes by the hour and is never consistent enough to gauge anything like schedules off of. "
good,"Wal-Mart offers a fast-pace, competitive and sometimes stressful work environment. The company provides employee discounts and many other benefits. There are different shifts and hours."
good,"Scheduled cashiers breaks and dealt with customer services."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the meeting the people and getting to know the team at Walmart.  I was sent for training in a Walmart a training site at another Walmart that showed me the ropes. I found the training to be satisfactory and meeting the back up team to be wonderful individuals and always helpful to me when I ran into problems.
good,"fold shirts on shelves, take clothes to the fitting room to be put in the right part of the women's apparel, and take unused clothes hangers to fitting room to be used. I've learning to be a little more patient. Its a lot slower pasted then when I was in the bakery. being bored all the time. I'm not sure yet because I started a couple weeks ago"
good,"Walmart is pretty much like all the other retail chains."
good,Wal-Mart is a good starter job. It will get you ready for any environment you encounter.  Wal-Mart has tought me to be a better listener and more understanding.
good,"I worked a total of 11 years in a variety of locations. Pharmacy was my only department, I learned a lot from the various Rph's I worked with. Its a fast paced learning environment that keeps you busy from start to finish."
good,"Most days it seemed like no one would come in and everything was done, but when there were busy days I couldn't handle it all by myself. Manager would not hire any help for me and got upset when others did try to help. Management can be contradicting and make things stressful with what you are asked to do."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if no college degree. Walmart offers on the job training and helps pay toward college tuition. Meeting new people and helping people on a daily basis is the most enjoyable part of the job. The least enjoyable would be scheduling and the high turnover rate of new hires.
good,"Walmart can be really fun. When I first started working there, I really enjoyed it. Then we got a new front end manager. She actively makes my job harder, then complains about why I'm not getting my work done. I'm a cart pusher, and she doesn't seem to understand that even after I clock out, people still exit our store. Therefore there are carts on the lot, and it's my fault somehow."
good,It was good company to work for but I just had do something different. The benefits choices are very good.............................................
good,not too much to say about Walmart. I'm not too sure where this company is headed. If you value work life balance than this is not the place for you. The salary is pretty good though.
good,"It was always busy. The thing that was disliked by all employees was they fact that they were constantly changing policies and didn't keep you up to date on all the changes per department Then they would essentially get you in trouble for not following that policy, but you never were informed of all of the changes.  If you have to leave for an emergency it counts against you and you receive points towards days off, because you're only allowed to miss so many days.  For everyday you miss you get points. Also, if you are trained to run register when they're busy they will pull you from your current job to run register. No big deal except when you are in a department that has a time limit to get things done in."
good,It was a good seasonal temp position for the Christmas season. Loved that I could help I  different departments. Most of the employees were helpful. Could of been paid more for working as a toy associated.
good,"Relatively easy job, day-to-day procedures are a little mundane. Good place to work as long as you get consistent hours. The best part of the job is helping customers."
good,scanning packages flipping totes and helping each other get the job done the job was pretty fun and lots of hard work we became a family by us working together everyday but the higher management showed lots of favoritism to the people who have been there the longest.
good,Tried for years to get any kind of advancement opportunities but was told multiple times that i was simply not visually what they wanted for the position i strived for
good,I've gathered new skills and better confidence in myself and what I'm capable through this company.  Working for Wal-Mart has brought me new life experiences that I can carry on in other aspects in my life.
good,"The work is tedious and after you learn the ropes, it's boring and drags on. Nothing changes day-to-day so if you like repetition and don't mind the customers, you'll love it there. I never had any bad experiences but really, it was only a job to have until I graduated college. I appreciate the work ethic I picked up there and the people you work with are wonderful, I'm just not cut out out for the kind of job where I'm doing the same thing everyday."
good,"Recently, Walmart has gone to a Customer First Scheduling.  It is not really ideal for stockers on the sales floor to be scheduled only when it is busy."
good,I work for one of the larger Wal-Mart's and the new system cut many associates hours and gave us twice the workload. I still make the same as new employees and I have been here for a few years.
good,Working at Walmart has its pros and cons. The service desk can be very busy around pay day and the beginning of the month. I handle money quite often. Management isn't always on the same page.
good,Walmart meant finding out what my daily duties were Working at Walmart showed me how difficult retail is Walmart has some pretty bad upper management.
good,It can be stressful at times. I feel they don't value their employees and communication is poor. Depending on management a lot of favoritism may be shown.
good,"The job was fairly good, you had the ability to learn about several processes, and move up or laterally. Long time co workers were great, benefits good."
good,"I held several job titles while working for Wal-Mart. I was a Cashier, Stockman, and a Sales Associate. The job is actually kind of fun. You get to keep busy and talk to a lot of different types of people."
good,"My overall work day was a challenge. I was often working shifts alone, managing at times over 30 employees with no help. We were also the busiest store in our Austin, TX region, which made it even more challenging."
good,"I really like the job, my co-workers and supervisors. A good job but they just scheduled me when I told them I had school, which I didn't too much care for which made me pressed for time and less focused on school"
good,The job itself is okay the Beni fits are good but sometimes it can get a little crazy but overall everything is wonderful at walmart. As a cashier you have to be a people’s person. Make sure you smile and interact with people. If you don’t your job will be boring and who wants a boring job.
good,"answered phone, worked cash register, handled money, worked at the Jewelry counter, pierced ears, worked with all different types of customers, management was not the best, hardest part of job was that there were many managers but no consistency with them"
good,Depending on you shift you can get out up to three hours late in order to accomplice the task that are required of you in a unrealistic time frame. Closing Customer Service Manager must close 17 registers and manually reset 13 shelf check out registers and are scheduled to do so in a one hour time frame. This task takes a minimum of atleast two hours and you are then expected to cut your over time due to poor scheduling. Management is not helpful all questions asked you are told to figure it out.
good,"A typical work night on grave yards for Wal-Mart is we come in, talk to the overnight manager, and she gives us our starting department to work freight in. We are typically expected to be finished with our area by our first break which is two hours after we start, but that also depend on the work load and the height of the pallets we have to stock. Every night is different, and so is the work load, some nights are heavier then others, some are lighter. I myself usually get to about three departments in a night. Usually after our last break, we are given a zoning isle, which we have to finish before we go home at seven am. If we finish our isle early, we just move on to the next isle or an area that hasn't been zoned."
good,i worked there 2 years the manager to this day does not know my name. I was doing 3 or 4 peoples jobs a day. getting in trouble when i could not finish everything at the end of my shift.
good,"Most of the people that I personally encountered had very poor work ethic. No ambition,drive. Most employees worked harder to avoid work than to tackle the job at hand. Walmart offers many opportunities for advancement in many areas. If you seek out the right people for guidance I truly believe that the only thing holding up any type of advancement is yourself."
good,"I worked at Walmart for over 5 years. Most of that spent as an assistant manager."
good,Everything was in a way organized but the were strictly against working with other coworkers to get things done.  The managers were kind of mean and didn't let you talk and work at the same time.
good,"A typical day at work would be going to clock in. then i would go to wash my hands and putting gloves on. After that i would go to help any customers if there was any. Then I would check if anything needed cooked to go into the case, check the temperatures to all the food that was in the hot case, make sure the salads are stirred up and fresh, making sure the slicers are cleaned off after it looks a little messy and i would make sure anyone else needed helped with anything. After all that i would close and make sure everything is cleaned up and shutdown. I've learned how to properly work with customers and help them with whatever they needed, helping others that i work with and maintain and operate the Deli. The management was not the best some of them were kind rude and very strict and everything you did gets on to your stuff for every little thing that you did which was very stressful.The hardest part of the job was during closing time to get everything done in time if your extremely busy thats the one part of the job that stressed me out the most. The most enjoyable part would have to be cooking the the food and helping customers."
good,"Really enjoyed my job at Walmart and the other associates I worked with, but getting pulled in between managers with poor management skills was the final straw on the camels back for me! You will be working on accomplishing something a manager ask you to do and in the middle of it another manager will show up wanting you to stop what your doing and pull you off to something they think is more important and then the previous manager shows back up wanting to chew on you for not finishing what they told you to do because the other manager pulled you away to do something else! It’s like running around in a circle chasing your tail all day long and never getting anything accomplished!  The managers all walk around pretending to work instead of helping the associates when theyre swamped with work! To many Chiefs and not enough Indians!"
good,"From start to finish you are going non-stop most days. This is a good thing as your time goes by faster. You are always learning something new. There are videos to watch and learn from and you can ask your supervisor if you need help or do not know how to do something. It is fun meeting new people. It is also fun working with most of the co-workers there. There is always something to do, which is what I like. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. The hardest part of the job is the feeling of having to be in two places at once. The stress of having too many tasks at once , wanting to do your best and helping the customer with what they want and need. It is difficult when you have been busy your whole shift and the tasks were not all completed."
good,walmart is a great place to work. depending on what manger you get in the area that you work. the most enjoyable part of the job at walmart is not that bad most days are fun.
good,productive and fun workplace  safe place to work... wage is low and benfits suck.  no future at wal mart... no retirement... managers dont listen to your ideas
good,I worked at walmart while I was in school. It brought in enough money to help me get by but I had to work so many hours it interfered with my school work.
good,As long as one does their required job it is an easy and comfortable retail company to work for. Not the easiest place to work for associates with family obligations.
good,it was a good job to have something quick until you find another job. armament was nice and everyone worked well together to get jobs and task done happy to work there.
good,"I worked third, you get paid well (third shift differential) but it’s stressful there. Store manager always yelling at your managers making them yell at you."
good,"Working for a big box store has it's benefits and drawbacks. Hours come and go depending on season. Management changes and you either get lucky or not as to who you get and how they treat their team. My job is fast paced and timed, which is annoying. It can sometimes feel like you are in high school with the drama that other co-workers can bring. The job itself isn't particularly difficult.  Benefits are great. Pay is decent for this type of work."
good,"The expectations are high, for overnight the expectations are extremely high. A lot of responsibilities fall on us. So if you walk in the door thinking this is easy work its not. Management you have some who are good at what they do and others who are there for the title. And yes it is a family atmosphere we do care about one another."
good,This job was very slow paced and did not pay well at all. low pay on top of getting paid every 2 weeks made the job miserable for me. I really didn't see any chance for advancement
good,working at Walmart is busy any time after 5 pm and weekends.  i learned a lot about the store and stocking. Working in the layaway department was exciting and fast paced.
good,"I usually had a good time preforming my job and if I had the opportunity to work there again, I more then likely would, but the only damper on my work flow would be the mismanagement of work procedures from ether recently moved managers or poor supervisors, making the job sometimes really unbearable. But working with fellow associates to accomplish tasks was gratifying and I would wholesomely recommend Cap team 2"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for... if you're lucky to get the position you're after. You likely won't; they may offer you a job in a completely different area than what you applied for. Be prepared to struggle to advance in the ranks if that is your desire.
good,"I was a high school student working part-time while going to school and playing sports which I found the management didn't consider when scheduling me. As a student I was given 25-30 hours a week which is too much for a high school student, and when I discussed this with my managers they did not seem to care. They even gave less hours to employees who needed more hours. I did enjoy working with friendly co-workers and helping customers everyday."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you are a student or just need a part time job. I enjoy working with the other associates and most of the regular customers.
good,"I would consider Walmart to be a good starter job, but I would not recommend it to be a permanent job. It was very difficult to work their as a student in high school."
good,A good company to work for. just not much work life balance. management works long hours and every holiday except Christmas.lack of salesfloor help puts a lot of responsibility on the managers to get things done on top of their duties.
good,This job will make you work for everything you can get.  It will make a better person out of yourself for earning every advancement through hard and patience with the customer.
good,coworkers were great and friendly. management never talked between themselves so everybody would get pulled from projects due to lack of communication
good,Walmart is not to bad the people you work with are good but the people there dont know how to manage the people all they do is check in once every 2 weeks and they also take longre breaks without any consequences my manger took 4 weeks off on vacation and we had no manger for the whole front end
good,"A typical day of worked consisted of arriving and clocking in and then meeting at the fitting room. We were then given different areas to work in that day. The areas consisted of furniture, accessories, jewelry & shoes, boys & girls, women, men, and infants. I learned several techniques to providing quick and upbeat services and how to handle a full work load without falling behind. The hardest part of the job would be sorting through apparel and determining what section of apparel that clothing belonged too. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customer and fellow co-workers."
good,"I had fun, worked with some great people and although there were times where I would have ripped a certain manager's head off, it was just stressful. Aside from that, everyone got along and work was fine. Pay was a little short though."
good,"It is a Very consistent job, your always moving, you have to be very good with customer service, scan products fast and efficient, and always smile and be happy"
good,"A typical  at work is exciting  you will never have the same day twice."
good,"I was fired because if a conflict with a manger from Butte Mt. bad hours and no one cared if you had family issues but it was of for their families."
good,no valoran a los buenos trabajadores que apoyan a las de mas areas  solo por insignificante error que comete uno lo tachan como uno de los peores y los sacan sin compacion alguna los directivos no entienden razones
good,Not very flexible with hours as they are done by a computer. long hours on your feet. tough customers. possible long hours. profit sharing could be worth it
good,"The typical day is just relaxing but with a few stressful customers. I learned a lot of customer service skills, how to use the multi-line phones, and how to stock candy."
good,A empresa possui um ambiente de trabalho agradável com colegas de trabalho muito carinhosos e atenciosos.
good,"good company but sometime they do not care about their workers. A lot of favoritism going around and sometime their is no room for professional growth. The pay is not worth it, I think the employees deserve more than a 15 minimum wage pay."
good,"While pay at walmart may be good, 90% of management is horrible to work for. They're constantly griping at you for something beyond your control. Not only that, but you better hope you don't need a day off or need to have a flexible schedule. They'll tell you they'll work with your schedule, but you always have to remind them of your class times or a second job you may have. Would not recommend,"
good,Walmart can be a good place or a bad place to work just depends on your managers. Managers seem to not care so much of what's going on as long as the work gets done before the end of a shift. Walmart offers good benefits as long as your fulltime.
good,When you did your job right they expect you to do beyond your jobs task then threaten your job for not exceeding their wishes. I didn’t get paid enough either
good,make sure the store is very clean and visible  for the customers to shop. I learned how to create daily task sheets and manage others on a daily base. the hardest part of the job is dealing with people who did not want to come to work like they are suppose to or scheduled. the most enjoyable is when the customers are satisfied and their are no complaints and the team is built strong for the day no call outs and no accidents.
good,"Its a good work environment an enjoyec all the differant customers, other cashiers can b hard to work witg when everyone has multiple attitudes ........"
good,"Management put unreasonable tasks on dept managers. Had to work out in rain,bad weather getting in products on trailers. Couldn't open trailer doors, because of rusted or unlevel trailers. Had to scan product on trailers with a telxon, which signal wouldn't reach inside the trailers. Managers make your job very stressful over tasking the dept managers."
good,It really depends on the type of person you are when working here. There are plenty of opportunities to advance but management has a hard time communicating with their workers. It may be a decent place when working short term but long term work may be taxing on the nerves.
good,"It's a great starter job.  Fun atmosphere and good people overall to work with.  Management varies from person to person, we have some great managers and some not so great ones."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work and it was ok, just need to give employees more hours to work and better pay it would be nice to give at least  30 hours a week."
good,"Empresa geradora de oportunidades de crescimento,Dinãmica,Etica e nos ensina a agir com integridade."
good,"Revisión al inicio de indicadores de tienda ,seguimiento a pendientes  recorrido de piso de ventas  para la apertura de tienda, seguimiento a programas comerciales, lo que mas me gusto que es un trabajo dinámico con retos diarios."
good,normal days were nice always had a good time at work with my coworkers. hardest thing ever was adjusting to different temperatures and seasons during busy days.
good,"Not much hours, but it’s a job. Managers are not caring at all. I would recommend job to someone who really needed one. I thought it was going to be a great job when i first started"
good,A typical day at Walmart is busy with customers and plenty of work to do. I learned a lot of different things working at Walmart. The management works with what they have. the work place culture is average. The hardest part of the job is learning your area. the best part about the job is the pay rate.
good,"It can be a very stressful place to work. They do not pay very well, but pay you enough where trying to find another job is tough without a cut in pay."
good,I have learned that it take a lot of time to be a manger there it was a fast pace environment from running all over for customers showing good customer service and being there for whatever they needed
good,"Anyone looking to make a decent salary. and be competitive with the world of retail walmart is the job for you. I work there for a many years made the decision to leave for more money, i should have stayed"
good,A quarter to half the time can be relaxed and slow but can change to quick pace and hectic within minutes. The staff on hand was helpful and there was almost always a manager on hand if help was needed.
good,A lot of Favoritism there at the store by management and you won’t be able to move up unless they know you personally and like you . They’re very unfair and do not keep there say and do not care for thier associates.
good,Too many managers and not enough workers. From day one they micro manage everything then want to lay the blame at your feet when you had no control over the decisions they made.
good,"Mereçe uma nota 08 por ser um ambiente muito bom, pessoas educadas compromissadas ."
good,"I found the work to be fine, however Walmart was very against working with my college school schedule. The working conditions were very draining as taking small breaks to kneel down or even pick up debris were considered improper. Mechanical errors were difficult to resolve as cashiers weren't always able to, or allowed to, without managers assistance."
good,glorified stocker....many people telling you what to do and no power to enforce rules or input in hiring....HONESTLY NIGHT SHIFT did job and was not hounded hourly!!!
good,"I loved the job itself, but remained miserable due to poor management and job overload. Availability was never taken into consideration. I wouldn’t recommend."
good,A typical day would be you go in clock in go to your station make sure your area is clean start cooking or making sandwiches or wraps. through out the day we would clean as we went.
good,Typically had to very hard to work with and I had to complain to regional.change roles too often. Russian accent hard to tak to customers and forced to answer phones. Many customers didn't understand me. Manager was
good,The work done in the automotive center is pretty simple compared to mechanic shops. However the management under appreciates the automotive employees.
good,"a day to day at walmart is pretty basic, you get your stock carts and put things on the shelves the problem is the hours were too inflexible and their overnight policies are too rigid"
good,Must have a very flexible schedule to work in customer service. Must be ready to deal with rude customers at times. Be prepared for handling large amounts of money in money center during pay days
good,tt seems that the answer to all problems is to have salaried management work all the time.12+ hours at the drop of a hat. Its hard to hold hourly associated accountable. They call off a lot and  its ok by Walmart policy
good,"Pay is decent.  After so long you get good health/vision/dental benefits that are decent cost.  Discount on almost everything in the store.   Main issue is that management plays favorites, the shifts suck and are all over the place, and they don't really handle issues you bring to them.  ANd be prepared to pick up the slack of you co-workers who no doubt won't get in trouble for dragging their feet.  And the customers?  Be ready for that crazy."
good,Gaining entry to company was easy. As long as you stay a sheep and don't make waves everything is fine. When you start asking questions and trying to hold people accountable then you're labeled a troublemaker.
good,"The Manager i had over my department would always be late EVERYDAY and then he would have me do his job on top of my responsibilities, our manager above him would not do anything about it."
good,They hire About 10 people or more every month and after 1 or 2 weeks only 1or 2 people stay. So usually there its no body to cover for you when you need vacation or a personal day and you have to do the work of 3 people by yourself.If you have and issue with any manager you have to keep it to yourself or they get you worst.  Some stores manager don’t care about your bonus moreover co-manager don’t work like they should so you can get bonus every quarter. I mean not everithing it’s bad there are some managers that are really good people if you work with them they will work with you.
good,"Empresa agradável, atribuiu muito ao meu currículo."
good,"Walmart requires a lot out of the team i was on, we basically did 90% of the entire store even the store manager agreed to that. We were not compensated for all that we did. The most you can get annually raise wise was 20 cents, that's just not enough these days. I wouldn't reccommend as a career."
good,Fun place if you were given the opportunity to work. Learn a lot about myself. Most enjoyable part is you can leave at 11. Management need more experience.
good,its a fast pace job you work with minimum 1 or 2 people on certain occasions you work alone. must lift heavy boxes and stock shelves with customers always around must be know about products to help answer customer questions.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. It just dont pay that much and they pay every two weeks. Its more for people that are straight out of high school or a job you work once you are retired.
good,"When working with the right people, was a good place to work.  As a high school student, they were good at giving me the flexibility I needed to participate in after school activities."
good,the job was easy but very slow paced. very quiet at nights and not supposed to talk unless to a customer. not the best organized but still got the required things done at night.
good,"My work expectation was highly demanding , but was expected because of lot of patients. Through the help of my support staffs and my supervisor, , we fulfilled our expectation."
good,"There is one manager in particular who doesn't care about your life outside of work. As a full-time student under the age of 18 I was supposed to get all school activities off no questions asked and this particular manager would never approve my requests meaning I had to choose whether to miss a required school activity or miss a day of work. Other managers discussed this issue with her, but she never changed."
good,It all depends on what position you get hired for. I started out as a cashier and it was hectic mostly busy which I didn't mind at all. Time seem to fly by
good,"Pros"
good,If you need money during the holiday season this a great place to work after February start looking for another job. It gets slow around January 15th.
good,pays the bills more so than other retail jobs but working here is awful. if you dislike your job you dislike your life. if you have kids and need something to pay bills urgently thjis works but not somewhere you wanna stay at.
good,"Great first job out of college. I learned many skills and the importance of a proper work ethic."
good,"I learned how to become patient, have an open mind and be ready for changes. In doing this, I've created a very strong work ethic. I gained confidence within myself to take on extra projects and learn different areas within the company. I was mentored by some of the best (in my opinion) in different area who specialized in that job task. I learned and mastered working/assisting in the area I was assigned and established trust and dependability with the supervisors/management team. It was nice to know when the decision came down to laying off employees, after speaking with management, they found it to be a hard decision to let me go and that is something that I will hold close to me knowing that they knew my worth and what I brought to the company within Home Delivery."
good,"Not enough to support a family or to make a career out of. barely brought home $500 every two weeks. make twice that now. Managers pick favorites here as well. I believe that goes on most places but some like here don't care to let it show I suppose. It was ok I guess, never anything to brag about."
good,"You can usually expect a good number of customers to come through your lane. There's rarely ever a slow day, but even when there aren't many customers, you're expected to always stay busy with maintaining your aisle and work station. And on the very rare occasion when you've done all that as well, you'll be required to stand out front and usher in any customers that might pass by."
good,"Working here was not bad, but only for those who enjoy motorcycles, atvs, utvs, etc. If this sounds like something that interests you then I would say go for it."
good,Walmart was a great company for me until all of the management changes started and some associates were treated unfairly. For examples this last year our new store manager would not allow any management to receive a positive yearly evaluation for our raises due to a single department failing at customer service which I found to be a little ridiculous.
good,"This job expects to much but not enough gain. long demanding hours, some upsetting management members and physical suffering not worth it. But lots of friendly people that are usually willing to help"
good,"no just no. "
good,"As everyone know, Wal Mart is notorious for paying their employees poorly.  The benefits there were pretty good, including discounted shopping, but the pay just isn't worth sticking around for."
good,"A typical day would be a fast pace, busy and competitive kind of day. There is always something to do. The management was good for the most part. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irritable customers. The best part is the people you work with, they become your work family and you become a team."
good,A lot of changes taking place in transportation. No more job security. All schedules are being changed and home time is becoming shorter. New pay packets do not include a yearly raise.
good,The company believe in training and building up their employees. They want to see you succeed as an employee and will invest their time and money to train you properly with pay. Great work environment. Lots of entry level and professional job opportunities. Many opportunities to grow within the company. Great Management team.
good,I enjoy my job. Do my best to make the shopping experience pleasant for my customers. Have a few really good friends/co-workers. Cliques between employees make environment uncomfortable.
good,walmart was an ok job but i say if you do like it good for you walmart was a good experience helped with things to farther learning experiences it was a lesson learned
good,The job is not terrible but I am trying to get a more stable income and schedule. The management system can get very confusing for associates only because there are around seven people who do not communicate with each other trying to get their associates to do different tasks.
good,"Long hours, high expectations, cut-throat. Regional managers are like revolving doors...always coming and going. I've seen more than a few store managers fall to the stress and request to step down."
good,Good place to work. Learned a lot. Management was ok. Pay was fairly good for a part time student. Tbh I have never worked at any other company so I wouldn't know how to compare.
good,"We did have Holiday Dinners every year. Dental, Vision, and 401K Benefits are available only for full time employees. Can work Full or Part Time, however they will not allow you to work Overtime. Work Schedules are fixed in that whatever hours your manager has set for you during each week you have to work and have to always ask for more hours each scheduled week to your respected manager."
good,I was fortunate enough to have a great management team after my first 5 years with the company.  The transportation department has been a great place to work.
good,Walmart is a company that a high school graduate would be fine with as a first job and an easy way to put money in there pocket but does not offer a life.
good,"Fun management, sometimes was a little demanding during holiday season, great coworkers I felt we were under paid for the work that we did. Overall it was great learning experience."
good,My experience at walmart definitely had its ups and downs. I did have the honor of working around some very good people. Walmart also did teach me the most in the retail world.
good,"I handled all the customers , product , & money that customer brought to the front to purchased.I had to greet all customers with care & respect. I also take anything that is not purchased back & stock it."
good,"Wages at Walmart are moving up. But,  should have a long time ago. Often everyone including managers are over worked. If you work hard and show initiative you can move up. Salaried members of management make the most pay, they work long hours for it though. It is a good place for new workers and those that want to make a career out of it."
good,"The store manger says he's there with an open door if you ever need to talk then when u do he doesn't let you talk and then calls y'all in for a meeting and says your information all out loud that's suppose to be private , my assistant manger set me up to fail she didn't give me but four hours to train for dept manger and then tells me the wrong stuff to do because when I read it on one best way I can get in trouble for that stuff , I also addressed an issues with her and she says it's my fault to take the blame for an associate yelling at me for helping out another team member. Assistants see policy being broken and they don't do anything about it. It's a hostile work environment in my dept & no one try's to help me make it better"
good,Walk around and check if everything looked neat also fix  or put stuff back together not much to do but just take care of the store and make sure customers are in good hands.
good,"I haven't worked there in years."
good,"Walmart was a vary interesting and fun place to work. I made a lot of friends while working there, got along with just about everyone. But management was an issue. they also did not care about personal issues you were having. You could be in the hospital and they would want you to come into work because they had a list of other people who called off. They would also want you to pick up double shifts. I had no problem with that, but working 9am- 9pm with only an hour lunch, 4 days in a row catches up to you."
good,"This was only a temporary job.  It did not have much opportunity for advancement.  The pay was okay,  but wasn't going anywhere.  Some of the people were good to work for."
good,"I worked at the Deli department on walmart. The job by itself it was straight forward which consisted of customized cuts of meats and cheeses for the customers. Also, we had to cook whatever it was needed for the hot display. On that, we had time tags on each product and whenever it was expired we had to throw that food and put it in the inventory and then cooked another batch so it was constantly fresh. At the end of the day we would clean all the dishes, ovens and the floor so we keep the department clean for the next day and ready for any health inspection."
good,it was a wonderful place to work except for the fact that the upper managers are very uptight and unfair. they can be extremely unforgiving if taken on alone. although the customers can be ungrateful and angry there are also days were you absolutely love the job
good,Everyday is a routine schedule. only during holidays is when the stores get off routine. You go through Academy training for management positions. Overall great Moral in the store.
good,I worked full time in the pharmacy and for the most part my coworkers and I had a collaborative work environment. The store is very busy and fast paced and there was not enough staff members to assist patients which in turn led to some very irate and unhappy patients.
good,Some are great some are not. The store manager typically has been in role for a long amount of time and is too far detached on what needs to happen to run a successful store.  Depending upon his or her mood is how the store will run that day.
good,"I enjoyed my work at Walmart as a Connection Center Employee. I loved helping people get just the right cell phone to meet their needs. I also backed up the photo department, fabric department and garden center cashiers"
good,Distribution center has high quotas to meet. Can not work there and be lazy or unsafe. not a bad place to work if you don't mind policy changes frequently.
good,"It's a fine job for people who don't want a lot demanded of them, but the rewards will also reflect that. Upward momentum is slow and it's very difficult to gain recognition for your work."
good,For our area this is a good place to work. They have a set of policies in place that allow for you to know what is expected of you. The training you receive in customer service and etc is very helpful and caries over to other fields.
good,Order Filling is a very rough job. The hours are much different than they explain in the interview. the job itself take a physical toll on your body..
good,it was a bitter sweet opportunity with conflicting feelings. though I grew to love and bond with each and every coworker and customer that I had encountered the front end management isn't what I would have hoped for at the time of my employment
good,"Walmart is a good company. I learned a lot about business while i was there, but the atmosphere at my Walmart was often negative and management helped when they had time. Workers and managers have an adversarial relationship which can sometimes stand in the way of productivity, and the pay does not match up to the continuously evolving work responsibilities."
good,It can be a fun a productive place to work but the managers don’t respect you and they fired you at the first chance they get because they have millions of applicants and you are replaceable. And I’ve been told the twice by managers.
good,"If you are just looking for a part-time job then walmart can be a start. Managements are lazy. Manager played favorite, and often not doing a great job."
good,"i like to keep busy and unload and load trailers working with others with good attitudes ,i did enjoy but i left in good terms and went to work for the government agency"
good,"Good workers were dogged to get work done, while others were aloud to skate by. Value  your fellow workers, to many chiefs and "
good,Job was great and sometimes stressful on everyone. Management was very poor an people that didn't know what they were doing. Management was poor on giving breaks
good,At  Walmart you are a face in a sea of faces it is very efficient there but in a store of 500 pulse people you are a number and it makes it very hard to gain a sense of store pride
good,Management was great the but a lot of employees would not work together and have no organization. The pay was somewhat low for how much work you would perform.
good,deli job was the most difficult but we were always busy and had something to accomplish for the day. The only issue we had was the lack of help which kept us from getting out at the correct time
good,I met a lot of people working for Walmart.  It was a very fast-paced job.  I liked working with my other coworkers. I learned to pace myself with the way the work pace was at Walmart.
good,I have been working for walmart for 3 years. As long as I have been there I have seen major transformations in the company ranging from emploment personel to closing of stores. Working for this company is benefical in regards to work ethics but personally it could be better in how the employees are treated in regards to their work history.
good,Many managers are risk averse and do not have technical expertise for the decisions needed to compete with Amazon and become a technology company which is the current focus of the company.
good,Walmart is a fair place to work at..Very stressful..Your over worked for what they pay you..There is no training..Have to mostly learn yourself...Very little team work
good,"As a place to work for a paycheck, it's very good. for a career? not so much unless you plan to join management. Each store is different as far as culture goes, i was lucky in that both stores i worked at had good employees and decent management."
good,I would recommend working here if you like to keep to yourself and be relaxed. It's a good place to make a extra money when it will never be busy either.
good,I worked on the 2nd shift in stock. so it was mainly just unloading the trucks that came in the afternoon and later that night.
good,"As an employer Walmart is all about Walmart.  Walmart put out a article that their associates  average wage would be $15 per in 2015.  Check it out.  We are not there by any means.  "
good,"This is only to the walmart i worked at, I was always being disrespected and they ended up at the end of working there they cut my hours. Any other Walmart is fine with me"
good,"Working 10+ hours, stayed on your feet the whole time excluding breaks and lunch. Favoritism is played largely, learned how to drive an RC standup series forklift. Hardest part was graveyard shift."
good,"Fast paced, stressful. Never enough associates so there was always room for improvement in the store and too much stress put on the associates that were available to work. Much of the management did not know how to be a manager. At one time shortly after I started working for Walmart I was yelled at for doing something I had no idea I was not supposed to do and the  manager's assistant sounded off right behind her. This was in front of other associates, customers, anyone in ear's shot. This is typical of any day."
good,"Un travail d'equipe quand meme assez present, des supervisieurs qui connaissent bien leur travail."
good,"Nice place to work, other than having to work at night.  I was hired as part-time but worked 40 or more hours per week on a regular basis.  Working with computers was along the lines of my previous job."
good,a typical day at work - very busy
good,"It was an okay place to work. We were not allowed to go out of our designated areas. They did however, work with you they took the time to listen though they did not do much about it"
good,"I like the store manager, but everyone else was not good to work with as far as other manager roles.  Walmart is not for their associates and it is a cutthroat company."
good,"It is what you think working at Walmart entails. It does offer some good job advancements, although I'm just working there as I go to school as well. Not very much hours at the moment. Always hiring though."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart and my co-workers and managers were great. However the higher up managers constantly mismanaged and made the work place toxic. Most days would be fine but the days where the higher ups would corner me and yell at me would stay way longer than the good ones."
good,"Ok place to work "
good,Definitely isn't a place to grow in unless you can get in a manager position and even they aren't paid as much as they should with the amount of stress they take on.
good,"Great staff.Micro managing too much. Too many managers. Communication between front end and backstage breaks down."
good,most Managers is terrible... its the who you know game when it comes to promotions benefits are okay.. but its retail so go into it with that thought... hard work rarely gets notice and expect referrals and coaching for problems that goes beyond your control
good,If you’re scheduled to work they expect you to be there.   They do not like for you to call in to be off if you’re on the schedule.    You get an annual assessment and most times a slight payraise.   You can advance their but sometimes they only want to advance who they choose.
good,"Working at Wal-mart for the first was fun and an okay place to work for, but then we were getting time for putting out stock and cleaning our work area."
good,Good place to begin the journey of having a real job. Staff were like family. Met some amazing customers. Days went by fast due remaining busy and focused.
good,"i have crossed train in cart and people greeting. "
good,"Working at Wal Mart is not very easy, especially on 3rd shift. Everything is basically stocked at night. The supervisors are usually arrogant, young and do not have a clue about their job"
good,I enjoyed the job I was placed in. The management on the other hand were more interested in favoritism than professionalism. Very high turn over rate.
good,long hot hours in very fast paced/production environment with no production based pay. Loading and unloading trucks at 900-1000 cases an hour get coached if don't make production
good,"You get to work with various types of people from customers to associates. Advancement can be accomplished from hard work. You will spend many long hours in difficult stores, which do not pay for added responsibilities."
good,"Was a nice place to work for a time, but there revolving door policy with employee and inability to maintain good team members for long periods of time lead it to be a wash with new faces every month and no major reward for your experience and knowledge."
good,its a great place to work just have to focus on work and organization to keep the customers in an safe and comfortable environment to shop. I would recommend
good,"Empresa boa, mas esquece um pouco de olhar melhor para os funcionarios."
good,"The company used to be a great place to work for but then they started worrying about profits more than their associates."
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work....   As long as you work was satisfactorily performed, you were allowed to work independently. Your work product determined your pay and continued employment, which was entirely satisfactory to me."
good,"Working at Walmart is something that is bitter sweet. The pay was good but with the amount of stress you had to put up with it was not worth it. Management is poor and or picks favorites, if you leave on good terms you still cant come back no matter what they say to you prior. Its a very cut throat place don't say something unless you want every one to know about it ."
good,"Low wages, poor customer service, and no rights for employees. Jobs here are tough, but as far as having a job they are easy to find here. Work is work, when needed Walmart is a good job to work for a short time."
good,"supervisors are awful, work is fast paced and you get paid incentive. If you decide to change posistions, they dont even train you for that new position they expect you to know everything on your own and if you dont they fire you like nothing."
good,Overall good experience.well liked associates and staff and pleasant working environment and wonderful discounts and hoilday get togethers. I enjoyed the time there.
good,Too much like high school. Great for college kids. My manager was great. An interesting mix of personalities. I worked during the evenings in the summer and there was always a high volume of customers and there was always something to do.
good,"i would have to say that working in the TLE is fairly busy work you are not wearing just one or two hats.  being a TLE associate is like wearing four to five hats ranging from,  stock-man, cashier, customer service, service writer.  seems the rest of the store doesn't give respect to the TLE areas and tends to put more demand on the performance of the TLE associates no matter if lacking in numbers and man power."
good,"Good bunch of guys i work with. I have really enjoyed working here until recently. Now they are constantly changing everything. Work schedule, froze my pay so i wont get an increase! No chance of promoting within the company."
good,"typical retail job, enjoyed working there, very team oriented. But again, Walmart will always be Walmart when it comes to cutting corners and cutting the fat."
good,"There are many positions available and they all have different duties.Walmart strongly believe in customer service and sure things run smoothly.The hardest part is being on the floor and handling task while also taking care of customers, time management is very important."
good,"Walmart is trying so desperately to beat Amazon, rather than compete with them. They are very delusional in their tactics and expectations that it sets their people up to fail."
good,"Training within the assigned department by key lead employees really provided me with proper procedures and expectations quickly.  Not all departments have cross training, but is something that helped me to be well versed to assist with daily activities when understaffed on the Sales floor.  "
good,"Working at Walmart is what you expect of... well working at Walmart."
good,"If you are a people person then being a front end associate ( cashier, people greeter, self checkout host.) "
good,"Very low pay and little to no raises. Great for flexibility. But mostly part time hours. Managers seem to know very little about the structure if the company but the co workers are great to work with,"
good,"Good starter job for someone looking to branch into the world of retail customer service. my tenure with walmart has provided me with the many different aspects of a retail store up to and including: learning the inventory process, reading labels and helping customers with their needs"
good,Wal-Mart compensation was not where it should be for the volume of work Cake Decorators had to deal with. My store was so busy we couldn't afford to have weekends or holidays off. I world with 3 very skilled decorators who they refused to give raises for what we produced and all 3 left. At the time they did give yearly bonuses based on how well the store did that year. Not sure what they do now.
good,The job was fun and challenging. People were nice to work with. The management though had poor communication with themselves and those working beneath them.
good,"Working at Walmart DC is a day to day activity. Every day is different, but most days are fast paced and quite often stressful. production requirements are fair for the most part, but management focus on them and over bearing stress on safety tends to lead to stress filled work days."
good,bonne esprit d'équipe mais pour initier un nouvel employé note de 0/10 exemple: première journée de travail un autre employé a du faire du temps supplémentaire pour me montrer les base ensuite je n'ai jamais eu de formation par les gérants
good,"The management doesn't really care about their employee's. Worked hard, with little reprieve. Always something done wrong, never seemingly good enough. Benefits of being a rather large company is the only good aspect for the small fry."
good,"Work was fairly average in workload on weekdays, not incredibly busy with enough time in between peak hours to take care of other duties."
good,"Typical day at work was signing in to computer, check emails throughout the day and process invoices and other tasks that were assigned. Task weren't difficult when I originally started. Takes anywhere from 3 to 6 months to grasp everything and be comfortable with what you are doing. But there were constant changes that seemed unnecessary throughout me being employed there, which made it stressful and tedious. Most of the managers there weren't much help and how much help you received was mostly based off of favoritism. Advancement was sparingly and if a position was available within the last few months it was due to others being let go due to not meeting production standards or attendance. Seen a lot of employees come and go...Quickly!  Overall it was a decent job..met a handful of nice co-workers that were like family to me. The hardest part was keeping up with production. Adapting to change is reasonable but adapting to constant change with confusing aspects is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  The provided training wasn't 100% helpful..Most would be confused and had to depend on others until you got the hang of it."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, met a lot of new people, I enjoyed the experience as a Walmart employee. I definitely look forward to going back, I enjoyed my job."
good,"Recebimento e controle de estoque, atividade relacionada também com analise de sistema."
good,I currently work here. Any one can get a job here. Depending on what department you are in there might be advancement or not. My boss doesn't care if anyone works but the people who do work do not get compensated for it.
good,"Just like anything else, you get out what you put in and who you have around you. In my roles with the company I had the opportunity to develop my public speaking, ability to manage multiple deadlines and objectives, and manage teams while also doing our best to take care of our customers. Don't be surprised though if the 10-hr scheduled day for salary turns into 12...or 14. The overall culture of the company is easy to see online and in PR, but what it really boils down to is the store manager, market manager, and the overall climate of the store at that time --- it can fluctuate in only a few years depending on the leadership."
good,Ok place to work. night shift was tough. management is not always honest about work opportunities and not good with communications. Coworkers are good people.
good,oportunidade de crescimento mais demora muito para que o funcionário seja visto na empresa
good,"Typical day includes conference calls, meetings and email.  Many projects are moving at the same time.  The hardest part of the job is including all the cross functional people to ensure transparency across all areas. The most enjoyable part is visiting the stores and teaching and training the associates"
good,"it was cool starting. i did online training and remodeling at a different location then when school started i became part time. it was a good start but then management and customers kind of got me unhappy and i had to do things i didnt want to, like register. management got annoying. i loved being on the floor just i didnt like register. it was almost trapping. and also working really long hours on register. co workers were cool to work with though."
good,"I go in and do my job until it is time to clock out.  I enjoy the work I do there,  I have learned alot about food retail.  Management is fare.  Most of the employees seem to work well together."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Job security is better at Walmart."
good,"I worked there when the salaries were at a minimum. Raises were only twenty cents, forty cents, or sixty cents once a year.  Overnight they practically turn the air conditioning  almost off. The heat is overwhelming in the summer. Thermostat is in Bentonville, AK."
good,As a stocker you do the same thing every day. It is not hard by any means. The management is the draw back. Managers compete almost against each other rather than work as a team.
good,Enjoyed maintenance & produce dept. jobs. Even enjoyed meat dept. Because of the rushed time & having to stock various departments each shift there was never 100% quality.
good,"I have worked for Walmart for twenty years. There is no typical day working in a super center. I carried myself as always being the manager that I wished I had going through the levels. I never forgot where I came from. I love to teach and train. You can not teach passion to do a good job, however if you have an associate that has that you can teach them processes. The hardest part of my job is knowing where to cut the day off and begin tomorrow. I always want to finish all projects and there are times when you need to stop and plan where to pick up the next day. I just want to keep going."
good,"Always busy & fast-paced for the most part. Never ""slow"" where you are not working. The other employees make it better. Some customers are extremely hostile, while others are the opposite."
good,"My co-workers were all wonderful. The job, itself, wasn't hard at all. It's repetitive and detailed type of work that most people can catch onto fairly easy. Management was overworked to the max. They were always exhausted and therefore crabby and testy. You could always tell when the bigwigs had been there for a visit because they were even more stressed out and annoyed. If it had been just the job and my co-workers I might still be there. But of course there was very little wage advancement as well."
good,Pay is good. Managers favor employees. You have to pickup others work loads & managers dont bat an eyelash. Needed to switch shifts but they didnt care to switch it.
good,"Its not a horrible place to work. most employees are easy to get along with, what makes this place unbearable are the customers. Management is ok depending on who youre dealing with."
good,"The employees were a joy to work with"
good,"I just worked in the apparel sales department.  I stocked, cleaned, helped customers find the right apparel, answered all the incoming phone calls and transferred them where they needed to go and ran the dressing room."
good,"Stay focused. Promotions come easy to those who are dependable and reliable. Walmart offers a great benefit package and gives great job security. However, work life balance is horrible."
good,"To be honest I worked at Walmart for such a short time ago, and so far back I have no solid memories of when I worked at Walmart and I won't lie to make up a review over something I do not recall."
good,This is a salaried position.  It is about a 50+ hour work week. Honestly the amount of work needed to be done needs about 70+ hours of in store work hours to legitimately get the job done. This ia applicable to most salaried positions in the work world. The departments seek  quality people in order to run it properly.  This job is best for an employee who has worked their way up knowing the policies of Walmart.
good,"The job was nice because you were basically by yourself all day as a cashier, but when you needed help they weren't as willing to help (managers) I usually had to ask a co-worker how to do things."
good,"Alguns funcionários eram tratados de forma melhor pela gerencia e por alguns outros associados principalmente durante premiações, dei treinamento na empresa e quando podiam não deixavam a gente crescer de cargo na empresa."
good,"work your processes daily"
good,"I had to handled  430 case an hour. the job was hard.did not get payed for not meeting  production; but got wrote up for not meeting "
good,Good place to start working to get you ready for future employment. Learned a lot about local produce and tips and tricks in the produce industry and field.
good,"I worked in the bakery as a Christmas temporary employee. I was expected to close at night, not leaving until 10 pm and then expected to be back on some days as soon as 5 AM.You may never ever work over 40 hours a week, so instead of letting you leave a hour early with this issue, they make you take a 2 hour lunch break instead. The competitive people there are not all good people. At Christmas the food we were able to have by them for lunch was horrible with nothing even for dessert. When it was time for me to move on to my job offer I had after  Christmas, the manager got angry and I would think gives me a bad reference. I was not supposed to give but a few days notice."
good,The globe-striding colossus that needs no introduction. I work on the logistics side of the operation wherein I'm paid just enough to endure the spiritually empty monotony of fully Taylorized capital in action.
good,"The job its self was fine. I enjoyed working as a cashier and most of my associates were nice. However, there were a few communication problems with my managers."
good,"Fast paced work environment with management wanting employees to stop in the middle of one assignment to attend to another."
good,This job requires you to work under production standards. You are required to meet those production standards
good,"Enjoyable work most of the time. Understaffed a lot of the time which"
good,"Working at walmart is always nice and fun, there is a lot of stuff to learn and very friendly people on the workplace. Very neat and clean place to work and well organize."
good,as a Produce associate the day were very busy keeping stock a rotating the bins heavy cleaning and re stocking all day made the shift go by quickly but very hard work
good,"Walmart is a very fast-paced environment with constant changes on a daily basis. Ability to multi-task while providing prompt customer service with a diverse clientele. Walmart provides on-the-job training in and outside of the location, with hands-on learning. Very loyal and attentive associates willing to go above and beyond when necessary. The scheduling can be very difficult to maintain a positive work/ home balance, but with critical thinking, it can be done with success. The customers can be very difficult to manage, but rewarding when done. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling aspect, with long work weeks, sometimes working 7+ consecutive days, with short relief in between. The most enjoyable part of the day comes from happy associates and customers. Walmart can be rewarding with associate and manager bonuses, including recognition."
good,Fair compensation and work environment in the group I worked in; certain policies are way too strict and there is no forgiveness when honest mistakes are made
good,"there is lots to do and lots to learn, very fast paced, there was always something to get done and something to learn, from stock to customer service."
good,"Walmart was a somewhat decent place to work: in my experience it was just a job to get me through school. They worked well with my ever changing work schedule, and were always understanding."
good,the experience working for Walmart is different for everyone. I on the other hand had a terrible experience. Managers giving nearly impossible goals. Put to job tasks I wasn’t trained for and being discriminatory against my mental health and physical health issues.
good,"Walmart is a typical job, but you are able to advance more which is nice.  Overall I didn't having many complications with them. Its definitely a place to go when in need of a job"
good,Needs more appreciation for employees and organization.. Benefits were awesome...Schedules varied from day to day. ...................................
good,A typical day at work would be ringing up customers items using a scanner. Collect customers form of payment. Work place culture not so much. Locals were our normal customers .
good,"Walmart is a good place to start if needing more job experience without getting paid minimum wage, some of the managers were SUPER understanding and the others were not, there was 50/50."
good,"Walmart has a casual work environment, I wouldn’t say stress free due to the occasional angry customer. But overall not a bad job option, especially if you are attending school because they can work with school schedules"
good,"This job was just unfulfilling and boring. it drained me and caused more stress then good. I would clock in, bring inside some carts, take a short break, and then go back out and bring in some more carts, and then clock out. it was unfulfilling and soul draining and I did not like it."
good,"I learned the second time at Walmart that one should keep his or her job once you get full time employment. I started again at Walmart and got 34 hours a week to start with, then I was bumped down to 2 hours a week!"
good,"Walmart was an okay place to work. You work at your own pace, you're not rushed to finish and its really laid back. Overall it was a decent place yo work"
good,"Spend 3/4 of the day unloading trucks and helping unload food truck if necessary, the other 1/4 is spent pulling the merch to the sales floor and then helping stock till its time to leave. Management is relatively lax as long as the work is done right they don't care."
good,"Good place to work if you don't have family. Long hours with good pay. Work on improving profit and loss, scheduling, planning for events and helping customers."
good,The hours for the job were not ideal for someone who wants to go back. To school and work a full time job. Job became to demanding of time and this is me choosing me.
good,"I would recommend this job if you are single and do not have a family. Yes, they do give you the discount around holiday time for you and your family. Work life balance just doesn't work out, no opportunity for career advancement."
good,Walmart provides opportunity for advancement however the work environment is changing.  The ability to balance work and life is becoming increasingly difficult due to job function and company direction.
good,"A typical night at work included a meeting at the beginning of the shift to outline the plan for the night and to get your assignments for the night.  After that everyone went to their assigned areas and began processing freight.  Work was fast paced most of the time, with occasional slow nights.  The hardest part of the job was getting all the merchandise on the shelf before our shift was over, especially during overtime freezes.  The workload is incredibly heavy during the holidays, as was expected.  The best part of working there were the other employees at night.  We created a family away from home there and it was always pleasant to talk with them during our breaks."
good,"I have been working at Walmart full-time (More than a year)"
good,The job is OK for those looking to get their foot in the door of a retail industry and possibly looking to be a manager of a retail store... However that being said most of the managers at Walmart  Are unfair...  Awful customer base.. awful team members... Awful raises
good,my work experience at walnut was a good experience .  The CSMs would be fair most of the time but they were also rude to me at times . Although I sometime had a hard time communicating with my supervisors it was a good job in all.
good,"What you put in, isn't always what you get out"
good,Walmart has given me the opportunity to grow as much as I wanted to within the company. They were fair about my schedule while attending school.I would recommend this company to any students looking for a decent job.
good,"It's a very fast paced job.  You must make certain that you keep the lines flowing so that the customers don't get angry and leave the store.  You need to pay attention to both receiving and giving money.  Customers pay with cash, debit, credit or check writing, and with Walmart Pay.  You get to meet all kinds of people every day.  You learn which are the best selling items in the store.  We are expected to provide excellent customer service. and to understand how the warranties work.  "
good,While working I did not enjoy the management or my position. Had to spend a lot of time in the freezer or the dairy cooler. Had to find space for items to go on shelves when there was no space at all.
good,Working at Walmart is ok as long as no-one is harassing you. They say that they have zero tolerance for any kind of harassment but when you report it they make you look like the bad guy
good,Very fast paced work environment.  Many associates are very eager to teach. Upper Management leaves much to be desired.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers demands.  the most enjoyable part is actually meeting those demands.
good,Working at Walmart was stressful because management was never on the same page. Management was just unorganized. I enjoyed my coworkers and the atmosphere.
good,"Over my almost 15 year with the company I have seen many changes throughout the company's structure and culture.  Beginning my career at Sam's Club was an immediate exciting and educating experience.  There were clear exceptions as well as a clear understanding to a future career path.  Over the years the company became more structured in which the Home Office began to initiate daily routines, automated scheduling and direct communication for merchandising.  The culture over the past decade has changed tremendously disallowing the Management Teams to make decisions that would benefit each particular store to better fill the needs of our local customers.  Overall I enjoyed my time with Walmart Stores Inc.  I am well versed in Customer Service, Training, Human Resources, Merchandising, Accounting, Replenishment etc."
good,It was a very fun experience. I saw all walks of life come through my line. I made friends and the management there was nice and I became friends with them. I always asked to try new things and learn as much as I can so I can always make sure that if someone needs help I am able to help them.
good,"Typical Day at work was: Show up at work, make my own personal overview of the department and then check with department manager and assignment board for tasks and responsibilities for me that day."
good,Ahí mucha preferencia en cuanto.a horarios y sobre todo en descansos
good,"due to recent changes in with CVS, we have gotten a lot busy while being short staffed. I can be a great place to work as long as there is enough staff"
good,A typical day at wal mart sometime it was good days and a also had its bad days I honestly needed the job I was not being picky but after a year at customer service I learned not everyone is nice and I rather not work in retail anymore
good,Secure employment but crazy hours.  Works every holiday and most weekends.  Sometimes work overnight hours and long hours.  Not your typical Monday through Friday job.
good,"It is one supervisor after another yelling nine different duties and all with the same priorities and time frame to be completed."
good,"Management here is poorly educated which leads to bigger issues in the running of this facility. If you're working during the day, they will pull you off the floor and make you unload freight from trailers but they will not reimburse you accordingly for this physical labor. At night they will pull you off the floor and make you pull pallets out to the various departments, sometimes working all alone and eating up a good 3 hours of your time which gets you in trouble the next morning when your department manager is upset at poor zoning. Be cautious working here and do NOT pull pallets if you were hired to run a register. If you comply with them the first time they will sniff you out like a bloodhound and work your ttub off without increasing your pay. You may be hired to work the TLE counter but you'll slowly find yourself running back and forth between sporting goods and TLE and eventually hardware and toys in addition to unloading freight and pulling pallets."
good,one of the best places i worked but the reason i left was because of school. managers are friendly and help full. there is alots of room for a person to build his careers
good,Where do I start?Walmart is not a place for everyone. you will do just fine if you can get along with your managers. If you cant you wont last long. The managers do have favorites. I happened to be one of them. The favorites get extra breaks and so on. Now I've seen people get fired for no reason at all. you never know what you're going to run into at Walmart either.
good,"Working for Walmart is very stressful due to dealing with customers. I learned patience and how to take care of customers quickly. Management at the Walmart I am currently have poor communication and have favoritism. Workplace is dominated by some negative personalities and bad culture. The hardest part about working in the front end is dealing with disrespectful, mean customers. The most enjoyable part about Walmart is being about to take care of a customer and making them so happy when they leave your presence. Very pleasing to know I made a difference in their experience."
good,"Walmart as a company has never been a bad job to work out. I learned quite a bit, improved on my cashiering, learned quite a few stocking and inventory techniques for other jobs, and got some management skills in the process. The rough in the road came in on a store specific level with a younger manager throwing his Assistant Manager title around and showed quite a lot of favoritism to female employees."
good,"Expect to be overworked and underpaid. Can be hard to advance if you work cap 2,. Heavy work load, managers that will through you under the bus, and only can rest on your brakes."
good,"My time at Walmart taught me most of what i know in jobs and was a good stepping stone to get to other jobs i would later prefer. I would not recommend as a long term career, but for a first job/part time work it is alright."
good,"Wal-mart was a fun, slow-paced job. I rarely ever found difficulty keeping up. A typical day included me staring mindlessly into space whilst occasionally cleaning up the Self-Checkout zone. The management was slightly biased in the advancement process and the workplace culture was frowned upon. The hardest part was waiting on my day to end. The easiest part was barely ever having anything to do."
good,"While not necessarily perhaps the worse possible first job I could take on, I was quite displeased with my time there. The management's competence greatly varies as I would grow frustrated with certain staff more than others. My coworkers were friendly enough, certainly because they were put through the same problems I had to deal with."
good,"fast paced days, management could of been better, most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, workplace culture was good, hardest part of the job was keeping up with the unrealistic times they wanted us to keep up with"
good,"It was a difficult experience for me because i didn't have a thorough instructor. The instructor failed to let me fail and succeed on my own but i got better, the longer i stayed. Its a tough job, I lost a lot of weight."
good,The employee's at the Maricopa Walmart had a good sense of family oriented type of place. Enjoyed working with them. Working for the customers was great. Customers would seek me out in my line.
good,"Everyday is a new learning process, great customers and good benefits. Company has great associates who will help you improve and develop into company standard."
good,All in all I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart until our new store manager brought a new assistant manager from New Mexico. He was more of a dictator than a manager. Refused to listen to any ideas that could possibly help with freight being moved and put on the shelves faster
good,"The computer system picked my schedule, so I worked something different every day which I did NOT like, I was not paid enough, I was all over the store when I thought I was hired to work in one section."
good,"Great for a starter job. Very fast pace and always busy, very flexible work hours. Some of the management was fine overall. They are willing to work around your school schedule"
good,A typical day consist of work for 4 Hours of work to 15 minute breaks 1/2 hour break very competitive family oriented great working environment.While working for a great company you receive stocks benefits customer appreciation day I would recommend this job to many I would like to strive and exceed in the retail field
good,Good place to work and room for advancement if willing to relocate. Can be stressful due to lack of help and work demands. Sometimes communication is lacking and can be confusing.  Must be able to do many different tasks and cover multiple departments.  Management can be demanding at times and seem stressed.
good,Walmart management team could be a little more organized. Lack of hired employees for each department. Great Schedule needs improvement on benefits for employees.
good,I enjoyed working at krogers. most of the employees were very friendly. we were properly trained on every situation at any given time. opportunities for advancement always came as well.
good,Walmart is everyones very store until you work here than its like your days never end. so much to do And the store is so big managers don't care or pay any attention
good,"Don't give employees the praise and hard work that they deserve."
good,I didn't like the hours that I had to work. I am  mother with 2 children. A person needs to have a flexible schedule. A person can't have that when you are raising children.
good,Empresa con buen ambiente laboral salario de acuerdo ala ley
good,"For 8 years, it was a fun, fast-paced and challenging place to work. But in the last year, more responsibilities have been placed on each associate as staffing diminished. Such that it became impossible to complete all tasks assigned in a manner that would satisfy management. This lead to  management inconsistencies. On one hand, you are told you are going a great job, then a day later asking you about your poor job performance. Always while trying sound like they have done everything they can to help you succeed, but not seeming to understand that they have assigned more than can physically be done in eight hours.  Most dept managers are taking anxiety meds due to workplace stress. I have recently been to other stores for training where this was not the case."
good,A typical day at work had multiple outcomes between co-workers and customers. i've learned that small things can change the impact of a day. the only enjoyable part of the day at work was dealing with customers because they can bring a laugh or smile.
good,Walmart is fine to work at if you are a student but not so much full-time as they don't like giving benefits. The location I worked at seemed to have terrible manager.
good,Apply customer services and we re -stocks merchandise and does cashier in fast pace. Helps customers to locate the merchandise what their looking learn alot of work in different department in the absent of the employee
good,"while the pay you recieve is quite nice, some days it was not worth the unorganized mess i had to deal with in the backroom. things were chaotic. each manager said something so it showed 0 communication. i learned about hazard waste and saftey clean ups."
good,"Overall, not too bad a place to work.  The pay is above minimum wage ($9.50 starting out, increases to $10.50 after completing computer based learning -CBL - courses).  Coworkers range the gamut from tolerable to friendly."
good,I wouldn't work there unless it's full time. They say you will be full time in 30 days but that's not true. Other than that it has great benefits......
good,Walmart was a bad experience for me.They gave me long lunches you had to take. I had to clear all the carts all the time with no help. Management always blamed one person for the carts but they never sent help.
good,"Uma empresa que apesar de não da uma boa remuneração, ela ainda abre as portas para milhões de trabalhadores no Brasil inteiro, e por isso merece todo o sucesso e respeito"
good,Bad pay bad hours refused to give more hours. the management varies some are very nice and others are mean and awful. you have to do a lot of cleaning and some days are really fast others are so slow
good,Room to grow with company.  Many avenues to take.  Lots of options.  Finding good talent is hard so the ones that do come in with a strong work ethic can easily succeed.
good,"a typical day at work is doing cake orders for customers filling up the cake case before I left. what I learned is that everybody don't deserve to work. the management is terrible. they don't be there when you need them and when you tell them something that you're concerned with, they don't do nothing about it. I love working with my co-worker. we all have fun everyday. we are always singing and talking about some funny stuff. the hardest part of the job is that there are days that I am by myself and I have a lot of cake orders to do and I don't have time to fil up the cake case before I left. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and having fun with my co-workers."
good,"Seriously, what I learned most was how to work hard and not mess around. No time for that. I also learned I wouldn't work for a big corporation again."
good,"As good as most corporate jobs. Absolutely no leverage for working overtime, even when it's only needed for extra work. Sub-par management. Not enough pay unless you are an assistant or higher."
good,Walmart associates don't get treated to good with respect . But Walmart does have a lot to offer you depending how long you've been present in they're company.
good,"Ive worked at several different walmarts & they pretty much all seem the same, they claim to be family oriented & haven't seen any of that at any of them!!"
good,Great workplace to get your foot in the door with tons of opportunities for advancement. the scheduling may suck at times and cons can be the management lacking experience
good,"sometimes stressful from stocking shelves and helping customers."
good,"Casual place to work, friendly team members. Management could use an overhaul. Unrealistic expectations drove some team members crazy. Great job if you need some cash and just got out of high school."
good,"Walmart is okay to work at, the managers are not to great. Seems as they dont care. The job isnt all exciting drains my energy when i clock in. Beniftes are great though"
good,co workers are great. the owner didn't know what he was doing. I got paid a good paycheck. great advancing opportunities. made great friends and great Customers
good,This job all depends on the location you are working. There is possibilities of advancement but you really have to be recognized by  the right people.
good,"Providing premier customer service, including greeting them and responding to questions.Dynamically selling product by providing customers with information needed to make product-related decisions"
good,"Daily Cashiering, Return Processing, issue Money Orders, process Money gram transactions, perform needed Haz-Mat processing.  This job was ever-changing with seasonal retail merchandise.  Patience, speed, accuracy and the ability to communicate with general public are necessary to succeed in this position.  The hardest thing about working at Wal-Mart is their inconsistent schedule.  It makes family planning difficult.  Office politics create conflicts among employees."
good,Grabbed peoples groceries and put them in containers by order number. Put them away by the times the customers were going to arrive. When the customers arrived we brought their groceries out to their cars for them.
good,the hours were pretty mixed up. some days you work all day some days you work only a few hours. I just needed more of a set schedule.  enjoyed the people and everyone I worked with
good,"A lot of work that needs to be done, and wants to work in areas that you don't know what to do. Then you have to help a lot of the customers in different Types of areas."
good,"Work at night in a cooler to stock items it was ok. I would come in at night to do my work, the work conditions was ok, I did not like that I could advance to another position for better hours and better pay"
good,"It was a good experience and a learning experience, it help me learn how retail worked and hleped me learn how to make a costumer happy and make sure they have a good shopping experience and a good day ."
good,Fast paced not much downtime management was poor the hardest part was working with the hours. I was told I would be able to work out a schedule because my child was in the hospital and the did not keep to their word. Best part was my co workers.
good,"In my time at Wal-Mart, I found my job to be a god one. I stood on my feet for long hours, but the breaks were frequent. The pay was great for a retail position, the hours were set to my standards, and there were many pleasant customers. My only complaint wold be the number of customers that were prone to cursing and disrespectful behavior when the cashier was following store protocol."
good,I hated it.  Customers come in a loose hundreds of iq points. They ask stood questions and can't find anything themselves. I have nothing else to say.
good,"Structured from the time you come in"
good,"The typical work day is fast-paced and you're constantly busy. If you're not busy, something will be found for you to do. I learned many customer service skills such as telling the customer in terms of their vehicle what services were done and gave them suggestions of what to get fixed on the vehicle. Management is very peculiar on who is in the ""in-crowd"" and who is not. Most higher-up management were friends and if one manager doesn't like you, they all seem to have something against you. The entire environment is cliqued up and if you're welcome in the store all depends on how certain people feel about you. The hardest part of the Job would be the customer service. You always need to have your feelings put to the side when dealing with customers whether they are happy, sad, angry, or just calm. Most of the time, they hear a small change in your voice and assumptions are made. The most enjoyable part of working at this job was gaining the knowledge and skills I didn't have walking in.  I learned a new thing every single day and do not regret the experience and knowledge I have gained."
good,"I worked at the Taylor Road exit for only five months. Could have been more, but I strongly disliked the area I worked due to the fixed hours for my schedule and the managers. For the fixed hours, you couldn't change it to your liking. It wasn't set like doing 3-11pm every Mon, Wed, and Friday. No, it was the company that would choose some random hours which was a BIG conflict to my school schedule at the time. This also ties to the managers. No one really listens to you and when you voice out your opinion and why your upset about something you have to be sent to a chain of different managers who have most of the time aren't even present. I'm glad I left the job. Only people I miss working with was the co-workers who I got close too."
good,I would work there again. I was content as an walmart employee. Had I not had car trouble I'd be there for much longer. I reccomend walmart to anyone looking for work.
good,"Wal-Mart in general I can't speak on, but from my experience working at Wal-Mart wasnt the best. It was very unorganized because people quit and the managers were unable to hire more workers."
good,"Managers don't care about their employees unless they effect the store from running efficiently. They can be quite pompous as well. This made the job very hard to manage."
good,"Management is lazy, you do the work of many people while they watch. if you have to leave and use Sedgwick to come back its a joke and it is hard to come back even though you give all the documents needed."
good,"The pay you receive at walmart is decent, the work environment is not a fun place to be, can be slow or fast paced, you never know what your day is going to be like."
good,"why am i writing this, its walmart, the job sucks, the management sucks, the customers suck, the only plus is that it pays kinda well but dont expect to get any wage increase if youre experienced"
good,Hey its walmart ! Work here get your experience and move on. Or move up way up and your pay will go up. Seen some workers 10 years plus with very low hourly wage. Finally they will have 14 to 15 dollars an hour !
good,I learned how to be a better leader in all areas of my life thanks to my last Store manager and how to work hard to get the best results in all that I put my mind to.
good,"The job was not tiring and I enjoyed working with walmart staff.  The customers were friendly, as I was able to help them with any customer service related problems."
good,Can't complain about the pay just policy and procedures are way stricter than any other place I've ever worked stressful workplace wouldnt recomeend working there
good,I worked in the grocery department and also in Health and Beauty as a stocker. I enjoyed the job while I was left to do the job that I was hired to do. The stress does hit when you get pulled in two different directions.
good,"Most days are busy. Slow days are in the beginning/middle of the week, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Management is rude and unprofessional. Would be a nice place to work being that they pay good, however management needs improvement from highest to lowest."
good,"Physically demanding. The store manager when I was first hired was awesome, motivating with a sense of humor. The last was something I'd rather not say. He was fired. So that's all that matters."
good,"Poor management, needs to have cashiers and other employees learn customer service."
good,Walmart is not the worst place to work if you get promoted to upper management; so I have heard. Otherwise the common part-time employee is looking at a long time no advancement.
good,"I don't think I would work for the company again, however, it was a good place to pay the bills, and it treated me fairly enough. I really would like a job with better benefits, working conditions, and salary."
good,"Okay, but having worked in lawn & garden the labor exerted is not worth my per hour wages. Other than that Walmart is a very lax place to work. At this Walmart you are paid every two weeks for only one pay period of one week it is hard to live off of if you are a part-tie associate."
good,"I liked my ending position because I was pretty much on my own, I only left because I wanted to be a stay at home mom once my son was born. I wasn't a huge fan of how thing were ran there outside of my position."
good,Fast paced workin environment always assisting customers with wants and needs. Careful observation of all surroundings . Work friendly and polite at all times.
good,"To be a Walmart employee is a source of American pride. Sam -the founder -created an incredible model I'm certain has made an over-reaching influence on the retail sales world-at large. I enjoyed my time within this business but may not ever return, due to a dstaste for what I was expected to originally do under my job title work-description and ultimately what types of tasks I was virtually forced to do without question!"
good,"i worked at the distribution center money was good, people were ok, but the management. If you're not embraced when you come in they will make it hard for you to last long in there. I'm prior military i know how to drive a forklift but they made me use a pallet jack and i missed my numbers constantly due to that. I watch other people come in and get on a forklift and i had been working there 2 months before they got there."
good,typically you just stand and do your job that about all there is to the job be nice to the costumers and smile. the brakes and lunch a good length to.
good,Some days there is lots of work and your day is fast passed. Other days super slow. Associates are blamed for not making production goals even though equipment is constantly broke down.
good,"its a good fun job lots of laughter and happiness , everyone knows when its time to work and get serious. it was my first real job and i really recommend everyone to try working at a place like there atleast once in there life time"
good,Needs to be more communication. Management needs to follow up with things that need addressed. Benefits are okay. a lot of changes all time to policies and procedures and sometimes are not kept up on them.
good,"You walk in to a chaotic environment. you are expected to figure out the managements mistakes. They don't value their employees. Walmart use to be a family oriented company and now all they care about is how fast can you work and how much can you produce its like they feel like we are emotionless, meaning less  machines."
good,Stay busy and use your pto wisely. If you have any questions make sure you get in touch with management as soon as possible. Finish pathways as soon as you can to get your pay raise
good,I wont say it is the worst place in the world because there are probably worse. Walmart doesn't care about their employees or their families.Only a few good managers there.
good,"I guess every places of work has it's own ups and downs, sometimes people makes it hard for me to work there because of the negative vibe around. On other part, there's also good people that cheers you up despite of stressful environment"
good,"Too many chiefs and not enough Indians is the phrase that comes to mind.  My store locations is one of the best, though. My previous manager was the best but left the company."
good,I don't have a problem with heavy lifting but working a double truck night in a big department alone and be expected to finish and zone in 9hrs is absurd and to only have been paid $9hourly is even more so.
good,"-jornadas pesadas de labores, el ambiente de trabajo en su mayoria es bueno, el trato del gerente es bueno."
good,It has little to no position for advancement. Work hours get cut left and right. lots of drama in the work place. It's not a very good place to work. Lots of stress.
good,Walmart is a good place to work and treats its employee's pretty fairly that being said the work is hard but i have more or less enjoyed my work there
good,"As a cashier for Walmart"
good,"Fun place to work if u are with the right people. The management sometimes didnt do things fair, I would go back if they would hire me back.Hardest part of job was when u only have 2 people working it can be very hectic."
good,Coworkers are great but you can feel the lack of energy everyday from management. Which going into work like that definitely explains the high turn around rate.
good,Lots of people to work around and the pay scale is better now than when I was there I wasnt cut out to be a manager so it wasnt a long term job for me
good,"Working in customer service at Walmart can be somewhat challenging at times. But overall, it was not bad, met some really nice individuals during my tenure at Walmart."
good,"Wal-Mart begins the new employee off on watching ""happy"" lessons how to do things. The videos had a condescending feel to them as well as the fact they taught common sense: how to bend over, how to pull things forward, etc. The job entitled for robots, bland-strict needs. Work a strict schedule with no lean room. It was a grand scale business requiring robots but wants to keep itself a large place for jobs. This is also more opinion based than facts, but it is obviously seen."
good,"Was at Walmart for 12+ years, and then boom they displaced my job as a traffic clerk. The job itself was great and I got to meet alot of different people on a day to day basis, but the hours weren't the best."
good,"Automotive area was better than other store areas to work. Job wasn't bad if you like doing oil changes and tire changes. Got busy at times which is fine but customers weren't informed of the wait. worst part is Managers keep getting swapped out every few months, and some had no clue about anything automotive related."
good,"worked hours not convenient to my home like, a lot of standing on my feet resulted in a lot of back pain, easy work but boring at time. met a lot of nice people."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work but some of the workers are slackers and management needs a major overhaul. Besides that if you go in and do your job and focus only on your work and nothing else you will more than likely enjoy the job as much as I did,"
good,"The deli was a busy and fun work place, really easy to get the hang of but the work schedule was inconsistent and the coworkers made the environment awkward"
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you’re looking for something wth a simple 9-5. There are no special requirements. Its a job anyone can do. I liked my job as a shelf stocker. I left because of the management. They were manipulating and deceptive. They did not care about their employees at all. It’s a good place to work if you’re lucky enough to have good management I however was not.
good,my typical day at work is clean up because one of the other cart guys wouldn't do his job he would wait for another guy to come in then he'd say he was going to break.leaving the cart vestibules would be very empty and the cart guy would be gone. and management would tell us they didn't  have anyone until later or they would but they needed him for cashiering.the management was terrible they would barely send help out to us or even help with situations. then i would clean up the mess the other cart guy would to come back the next day to the same day.
good,I would recommend working at Walmart to friends and or family if they were looking for a job... you can get an opportunity to take care of your family if you are set in the right positions within the company
good,"Wal-Mart can be a great company to work for, the one i worked for started off great until most of the management changed. After management had changed everyone started hating working there and it became difficult to like your job. It became hard to care for your work when no one else cared about your work or their own. It became hard to work for a management team that didn't care about the associates and didn't follow company policies and procedures. Overall I learned how to use different types of pallets jack, walking stackers, and forklift. I learned many great tools to help advance and progress in any career. I learned a lot of helpful customer service techniques."
good,A typical day at work is non stop customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.  We have our fun just like everyone else but we also are serious when need be.
good,It was very good experience working at Wal-Mart this was my first job. I was working at customer service desk so always deal with customers with returns & exchanges. Management was good gained lot of experience.
good,"The hard workers don't get ahead any more than the ones who just float by.  I have learned how to bake and how to manage time, more here than any other place I've worked."
good,"It's grunt work. Management is inconsistent due to the number of people you'll answer to, but it's not so bad. Lots of different people to get to know."
good,"This was a great first job to get experience. However, there was a lot of frustration that came with it regarding management's unrealistic views and expectations. They expected you to be able to perform a department manager's job even if you were just a new hire or entry level position. But, there was a lot of stuff you got to learn if you were willing to advance in a position. Another drawback was most associates don't stick around because they just want to laze around and not work. Walmart is a job where it is very fast-paced and the will work you for your money. This is not a job for lazy people or people who physically are not capable of lifting, bending, and kneeling, and climbing."
good,"Wal-Mart is not an overtly bad company to work for. It is great for a short time, although advancement prospects are minimal. Nepotism is the route to promotions and recognition. I loved working there until my manager changed."
good,cashiering or stocking. Winter time at this store was bad due to placement of registers in front of doors with no weather block. Extremely cold in winter.
good,I fell I have had to consistently fight for my job at Walmart I'm finally over it and I cant handle the stress of it anymore. my management sucked schedules would change on a constant. too much gossip. people not doing jobs right and managers do not show professional sup to workers.
good,"Easy work, nice management, get used to the work quickly. Overnights can be difficult but not hard to adjust to. Lift and move a lot of boxes. Must be quick and organized."
good,The Wal-Mart experience can be better if the management was better trained to interact with other employees. The rate of pay could be better. I learned.
good,Can be a better place to work if management care more and if everyone would work together  working there seem as if we as workers are never doing enough
good,Management never on same page. You don't get moved up on what you can do but on who you are friends with they are fond of favoritism.I only recommend working here at last resort.
good,A decent place to work but unless you are looking for a management role in Wal-Mart then it I only a temporary job for some people.  You are treated fairly and respectfully but sometimes it can be hard to deal with.
good,Enjoyed working with a lot of nice people but did not agree with some of the company policies. The main problem is that the policies change frequently.
good,"A typical workday is hectic. Customers complain no matter what you do, and you can expect to be screamed at for something that is out of your control. There's a fifty-fifty chance that your manager will listen to your problems or requests. If you work the closing shift, be prepared to inhale dangerous cleaning chemicals with no facial protection. Overall, the work is stressful and the management is somewhat poor, but the job is easy compared to other jobs out there."
good,"The team I was on was supposed to have 14-16 people, usually operated with 7-10. Fully expected to get everything done with far fewer people than we are supposed to be given, and we were punished when we couldn't complete the tasks. All I learned from this position was that working on a team is a terrible idea at walmart, since they hire just about anybody who's willing to walk through the door. 3-4 good workers would get disciplinary action taken against them for the actions of the whole team, and when said workers went to management about the people in question, asking for something to be done, nothing would be done about it, and those willing to actually work eventually got fired or quit."
good,"On a holiday weekend and first of the month when the store is overflowing, I was in charge of three departments. No one called in, I was purposely scheduled that way to ""save"" for their goal revenue. I was expected to keep it up. Not fair, almost like legal slave labor. I've had professional jobs in health services, community programs, academics and I've been sat down twice for ""he said, you said"" kind of stuff. It reminded me of high school gossiping culture."
good,Good for people dealing with alot of people at once multitasking dealing with rude customers and a fast paced work place. Only good thing is that you get a personal discount card and so can your love one.
good,Cadena tras nacional que tiene muy mala dirección en la república mexicana
good,"stressful work environment, unhappy employees, lack of adequate training, favoritism and lack of job advancement, the management treat employees like they are stupid and worthless, constant drama between managers instead of actual work, poor training, poor job responsibility, favoritism, people constantly slacking off or on their cell phones. Management of the front end lack basic understanding of running a schedule and handling breaks and lunches. Many of the managers on the front end refuse to step up when short handed and ring customers and they constantly are standing around gossiping instead of working."
good,"Fast paced, over night stocking associate. I did not like the hours and they could not move me to different hours. Overall, I probably will work again for this company."
good,"place to work when you need a job, for mothers the just want a part time job to make a little extra money to help out the family. You are able to advance in the company rather easy."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at every Wal-Mart. Unfortunately as in most large company it is easy to fall through the cracks and be held down by a supervisor or manager who does not work well with you. Some managers tend to be on power trips but most are really great to work alongside daily.
good,"just work.learne work on floor machine placed tile ,management was ok,allright,night manger.the people you work with.going home for the day spend time to relaxed ans for get that day."
good,Overall your work/life balance was not very good. They expected you to give up family time. It was awful hours and they take employees for granted. Pay was decent and benefits.
good,"decent job while youre going to school was close to home pretty easy but managers loved to make you feel under them and get you to do their jobs, they were super lazy, only a few did their job properly, but even hard stuff was still easy"
good,The hardest part of the job is being pulled around by management because each of them has something different in mind to do. There is no communication between members of management.
good,"I would work from 1600-0100 in receiving sometimes until 0400 to make sure everything was squared away for the night shift and for the next day of work. I moved back there from cart pushing so i could move up in the company but after a  year of that it didn't seem as if that was going to so I transferred to frozen and dairy where I gave it my all, always making sure that we had the shelves stocked and any expired items were taken off the shelves and after a few months of that and not moving up in the company I then went to transfer to meats where the cycle started all over. I worked hard to move up in the company but was never given the opportunity so I eventually went to pursue the military."
good,"no manager help, laughing and playing while we have long lines, no overtime, I was took off the cash register to help csm sort their work out than they didn't say thank you"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. I really didn't care for how they treated their employees. This company don't give you good raises and to  move up in this company take a bit much.
good,"Tried to make me come in on a scheduled day off when they are not supposed to be able to call you in period. Other than that, it is a typical retail store with customers good and bad with good and bad sales days."
good,Walmart pays good but the plainview mangemnt group does not do a good job at caring for thier employees. They fail at promoting good leadership qualities and expect for thier employees to over work themselves
good,"First you take out the merchandise from the backroom by scanning the bins. Then you place the merchandise on the carts, and roll them out to the sales floor. Stock the merchandise on the shelves. Any overstock goes on the very top metal tier. Keep working areas clean, for the safety of the customers."
good,"If you enjoy having to step on the little people to get ahead, then its the greatest job ever. It's not so bad if you're content and just trying to work a simple job and not wanting to advance."
good,Multiple task at a timely manner while keeping a customer satisfaction and cleanliness. Shipping and unloading claims and moving pallets this job is physically demanding
good,"My typical workday consists of me clocking in, getting assigned a task by a CSM, doing the most I can to assist customers and clocking out."
good,"It's Walmart, where you work for minimum hours, at minimum pay, and they expect maximum results. "
good,"Overall working here isn't the worst job one can have yet it leaves much to be desired, mostly as a part timer. Your shifts can really suck and if you ever want to become full time dont hold your breath."
good,hours are 32 or less. 80% of workers are P/T. some days are 5hrs w/ a 1hr lunch? if you go over 40hrs you are written up. days of work are inconsistent and they want you to be available anytime?
good,Competitive very team oriented and family like atmosphere huge load at times if work is not planned or processed ahead of time fair an easy job not very hard at all
good,"Start the day off with a 20-30 minute meeting about managers personal lives and a quick 5 minute designation period of who goes where and does what even though you can just scan your badge and see where and what you will be doing for the day. Did not learn anything that was not specific to the job. Management lack communication skills, give brief explanations that leave you questioning their leadership skills. There is no culture, everyone just does their job and goes home. The hardest part of the job is in the middle of winter if you are on maintenance because you have to go outside and get carts that it specifically says in big red letters in the handbook you are not supposed to do on overnights. The most enjoyable part of the job was making fun of how ignorant the managers are with other associates. New policies every few months, 2% raise once a year. New somehow dumber managers every six months. Not to mention management does nothing themselves, they make maintenance clean up all there messes including throwing their cardboard in the baler. This is all coming from the best maintenance associate they had according to my direct supervisor and their supervisors."
good,"lots of customers, management can be friendly or harsh, don't like the point system for calling out after 6 months you can call out a total of 9 times then you are let go."
good,You spend your day checking out customers. The enjoyable part of your day is your fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the tediousness of standing there all day doing the same thing over and over.
good,"typical work place, hardest part of job was going into work sometimes, jobs was stressful, some of management is rude to employees. gained lots of experience on cashier and sales associate"
good,"Offers medical, dental, vision, 401k, stock purchase option, and pto time. Not much room for advancement in this field. You will get to meet lots of interesting people."
good,"Uma excelente empresa não tenho muito o que falar. .foi um enorme praze ter trabatrabalhado."
good,Walmart is very high in demand. It is a great place to work if you love to wanting to meet different people everyday. Walmart always have an surprise waiting.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart were the angry customers; being able to turn a horrible experience into a helpful, successful and happy experience to represent the company brand"
good,It is a very fast-paced place to work. I've learned more about myself personally and professionally that I have in the past. You can advance yourself as far are you want as long as you're willing to give a little.
good,"Started out with an agreement that assistant managers worked 3 on/3 off.  That lasted roughly one month, then changed to 4 on/2off.  During holiday season starting in August-December worked up to 14 consecutive days.  Similar trend preparing for the yearly inventory."
good,"Worked in the Department, Stocking and floor support. Stocked shelves, Kept floors cleaned and kitchen maintenance.Management was very poorand It was just temporaily."
good,"I was hired as part time, they would not move me to full time, had they of given me more hours they would of had to include health care coverage and more money. I was promoted from sales associate to sales coordinator in jewelry. The promotion only increased my pay 10 cents an hour, which was not a lot given the increase in responsibility. "
good,"good work place"
good,"Couldn't get proper training for department manager position, was always getting pulled to help check. Took over department after three months of no one working it. Had no training still made profit.!"
good,"Fast paced, but we quick at what you are told to do and do it in a timely=ly manner the correct way while still providing customer service working as a team is very important."
good,"The lack of pay and management skills, very disrespectful to not only the other employees but to the cumstomers as well. I want to further my career and learning from this envoriment is not he right for me."
good,"Walmart is one of those places you don't REALLY want to work at, unless you have to. It was my first job that wasn't just a seasonal job, and for the first few years I enjoyed it."
good,"The lack of management and organization is unbelievable. It's messy, chaotic, and not to mention management is every big on favoritism. People are not always treated fairly"
good,"Very bad experience and I wouldn’t recommend none of my friends or family to work there, very unprofessional and in experience managers they don’t train managers their."
good,"an okay place to work... depending on management.. some like to play the favoritism game towards lazy workers for some reason.. kind of unethical."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart has been educational. I learned about the eye glass industry and how to help patients pick out and order glasses."
good,"Friendly environment with competitive workers. Everything was fast paced but enjoyable, instructions could've been a bit clearer. Overall a great experience through it all"
good,"Management was very poor, some very ignorant people. The work was easy and employees were nice to work with tho. Managers would tell you one thing then would get mad when you went to go do what they asked for you to do.  Bad communication between everyone."
good,I worked graveyard shift overnights stocking all freight in several departments to have the stores products on the shelves and ready for sale to our customers
good,I like working at walmart. I met a lot of people who I can call family and some friends I hang out with on the weekends or on my days off. Some of my managers make my day when im feeling down.
good,"I advanced early as a CSM because i learn quickly a department manager position was opening up that I knew about since I shadowed the person leaving, well i was told i got promoted too quickly and needed to wait... Also it is very stressful when you work with others who don't follow rules and there is a war between the old and the young cashiers..."
good,It seemed like they were willing to cross train you in other departments in order to keep you at full time hours. Hours seemed to be flexible as long as you worked when they needed you.
good,"when working at wal-mart i love it,but i soon learn that i was not going to have my job for long due to unprofessional managers and co-workers.would love to work for corporate."
good,"-sometimes slow paced sometimes fast"
good,"Maintenance associate is a pretty easy going position. I don't do too much in a shift, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. The schedule is awful, it's hard to work around school."
good,"as long as you have the drive to move up in the company, you can. there was hardly any down time. always busy which made for quick days. hardest part of the job was reporting a problem and watch as nothing was being done to fix it. the best part of the job was getting to meet so many new faces."
good,I love working the morning shifts. It seems like the later you work in the day the more stressing the hrs become. I do like working there and my produce coworkers and amazing
good,I matched the right freight with the right department and according to whatever department I was assigned to-would stock the freight for that department.
good,Does Not Pay Enough for the amount of time they want you to work.  They stretch the work hrs from part time to full time.  You can work 34 hrs a week and still only be considered part time.  You can work 40 hrs with overtime but still considered part time
good,Meeting and greeting any and all customers.  Answering questions and directing the customer to the area ask for.  Making the surrounding work area safe and secure.
good,Was a good place to work . You will never be bored and will always have something to do. Some of the other workers were ruDE and I think management could have done more about it.
good,Really great workplace if you are a college student or someone who needs a second job. Most of the time you will experience poor management but that all depends on the store location.
good,its a nice place to work  as an hourly associate but not a salary.They keep cutting hours from hourly associates and ask member of management to stay longer or come on their days off. always under staffed. As a manager You can not make a plan because there is always somewhere short and you need to send your team there to help. It ruins your plan.
good,"A Typical Day Working At Walmart Not Being Bothered just staying busy.What I've Learned Was How To Sort Things in the proper order. The management Was Ok Just Was Giving me short hours. The Workplace Always Busy in The Morning.The Hardest Part about the Job Was stocking being timed for a short period of time. Stocking, Sorting All Kinds Of Things Putting them Where They Belongs"
good,"In an average day i would have to assist with unloading the truck of received freight, afterwords i would have to then stock the received freight onto the shelves for customers to purchase."
good,I worked at walmart for nearly eight years and my experience there was great. I had many opportunities to lead  and train newcomers and lead the department in managers absence.  Customer service was a great experience.
good,"It was easy to get the job here. I was apprehensive about working overnights and doing schooling at first but has been working out for me so far. The only down side to working here was the management. Some just had a bone for scolding employees for small things that aren't even scolding worthy. They should save it for those that are breaking the major rules like unattending a wet spill, stealing merchandise, or doing drugs. If there is something that I'm not doing right, just inform me and teach me. Don't just resort to interrogating me and making me feel stupid or bad about myself for not knowing certain rules or on how they want me to do certain things, especially for people who are new and trying to learn how to do their jobs."
good,Asked to work at many different roles; challenging time management because the company requires a minimum number of hours per week (14). Nice supervisor.
good,The store manger didn't want to work with me with my hours. she told me i would get less hours if i switched my house. She also took some of my hours off of my check and when I went to to ask her to fix if she cant fix it.Then I just left the job.
good,Walmart was very flexible with the hours I was able to work.  I had small children at the time and need to be able to work on the days my husband was off.
good,"My typical day at work was very good, I just felt like I wasn't learning or advancing like I would like to. But overall I liked working for Walmart in the optical department."
good,"I always dreamed of working with Walmart, I’ve always shopped there. It’s just hard trying to move up in the company. I just wish management would acutely listen to the associates"
good,"It has been a long time when I worked there, so this review is old, but the pay was very poor at the time and a lot of standing up, stocking shelves, handling monies, etc."
good,ótima para se adaptar e ter conhecimentos e dinamismo
good,"The atmosphere and culture fostered a very friendly, family rapport with other employees. The company has many events and meetings that are fun and motivational. However, the demands of the position were stressful due to a lack of resources and materials necessary to complete daily tasks and meet overall goals."
good,It's a good company to work for you can and do have options for career advancement if that is the route your going for. I would work there again if the opportunity arises again
good,It's a paying job if you renting a place you will need help or second income or very good money management skills some of them an image management is really good and some of it is really really bad it just depends on what store you work for and some of the people you deal with are really bad but as long as you got patience you could do it lol
good,Was a good place to work if you have your corner to work in.  If you were just an employee you tend to be pulled this way and that never knowing what you will be doing when you walk through the door.  I preferred the positions where I knew what was expected of me every time I walked through the door.
good,Basic day you check the bike racks and make sure they are full. when there are open holes you check back stock and pull them and build it and fill back in the hole. Check with lawn and garden to see which grills need to be built as well as furntiure check and see what needs to be built. rest of the day is checking with management to see if anything  needs to be fixed
good,"I have to zone aisles for seasonal during the summer for back to school, before Halloween, and for Christmas. In addition, I had to bring back returns to their locations. The place is face paced and they have high expectations there. Management seems to want to place employees in places which could help improve the profits at Walmart."
good,"met a lot of cool people in the small town i lived in, good for stories and a fairly uncomplicated place to be and work, flexible hours and a varied workload."
good,"Being employed at a couple different locations, I've noticed that each store is understaffed. That results in collateral issues leading to poor customer service."
good,Most days were normal and to the letter of the job i was hired to do. i learned many new systems for stocking the merchandise that retail stores such as Walmart carry. I gained an appreciation for the work and commitment to excellence the all have for their job.
good,"Like any job, its what you make of it.  "
good,"Few things are good to work in Walmart such as working with people, convenient place to work . But expectation is beyond the limitation. Team department supervisors are horrible. Higher management is okay"
good,"a typical day at work for me is working picked carts making sure shelfs are organized and fully stocked"
good,"While working at Wal-Mart, I had many ups and downs in the work place. There were times where it felt like I was in high school all over again with my coworkers, the manager at the time was pretty understanding about things, but didn't take nothing from no one. I ended up having to go over nights because of coworkers. Overnights wasn't as hard, it was more manageable for me than day shift was because it did have less employees working and more down time to get things done."
good,"Typical day for overnight stockers at my location consisted of coming in, go to meeting, prep my area by cleaning, return carts, etc. Then begin stocking. When finished, straighten everything, make it look nice and then move on to another area that needed help."
good,"I was never not busy when I worked here! It was a very cheery environment, some of the bosses were a little mean but I warmed up to them eventually. I just wasn’t making as much as I thought."
good,It is a very stressful place to work. In my experience they do not provide what I need as far as interactions with management people abuse the system and then are not held accountable for not doing their job especially when others have to pick up the slack
good,"No matter what position you're in it is very fast pace and you have to have some thick skin in order to take management and the customers. If you're not a labor hands on person you will not like it, but if you like that kind of thing they have great advancement always available all without a degree."
good,"Wait I customers, ring up their items, bag their items, and take payments.  Sign them up for credit card and ask for donations.  Take payments for credit card, load preloadable cards, and gift cards.  Put return items back."
good,Walmart has great benefits when you use them.I do wish employees could have discounts on gas .The discount card is better used at the end of the year rather than the beginning.
good,"Lots of grunt work to get noticed just another number but you can make the best of it, no overtime, no holiday pay and not much atta boy ir atta Girls."
good,The job is to fill grocery orders for the stores using power equipment and a voice recognition system. Great pay but must keep up with the pace. Required to pick cases of food (some up to 40-50 lbs) at a certain speed for 10 to 11 hours a day. Holidays are usually very busy and require extra time/coming in early/forced overtime on days off. Currently short on people so everyone has to make up the extra work.
good,I enjoyed working with the pharmacist side by solve helping customers as well as solving problems. Other than the pharmacists all other staff members were unprofessional.
good,"work long hours in a very fast-paced environment, if you like a fast-paced working environment then Wal Mart is the place for you. Management is kind of complicated."
good,They do not care if you have family they don’t have set schedules must work all holidays it’s just a job best for someone with kids that need a set schedule
good,"Pathways (the online training) and your everyday work reality will definitely differentiate. "
good,Walmart is a great company to be with while finishing up on your next step in life. It’s a job that should usually only be used to pay basic bill being that you only get a few hours a week and it’s reallh hard to become full time unless you work night shift you are  guaranteed 8hrs shift daily 4-5 Days a week with overtime every now and then.
good,"When I first started this job, I was told my hours would be worked around with my schooling. As I began working, my hours interfered with my school hours. As I told management multiple times, they refused to change my hours. When I got my raise after the three month period, my hours were cut tremendously. Due to my disease, I have to take one day off every three months in order to get to my specialist in San Antonio. Management knows about these doctors appointments and continuously scheduled me to work."
good,It was a good place love the people the customers are great you work hard and it's a very fast place to work never really have a problem and the managers are good
good,"There skill review has to be done on the clock, that means you have to be off the floor to do it. I have never heard of a thing. You can do every thing else on your phone, table, computer but there review has to be done on there computer at the store while on the clock only. That's why its hard to find someone to help you if you need to ask a question you can't find anyone in the department. You can look around and never find anyone."
good,I enjoyed working hands on with the customer helping them find various things that they might be looking for while fixing the shelves (there was always something to do). I learned how to cut fabric here as well.
good,I learned a lot about customer service in a different field but I was not impressed with the store manager. I had a newborn so it made it hard to me to work all of the different hours.
good,I tried to do the right thing most of the time. Yet it always got overlooked by lazy managers who got set in their ways of not actually having to work. Cleaning up after People is not what I signed up for. A lot of daytime managers were reallly cool.
good,You started by unloading the freight truck and then we stocked shelves the rest of the night. The hardest part of the job was working with a bunch of people that did not want to work for their  pay.
good,planned and directed sales. greeted guest and answered customer questions pertaining to sales and merchandise. watched and recognized security risk and theft.
good,"Cashier, Customer Service, Front end responsibilities. I learned working for Walmart stores are very productive and time consuming. The customers always come first."
good,"Every day at work is similar, management will lay out your job for you to do. Your role is easily defined, you get into a routine and you don't move out of it. Everyone is super friendly and willing to help, except if you make a mistake. One you make a mistake everyone abandons you, you feel alone and left in the dark."
good,I would recommend Walmart for someone who is looking for a job and can work well with others and likes to be around people. Must be patient with others.  Coworkers are usually frustrated.
good,Es un Lugar donde se maneja mucho estrés sin posibilidades de trabajo y crecimiento personal
good,Some jobs are very easy with low stress and some are difficult with high stress. Walmart has plenty of different areas to work in that there is a place for everybody. You just have to find the correct job for you there
good,It’s an okay place to work at not challenging at all. But it’s some managers that love their job to an extent to fire people for no reason what so ever.
good,"I honestly don't think I'd recommend working here unless you're looking for an entry level position. If that's the case, go for it. I felt the pay was insufficient for the work I was being asked to do."
good,Wal/Mart is a place for high school kids and retired people to work. It is not a place where you can take care of a family along with other bills . you might need another part or full time job to survive.
good,Tem varios aspecto esta empresa em geral mas nao tem muito crescimento que oferece e salario abaixo
good,Overall while I worked at Walmart I would say the pay is at least decent compared to a lot of other options.  It can be a pretty stressful environment though at times but there are some perks to it.
good,part time gets no benefits. i did get 3 days paid bereavement. and i got pto. sedgewick leave but only a certain amount. accomodations when i came back to work. other then that i had the impression when hired i woul dmove up fast and never did they gave it to others who never seemed qualified. they didnt want to move me cause they liked having me where i was at. some managers are great some not so much. it get to be a very stressful job. if all employees dont work together to be a great store.but if your not fulltime or management its not worth the stress because many arent recongnized in there work.
good,"A typical day at work constant of top stocking, zoning throughout the day as well as re-shopping and assisting/answering various customer question(s). I learned how to pace myself better throughout the day to get task done at a quicker speed. Management for the most part was a pleasure to work with. Workplace culture was hectic with hundreds of customers on the floor at the same time, you have to always be alert and ready for anything and task passed your way. The hardest part of the job was trying not to get overwhelmed by the heavy traffic of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees you work with they become really good friends and make the day go by easier."
good,i heard it was a good place to work so i went for it but as i got older at the company they would tell me things like you cant go to the br right now.i would hear things like shut up and get back to work
good,"Working at Walmart was harsh. There are a lot of Managers/sub managers assistant managers and very little coordination between them. "
good,Loved working here lots of benefits and the managment team was awesome i moved around and leaened all types of department they had great benefits and annual bonuses
good,The company provides an excellent work life balance. work can be vigorous and repetitive. Work hours can be somewhat atypical but again there is a good separation between work and personal lives.
good,It is hard to plan out your day as a department manager. Upper management always has you doing other peoples tasks. You often end up doing much more work then what you are paid for.
good,"Got Strep Throught? Physically can not call out? You're fired. Need a bereavement because of a late family member? You've got 3 days to ""Get over it."" other wise you're fired. Get back from your break / lunch 2 minutes late, write up. Management talks about you behind your back, things that are never good. Go 1 minute into your ""5th hour"", write up."
good,"I'm sure walmart work experiences differ according to the place, but my experience, was rather negative, in the sense that i worked alot for only 8hrs, had no option of working more for overtime, and didn't make as much as i'd wished. "
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart started by stocking the shelves and ordering merchandise. Helping customers was a constant and one of the best part of my days at Wal-Mart.
good,I would recommend anyone to work at this company for the great benefits that they offer for anyone and everyone especially the insurance and the paid time off that can be used after work full time hours and it has excellent management
good,Some of the co-workers are great to work with but the scheduling of employees are sometime messed up. Other than these things it is a good place to work.
good,For Anyone Who Thinks About Working There Think Twice you will get your moneys worth but if you can't stand being in one place for a long period of time it's not for you.
good,"working at Wal-Mart has different kinds of work speeds. some slow, some what fast paced and then fast paced. managements are not on the same page to know things, store manager is most of the time left in the dark with certain situations, because other managers don't tell store manager everything that he needs to know. "
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar,com beneficios compativeis ao mercado. jornada de trabalho razoável."
good,"Upper Management could use a little work. And there is a lot of work drama, and people start rumours there. But Management lacks communication. Otherwise than that, most associates made work bearable"
good,"An ok place to work! Large format stores require a lot of dedication! No work/personal life. Work all the time. When you're off,you want to just sleep."
good,"been in customer service for over 10 years I was able to move around the store in different departments which made me gain many different skills, good"
good,"If I was seeping and  I was doing a good job I was to slow and if i was fast I was not doing it right managers were hoping for failure so would not help enough they only came when they new i was not doing something right,had to do swept the entire store swept under the shelves picked up toys cleaned the restrooms.i cleaned trash out side"
good,"The management is not what is expected. They half do their job which makes the place look bad when it come to store ratings. The job is easy as a money center associate but managers make it hard sometimes when you need them and they are no where to be found or they take ten minutes to come assist you. It's an understanding that they have other tasks to take care of but most of the time they do not even be doing important things. They will not relieve for breaks when you have no coverage in your department, but will use you to give others breaks else where."
good,"Fast paced, many different tasks, different opinions.  There is not much training available and it can feel overwhelming at first so this job is not for any individual that needs constant supervision, it is more for individuals who can be given direction only once and can be trusted to get things done on their own."
good,"very busy place, lack of benefits is very upsetting. I do enjoy my co workers and management but lack of pay and benefits is my main reason for leaving. I also feel I am not utilizing my vast experience and knowledge of medical insurance claims, benefits and coding."
good,"Nice place to gain FMGCC experience, opportunities for personal development for those who are keen on furthering their studies diverse areas of specialization from stoking to management."
good,"Everyday I would come into work and make sure that the inventory on the shelves and in back stock for the busiest store in the market was accounted for and stocked on the shelves. The lower management was good, however, the upper management was hard to deal with. They expected too much from too little staff, and gave impossible tasks to do and reprimanded you when you were unable to complete them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the lower management."
good,"Walmart is not a great option for a person to work at. Very low pay, management are usually very bad and treat employees unfairly. Don't help students with schedule."
good,I think that walmart dont care about its employees anymore all they care about is the dollar bill.I think that is sam walton was alive it would be 100 times the company that it is and its a shame that his family have distroyed it.
good,"A typical day at work was unloading trailers in a timely fashion, making sure pallets made it to the floor to be stocked and any other duties that was asked. Also learning management when I had the time."
good,"Fast paced supermarket,working as a cashier. Hours asteroid designed to fit your schedule. Has an open door policy in place for inquiries and problems. Has different shifts available."
good,My personal assistant management team is great. There is a problem with upper-level management in regards to respect for the individual. Walmarts basic beliefs and core values are phenomenal but they would work better if everyone chose to follow them.
good,"Hours were long. Work, life balance was lacking. Very stressful. Very competitive. Salary and Benefits were great. Culture was lacking during my duration. They need to get back to basics on taking care of their associates. Open Door Policy is broke. Retaliation does exist at Wal-Mart."
good,This company offers great opportunities to move up and be a part of the team. If you are looking for a career but have little to know work experience anywhere this is a place to start with fair pay and a work schedule that can be flexible.
good,The job itself as well as the co-workers i was with was great. Although the quality of advancement within walmart was a bit lack luster so i had to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"Overall a good place to work at, with some very reasonable managers, but it's very difficult to become full time there, despite working near full time hours. Part time employees have to be there a year to get any kind of benefits."
good,The job is very easy to learn and understand. Just come to work and do what is asked of you and your day will go perfectly fine. And the most enjoyable part is leaving on time.
good,"A typical day at WALMART was always started calm and ended with a surprise. Management needed work. WALMART had a large selection culture wise. The hardest part about working at WALMART was the dealing with a difficult customer, some like to get loud out pocket. My favorite part of working at WALMART was the regular  customer, they really can make your day."
good,Most of the jobs here are definitely for a younger person with tons of energy.  Long hours and production standards dictate constant movement. Some ares work a lot harder than others.
good,"On a daily basis, it was not only a challenge to delivery a clean, stocked and fully stocked store for our customers, but also to meet their expectations of full customer satisfaction in our service to them and the quality and quantity of our merchandise.It was also alot of fun to teach and train the associates of all the policies and procedures and helping them to advance within the company if they desired to do so."
good,Your experience working for this DC depends completely on what shift and area you work in. It's production and although it probably isn't your dream job you won't find somewhere in the area that pays more.
good,"It was a great experience working at walmart. There was never any dull moment with never-ending deadlines and workloads, but you will get used to it after some time."
good,"You get 1 hour lunches. You have to be people-friendly, as you deal with a lot of customers. You will most likely always work holidays unless requested off"
good,"if u like customers it was good. management was poor. one cashier didn't show up from work for 2 weeks, they allowed her to come back. where another employee didn't show for 3days and she was fired."
good,"It's wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  It was ok.  It was exactly what I expected going to the job, so at least I wasn't disappointed.  On a good note, my co-workers were nice and easy to work with."
good,"Very busy when I get to work, making sure all my associates up to date on they training, setting up orientation checking up on they background checks.making sure all my boards are done and up to date.I learn when you nice and pleasant the day goes by fast and people are nice.We have all different culture at my jobs. The hardest part is going home because I love helping people.The most joyable thing about my job is I solve problems and my associates love me because 'm the one that make sure they good, plus they say I'm polite."
good,"Walmart is a very fast-paced work environment. I learned about Six different departments because we were short staffed. There was really no hard part to Walmart, do your job and Go home."
good,Hard work but good team work . Fill orders for Walmart stores. Fast paced filling product into boxes according to orders from Walmart stores. Clear jams. Recycle boxes. Keep area clean.
good,I dont mind some of the co workers and some of the managers just alot of work they demand and dont wamt to pay like they should or get or fix the current equipment
good,It Was A Good Job But I Was Looking For More Hours Because I Lived 40 Mins Away For 30 40 hours in two weeks that were to much driving for not enough hours and not enough pay but it was a very good job to have but I need better I have a family
good,"It will be an experience that I'm glad I had, and one I am glad I am done with."
good,"La logística da buenos resultados, el ambiente es motivador."
good,"nice play to work, can learn things from working at walmart i learned how to operate machines such as forklift and walkie stacker, management is ok, workplace culture fair, the hardest part is letting time catch up with you, enjoyable part going to work getting finish on time"
good,"Productive and fun place to work,has a ping pong table,and allows stock purchases.Good paying job,with paid time off,you earm according to the hours you work."
good,Was fun to work there and made a lot of friends and work was slow but got through the day benefits were good got discounts then later down line dental
good,"it is generally fast paced, the lack having sufficient registers open most of the time. Management at my store is poor and really doesn't watch/keep track of their employees well. They have the favorite people there."
good,Management is difficult to work with most of the time because of their view towards everyone. Some are better than others. Most of the employees lack basic common sense.
good,"In maintenance you are always moving around, all the time and doing more work than everyone else. You are always cleaning up after messy and ungrateful people who don't care about you. at all"
good,Walmart is a good place to work if your needing work experience but not not if you have work experience and are looking to climb up the corporate ladder. The pay is okay and the hours are good. But I found it hard to move up in the business because they choose the people who have been their longer over someone who fits the job better (not just myself). Most of the people are amazing including managers. It can be an extreme headache especially around holidays but the overtime pay is great. All in all if you don’t already have a career with Walmart it can be difficult to advance.
good,"A lot of suppliers"
good,walking the floor  assign all work assignment to all assoc. total store operations rotated thru management hard line soft lines and automotive and overnight stocking manager and fresh area  p & l payroll
good,Working for Walmart is a fun and fast pace job. You have some good customers and rude ones but the good always out way the bad. The management was ok some was understanding others wasn't.
good,"Wal-mart like most 'big box"" retail stores exist in  demanding stressful  environment. You must be willing to deal with heavy public contact. They lean too much on computer based training for my taste. Most management come up through the ranks, which is good to a point. However my time there would indicate that most of them would benefit from outside training or experience."
good,"It will pay your bills if you have a small family.  The first year I was there, they went thru several managers.  Basically a training store.  Would I work there again?  No."
good,I loved working there till I got a new manager who’s was rude to every one. I tried moving to a different area but they wouldn’t let me move so I left my job.
good,Long hours with decent pay. Room to advance if you are willing to relocate across the country. Best 401k 6% Match.  Senior leadership is awful at change management.
good,"Overscheduled despite notifying management of maximum amount of hours per week. Day-to-day shifts required extensive work outside of my area, making it difficult to complete tasks in my area."
good,"Clock in and report to the register.  Assist customers with their purchases and would occasionally learn about new products.  Management was pretty flexible and nice and most the fellow employees were friendly.  The hardest part of the job was the rude customers, but the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly customers."
good,"Fast-paced, very busy and always on the go. I learned that dealing with customers you have to have patience. Being a manager you always have to make a plan for your day. Hardest part of the job is finding coverage. But the most enjoyable part of Walmart is interacting with different personalities."
good,Worked myself up in the company.  Used to be a lot of opportunities for advancement.  Home office has made decisions to impede that.  The pay is pretty low end compared to smaller companies out here in same role.
good,"Career advancements is a bit of an exaggeration. Management acts like children. Being a hard working part time associate I hoped to get that career advancement but when a new worker came to work with me he didn't like it and was able to transfer immediately, I applied for 8 different positions including 2 department manager positions and was denied all. When my department manager left for 2 weeks, I was left to basically run 2 departments by myself plus abit of meats."
good,"I think everyone should work some kind of retail at least once in your life. Walmart is definitely a stepping stone, that can turn into a career if you so choose. It's not for everyone but most people enjoy it."
good,"Walmart offered many opportunities to advance and had great benefits. However, the management team was not very good, they rarely worked with your personal schedule and had no emotion."
good,"i worked nights. so it was cool. there is not a lot of communication with what the managers want from the regular workers. there were two managers i worked with a lot. there was one who everyone loved but it was because he was lazy as much as everyone. the other one, everyone hated because she was on people about being lazy. i loved her. she knew who were the good workers and who werent. this job was whatever. it's just a lot of junk everywhere. it paid the bills. i didn't have to deal with any annoying customers so it was alright. there were no benefits involved that's why i left"
good,"While working in the electronics department was the higher paid department, I disliked being left alone for long periods of time, having to handle the register, assist customers and multitask very overwhelming at times."
good,"Three different shifts so make sure your time fits the shift. Timing is everything from the minute you clock in till you clock out. Must be mindful of your area because spill and accidents may occur so keep in mind of your fellow associates as well as customers that pass by the isles. In addition to being mindful of the area, you must also be willing to helping other associates who may be new to the area or new on the shift. You must be mindful of zoning during your shift as management will check in from time to time expecting you to do the work but being mindful to zone so when customers are passing by they have an easier time gaining access to the products."
good,"you have your good days as well as your bad days, most customers are wonderful and with any job you have those who are challenging to say the least, you are not always treated fair"
good,I was there a little over two years and it's not hard to maintain. It's just not the best work environment in my opinion. However if you intend to stay with the company for years it will pay off.
good,A typical day was clocking in and getting right to work. This walmart for me was very tiring. Managment really had their favorite associates who they help out more than others.
good,"es de llegar a ver la sala de venta y ve lo que falta para reponer "
good,"Walmart is an easy job to work. But the training is a little complex. Hard to grasp easily. There is just a lot to memorize and remember. Some days the customers can get a little rough. Holiday season is terrible. Always super busy, everyone is stressed and cranky and can be stressful for everyone. I wasnt there long so I never got benefits. But overall a great first job."
good,"You could probably say this about most retail management positions."
good,Walmart is a stable and growing company.  Over the last few years there has been a great deal of leadership changer which is bringing great advancements with the organization.
good,"Not enough employees to make the day go as smoothly as it should because of an un-revised schedule. I am a college student and the managers are a ware, but I am still scheduled on class days."
good,"this job was a good job. it was fun to work at Wal-Mart. the management was nice, organized, and valued their employees. i would recommend working here to someone who is looking to begin a career path in retail or warehouse"
good,"In my store specifically, we as associates are not provided the tools to do our job, but are indeed pressured by management to do tasks in a timely manner. We cannot move up unless we are manager favorites, at least with my former direct supervisor, I heard from several different associates that he only promoted people he felt comfortable working with. I only recommend Wal-Mart as a stepping stone so to speak, as you look for employment elsewhere, using the skills you gain from a face paced retail environment."
good,Working as a cashier at Walmart was a an easy job as far a customer service could be challenging at times. The pay was not a living wage. It was a steady job but little opportunity for advancement
good,it was a good place to work as just an associate but any advanced management results in a lack of training and their communication is less than what should be
good,I love the Company I work for. It has been good to me and my family. I have run out of opportunities in my current store. I am unable to move due to family commitments.
good,the highlight of the day would be the fact of excitement that i get to help out others but the downfall i would have to say would be that my over the top effort wasnt bringing me the compensation i was deserved
good,even though they paid alot it got to be very stressful and unrealistic at times. i loved walmart before i went to work there and even now i barely go into there to shop.
good,I worked for Walmart for 10+ years. there are different areas to work in a store and now there are neighborhood markets in addition to supercenters. Little room for advancement unless you want to go into management
good,If you can dedicate yourself to Walmart the pay is good and you and carve a stop in the store you work for. Otherwise just show up for work and you can keep your job.
good,"Esta empresa trata de integrar a todo aquel que quiera laborar en ella, por ese lado me parece muy buena."
good,"The employees were decent and the management was fair. I did maintenance when i worked there  , i scrubbed the floors and buffed them. I also cleaned the bathrooms and took out the garbage."
good,Being a cashier at Walmart isn't too bad at all just very representative and hours feels very long but co workers always make the job worth it at the end of the day
good,The best thing about Wal mart is job security and the benefits. It is an fast pace environment that requires you to move at all times. trying to keep up with production is the hardest part.
good,i worked overnight at this Walmart. my job wasn't to strenuous and wasn't too light. Management wasn't lenient when it came to sick days. That's the biggest problem I've found with Walmart.
good,"i worked at walmart for 4 years its stressful but at the same time its alright, the management team is hit or miss but overall i liked a majority of the managers."
good,"Walmart was once an excellent ""foot in the door"" company. It was flexible, and generous with opportunity."
good,"Thank You, Provided for my family for over 20 years. Shame for what happened and is still happening. Some aspects of the company is so far out of reach that leadership is not engaged at store level like the should be or a support tool for store leaders ."
good,"Self drive employees complete task assign to them. Provide customer server, stock inventory, and assistant in preparing the store for next business day crowd."
good,"The pay was nice, and most places don't usually give sick days when you are so new, but they gave three for the first six months. I enjoyed my actual job sometimes, but there were instances where I would be the only one on a register and there would be a line of angry people, and no one would jump on a register. So I had to diffuse situations, hurry, and it would be about 10 minutes before I had to clock out, and if you clock out 10 minutes after your scheduled time off, you get written up. If you get written up a certain amount of times, you are fired."
good,Walmart wouldn't be a bad place to work if they would be more considerate towards their employees who have sick family or are sick themselves and they would pay their employees alot better than they do.
good,"unloading trucks, stocking shelves, hours varied week to week never got the same amount of hours every week. management was alright, co-workers were great"
good,In my time at walmart it has taught me alot of social skills and customer skills that will help me in future jobs I seek to better myself and my future.
good,"Working here's almost exactly what you'd expect from a retail job.  You're either good, or you're another expendable number on the employee list.  Very standard."
good,I enjoyed my 5 years there wish it would have been longer.I really miss my job and my customers.I was trying to get transfered to the Pottstown store for three years and they never gave it to me.
good,"I worked in the deli slicing meats and cheeses, keeping the cold and hot bars full by frying things,made pizza etc."
good,"No ones on the same page, the managers contradict each other all the time. They hire just anybody. and people steal ALOT. the managers also like to couch you when ever they get in trouble."
good,"Keep in mind with this review that things may be completely different from when I worked there:"
good,"Rough, very hardwork. Lifting and load pallets by hand daily. Bad job security easy to get fired. Production makes for a very competitive environment and makes more dangerous."
good,It's not worth the stress working there. You have do everyone's work for them and get no respect for your hard work. Most of the managers are a joke. And they don't care about there workers
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. I really loved the people I worked with. I was very happy when I was able to help a customer and they left satisfied. Wish the management was different but I would most defiantly work there again maybe at a different location.
good,This job was ok. Much better than the others. I did not like not having set hours and having to work most weekends.  But I did like my job and get along with my co workers.
good,"You never know what you are coming into each day. Favoritism on the job, It gets stressful because you have to do your job and another man job too. No teamwork, less money for the job. If you work over your hours you have to take a longer lunch no overtime. They make their own in-store rules."
good,"Most of the managers were understand, but some didn't care if you were a college student and have exams or school work, very unreasonable at times. I wouldn't recommend student to work more than weekends at a retail store like Walmart."
good,"Management at the time had very poor communication skills within management and between employees as well. workplace culture was"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart I had the opportunity to be in three different departments. From customer service, cash handling, and many more duties. I enjoyed cashiering the most, as I got to see many smiling faces."
good,"When I started at Walmart, I was ecstatic. For weeks, I looked forward to the job. But once that ""new job"" optimism went away, I started to see how much of a train wreck the workplace was. With scheduling managers not bothering to check the schedules they generate, and the subsequent lack of coverage, I found myself being more and more irritated by the smallest things. Management is useless, often times never lending the hand they claim they will, or pushing simple jobs onto associates who already have a lot on their plate. Hours tended to work with you more than against you, as long as you follow the system. I was offered to go into training to become a member of management, but I couldn't stand the place anymore."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at wal mart in grove city,the customer base in the area were overall god people but recent years crime had increased and so did theft and vandalism which is discouraging"
good,It was consistent. Sometimes had good hours. There's room for advancement but if you do your job too well then they won't want to remove you from the position your in. Management were mostly good but a lot of big company politics.
good,"The last team I worked on had seemingly daily-changing priorities, which were a challenge to implement and understand. The is a tremendous shift to downsize the staff at Home Office."
good,WalMart doesn't like to give a lot of their employees full time work. They believe in you working your way up to full time work. Other than that they is a good company to work for.
good,"Alot of management was not well trained for position and made poor mistakes, other managers who have been there longer would help and understand the most. Coworkers not very fond of being porductive but it would keep me busy. It was an easy job all together but wanted something better for myself."
good,"At Walmart, the managers are always willing to show you how to work in another area or how to use the equipment on/off the floor. I did enjoy this job very much and was able to move up in the company. This was probably my favorite job I have ever had."
good,"If you can work efficiently and diligently you can move up. The only issue is company favoritism, but not necessarily a bad thing if your a hard worker and people person."
good,"Wal mart was at that time, personally I enjoyed working there the pay wasn't good but I had fun working there and looked for better opurtunities."
good,"In my time with the company, i saw many changes in Operations, some were good but most were not good. The company stopped putting the spotlight on people for doing what is right, it then became very negative results driven. I was pregnant with my daughter when we went through corporate restructuring...translation is I lost my job."
good,"My experience, at a certain location, involving management, training and scheduling was the absolute worst! I was undertrained and under paid. It took 5 months of constant calling to have someone mail me my W2s. When I would visit the location to inquire in person about my W2s I was brushed off an given the run around."
good,Overtime hours were cut down because they will send you home early just so they wont pay you any overtime. Managers rarely acknowledge employees hard work and some are pretty rude.
good,"If you enjoy retail then this is a great place to work at, they offer competitive wages and there's room for advancing your career. Workplace culture is heavily influential by management and long term associates. Getting to meet and work with a diverse group of people was one of the advantages of working for such a large corporation."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the members. The hardest or most upsetting is watching the turnover they have year after year. When there are a lot of call ins. the people that are dependable and have respect for their job are expected to fill in and continue to do their own job as well.
good,I worked for almost 4 years at this job and it was ok for the most part. I felt like I was never doing enough and when others even did a portion of the work that I did they got tons of praise and I never seemed to get any.
good,"Starts off slow then picks up quickly, long lines lots of price matching, a lot of rude customers, and also a lot of different people that you will meet."
good,Walmart is a great place to work for the only downside is with customer service. They don't have the staff to reach that demand of customer base needs
good,"The staff here made the job fun. Being able to work closely with coworkers made the shift go by faster. I enjoyed working here, but felt there was no room for growth."
good,"Will give you hours and few months later will cut hours, not only in electronics but in all departments. The management in this store does not treat all employees fair. How can a manager tell a customer after you have already worked the floats and back room, that he would not trust the sales associate in front of that associate."
good,"It was a nice place to work, but their turnover rate is bad. It seems like they hire employees to get them thru a holiday rush, then find ways to get rid of you."
good,"wanted to move to the day shift was not allowed to, had to keep working overnight. not enough raise. always low on employees. when you apply for one area you are sent to multiple areas."
good,"Walmart is a good first job for young and a good job for older people,but I have not been able to advance in the 5 years I have been there. I also work 10 hours a day and I drive an hour one way. I am ready to spend more time at home with my family."
good,"ringing up costumers, fixing/restocking shelves. worked costumer service. managers and supervisors did not really listen to the employees, some were rude and unappreciative. customers being rude. most enjoyable was layaway"
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in at work, huddled up near the entrance of the store to listen to the news and the sales figures that each department has made over the past day."
good,"The job was rewarding, easy and just the right pace, the management was horrible, most of the other staff could not stand being there or other people."
good,"Job was not very satisfying, the progams that were implicated were not properly implimented. The people were great but management was not productive in keeping accountability to the sales associates for lack of job performance."
good,"Learned to keep up with customer requests and continue to be polite. Great management, but a little confusing because there are multiple managers. Difficult with lack of staff sometimes but as with any workplace, you can find wonderful people to work with!"
good,"I worked as a cashier, so a typical day was just coming in and running the register, greeting customers, and making sure they were served in a timely and professional manner. As many cashier jobs go, it got monotonous after awhile. The atmosphere was generally good."
good,"Always busy, some customers nice, some very rude, pretty decent pay, sometimes unstable work environment, turnover rate is high considering a small mistake will get you fired."
good,"The only experience I remember from this job was that they had made take all the products off the shelves to add new to the line up, and was told I was being too slow on something I've never done but that one time. And my manager and Supervisor would disappear every 5 minutes to smoke without saying a thing,"
good,"worked with good people limited opportunity for advancement, good work place atmosphere the hardest part of the job is making sure the customer needs are met as well daily tasks are done"
good,"It can be stressful. I think Wal-Mart is a great company. As a customer I love it. As a co worker it can be stressful but it's worth it. I've only had a few bad instances but with helpful management they were dealt with appropriately. In the store I rated it low because mentality in this store is low, but Wal-Mart in general I love and have nothing against"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral ,companerismo "
good,To me Walmart is good for students whether in high school or college. you will get to meet people everyday and assist them as well. you will get better with your communication skills.
good,Walmart gets really busy during holidays and weekend. Sometimes fast pasted depending on the position you have. You have the possibility to work many hours if you are willing to pick up extra shifts.
good,Walmart is a good place to work at if you work with the right associates and managers. Only a few make full time everyone starts off as part time. You can move up in Walmart as long as you show them your worthy of promoting.
good,Position that I was assigned to was on third shift.  Position was fast pace in order to get everything done that was assigned you had to be organized. Hardest part in retail is to understand that you have to work a lot of holidays and weekends.Enjoy working with the people in worked with as well as helping customers.
good,"It's walmart.  depends on the building and the manager.  there are often many people in the building that like to cause drama or heartache.  not really like a family anymore,  room for advancement is not there"
good,"This job is made for college students that only need to work part-time.  If you are looking for a job with more security, you need to look somewhere else.  The job itself is not hard, but there is also too many managers trying to tell you what to do."
good,"Typical day at work: always on your feet"
good,"I am a hard worker! I never was late. some of the people I worked with liked to stand around and watch me work. I fixed things that needed fixed. I was certified driving a scissor lift. So I would replace ceiling tile and lights. Unclog the compactor, and fix holes in the walls. waxed and cleaned the floors. I worked in receiving, stocked shelves. I did what ever they asked me to do."
good,"Management were not fair most of the time, they are very cool but they have their days. One thing about the company is , its good if you just want some money and wanted to work, i am a college student so i enjoyed it, just not the managers"
good,"max raise is 30 cents a year"
good,"room for advancement was very good , started as sales associate moved up to department lead.  there should be more time do what is needed  in own department ."
good,constantly being rushed. Management select a hand full of people that they know are hard workers and use them to do all the work . If you are lazy and they know it from the start you will be safe . They will not waist there time asking you to do more
good,"well I was an over night frozen/dairy stocker,it was a lot of hard work for one person to finish before the end of the shift.I took the product from the pallets, separated them on l carts,then placed the product on the floor in front of the spot were it needed to be stocked. Not to mention all the other responsibilities that came along with the job."
good,"Overall, is a good company but currently going through major restructures so not able to speak to what it will look like tomorrow. There are lots of opportunities but recognize that the market is changing and long term employment is no longer as likely an outcome as it once was."
good,"I would come into work and count out my til, get ready to help out customers to cash out their goods. Clean around my area so it says clean for better outlook."
good,Due to overnights being understaffed there is more pressure on those who work overnights. Management is very poor and it needs more respect towards my co-workers and I.
good,This is a fortune 500 company. Salary low but opportunity for advancement. Retail organization so hours are long and not supportive of family at times.
good,Not a bad place to work relaxed atmosphere and very nice people just dont make enough to really supports yourself or a family unless you can work your way up.
good,"-many chances for advancement"
good,The job itself is disgusting and hard while you barely get paid worth your time. Working here is hard and annoying with worse workers. The only way to make it okay is if you want to stay there for a long time and slowly climb the ladder.
good,"LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE I ENJOYED MY JOB BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE CHANGE OF Management every 3 months."
good,Some of the stocking times at my particular store were unrealistic. One hour break but sometimes provided employees with food. Also the store can get cold during the night shift
good,"The management does what they are instructed to do. "
good,"Personally, I did the work of 2+ people daily and it took its toll."
good,Walmart is always hiring so the work is always consistent. There is opportunity to advance within the company or other stores. Pay is good depending on what part of the store you work in.
good,"when you start work,you never know just what your job will be and it changes as needed while on the job.always someone changing you from your assigned work ,to do something else for them,basically they have too many leaders to try and satisfy at the store I worked in when I quit.The first store I started in was managed very differently,you had one leader and they directed you to your work,and any changes came through them alone."
good,"Once you get used to the registers, and the customers, It's not a bad place to work. Just don't count on getting your breaks on time.  Additional training is offered, on your own time, and there is some room for advancement, but you have you really put your nose to the grindstone."
good,"Working here is not bad, once you learn how to handle the customers and the registers.  Often times we were short handed, so breaks would often be late, as it was difficult to maintain proper staffing balance to cover breaks. You have to finish training before you get your raise. but they had a deadline to complete the training which would be hard to meet when the staff is short handed."
good,Was a good company to work with but just have family issues that's why I'm looking for another career that can work with my hours so I can have time with my daughter so looking for a first shift job .
good,Very demanding.  Never enough hours in a day to complete tasks.  Always work to do.  Everyday was different.  A lot of great people work there.  Used to be a great company.  Now it is a job.
good,In general a decent place to work if you can survive the compensation you receive. Management is lacking leadership and tack. It is easy and challenging at the same time.
good,Truck unloader was a ruff and thankless job. But fast and always moving. But once truck or trucks are unloaded plattetized and staged in there zones then it slows down and have to help stock.
good,"Wal-Mart provides a team-based work atmosphere in which an individual works with a team to complete a specific task such as cashier work or a range of tasks such as inventory associates or cartpushers/custodians. Management generally provides an overview of expectations and allows individuals to reach those expectations of their own accord. One aspect I enjoyed of this job was the lack of micromanaging. However I did encounter issues with payment when hours were missed on a paycheck, and several other associates experience the same problem. The solution was unsatisfactory, as they put the money on the next pay period, depriving us of money for two weeks, and causing more taxes to be taken out for some of us because the larger paycheck went into the next tax bracket. There are issues but its not a terrible job."
good,Its not a bad job. I worked here throughout high. I Liked it. once it was time for me to go off to school. I put in my two week notice. The store was fun. I like the staff.
good,I personally  think Walmart needs to follow a chain of command when getting task done. There are to many different managers giving orders to the same person which could be stressful at times. For workers like me who like to get everything done before they leave work it can be a little over whelming if more then one person is giving orders. Also managers need a system for training managers to becoming an efficient. They are not taught how to treat employee or handle irate customers.
good,"It's ok if you are alert to customers and service which I was. It's kind of stressful during peak customer hours. You've got some customers that no matter how great of service you provide, it's never good enough."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work when you're just starting out in the adult life. They try to give you what you need but don't really care in the end. they forget a lot but if you stand out, you can move up in their business pretty fast."
good,The workplace was okay if they had better management and associate it would have been better and communication. They management showed favoritism for certain people and they very unorganized.
good,"Walmart is a Good job while in school. Very low paying, that's all the reason why I started to search for new employment. You meet some interesting people being a sales associate."
good,"The work it's self wasn't extremely demanding I could get everything done pretty decently."
good,"i was suppose to be a work inside at walmart, but had me to be a cart pusher because someone didn't so up that day and they wanted me there in the winter time."
good,"help customers throughout the store. on your feet for your shift. you may do more than what you were hired for (cashier, straighten store, put back items customers did not want, ect)"
good,Wal-Mart has become a company empowered by making money and has lost track of the hard working people that have made it great in the first place.  Those of us who have worked hard to move up in the company are finding that there are no longer positions to move up into because they are forcing their earlier hard working employees to step down and take those positions.
good,"I worked a lot of positions at Walmart, including sales, cashiering, automotive, pets, over nights, and department manager. Coworkers were generally pleasing to be around, as were most members of management. I was promoted to department manager, but had the position given to someone else mere weeks later. I ended up leaving due to low hours and scheduling conflicts."
good,Working for wal-mart is alright.  They usually work with you for your schedule.  Not much job advancement opportunities if you don't have complete open availability though.  Pay is not that great.
good,"While working at Walmart I've learned a lot about myself and the company. Walmart has great benefits if your management. An hourly associate is not as great. A lot of walmart is who you know. Other wise you have to really work hard to get noticed. I liked working at Walmart, but the direction that the company is taking. I do not agree with. At times lower managers or associates are treated in fairly. Work and personal life balance is not easy. Overall good company."
good,Hired on to do a temporary remodel but was promised full time after the remodel was over. Was actually given LESS hours after the remodel and I couldn't live on 24 hours a week at $9/hr.
good,"I needed a job at the time.  They were the only one that would give me a chance. I worked for 3 years at customer service, and 2 years in the back room. It was very physical."
good,"If an emergency happened, you were not allowed to be excused from work you will be pointed for violation against you. One week you would have decent hours, and the next week you could go down to less than 15 hours that week. The only love that was givin was from the team members, when hours were low, we would pitch in to help the employee that had less hours."
good,"You work hard most days, some days are very hard. Managers either very nice or should not be in that position due to their attitudes. I learned that when unloading a truck people should be in there own areas. The culture at Wal-Mart is grocery store. Hardest part was dealing with the workers that didn't care about their work quality. The best part of the job was it was full-time, paid at 10/hr."
good,"I worked hard and a lot but there wasn't any way to obtain a full time position or advance. My co-workers were mostly hardworking, average, American citizens, barely able to get by but hanging on because it was better than the alternative."
good,"tiene excelentes trabajadores"
good,"This job was what you would expect."
good,"Hardest part was not being properly trained. I was given some training, but it was not what I expected. I was a little disappointed in their procedures."
good,Very productive energetic working environment. Positive coworkers and HR is very helpful for whatever you need  to succeed they are there for you. Great company
good,"A typical day would involve prioritizing my work through price changes, stocking product, and following flow chart module updates. Learned a lot about customer service and dealing and delegating work to associates as a manager. The most enjoyable part of my work was dealing with customers and fellow associates."
good,"Love the benefits and the vacation time, work more hours then need to, low salary pay, inconsistency with integrity between associates, not uplifting or praises hard working associates."
good,"Despite having a loving staff I found being a Walmart cashier was stressful. I was stressed about the way customers would treat me and my fellow associates. I was stressed about how my managers didn't care for my well-being. My anxiety had gotten to a very bad point, I actually developed a stress disorder while working there and when I was terminated I was relieved of that disorder, though it still surfaces when things get bad. Despite the negatives the people I met were like family to me, and they pay was adequate. Overall I don't think it was a great job for me; but, for others who are more mentally prepared for handling a job such as this I say that Walmart is indeed an OK place to work."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Management needs some understanding in communication and chain of command, get that fixed, the job would be higher rated."
good,The workplace is not a bad workplace to be apart of but it's not the greatest either. Some shifts have great managers others not so much. It can be cutthroat at times whether they keep people because of policies it just depends. Management could be better at times but most of the time try to overwork employees in certain areas and not show appreciation to employees that bust their tail for them on a daily basis. Most employees just try to get the bare minimum because there is no incentive to work hard. The work isn't hard just your typical warehouse work in all the areas of shipping and receiving.
good,"Walmart es un magasin qui es très vivant, chaque minute compte pour satisfaire chaque client. Le magasin nous apprend à servir nos client. Entre collègue la solidarité es vraiment mise en avant, on nous fait comprendre que chaque action peux avoir une impacte sur le prochaine personne qui travail après toi, donc tout le monde se respecte et s'entraide."
good,Empresa que promove os funcionários dando a eles sonhos de crescimento
good,"I loved my job as the freight unloader and stocker management is not the greatest and could definitely use some improvement, overall its good for the pay and benefits"
good,My manager has lied on me and lied to my face to save his own job. There is in no way I would work at that store again ever. I quit upon being ridiculed and accused of things I did not do. I was personally targeted and even my own associates started coming to me asking as to why the manager treated me in such a manner.
good,I loved again working with the people there. The management however could have been better. The store manager however at one Wal-Mart did a amazing job and helped me out a ton.So did the front-end manager as well.
good,it verys per store some are really nice some are not most operate the same way some manager think they are better then most people because theyare in that position they are not
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart. When I transferred the management team was not what I was looking for. They had no interest in taking care of their department managers. I
good,They paid minimum and they want everything done and to make you help others. They don't like to put overtime and have some  drama too. Some people have a really bad actitud with others and that what I don't like.
good,"I liked the job it's self , didn't like the inconsistent schedule , the breaks were poorly given . I liked my co workers & customers . The pay was good"
good,A very productive workplace. Individual should be somewhat climated to environment. It is a very fast paced job but takes a while to change positions.
good,This is my first job and it can be stressful some days and some days are really great. But there are many times when there is no hint of teamwork and most of the work day can be very difficult for the next shifts.
good,Its straight to work at if you have the right attutide to deal with the manager and customers and workers. You stay busy working there it make time go fast
good,"If your a hard worker this is not the place for you. The harder i worked the more responsibilities they gave me(with no raise), so by the end of me working there i was doing 2-3 peoples jobs but getting paid for just 1. Some managers were good but most are absolutely terrible, in the sense they treated me like trash because i must be trash if i worked at War-Mart."
good,I was hired at the old store in 2006.  I loved my job.  Then we moved to the new store and a new pharmacy manager came.  She did not like me helping elderly customers.  A lot of them knew me from CVS Pharmacy.  They asked me to help them find cheaper medications because they could not afford the medicine.  I would help anyone that I could find cheaper medications if they had no insurance. She was rude to some customers. She gave special treatment to some and gave the rest of us the bad hours. There is to much back stabbing in Walmart.  The store manager at that time would do nothing to help you.  They all stick together.  That's why they have such a large turn over of employees.
good,I came to work there in the old store.  I had a different pharmacy manager. I loved it at first. Then we moved to the new store.  When my new manager came on she did not like me because I helped the older customers a lot.  Some knew me from CVS Pharmacy and would ask me to help them with their medications.  They wanted to find cheaper medicines because they had no insurance or little money.  Is that not customer service? I would help anyone who asked not only the elderly. If you did not suck up to her she made your life horrible. She is also rude to customers.  That's the way it is at Walmart.  There is to much back stabbing that goes on and it really hurts employees that are just trying to do their job and make a living.  That's why they have such a large turn over of employees.
good,took this job right out oh highschool to support the kid I had at a young age. Pay was good but the drive to there was too long and to early in the morning
good,This was my first job. I had a set schedule and made decent money. I received full benefits. There was no room for growth or career advancement. I found a better job.
good,Hours are decent for the most part. No benefits unless you're full time. Scheduling is fairly flexible. The only down side is every January they cut everyone's hours.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart can be fun sometimes. I loved when the holidays came, there was always a variety of foods and plenty of deserts. The only issue I had was there were never no one To relieve you from your breaks. Sometimes you didn't get a break. I had to work work full time hours, but was hired as part time."
good,I dont like Walmart because hes management has no idea what they are doing very lack of experience another thing is that you see a lot of stuff that is wrong with co workers and managers from the store.
good,Very high pase and stressful with many confusing  verbal rules to follow along with policy rules. Many threats of physical harm from customers on a daily basis.
good,"Working in the deli/ bakery area ensuring customers receive a good product. Being a cashier can also be productive being able to serve the customers, working here can be intense and productive."
good,"If your not looking for a career just something to tye you over while achieving your goals."
good,the points system is really stupid assoicate don't care about whats really going on in your life. health problems etc. they really don't care they just want you to come to work no matter what.
good,Have bills so working here became a priority and besides Walmart is good for working you like a slave and never giving you your full potential back in compensation so overall alright.
good,"The conditions of working store standards with the management line up was less than pleasant. During the longs summer days theyd give no time to come in and get a drink or anything, consistantly worked to the bone. Most days i went home after my shifts with heat stroke because of it."
good,"Everyday work load, I load, and unload trucks with forklift, pallet jack, count pieces from the truck , shock the items on the floor. I take 30 minutes break,my manager is OK."
good,"Working in the Vision Center is great in comparison to the rest of the store. You maintain an office environment. However, when it comes down to it you are still Wal-Mart and the clientele can treat you that way. The Vision Center Manager is great and works with you in daily operations."
good,I was a exciting work place to see many different individuals. The company itself isnt the best but the experience it gives you is worth experiencing.
good,"I worked several areas at walmart, which made me very knowledgeable of the area.  If I were to go back now, I think I would be an awesome supervisor. The hours were a problem from me."
good,"I started out as a cashier, and within a matter of a few years, worked my way up to customer service manager. I was in charge of overseeing the front end(cashiers). With this, I would be making sure that lines were to a minimum. I was also responsible for making sure the registers maintained accurate change and deliver or deposit as needed."
good,i found coming from already service advisor training already with sears made it easier knowing how to help the customers with their vehicle services. I learned a lot and the hardest part was picking tires out of an un orderly system where tires were put at and learned how hard it was to get a promotion as to where people were positioned at within the company
good,Good place to learn retail management and inventory control and flow processes. 70 % of stores and company management promotes form the the lowest positions of the company. There's a lot of opportunity to grow with the company. Management wages are not competitive to other retail companies.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 2 years and I can say in that time I didn't mind the job but the people you work areound are the worst part. And trying to promote is almost impossible and unfair and extremely biast. Even if you do pass the text at the interview they'll have they're mind made up already, now matter how good you are at your job you're nothing to them if you can't talk about you're personal life and spread drama."
good,Walmart is a good place to work overall. It is very long hours and you are on your feet all day. There is about 10-20% downtime on average but there is always things you can find to do during that time. There is room to move up in the company but you have to work the shift they give you and it can change at any given time. You may work the first shift for a few months and then the weekend night shift for the next few months. The associates stay in the shift they were hired for however. That's the downside to moving up.
good,"Walmart has a lot to offer young, energetic employees. I worked for the company 10+ years and enjoyed the job and the people. I am no longer able to spend a lot of time on my feet and require a job that is mainly sitting."
good,"Working at Walmart helped with my people skills and becoming efficient in to stock working, uploading and unloading boxes, efficient in keeping ones workplace clean and assisting other employees and customers."
good,I love my job but I don't like some of the manger when you need help or tell them you have issue they seem to just brush you off. that is all I have t
good,There are different mangers at different times and some do not speak to workers in a respectful way.  They want speed and quality work no matter what happens but at the same time you have to help customers that ask for help.
good,management should do better with there employees. they need to care for there employee to make sure they are ok not talked bout behind there backs....
good,Its not a bad place to work it teaches you good communication skills how to assist people and help people. If offered another job its a good chance i just may
good,"Wal Mart required a lot of work on a daily basis. You are constantly working. I believe my job in a timely manner, and I believe in team. I believe in open communication, and working to get tasks done."
good,if u have some time to spare you will enjoy working there and if you work hard you will definetely get a raise so if you are hard working and have a lot of time and energy its good
good,Its a business so the objective is to provide excellent customer service while trying to sell the products offered. Customers can be appreciative and others can be rude.
good,Indeed is a great way to find jobs is a easy site to work I have had some good interviews and all the people I have seen from Indy loves their work so thank you to ND
good,The hardest part of my job is when we have customers who must wait in line because we do not have enough help.  The jobs are there to be had but people now days just do not seem to take pride in a job like they used to.
good,"Anyone doesn't want to stay at Walmart when management cannot make a decision and cannot follow it through. As well as make unfair decisions that create an environment where nothing can change. If all the variables were set right, Walmart can be an ideal place to work, but my store was lacking professional decision-making and poor care in associates based off of under staffing every position."
good,"My opinion is that if the associates have the correct training they would be more productive.  Nowadays the training is not job specific enough.  Also, on the communication it is just not always there.  There has been many instances of associates not knowing what they need to be doing due to the lack of communication.  And sometimes it was given out too late.  Also, it's the type of communication that is lacking.  There is a right way and also a wrong way to communicate job tasks and also information."
good,"Apesar de ter sido um serviço temporário, gostei de participar da equipe, ambiente climatizado, e ótima convivência com os demais."
good,The job can be what you make it.  It is not a place for mature workers unless you love retail and can overlook nonsense.  Great place to start if you are young.
good,Not much for associate consideration. They're more about the company making money. Decent compensation. Not much availability for a raise. Unfair management.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart starts off by trying to find equipment. This is a very important task because your job relies on it. You have to show up before your scheduled shift and track down people who may have equipment before it's given to another worker. After the equipment is maintained you must get on task as quickly as possible. Wal-Mart is extremely fast paced. You have to scan every out and ensure overstock is according to one best way. I worked in the deli and in grocery. "
good,any job isn't perfect and this one wasn't any different it depends on what you are after for me it almost all the points the boss doesn't breath down your kneck you are provided breaks and many opportunity but they will work you full time with no benefits
good,"Our team was ok. Our dept mgr always disappeared. "
good,Managers base opinions on what they think about you before they actual even get to know you on a personal level. and most of the managers act as if their better then you and try to lead out of fear. On the other hand the csm's for the most part are almost completely opposite and really get to know the associates on a more personal level rather than on a first impression or on what they hear.
good,Walmart was a fast paced environment. Co workers were true team players. limited opportunity to advance within the company but wasn't a bad experience.
good,"Nice bunch of people to work with, keep very busy which makes the work day go by fast.  Management is easy to work for.  Could use more staff.  Awesome benefits."
good,"Productive work place just not my type of environment to work. I have bigger goals and plans that's beyond Walmart, I like to work in a well organized work place and Walmart is not that place."
good,"What do you expect from this BIG BOX Brand."
good,"I enjoyed working with fellow employees. I also enjoyed helping customers by providing the best customer service that I could provide. However, I did not enjoy coming to work because of the managers/ supervisors did not respect the employees."
good,"too many managers telling you to do something different then the last manager "
good,"I pride myself in being personable and open to helping others. Other Walmart employees weren't quite the same, sometimes treating others unkindly and unfairly, most often management."
good,I enjoyed my time there and made decent mony at the time. I was asked several times to move into an Assistant Manager role but declined due to the possibility of being relocated.
good,"The job is listed as a maintenance job, but the work is Janitorial. I wax, buff,and sweep floors,and clean rest room floors, toilets and sinks. occasionally fix a stall door."
good,"Hard work, stayed busy.. Associates was very nice and good people to meet . we stocked groceries, unloaded a truck everyday, and helped customers.we did topstock zoning, made sure everything was nice and worth advertising for customers."
good,"Managers aren't very nice, unwilling to work with employees on tasks and schedules.... Employees are rude and make fun of other employees for being to slow or asking questions. Mostly the new ones."
good,"Typical day included unloading the pallets in the morning, managing the sales floor, organizing the backroom and customer service. Managing sales floor include: Culling bad produce, stocking produce based on freshness, cleaning the sales floor and adjusting prices after MODS are finished."
good,"A typical day at work is getting there, and going to your manager and them tell you which station to be at. When you have no customers, you zone your section, making sure everything is up front and pretty looking."
good,"Challenging environment but could have used more positive support from management.  Stressed to move faster over pushing the quality of work. I would not highly recommend working for this company.  Used to be very family oriented, but that has changed a lot in recent years."
good,I moved up quickly after six months. the problem is either you sink or swim manager wise. And if you need direction on how to be the best you can figure it out yourself. If they need you in a position they will put you there against all odds. But once they don't need you they will snatch it from under you like you did nothing to deserve it.
good,"It started off as a nice job, but when new people come in and start doing better then workers that been there longer then you and u move up way faster they start to hate because they feel they should moved up before you and the bosses don't try to pay no mind to it but it was a problem."
good,"While I can't say that I hated my job at Wal-Mart, I can't say honestly that I loved it either. I DID make quite a few lifelong friends, and learned quite a bit about the retail world. "
good,working for walmart was very stressful.  my location had poor management.  the company underpays you and is very unorganized to be a mutli billionaire company.
good,They are always changing their policies and rules for employees. Taking things away and cutting hours. But when I worked there they had decent benefits and ok pay
good,it has its ups and downs. The work hours are sporadic sometimes you don't know how many you will get from week to week. Low pay but decent time off and decent benefits package.
good,"If you work hard at your job, you will be eligible for career advancement. Being at management level brings a different view on the company than a regular associate."
good,"Life as a cashier is the same as any other job. In the beginning of the shift you clock in and find out which register you are assigned to. From then a CSM will move you around if coverage is needed. The customers are the same, some good and some bad. The co-workers are friendly and management is appreciative and respectful of their employees."
good,Working as an ASM and worked for walmart for 20 years!! It is a good place to work and the benefits that they provide.. The management could care more for the customers and associates.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but not great either. Not a great fit for me personally. It was straight forward work and provided a paycheck but there was no real great experiences or opportunities. I would say it is a good first job for people, but not great for a long term career."
good,co-workers are great but management expects one person to do the job of many. Many times people are called up to cash leaving their stations unattended.
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of long hours with an hour break(unpaid) and two fifteen minute breaks(paid) But there were often times the Supervisors would give breaks late. "
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, porém não dá oportunidade de crescimento profissional para seus associados com menos tempo de empresa."
good,Start shift at 10 pm on register to help clear evening customers and prepare for stocking areas. Retrieve pallets of stock from warehouse and proceed to sales floor. Begin stocking shelves and maintain customer service throughout the night. Organize (zone) shelves to keep a neat and clean appearance to appeal to customers. Learned different attributes of the various departments and how to accentuate their strengths. Morale was at times very high and sometimes stressed during major events. The physical workout of bending and lifting was hardest but the reward was great customer satisfaction!
good,"Walmart pay rate is to low and the benefits are not good. "
good,"Walmart doesn't get the best praise for its employment turn overs, but for me, just out of high school, it was a good starting job. A good place to get your feet wet while exploring jobs in retail."
good,not a bad place to work however the hours and workload and increase at any giving time. there is not enough work and home balance especially when you are in management
good,Enjoyed working for them until they let me go for getting scammed. Hadn't been coached in 6 years and they let me go like trash. Very unappreciated. Didn't pay for the amount of work I did.
good,"travailler chez walmart est un bon debut en tant qu'etudiant , tu acqueris des experiences pour le future et dans le millieu d'emploi"
good,Good learning experience to learn and to be improved that can be used for many work places such as customer service skills and communication skills that can be used in many work places.
good,I work there for 6 and a half years. It used to be fine until they started to stress me out !!! Then I started having health issues plus the mangers were cut throat wish I think they were paid to be jerks!!!!
good,Work there is ongoing it never seem to stop the busyness of the job helped the hours go go by quickly. Most of the people are easy to work with. yet as in any work place you will find some folks that are more of a challenge to work with Management is not always on the same page with what is going on and sometimes they make unrealistic demands for time allowed to get things accomplished and then wonder why it was not finished on their time table ... it is like the have forgotten that it takes time to do what is required and then all the extras they add on  leaves you with no time to get the required duties done and get the extras taken care of at the same time question is what do you leave undone to take care of their extra requests???? Then they wonder why this  or that was not done when it is physically impossible to accomplish..The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with fellow associates and interacting with the customers that came in throughout the shift.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is long with much standing on your feet. With time standing becomes easier, and the day seems less difficult to get through. There's little to worry about and days become routine.The most difficult thing about the job is the schedule. Adjusting to working nights and getting rest during the day doesn't always work out. There are times when there's the need to fight falling to sleep. Walmart is well staffed there are many people to help keep things going."
good,"I worked there for about two years. My time there, I had many different managers. Assistant managers rotate every 3 months or so. (could be longer, days tend to blend together when you work there.)"
good,The only big concern I have is that the managers did not know how to manage. When I asked for help because they put me to work in my department they said they would try to find someone who could help me. They did not I emphasized many times that I cant do my job alone but they refuse to listen.
good,It all depends on the managers in place. If they are not on board with company programs it can be a little challenging.Overall  not to bad. It  depends on the managers. Over all good peope.
good,if u really need a job then Walmart is a good place for. the managers are rude too. just do your job and u should be cool.i can say that do have great benefits but thats about it.
good,"I worked in Asset Protection. My typical day would be to floor walk and catch shoplifters. Management never micro managed. They believed in allowing you to work your position without Supervision."
good,As pessoas dessa empresa reclamam muito por falta de responsabilidade
good,"My times working for Wal-Mart was not a enjoyable time. Most of the managers seemed to take liberties to making others hate their jobs. Switching hours last minute, expecting too much stock placement and requiring strict time cuts (no chance for overtime unless manager)."
good,Working at walmart was fairly easy. I found a lot of times we were understaffed which made for a stressful shift. The schedules were terrible. Coworkers were very kind and easy to get a long with as well as SOME of management.
good,"Overall I love what I do there.I've worked about every department over the last three years,but I've mostly been in frozen and produce.the pay seems fair for the work thats required.what i hate are the lack of hours.and for about the last year and a half the store I work in has gone a long way downhill.day shift is filled with terrible managers who dont care what happens unless they're about to get in trouble for it.the current store manager is terrible.and theres enough work for about twice the amount of people that we have.overnights is much worse.about five associates are expected to finish the same amount of work that 15 used to do when I first started.I've never minded what I actually do for my job.it can be stressful at times but it's incredibly boring other times so it kind of balances out.and lastly,if you ever want to be treated very poorly and eventually let go,just whisper union around your store gossip"
good,"Very big supermarkets running on minimal staff.    Lots of pressure to get work done, as expected.    Colleagues have to cover all departments when required incl. checkouts."
good,"when working third shift you experience different kinds of people. I for the most part enjoyed my coworkers everyone was helping. It's normally quiet at night, so you have lots of time to stock and reorganized."
good,"management get away with anything and store manager ross doesn't do anything about them. Everyone sleeps with everyone, they make millions of dollars a day and they can't give an decent amount of work hours to the employers."
good,Wasn't a bad place to work in the beginning but poorly managed. Safety is a huge deal until you actually get injured then they want to sweep it under the rug. Great pay if you can tolerate the nonsense.
good,ok environment but management horrible. people who arent managers play a manager role. too many chiefs not enough indians. currently looking for new employment
good,I loved working for walmart would go back in a heartbeat very great place to work for care for the employees overall great place to work for if you are willing
good,"on a regular day I clock in and get right to work"
good,Walmart is an decent job if you have to stay close to the area you work in. You have good stability and decent benefits. I wouldn't recommend working here if you don't have to
good,Working at Wal-Mart you have to be very patient with people. More than half the customers are rude. You just have to deal with it. Wal-Mart should pay more and give regular bonuses.
good,My time with Walmart was great despite the management over time becoming more of a hassle to deal with. The work load was more than enough for one person but needed to be pulled away per management for other tasks to be done.
good,get started early and keep going till the work is done. I dont like to sit around I prefer to stay busy it makes the time go by faster.I'm a hard worker with good work ethics.
good,"Long, boring/stressful days at work, management is not good and not a good job at all, I didn't like it at all. You have to deal with rude customers and even more rude employees."
good,"It was a fine Starter Job, however when i went to managers regarding customers or training me to do certain things, such as run the register, these things were neglected and ignored a majority of the time."
good,enjoyed working with fellow associates and like a fast passed environment. Working gave me experience in many different areas such as sales floor and back room product management.
good,If you're willing to put with the stress of day to day operations that happen then it's a pretty good job and pays decently. Most  of the time in order to advance you have to kiss butt
good,Walmart is a decent place to work where most of the people are friendly and willing to lend a helping hand. On the weekends a typical day at work is super busy. I've learned to be versatile and to do my job to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on customers faces and the least enjoyable part is when customers seem to have a bad experience somewhere in the store.
good,Casual environment that stresses customer support in sales and merchandising. They stress that shelves be full and stocked at all times. And they stress at price management to make daily sales.
good,"The days are very consumed with taking care of customer needs as well as associate needs.I have learned much about the retail world. The management is good for the most part, but very few have a college degree and some are very immature. The hardest part of the job is walking around on your feet. The other problem is due to the lack of any consistant schedules. I love to work with people and resolve their issues."
good,"Wal-Mart is a decent job to work at when young. As I grew older I felt as if Wal-Mart was not a career I wanted to seek, so for the past few months I've been looking for a new career. Typical day at work an be stressful but you have to find a great balance within your work day. Hardest part of working there I would say is dealing with unrealistic expectations. The most enjoyable part would be meeting new faces and customers daily."
good,"Overall working at Walmart was ok.  I started as a night stoker and then moved to an electronics associate. "
good,"I enjoyed working there. I doubled my pay through advancement in 3 years. However, it is one of those places where the management team can do whatever they want; retaliation, etc. It's very ""save yourself..blame others"" unfortunately. The job and the work family is great. The unnecessary drama, not so much."
good,"This company has helped my growth into adulthood. Not only was I able to advance in the company but meet many of people who would play a big part in my life, Walmart can be a very challenging place to work but the customers make it all worth wild, there are a lot of interesting people in the world and it is a pleasure to come into these experiences to better understand my human race."
good,Could be more concern about employees. The pay and the hours is not satisfied from employees. Management more focused on customers not employees. Could get better if management is willing to change.
good,"Nothing else to say other than a horrible experience. Granted it was only a job during college, I still would never recommend anyone to apply. Management was rude and tried their best to take advantage of anyone that would allow it."
good,"The customers weren't so bad, the department managers didn't know how to manage a team very well nor knew how to get along with anyone. The pay and benefits were great and the store managers were alright.  My fellow associates were nice and easy to work with and many of the customers were happy quite a bit. I also love to talk to new people so it helped being in that environment. I learned how to work in a fast-paced workplace while paying close attention to detail."
good,"Working at Walmart was terrible. I would not recommend, unless you're really desperate for the money. Ever since we got these new managers overnight we've lost so many people. There was a lady who's been working there for almost twenty years and she just walked out. And there's another guy who just walked out after his ten year mark. I did so much for that company and they act like they don't even appreciate anything I do. But they sure did make a big mistake. They're going to miss me so much when I'm gone."
good,"A typical day for me is being on my feet for at least 7 hours and not being to sit down. I'm just worn out from this type of work,but my team is family"
good,I believe Walmart is a good place to be employed at and in general they are fair with their salaries and benefits.Walmart has a lot of opportunities for their employees.
good,It was an easy enough job except the hours changed during the holidays and there was never enough help.  You had to take an hour long lunch which  always seemed like a waste of time.
good,"Calm environment "
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work at first , but after Helen died no one cared about the employee anymore they just wanted to make more money. At first we were  proud to be in every parade, every fund raiser,a lot of pride went into our store. As the years went by the fun went with it. they took away Christmas bonus even after we were vested. they stopped most fund raisers they stop being in parades, stop even showing up to associates funerals. pretty sad. they took away merit   raises, they took away good job buttons.  they wanted more and paid less. they dropped the amount of the raises. we use to get 30-40-50 cent raises now you get a 2% raise. that's awful . deductibles went up, coverage down. they cut back on rewards.dinners , cookouts .they told us we would get a new leather jacket if we had a year accident free. when we got our year accident free they had changed managers and said .I didn't say that. so I'm disappointed in how it turned out."
good,"Working at Walmart gave me incredible customer service skills. Walmart is the reason I have become an excellent multi tasker. Management was not the best though, they care more about the stores reputation rather than individual associates. It was a good job non the less that kept everyday interesting and exciting. I even built some friendships along the way that I will take with me when I leave."
good,"I Learned how to move quickly in a very busy enviornnment, confidence and patience. "
good,Very stable work environment for someone looking for long term employment. Lots of room for advancement if your looking to move up with the company. Very flexible hours/ shifts providing good work life balance.
good,"In between doing the job you're assigned, you have to listen to management and customers, however management has trouble communicating with eachother which makes it difficult for any work to actually get done."
good,"Working at Walmart was not bad at all, great benefits, and paid time off was the only good thing about it. The reason i left was the managers at the auto care."
good,"I Have Learned That working at Walmart you have to have good communication, and engagement. Walmart is a great company to work for. The Only thing about the culture at Walmart is the management doesn't give you the same communication you give them."
good,This is a cool place to work for your first job but idk how anyone can make a carrier out of this job but they do. I felt like a slave working here honestly
good,I work 8 hours a day and deal with a number of terrible managers. I have been in the company for 2 years and have nothing to show for it. When few veteran members were on shift I took the mantle of responsibility and tried to hold the team together but was over-ruled by managers who have been there for less than 2 months.
good,"Uma otina empresa para trabalha, ambiente amplo e agradável  com uma ótima equipe."
good,Fast paced but friendly.  It was easy to get Into the job. Other employees were helpful and understanding. Not a bad place to work of you are a people person
good,Walmart has great potential under good management but sadly enough that is a very hard Walmart to find. They are constantly changing your schedules and extremely under staff just so upper management can have there big bonuses.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would include check the clipboard to get my assigned area. I do a walk-through of my area. Then I complete my tasks for the day."
good,Walmart was very stressful always tell you to do things then one minute later they want something else done and you haven't finished the first thing they wanted you to do.
good,I would not refer anyone to work at Walmart if life happens to you a lot. It doesn't take a lot to become a manager. You have about 5 managers walking around at once telling you what to do but other than all of that it's a good job.
good,Walmart is a very diversified company. It is known for it low prices for customers and helps people to live better. On a typical day at work it can be stressful because of the company's needs therefore it can create problems especially if it was not completed before. The hardest part of the job is completing your work before your shift ends. What I have learned is to utilize my experiences and knowledge to benefit the company.
good,I really lved my job but when we had really bad weather it was hard for me to get there. Even if we had a weather alart it would still be counted against you if you called off work. Other then not a bad place to work at.
good,"The compensation was good, but personally my managers were nothing special. I did not get along with all of them and eventually it led to my departure from the company"
good,Always trying to cut hours. Then complain that departments are not zoned and jobs are not getting done. They want one person to do the job of give to save money.
good,"point system unrealistic to life, you are allowed 4 per six months and once the four points are reached you are terminated. no exceptions. nice people. bad management"
good,Needs improvement of pay for hourly workers. Other then that things aren't all that bad. Could clean house a little though. I wouldn't mind working at Wal Mart again honestly.
good,Working and taking care of my duties was easy but the store I worked at was always short staffed and would have us fill in those spots and then it didn't help with us being short staffed management never knew what to do and always stood around talking with other and just made themselves look busy. But overall it's a good work environment.
good,It's never a dull moment at walmart.  You will always have a task to work on or other departments that need your help.  You will always be busy in between breaks so it makes the day go by pretty fast.
good,"- Walk the store note any issues"
good,It had its days working there. The only real problem was the managers. The managers did not treat workers right. The floor stockers were friendly and helpful.
good,"While it was a friendly place to work, and I have no compliants about the work asked of me, at the time, they desperatly needed to update policys and the equipment necessary to accuratly keep track of their employees."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good starting point when it comes to jobs (especially with their raise) however, it's overbearing and management doesn't help sometimes."
good,Good environment with good people but work can get hectic.  Lacking on work/life balance as shifts are not consistent.  Dealing with customers has its charm if your that type of person.
good,"Working here was ok for me. the ppay was ok at the time. my only problem was scheduling. if i needed time off for a doctor's visit of family issue, i had to find coverage for my shifts which wasn't at ways easy."
good,"es una empresa emprendedora con facilidad de crecimiento oportunidad de trabajo . compañerismo, emprendedora y sobretodo con lealtad  misma  . empresa que da oportunidad sin discriminacion"
good,"A typical day involved time management, multi-tasking, loading/unloading stock, shipping/receiving, claims office with expired products, mild cleaning and maintenance. Most shifts went quickly."
good,"You're kept busy scanning and bagging items, making the workday pass by faster. Standing on two feet can be tiring. You get plenty of hours, but they're not assigned consistently at the same times and days of the week, which can be annoying when trying to schedule routine things such as school, rehearsal, or another part time job later on. When lines aren't hectic, you're left cleaning and zoning isles until there's a customer you can invite over to checkout. Managing self-checkouts was lower stress and involved less conversation, which as an introvert, was my favorite part of the job, and provided a nice break from all the forced conversations I had to initiate earlier in the day. Most customers are nice, but you will come across some bad ones here and there. That's just the nature of retail."
good,"I would say that this job definitely challenged me at another level. There were different health products sold by Walmart from vitamins to blood pressure machines. We had to be able to give customer answers to any questions they may have about the product and instructions on how the product was to be used, if they were not satisfied then we would make a return request and while doing all of this document the call and get all of the customer's information."
good,Easy work environment most are understanding when it comes to leave and vacations. As long as you are nice and understanding you won't have any problems working here.
good,"Depends on where in store you work "
good,"This is not a good place to work , if you're a female. The male staff are very inappropriate, especially to disabled female associates.The"
good,"Not a bad place, good for a stepping stone to another place to work. Don't expect to have the same boss, as I've gone through four or five at the time of writing. Our store has gone through four store managers, and likely to be five by next year."
good,"This was one of the first jobs that I had, and for a first job it could have been so much worse. It wasn't the best place but by far it was not the worst."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers that came to the store. Most people were friendly. They easily built a pleasant friendship with the cashiers and other employees at the store.
good,"I joined the company with 4 others in training. Most of us had issues but the store I worked at seemed worse then others. The store manager ran her business with favoritisim and didn't care much about how the store is supposed to run, just how she wanted it to."
good,"productive, busy. I help customers in every area of the store. help unload trucks and put th freight away as well as work bins. I also set new modules."
good,A typical day at work would be very stressful and heavy. I learned to be quick and wise. The management was poor. The workplace culture could use a better cleaning crew for the bathrooms and work places. The hardest part of the job was balancing my time and hours with my personal life. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing getting good customer reviews and statements.
good,They first 2 weeks were great of course i learn how to run a cash register and i got to know other people who i work with. but i couldn't trust anyone
good,Little to no training. Not very good pay. Not a friendly atmossphere. Short lunch. Bad hours. To much to do in the time they want it done..............
good,"This job was great at the time for me I got to work as much as I wanted but it is hard work. I unloaded trucks and stocked shelves, collected carts and cleaned floors."
good,"I worked as primarily a wireless associate for almost 2 years. I liked working with customers and most of the associates. Store management was terrible at communicating with each other and staff though. I had numerous issues with ignoring my hours of availability, being scheduled outside of department operating hours, and being told to come in late or leave early then not having my manager correct my attendance."
good,Loved the people i worked with good communication skills. Very poor judgment of timing for freight and the people assigned to the work. Needs more work and better judgement from management for directing and helping people succeed in the job.
good,"mucha presión por parte de los cliente, lo que aprendí es el sentido de urgencia la gerencia es buena , la parte mas difícil es estar bien con tus jefes y con los clientes , lo que mas me gusto las amistades q surgieron ."
good,the most important part of the job is CUSTOMER SATISFACTION/when you know a customer is satisfied/you have done your job for that day/good management team to work with/for...good company to work for....
good,They lost there core beliefs. If you are looking to advance its a great company to move up but it also lacks leadership and training skills throughout management.
good,"Wal-Mart has, for the most part, lost it's spark. Customer care, associate relationships, and general store well being have taken a back seat to bottom lines, profit margins, and upper management bonuses. Its a cash cow not a place to enjoy working."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar onde as pessaos procuram se ajudar e a organização procura dar condições de trabalho para os seus colaboradores, e estamos sempre em busca da melhoria continua. Onde estamos buscando o conhecimento o aprimoramento e o crescimento pessoal. Aempresa já tem o seu nome e buscamos fazer o nome estando trabalhando e se dedicando a cada dia no exercicio de suas atividades"
good,"Very unorganized environment,  there's not enough communication in the store. They treat there employees  horrible  but expect so much. I here some other Wal-Mart's are better."
good,"not a bad company. "
good,"The portrait studio that was once in Walmart no longer exists.  It is a good thing. I would not have recommended working for this company.  The hours were long, the pay was low and the management was poor."
good,"Just a company that wants to get as much as they can with little to no resources. Can be fun at times, work with some amazing people. However sometimes too stressful for my taste."
good,When I got hired in I was told it was full time and they lied. They hired a lot of people in for the re-grand opening. After they finished turning the store into a supercenter they had a meeting letting the employees know they were no longer needed and terminated their employment.
good,foi gratificante pois tive a oportunidade de crescer muito profissionalmente.
good,"Walmart is great for just starting out. But it is not a great career. Management is lazy. The only time they come out of their offices is zone time. Corporate comes up with the shifts that schedule people and the store is ALWAYS short handed. Even a Monday or Tuesday at Walmart feel like a Friday or Saturday because of corporate who never come into our store, make up our schedules. It always feels like doing the work of 3 people. The only suggestion I have is if you want to make Walmart a career, go into upper level management. Most of the stress if with the associates on the floor. And the customers treat you like you are an uneducated person. And they will not take doctors notes. A point is a point. Even if you or a family member are in the hospital."
good,"A good company to work for if your boss like you, the culture that Sam started this company on died along time ago. the hardest on my job was listening to my boss."
good,"Its a good place to work, only because of some of your coworkers. Other than that its not worth it. If you wanna move up in the company, Walmart is not the place to go."
good,"You can be part or full time and some positions can create their own schedules for the most part. I learned to act well and calm under very demanding circumstances, and how to multi task while being proficient at task at hand. Management is for the most part easy to work with.  The workplace culture is taught to be friendly and respect for the individual. The hardest part of the job is the turn over rate. Has not been fully staffed in a long time and cannot keep current employees so continuous cycle. Most enjoyable is being able to be sociable and customer oriented."
good,it is retail very busy a times set  schedules.Good customer relations is a must. some of the management is supportive..................................
good,"WalMart is one of the biggest retail company and although this company strives to live by its trendy goal - ""Live Better, Live Longer""; the company fails to properly communicate between levels of staff and management. The company seems to care to about its employees in some form or another. But management messes it up by giving an employees' fluctuating schedule work schedule to where the employee cannot make plans for their personal life. In general, WalMart is a good place to work but there ARE TOO many bosses and no one seems to know what the other manager is doing - so that leaves the associate in the ""what do i do now?"" and causes stress to the employee."
good,"There is to many young kids, and the managers cant really care for their employees. They cant really make sure every empolyee is okay and taken care of on the job."
good,Raises are very low and your advancement is dependent upon who you are friends with. Employees who are older..don't have much chance for advancement no matter how great your work is unless you are prior military.
good,"It is a very simple work environment, always busy so you have to stay on your toes, very easy job. You meet new people everyday. It's nice. Management understands you and give you flexible hours."
good,"Has a great system in place . All one has to do is trust the process . The entire company is based off a great internal inventory system , that if use probably , will eliminate any errors."
good,i loved working there becuase of the crew members. Managment at the time was real Bad. Workplace its self was a fast paced enviorment.  The Pricemaching was dificult on account that sometimes the costomer would use very old adds to price match.
good,"I comprehend the rigidness required in attendance for a company with high turn-over rates, like Walmart. However, when I needed time the most in order to be present for the birth of my son, I received marks against my attendance because I was part-time only, which apparently disqualified me from LOA that I desperately needed. The problem escalated, rather than being resolved, resulting in my termination due to a lack of communication on the part of management."
good,Very flexible hours very fun to be part of a team but short staffed quite a bit and benefits not so great we did receive bonuses for being a safe and accident free work place
good,they are a good start off job but the management is bad and the way they treat people are just wrong but its a good paying job but they can do a lot better
good,Wal-Mart mis treats their employees.  Employees are a body to mis use and take advantage of since their belief is that all employees are expendable.   The people that currently work there at very unhappy and reflect their unhappiness toward their customer base.
good,Assistant manager must have patience to work under micro management. Daily operation including receiving and pack out is the most essential part of an assistant manager job function.
good,"Walmart was a nice job to have considering that i went to school as well .. "
good,"They are a great company to work with if you are in school or whatever the outside Circumstance may be. Unless your working in the back I.e. Cap team two or repairs, customer service skills are a must."
good,"Do not have alot to say, they are a company that does not seem to like working with thier people. They don't like to give raises, nor put you in a slot, and give you the money allotted for it. They like to think they pay you eqaul pay, but it's not."
good,"Walmart executive leadership and Culture is excellent.  Individual leaders (Regionals, DMs , Store Managers, Co Managers and Assistant Managers can definitely make or break their area of responsibility with associates based on their management style.  I have worked with great leaders that make work enjoyable and I have worked with the ""slave-driver"" managers that are unrealistic on purpose to accomplish more.  The company is great, some leaders are and some aren't.  Very similar to any other company.  Unfortunately, the talkers get ahead more than the producers, but hopefully it'll change someday."
good,I had a great experience with the management on all levels. I felt the employee turnover was a little bit high and they went to hiring more temps as of late which I do not approve of.
good,As a cashier at walmart I must admit I was a very fun experience. If you like to stay busy and working at fast pace. I enjoy the break room activities that are provides when we take break. Management is great that make you feel very welcomed. Working at walmart you learn that muilitasking  is the key so that you can get them in and out.
good,It is a job the pay is not comparable to what you have to deal with in working with the public but if you can make your way up then it makes it a little more bearable.
good,Good working environment and very friendly customers and workers. Learned alot working with my co workera and management. Felt like i was working with family.
good,I have been working for the company for many years. I would love to stay the store manager wasn't out for others jobs. Company has changed over the last few years and not necessarily for the better. For those who put in so much time to feel like their jobs are at Jeopardy it's not really fair.
good,"The Co-workers, managers, and even the customers are all really great to be around. The environment was actually quite positive. However, I disagree with corporate's view's towards both employees and customers, and disliked their policies against them. The Best part of the job was all the friendly customers. The worst part was checking their $1300 receipts to see if they were stealing."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for, they give you great pay and nice benefits but the management sector is lacking in all the stores that I have visited. You show up to work and do your task to a tee or someone will yell at you for the mishap. Continually doing your job great may get you customer compliments but those mean nothing to Walmart as a whole. When corporate visits everyone scrambles and you will be doing so many odd jobs that your breaks and lunches will either be super early or super late, leaving you with an awkward work day."
good,"empresa multinacional, mais não oferece beneficios"
good,"Did what you had to do to stay business."
good,"Truck loader and un-loader requires a lot of lifting. Very fast pace moving production line. Time goes by so fast due to the fast moving pace. Liked working here, however the management is very strict at everything from safety and production rates."
good,i did the night shift and it was easy and fun the management team used to be the funniest group and play more games then worry about the merchandise to be put out
good,Good place to work paceful and joyfull in my area good co workers.Very productive in the way the you can have experrience with tires and other treatments for cars.
good,I loved working with my crew and customers .the management is what takes this job down to two stars.great oppurtunities to advance and great hours available
good,Walmart is a cool place to work depends on which one you at the one I was at I didn't like as much the managers and the way the store was ran was unorganized
good,"It's easy work, a lot of standing. Management is mediocre at best. Customers are awesome though as long as you provide excellent customer service. Overall I do love the job because I am a people person. However, weekends are required, there is no holiday pay, and quarterly bonuses are determined by how much money the store did not loose. For instance, every theft loss amount comes out the total bonus as a whole. Then what is left is divvied up amongst the 200+ employees depending on how many hours you worked."
good,"Overall, the company should care about their employees just as much as the customers. Everything shouldn't always be about making a sale, we all have lives and it should be treated equally."
good,"Very good the one thing I love the most is meeting different people from other countries it's extremely beyond the original"
good,I enjoy meeting new people everyday. And the Walmart team is a very close knit family. I have a close relationship with most everyone I work with. I enjoy learning new things. The company has raised the starting pay. But you have to jump through hoops to get another raise. The management team is not very approachable. And they treat people as if they are beneath them.
good,"Wal-mart is not a bad company, they do have issues like any other company, Advancement is good, but also tricky at the same time, Pay could be better, but is ok"
good,"Was train to do the meat wall and unload truck stock the meat wall"
good,"I worked at Walmart through a temp agency, and the experience at Walmart was average. The work was consistent, as were the hours, and there were many roles one could take up on any given day."
good,"I think it's a nice place to work, but many changes and it's hard sometimes to get things done at times. The sales are good per day.  It gets very busy during the day and not to awful bad at night. There are  many employees."
good,"Management needs some work.  The biggest issue I have seen while employed here is the lack of people skills and current management education within the ranks.  The ""BOSSES"" seem to be there for the wrong reasons and don't have either the education, ability or desire to bring the company to the next level.  Too bad, because I like the idea of Walmart but without ridding the company of ""the good old boys"", they are allowing their biggest competitor Amazon to easily take their market share."
good,"It is a good job where you have job security, however, the teamwork needs to be better. The managagement at most stores are not very approachable and that makes the work environment worse. The benefits are decent. Management should show more appreciation to the associates in the meeting and more/better work will be done."
good,My pharmacy was always busy; It was not unusual to 300-400 scripts a day. I had hands on training before doing any standard operating procedures online.  Had a good team of associates and Pharmacist to help with questions.  You got to know the regulars by name and of course you get the impatient ones when their scrips aren't done in exactly 20 minutes.  I did enjoy the job and was looking forward to being certified.
good,"The job had its ups and downs. A typical day included picking boxes from the back room, loading them onto a cart and then stocking the shelves. This is what i did for most of the day. In between this i would have to constantly help customers, even if that meant walking across the store to help them find a product. Sometimes i would encounter rude customers but i had to always maintain a respectful tone. I would also be called up to help cashier multiple times a day. I would be doing that from anywhere to 15 minutes or even a few hours, depending on how busy it was. A lot of the time this caused me to not be able to finish my work i started that morning. At the end of the day i would have to put all over stock away, dispose of my trash, and prepare for the next day. I would say it was a good first job. I learned how to deal with customers and my coworkers right away. It was an environment that I had to quickly adapt to. Management provided little training. I had to figure a lot of things on my own, even after asking someone to help me. Each day was different."
good,I would help out in multiple departments. Working overnights and taking on responsibilities that were above pay grade while being promised to get a new position or better hours. With constant changes in managers this was overall just a way to get you to work hours no one else would want to.
good,This was one of the best jobs I had and you always have something to do. I got a long with everyone I worked with and as long as you did your job you would do fine and move up.
good,Its a job. It was OK. For the most part. I miss the people but not the stress. They have a program in place to help employees in dire need but when I was being evicted because my so called best friend stole four months of rent money from me they wouldn't help me and I got evicted I lost all my belongings and worst of all I lost my fur babies.
good,"Working in Walmart was such a great experience for me because I enjoyed staying with them and others co-workers. Walmart does not pay good their employees  at all, but I had a pleasure to work with management and co_workers."
good,"Great place to work if you want to become a Walmart store manager. If you want to become anything else, then Walmart is not for you. No one has been able to help me try to get into corporate where the jobs other then sales are."
good,"Walmart is ok to work.  While some associates managers try to help you out, some simply don't care.  Benefits are ok, standard in the industry.  A good job for someone interest into entering in a retail career."
good,"The people at the job are fun. Management is generally poor overnights and the store manager did little to remedy the issue when it was brought to his/her attention. The work itself is very simple in terms of complexity, however it is continuous and can be exhausting. Slow workers are empowered for working slow, as the hard workers who complete their work in a timely manner are sent to ""help"" the slower people. Some of the workers take advantage of this system and will deliberately slow their production so they get assistance."
good,"Its not family oriented,as it was when I first started.The attendance policy is too strict.Your position is not secure ,due to company constantly trying to get rid of the older associates with a high salary."
good,The job pays decently however you dont really get anywhere. Each day is the same. It feels like you are just treading water and some shift managers are focused on writing people up.
good,"Walmart's founder has created this company for this soul purpose "" save money and live better"". I wish i could say i like the fastpacedness and competitivness of walmart, but its sad to say that alot of times things are either not done or changed coz only for the managers liking. Walmart has all the poetienal to be tha great company it truly is, but its managers must stop rushing and competting to tha point that they are willing to put more pressure on its employee's rather than help ensure they have the right management to have things in order also placing competitivness to the side until truly nessicery."
good,"must be flexible  for everyday is different. prioritizing your day is essential because things change rapidly.  "
good,"Helping customers find select merchandise, Zoning making sure merchandise is properly placed, Maintaining neatness, Mixing Paint, Making keys, and Working the cash register"
good,Un buen desempeño pero no hubo estabilidad laboral
good,"I was in charge or gander center and it had 2 cash registers . Some days I would be the only one there. I would be going back and forth to checking people out and finishing notes.  I learned how to order items , look up items from different stores, set modular , change on hands, and how to drive a forklift.  That managers weren't that good. Every time I asked for help they would say to ask someone else . The most enjoyable part was when I had employees working in garnde center. In that case I can do the routines a department manager has to do everyday."
good,"When I started working at Walmart in 2008, They were flexible and understanding they had different call in policy which we were able to work with. back in the day I could transfer and keep my pay rate but now when I transferred, I lost almost a dollar pay, and the new policy for call in and  the strictness of management has led me to leave the company for good. When I left they had fired few people who had worked there longer than I had, some were over silly things. I would not recommend to work at Walmart unless it was last resort."
good,Very unorganized. Consistently changing seems every week. The pay was great. It always felt like I was walking on egg shells with the constant change of supervisors.
good,"In a typical day, I would usually be a self-checkout host, which is quite monotonous for an 8+ hour shift. Requesting cashier shifts got me nowhere, and management never wanted to train more self-checkout hosts. Majority of employees were nice, but the discipline was lacking."
good,I have worked for Walmart for 6 years and been in two different stores. My first store I had no problem with and everyone was kind and helped you learn and build. The second store I am at the management team does not help you build and grow. They are rude and do not care to help you. When it comes to the market team coming in they will throw you under the bus to save themselves first. I never disliked my job with Walmart until I came to this store with this management team.
good,"● Supervised front end cashiers"
good,Very fast paced and a change from my previous position.  Enjoyable and management works with you.  Position is part-time with flexible hours.  Always changing areas so easy to learn all areas of the store.  They allow for an hour lunch with a break before lunch and after lunch.
good,"The managing staff was good but could have been more organized."
good,"Fast paced, real time environment.  Made great work contacts and formed friendships throughout the US.  Associate discount is a nice benefit.  Not enough work/life balance as working 10+ hours a day and weekends creates a burnout."
good,"started off great but they quickly pile a bunch of extra work on your work day that you may not even be trained to do. Then you're ridiculed for not getting everything done. management is also a mess, lots of promises to get things done/help but no follow up."
good,"Salary- minimum wage, and you get a 40 cent increase every year you stay on "
good,"Although i did everything i possibly could to prove i was of management quality .I was never given the opportunity. There was always another reason as to why another employee was more qualified . it did not matter that i had more knowledge of the area of the store or not . I had to on multiple occasions train my manager,"
good,Average work place.  Retail work schedules are not family friendly. You have extra work put on you that should be done by others in different positions.
good,A typical day at work: twelve hours shifts with three breaks. I learn how the distributions works and how the merchandise gets to their destination. Hardest part of the job is temperature changes
good,Easy job but there were too many supervisors for one shift. Multiple directions received from multiple supervisors.  Most contradicting the other.  Unreasonable output goals for certain areas.
good,Working at Walmart was a good learning experience. It was nice to work for such a well known establishment. I really enjoyed my time wording at Walmart.
good,It's a bit of a grindstone. You can advance easily but the work is also mentally straining as it's very tedious. I had amazing co-workers and store manager.
good,"Benefits and incentives have been steady decreasing over the years. It's becoming a glorified dollar store, and they treat their employees as such unfortunately."
good,I worked with customer service as needed. The job wasn't hard but getting full time hours and benefits are almost impossible. This is not the job to retire from.
good,"Una empresa llena de trabajo siempre, aprendes muchos procesos tanto bancarios como en manejo de efectivo y organización de personal. un detalle es que tanto la gerencia como los propios compañeros no se hacen responsables de las malas decisiones que ellos toman durante la jornada. y si hace falta se lavan las manos con tal de no hacerse responsables de las consecuencias, por lo tanto no sientes apoyo de ningún tipo."
good,a typical day at work is always going to the back to see if u got any freight that needs to be put out and later going up to the from to check if any customers need help and after that just zone everything. i learned a little bit about how big businesses are managed. the workplace was filled with a lot of bullies and just really mean people and worst of all the managers wouldn't bother to help you.
good,"The pay and benefits are very good, but you definitely earn them.  The environment is very fast paced, most jobs have a production number that must be met, and the breaks are infrequent and short. As a long term employee I have noticed the ever increasing focus on saving money by making employees work harder by any means necessary."
good,"The time that i worked at Wal-Mart was not the best experience, but it was experience non the less. The management for this store i worked at in particular was very poor and did not care to much about your opinions as a employee."
good,"The management when I worked there in 2011 was failry young. Being a cashier is great for a student, but for anything long term, I would not recommend it."
good,"Starting out positive: The pay was nice, my co-workers were relatable and understanding, and you actually got two breaks and a lunch if you worked 6.5 hours."
good,"The job requires too many demands without the proper tools to get the work done. Could not change shifts, training was vague. the hardest part was meeting the demands of the job without the proper tools need to be successful."
good,"You are required to do more than you get paid for, customers are rude, mangement does not care about you or your personal life. every now and then you will run into a good mananger"
good,"You work very hard with long days and sometimes weeks at a time until you get the job done. A lot of turn around due to they just hire anyone to fill the position. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, associates and customers.Over all the company has treated my family and I well but it seems like instead of teaching and developing associates they have them sink or swim."
good,Like where the company is heading and processes that will increase efficiency. Some things we are doing are not necessarily good investments with associates time and metrics used are not always a direct line to what's happening in a given store.
good,As a dept mgr you are responsible for your dept(s) as well as associates.  There is too much favoritism and the wrong people are held accountable.  Management is spread too thin and do not support the associates.  Culture is to molly coddle associates.
good,"No individuality, no compassion, no consideration. Though the people one works with at this company may be wonderful individuals, the policies and protocols the company implements makes the work environment incredibly competitive and heartless. The blind lead the blind here."
good,"most people are great to work with and talk to. i wish the management was a bit more dedicated to follow through."
good,14 yrs with this company my job was operation manger a typical day is dealing with customers that comes in upset and make sure I take care of their problems I learn how to lead people and make decision
good,"I worked as a cashier while I was pregnant and the heat was hard on me. The csm's were nice and my peers were okay. I also was in customer service, mostly with returns."
good,"I have worked at Walmart for almost 5 years now. It's not my ideal job by any means. But it's steady work and there are a variety of shifts to choose from that will work with almost any ones schedule. Management can be unrealistic and favoritism is present. But isn't that at every job? Customers SUCK. Might be the worst part of the job haha Overall if you need a job, take it."
good,"Working at Walmart had a lot of its pros and cons. For the work, the pay was good. However, the managers weren't very understanding. For example, they had a policy where if you have legitimate reason, you wouldn't be 'pointed' (which is kind of like being penalized), for missing out on work. Yet, fainting on the job received a point. Some girl who went into labor on the job got pointed as well, if I remember correctly. The managers usually aren't very understanding/compassionate."
good,"Work yourself to death"
good,"As a cashier,  I am required to quickly get the customers through the line, as well as offer them the credit card application and at the end of the sale ask them to do an online survey.  Customer service is important to me and making a customer feel welcome.  Bagging their groceries properly, building a relationship will keep that customer coming back.  I enjoy the social side of my job, I can tell in 5 seconds if a customer wants to have a conversation or be left alone.  The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet for an entire shift."
good,"Working as an Unloader/ IMS Associate at Walmart is ultimately not a bad job, if you like to be moving constantly. I enjoyed my job when I first began working as an Unloader. But there is favortism that goes on, and a major lack of communication through management that frequently causes unnecessary confusion and conflict. There are quite a few great people to surround yourself with, but there are also those who enjoy conflict as you will find anywhere you go. I learned some things as an Unloader, but I would have liked to learn more. I frequently asked to be trained in new things, and taught new things and have been denied due to short staffing and lack of communication through management. The best and worst part of the work day is unloading the trucks. It is the worst because it is the most fast paced part of the day, constant movement for 2-3 hours; depending on how long it took to unload the truck that day. It is also the worst part of the day because it is constant lifting, for 0-100 pounds, with or without help. But it is also the best part of the day because as your unloading the truck you have anywhere from 3-6 other associates that you can talk ammongst and you have a good time while working on the truck; which makes for a good start of a day."
good,"It was a typical work environment, I had some managers that were accommodating then others that let power go to their head which could make the work place fun or stressful. I also did not get proper training for the job required and would get docked for it. Management over looked a lot of issues. Most enjoyable part of the job was when friendly customers would come through my line."
good,Fun to work with co workers. Management not very approachable. Salary not enjoyable. They usually cut hours. the hardest part is when you are not done with your own department and they want you to work in other department and when your own department is and mess they well blame you.
good,"Un ambiente laboral agradable"
good,"Working at walmart can be somewhat stressful, but overall it an was okay work environment. very diverse, equal opportunity holiday pay. decent work hours But not so good on breaks and lunches."
good,"Met great people, who soon became friends after 2 years of working for the company. Flexible hours when in school, but sometimes not understanding of personal life. A lot of favouritism, not many possibilities of advancing. Good part-time student job."
good,"In addition to this job not having a good work/life balance the company will lie to you about the job requirements. They make you sign a contract saying you will work at least 45 hours/week, but you are salaried so you do not get overtime. Also, they will tell you not to stay late or come in on weekends because you will suffer burnout. However, if you are behind they will turn around and say, but you probably should stay late or come in extra days to get caught up. You NEVER GET CAUGHT UP. That is the problem with this job. Also I asked my team leader directly what my max caseload would be. She told me about 125 claims. I had a max caseload of 140 at one point in time. Management can also be wishy-washy. Some of them are great at their jobs and some of them are horrible. "
good,"Working in Customer Service for this company is very tough, you have to be observative and very conscious of all surroundings. Always giving good and fast paced services to keep customers coming and happy."
good,A typical day was okay for me. It was too hot outside for me at times so not very enjoyable. The management was strict and hard at times but nice at others.The hardest part of my job was pushing carts when the mule was down.The most enjoyable was knowing i did my job.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, it provides experience that one will need to continue in the work force. During my time at Walmart I was fortunate to be able to move up in their company."
good,"I work in the jewelry department and I love my area. I pierce ears, greet customers zone my areas, ring and bag customers items. I do inventory and make sure our customers feel at home while shopping in our store."
good,"Walmart is an alright place to work at, i would have stayed at my Walmart were it not for the horrible management my store had. Besides that everything else was fair, the only down side i can think of was that in the first 6 months of work you were only allowed 3 days off."
good,At the Management level there are some that are great to work with and others that are looking to just make a paycheck. At the associate level there quiet a few that just show up for the money which thats not great either. If you work there think of it as a stepping stone to a better job.
good,"Not a good work experience for me. Bad hours, uninvolved and disrespectful managment, low pay and no one would be there to help you when you needed it."
good,"Work is steady, most nights are the same, the only difference is sometimes your assigned department to stock is different.  Hours don't typically vary."
good,I have worked with Wal-Mart for over 13 years. When I first started I think we had a great staff . It was a pleasant place to work and customers loved shopping there. As the years went by it seems that it was not the same place as when I started. I know things change and you have to adapt to it. But I think as a store level management forgot how to treat their employers with respect and expected more and more from them. I do like the company as a whole (benefits and salary are reasonable and they do give a lot to the community). I feel that the managers are under a lot of stress related from the job and they need to be retrained in customer service and to help out their associates more.
good,It was a okay place to work for the pay could be better.i worked a lot of hours and even cover dept for dept managers and did not get recognise and the paid for doing dept manager job.when you have dept managers that don't show up for days or even weeks and people cover for them and do there jobs maybe they need more than just a pat on the back.
good,The Management at Walmart was the not very good.  The workplace culture was very stressful. The most enjoyable part of my day was taking lunch and going home.
good,"Upper management doesn't listen.  If you need help, it's like pulling teeth to get it.  It it's broken, fix it but nobody wants to.  They ask you to stay over for overtime but don't pay you for it. They have you cut your hours on a different day."
good,I worked as a sales associate. I worked with amazing co-workers. Job duties were assisting customers with finding whatever they needed. As well as keeping department clean.
good,Day to day is manageable if you follow the tasks and orders. I worked for a long time at Walmart and moved around in the store and the only time I had full time was when I worked over nights. If your looking for something in between jobs its a good place to work but its definitely not a place for a career unless you have connections with corporate or management.
good,"The Tle is understaffed and we do so much work for so little pay. We also do two jobs a technician and service writer. They are two different jobs with two different pays its not my fault that we are under staffed so why should we be sent out to do another job? Our job is dangerous and people have been killed before, we feel we need a better pay. Other departments get payed around the same or more.Like bakery they just make deserts but get payed just the same while we work on cars."
good,Working a Walmart could involve anything from running after a shop lifter to helping an elderly person to their car. Walmart defineatley taught me the importance of customers and exceeding their needs and wants. Management  was always pleasant and welcoming  to better ideas. The workplace culture was vibrant with many changes and even great traditions. I can't say that there was a hard  part of the job. The most enjoyable moments involved the customers thanking me excessively for helping them out in some sort of form. It was usually a small gesture for me but to know that I can make someone's day overly turn around in a positive form has always been enjoyable for me.
good,You get your pats on the back. They try to be positive to all the employees.  Sometimes they cook a out on the grill for all the employees for lunch. It is nice to get a free lunch every now and then.
good,I would start my day talking to a management on where they needed me. I learned to work with others. Some days were pretty crazy but you got by with what you needed to do. I loved working for customers on a daily.
good,Very fast pace culture that demands a lot from one wanting to move up with the company. You work weekends and holidays which is why one is paid so well.
good,"At my location the heads of management were not the most responsible, but the coworkers I was aside with worked very proficiently. Before the announcement of the store shutting down I was in discussions of being promoted to electronics but days later the store was going to be shut down in a month and I was left on as a cashier and cart pusher."
good,"a typical day at walmart is very fast paced and busy. I've learned to work at a steady pace while managing to get things done on time, learned to do heavy lifting,  learned to keep the work environment clean and learned people skills by making talk with costumers. "
good,"Worked with great people, had great managers, however job tended to be frustrating at times, along with dealing with customers who would rather make things harder than they needed to be."
good,"Good place to work, coworkers generally get along.  They demand hard work, but workers are respected by the supervisors.  They still know me there and treat me with respect after 10 years."
good,"They have plenty of opportunities for advancement, and they do offer great benefits after you've been there long enough. Making it long enough can be difficult though, the schedule they give you can make it extremely hard to stay healthy, closing one night, then opening the next morning, leaving you incredibly tired and your immune system down. They might have you scheduled to leave at 10 one night, but don't expect to be clocking out until midnight on those nights. But the benefits are fantastic, and they offer more breaks than anywhere I've heard of."
good,Most of Management is more worried about themselves and not so much about how to work with people and no real plan on training people to improve working relations
good,It was a bit overwhelming because the training process need to be more explanatory. The work equipment needed for the job was available however I was never taught how to use it properly.
good,"Go to work do your job and work to the best of your ability , their always work to do so theirs no room for slacking. Their is room for improve once you put your best foot forward"
good,The job of Cap Team 2 is not bad. It's a lot of physical work and I knew that going into the job. What the issue was was the managers. Most of them had no issues yelling at us for not completing impossible tasks and would belittle us for trying to defend ourselves. This was at the Blue Springs Walmart Super Center. I do not know if other Walmart buildings are like that but I would highly go against working at the Blue Springs Super Center. The pay was good but not worth what you will endure.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was getting as many hours that you want as well as the managers and supervisors accomodating to your requests. I really enjoyed being apart of the Walmart team
good,"Was a great place to move up. Started as an Hour ASC but through a lot of hard work and late nights was able to be promoted. We have slot of new good data but takes a lot of work to build it all out Wich causes you to work slot of hours trouble shooting issues. You are expected to support multiple catgs and be an expert in all of them, which causes you to work late slot."
good,"- unload trailers"
good,They like you to put a lot of time in. Always busy you can never get bored and always a challenge. You need to be hands on able to jump in to get it done.
good,"Walmart as most people know is the home of everyday low prices , which is true because they're prices are low as advertised. A normal day at work is either slow and laid back or chaotic and hectic. The management isn't always there when you need them and often comes off as rude. The hardest part of the job is probably doing all the cbl computer training , the easiest is being a cashier and giving great customer service."
good,Its an alright job to build up your self and gain working experience. working with the a good work forces you in possessions you may not enjoy but gelps you grow
good,Good hour but pay isn’t as good for how hard they have you working you get 1 hour lunch and 15 min breaks and the managers always yell at you or threatening you some type of way with coaching or firing instead of helping
good,"A typical day consists of back breaking labor unloading trucks."
good,It's okay if you just want a job. However if you want to grow in the company you better make the important connections to upper management. Otherwise you wont get far with the company.
good,Working at wal-mart I have to say was great as far as the manager I had. My only problem with wal-mart was that I did not get paid for what my duties entailed as I did everything in the store both front end and back end. I tried to go for a management position because I knew the job but was not given the job
good,Walmart is a good place for young people to achieve work experience. They are good with working around school schedules also. They allow advancements as well
good,"I love the people I work with, they are all hard-working, self-motivating, innovative thinkers.  The environment changes continually. Schedules constantly changed with inconsistency in hours per week."
good,Need better BENFITS pay people for holiday  help single mother or father need a better  attendance policy be more support for there  associates  but it ok for the most part
good,help customers while on the floor stocking. Waiting until it is time to start unloading the truck.  unload the truck in reasonable time. bring inventory out at the end of the night. most enjoyable part- the co-workers. hardest part-two trucks in the same day.
good,"i was hired on as a hba, cosmetics, and jewelry associate and after working for about 3 months i found they were going to hire someone else for jewelry making more then i did because that is the starting pay for that job so i had to go back to ask for a raise because they jiped me out of money. the managers were always causing trouble trying to make it look like i couldn't do my job by having someone come over from a different department to do that job when i was never asked to do it in the first place."
good,"I enjoyed making cakes for customers, it allowed me to use my creative side. I was working at my own pace to fill up the display case with cupcakes and cakes."
good,The expectations change for stockers every day. Some goals are impossible to reach by one person. You also never know what managers will be there so some days were much more stressful. Not a high paying job but stores do earn quarterly bonuses which can be as much as an extra check.
good,a typical day at work would consist of meeting in the back room where would start unloading freight from pallets into carts. Once the fright was separated by isle we would take a cart one at a time to its home isle and we would stock in a very fast pace.  I learned to stock correctly in a timely manner while being able to help customers. management was fair for the most part. hardest part of job was being able to keep a fast pace for the full shift or sometimes beyond the 8 hr shift. Most enjoyable part was helping customers and the good environment.
good,Normally start on register when my shifts start. i enjoyed working at wal-mart because it was very friendly. Most people i worked with were very understanding of the task at hand.
good,"Just a stressful place to work. I was hired to work in a certain department and ended up working in every other department on the floor, including unloading the trucks in the back."
good,the company really was not a good company because they didnt want to really give us our correct amount of pay. they took money for all type of crazy reason.
good,It was an ok job im not really a peoples person so me dealing with customers on the daily really made me except that attribute about myself but other than that it was ok
good,"I would take cake orders and decorate cakes. My duties included helping customers, decorating special ordered cakes or cakes that are set out for sale, filling the shelves, putting bread in the oven and cleaning behind myself."
good,"For the time I have been working at Walmart I find it hard to stay busy, I have to listen to commands of the remodeling supervisor and by the time I have finished 1 assignment I am waiting around for another."
good,Walmart is a okay place for kids in high school or adults just starting out for work. It's a little fast pace you expected to muilti task on everything. It's a fun starter job.
good,I do the best job and customer service I can provide its a company that tries to provide opportunity at  the store I work its about who you know not what you know
good,This was my first job I was just eager to work. If you are looking for something that will pay this is not the job but the experience will be different for everybody.
good,"I did overnights so it wasn't as busy as when the store is open. The people were nice. It was incredible how many people would come and go. They did not keep employees very long. I would wash and wax floors,break down cardboard, all that kind of stuff."
good,"its a cool place to work, sometimes a little unorganized but overall not bad. room for advancement and growth, co workers usually get along pretty good however I stay to myself"
good,I can't say much more then its a great way to get your foot in the door with Loss Prevention.  I'm where I am because Wal-Mart gave me a shot to be successful.
good,"Working as a cashier at Walmart is good because the business makes time go by so quickly. There were always extra hours to be taken and schedules were released far in advance. The only downside would be the customers and the other staff, who were not very friendly."
good,"i had so, so experience with the company. You can move in the company quickly if you work hard and have the right attitude. Bu if you make a lot mistakes or simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time , it can go bad for you. Over all it was good and i learned a lot . I think the biggest problem was there was too much top down control and they didn't give people on the ground a lot of flexibility to run their area the way they see fit. Sometimes there are thing you have no control over and someone else make a bad decision and you end up getting blamed for it. On the other hand i did like working there , I liked the people there and they gave me some good insight into the workings of the retail business."
good,"If you are hired as a full time associate, you get all benefits after a year.  Unfortunately, Walmart rarely hires full time associate.  Management either make your work experience enjoyable or intolerable so it is hard to gauge if you are being hired at a good Walmart."
good,"The daily job responsibilities include receiving the merchandise transported to the store."
good,a empresa tem o horario bom mais o salario nao e muito bom e nao tem vale refeição.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. If you are a good worker, the opportunity to move positions is easy. Great benefits for full time and part time associates. Most stores hardly hire full time, it is an acquired thing by proving yourself,unless its an office position."
good,"Management was a nightmare, there was too much friction between overnight management and day management to make the work enjoyable. I did not mind the consistency of the hours however the consistency got a little tiring."
good,"Working at walmart in my personal opinion could have been a lot better, management most definitely left a lot to be desired, but I learned how to prevent and deter theft there at the store and the proper guidelines and policies regarding the position(s) I was in; the culture there was diverse but I enjoyed working with the vast majority of the people there, but the hardest part of the job was trying to make it past the unrealistic expectations required of you, but i would have to say that working with the people that i worked with made it more bearable than it otherwise would've been."
good,Wal-Mart has its pros and cons while working their. A typical day is basically taking care of the customers. Sometimes they think you suppose to work all day everyday.
good,"Em relação ao Brasil, vem enfrentado algumas dificuldades no atendimento aos seus Clientes Internos e Externos, cedendo espaços importantes à concorrência e uma clara desaceleração das vendas com lojas que apresentam uma Queda no Padrão de Limpeza, Organização e Mix, apesar de praticar bons preços."
good,At the time working at Walmart was ok.  The chance for advancement was minimal.  Now I've notice lately that employees are paid so much better and treated better.  The problem managers are no long employed at Walmart. I am considering returning to work at Walmart.
good,"It you need a paycheck,it well work..Benifits are not to bad...plan on working every Holiday and weekend's though. ........................... ......!"
good,The experience at Wal-Mart Logistics is fully based on which area you work in and how competitive the area is.  The managers within the warehouse vary from fully qualified managers with previous experience to managers with 1 year with the company and no previous experience of management.  This creates a rift within management and that rift is passed onto the associates in the form of unnecessary stress and blame.  I would recommend working here if you are a hard worker with strong emotional intelligence and are working towards a better opportunity.  There is a high amount of turnover in the warehouse and the effect is felt in lost incentives and poor training.
good,"Was an alright job it was just the store was all over it felt like. also, had to talk to three managers about getting time off before anything happened."
good,my position pays well... i like it it is pretty fast paced we have to do things really fast. we do get a lot of work done on a typical day but all in all we work pretty hard.
good,"Walmart is fast paced . I worked in automotive taking orders, checking out customers all while stocking shelves.  It can be fun or stressful all in one day."
good,I have nothing to say about this company it is what it is I have not worked there in over 10 years. the day I left until this there has not been much changes
good,"Management could be more stable. Lot of people work there, so naturally drama takes a front seat to efficiency at work. Plenty of opportunities to move departments."
good,"A typical Day at Wal-Mart is fairly standard and doesn't change much from day to day, so it is a fairly low stress work environment excepting an unruly customer."
good,"Each day starts at a high pace and ends the same way. I've learned better people skills and structure importance. Management is fair but continues to have a revolving door at that level. The culture has changed along with a lot of new faces. The hardest part of the job is to find consistency among all shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to adapt, grow as a leader and relay a game plan that works."
good,I enjoyed my time here. Management was very unorganized. I was constantly bouncing between departments with no real sense of direction. The pay and benefits were great.
good,"Hard working I was cashier but I did what ever they ask for it cleaning, zoning. For release they always forgot they just care about customers if they tell us what ever they like we can not complain about it."
good,"Walmart knows that competitive compensation is the way to draw in employees. Retail jobs are a dime a dozen, but the hourly rate at Walmart is simply better than most. Working in retail is not for the faint of heart and requires great people skills, one thing you will definitely develop while working as a sales associate."
good,"When working with the public you're challenged with new experiences, metting new people, having a good relationship with customers making them feel welcomed..."
good,Basic work that will keep you busy. Kept my head down only to work but issues with management came from most employees. Overall good life experience and to meet new people.
good,I work a ton of hours as a manager. There is no work/life balance & there is no since of team work. The organization of my store is chaotic to say the least
good,"As a cashier I felt as if I was a bit out of place. All the other cashiers were way older than I was and it was hard getting a long with them. I started to show my interests in advancing within the company and I felt as if the older employees would not respect/listen to me if I were to become a manager of some sort. I was young at the time, so I felt that had something to do with it. I continued to tell my managers that I was still attending college and there were certain times I wasn't able to work, however I was continually scheduled during the requested times off, week after week. I felt as if I was not being listened to and even my younger sister had the same issues nowadays which caused her to leave the company."
good,"my time as a backroom inventory associate was a lot harder than what i thought it was going to be, but i think that was cause i wasn't ready for the intense workload that was required for the job. doesn't help that it was my first job, and it demanded more than what i expected."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I worked as a service writer, i enjoyed assisting the customers. what i did not like was i was unable to receive my tips and they frequently had me working in departments that weren't mine. i was often asked to change oil which i was not compensated for."
good,I had the tools and authority to do my job and assist the customers as needed. What I have seen is Walmart has new upper level management and they are not following the Walmart culture.
good,"A typical day at work would be Unloading Frate to the sales floor."
good,leading my team to unload all the trucks before lunch giving them encouragement and positive comments. stocking the shelves neatly and at fast paste..
good,"Most of the day at work was spent putting new freight away on sales floor. customer service was a large portion of daily tasks. Performing price changes, modular resets, and merchandising seasonal items was the most enjoyable part of my time there."
good,"I would start by clocking in and do my daily checks. Return to the Loss Prevention office and scan the store for shoplifters and store employees by using the CCTV."
good,"I am reviewing the review system, I feel stars is an efficient way to communicate without forcing people to write drivel that honestly like 5 people MAY read."
good,"Wal-Mart isn't a bad job, its management that makes it hard. I enjoy my job and i like my co-workers and we all get along, honestly the experience you get here depends on your manager."
good,"Aqui aprendi bastante y sobre todo aprendi al tracto directo con los clientes, cobranza, manejo de equipo telxon, al manejo y dispensacion de medicamentos"
good,"It was a ok job, I was very active. It was a very active job you had to be fast and alert. Always had to keep a smile, and be positive, overall it was a ok job."
good,Um bom local pára trabalhar .Não tenho nada a reclamar
good,"This job is very monotonous, you no making decisions you feel forgotten inside the organization, they are worried about security but with low salaries, situation that can vary depending on the location and your post within walmart."
good,"Wal_Mart use to be a great place to work. There were no walls every employee worked all over the store with no complaints. We helped each other out, and helped customers. It is not like that anymore."
good,"Walmart was an okay job all though it was my first job, it had its ups and downs I had fun while being a Cart Pusher. Management was a little pushy about our job at the end of the day the job was done."
good,"Activo, reciprocidad, amabilidad, trabajo en equipo, respeto, tolerancia, liderazgo, ayuda."
good,Working here was okay as far as the customers but as far as having a life and working they didn't care about that for the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job are your peers and the customers.
good,To assist customers with their needs. Stock shelves and make them look neat. The hardest part of the job was the consistent schedule changes. The best part was helping customers with their needs. I learned that it is a great starter place but not meant for long term employment for me.
good,"Always under pressure with threats and intimidation. Rarely good enough even when exceeding all budget goals and expectations. Has lost their core values of respect for the individual especially at the management level. Management better treat the hourly associates right, yet upper management does not treat management the same way."
good,"A empresa é uma boa escola, mas serve apenas para iniciar a vida profissional, pois a empresa, aliás, seus gestores não valorizam o profissional com experiência, talvez por ..."
good,The job was better than what everybody was saying it was when talking about pay I mean they paid better than Meijer. I moved from a seasonal garden associate to receiving where I cut the companies time unloading trucks from 2 hours to 1 hour so they tried to keep me in receiving; that was the biggest problem with Walmart they will not move you if yo are good at where you do.
good,"I loved working at Walmart, however these Walmart needs to work on their management team... They seem to not care for their employer. The store would be ran 100% better if they better their management."
good,Everybody is all over the place. Supervisors are a little rude. Plenty staff workers. There's always an opportunity to advance in the work place. Overall a pretty cool place to work.
good,Setting up the front end for day shift and giving breaks to cashiers.We reset cash registers and drop end of shift money into a machine in accounting.  Zoning the front end and putting up all returns fro grocery's and other in store items. Taking care of customers is main priority.
good,They are not considerate about what you have going on in your life. They don't know how to communicate effectively and also do not like to work with outside work schedule. Then they always want you to go above and beyond when they don't do the same.
good,"I was happy with my job at Walmart, I really liked the people that I worked with and I didn't mind the customers most of the time, but the managers were hard to work with at times. I would still recommend working here, but keep in mind that scheduling can be difficult."
good,out of the two walmarts that i have worked at they are fun. management needs work and maybe even the pay can go up but other then that its a good place
good,I like the people I work with but its a fast paced job. Some of my fellow employees do not contribute equally to the work which ends up making it harder for the workers that do try. Overall its not a bad job.
good,For the amount of work required the pay should be more well compensated. The management was bearable to work under considering the working conditions.
good,"The further out from HO you get the less likely you are to be in a work environment that promotes the company culture. There are a few outlying stores that hold the values true but they are the exception not the rule. This company is best served by individuals who are willing to sacrifice their time, are driven to succeed and can keep a cool head under pressure. One of the major pros of working for this company is that you will rarely lack in finding good people, it may not always be the best place to work and things can be hard sometimes but you can be assured that you will find friends, good friends. If you are driven and make your intent known it is a very good company to promote in."
good,"While I do a lot more than many of my coworkers on any given day, working at Walmart has afforded me the position of gaining my pharmacy technician certification. They reimbursed me for the cost of the test and continue to reimburse me on a yearly basis for the licensure needed to perform my job."
good,"Always busy, especially in the Christmas season, and never a lack of hours. Only complaint is bad worker care. No heaters for coming in from outside to dry clothing, and no way to clean yourself."
good,My boss wouldn't work with me and the hours I needed at the time for my 3 girls. I tried to move to another department and he said I couldn't.  They needed me in sporting goods. On top of that I am a practicing Christian and attend church every Sunday and it's a family day and in the being when he hired me he said I could have it off. Then he said he needed someone to close. That wasn't going to work.
good,Under appreciate it lots of hard work not very good pay and after 2 years everyone makes the same from the laziest to the hardest workers. Currently we are getting out early not even close to 40hrs.
good,A good job for a student or someone fresh out of college starting out not an ideal job for a person with responsibility or someone who has a family or a new parent.
good,"The management team is a joke they target you if they don't like you or your religious views they let people like CSM's get bullied by ZMS the job was wonderful the hours are perfect and insurance was amazing, only issue is management and discrimination"
good,"Was an overnight stocker, hours were from 10pm-7am friendly co workers and supervisors were helpful. Was nice to help customers find what they were looking for all while performing great customer service"
good,não tem compromisso com os horários dos funcionários.
good,"while there is plenty of room for advancement, the managers dont promote on the ability to do the job well, but rather people they would want in their departments, they pay is a little less than desired to, over all its not a bad company, although there have been some changes to their policies that i dont nessacerialy agree with like their attendance point system."
good,"Los días laborales honestamente son muy monótonos, se vuelve bastante tediosa la rutina, sin embargo es un trabajo relativamente sencillo y está lleno de compañeros, se podría decir que el ambiente laboral es bueno, si algo,saque en mi paso por walmart es que todos los empleados allí son como una familia, un gran equipo de trabajo."
good,"Working at Walmart is not the worst thing ever. The people you work with are great and you'll make a lot of friends. The pay could be better though. Also management can be a bit split at times on what they would like you to do. Example: One manager could tell you to do one thing, then along comes another and redirects you."
good,"I have mixed feelings on Walmart. I feel management is not the greatest and there is little to no ability to move. They also avoid making people full time at all costs which is part of the reason I am searching for new work. Overall I like my co-workers and managers as people, but it is not a very promising job. I did learn a lot working here the past 2 years. I started in electronics and got familiar with doing re-mods, inventory, and stock. Then I became a cashier where I got to interact with people everyday. I got very good with customer service. Finally I moved to where I am now the pharmacy. This is my favorite position so far. It is fast paced with many different jobs to do. Overall I learned a lot from Walmart I just can't stand the way hours and pay are managed."
good,Walmart is an okay job. The work isn't too bad and the pay isn't horrible. People are decent and fun to be around. Some policies seem to be confusing and are enforced at random moments.
good,A normal day in Photo lab (depending on what time I clock in) is that I'm required to Pre-op the printer and start printing the photo orders from overnight and putting them away in envelopes with the order name tag. I am also required to zone Photo departments and Stationary and Stock these area as well if necessary. If low on staff I can help up front ringing out costumers.
good,It was alright working for Wal-Mart. It changes from the last time I worked there. Few of my friends still work there and they aren't to happy with the way it's ran.
good,"hours vary and management don't really care out the person at all, if you get into management that's were the pay is otherwise an hourly associate will not get paid much or get hours they want."
good,I wouldn’t mind working for this company again. needs a few improvements when it comes to management and the communication between associates. None the less I enjoyed my time with my customers very much.
good,"Terrible management, co-workers, and environment. When I first started I was given no training and was expected to know about everything even though it was my second day. A lot of the employees there are rude and inconsiderate. Management was always rude no matter."
good,As an Unloader/Cap 2 Associate my experience is mostly enjoyable at Wal-Mart.  I spend most of my time working with coworkers that quickly became friends.  Most days follow a set routine of unloading a truck or two and then stocking until it is time to pull the remaining freight to the floor for the overnight shift to finish stocking.  It is a job that is simple to learn but requires a lot of hard work to finish on time.
good,As a employee with Walmart I was a cashier .On the job I had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful customers .I also enjoyed working in the garden center as a sales associate .
good,"15 yrs over all good place to work hours were good shifts were good they did fun activities for the families, vacation time was good, and raises were decent"
good,Most co workers are nice but most are mean and management doesn't care for its workers they yell at their employees majority of the time most are gone within a hour and never stick you and one place always have people moving departments they choose who they like
good,"Pretty good job, enjoy the cardio for constantly run back and forth from the store to the parking lot. Co worker were fun to work with. Plus the had a Subway inside."
good,"Fun environment at times, poorly run by management. Always short staffed which pushed the current staff to truly haul butt which wasn't always a bad thing, made the day go by quick."
good,"Dentre vários pontos favoráveis, talvez tenha faltado experiência na função de alguns diretores; pois esta região não está acostumada a um sistema que já é normal em várias cidades brasileiras e do exterior."
good,"management shows favoritism, workplace is highly unorganized. Typical day at work consists of you working in any other department other than your own due to number of call ins daily."
good,In my experience at Wal-Mart I was forced to learn fast. I am a fast learner but had never even worked a register but was over all cashiers. I also was there for the building of shelves and stocking of shelves in the new building which was hard work.
good,A good job to start with. Not really good to stay. For the most part its easy to get alone with everyone. The day goes by pretty fast. As long as you do your job you should have a great time.
good,Company was great to provide advancement opportunities. Typical work alone as a department Manager needed more help. Competitive pay for the Management .
good,"I have worked with the company for almost 4 years, the  coworkers are awesome but A LOT of drama in the workplace The company is a great first job, I don't see it as a permanent job. They work with flexible scheduling for college students."
good,buenas relaciones laborales en cuanto al ambiente de trabajo.
good,I learned many things for example the codes on the product and more computer skills. Honestly the jobs i worked wasnt really bad it was easy. I enjoyed talking with the customers and welcoming them to walmart and they seem to like me cause i am a very talkative person.
good,I was promised to be hired on to a supervising position in the front end (cashier) but after almost two  months I had to quite because that wasn't the case.
good,"The daily work is pretty simple to do. There is alot of heavy lifting in certain positions. "
good,Managers are not there to really help you or help defend you against anyone. They will customers attack you then take their side.  Don't accept doctor notes as an excuse for an absence which by law they are suppose to.
good,Walmart was my first job. It was harder to get used to at first but easy to get the hang of. The only thing was we only got 10 minutes smoke breaks and they were real strict on time
good,Good place but management needs more knowledge.looking for new.career. I want to be in a company where I can grow up in the.company. I want to be recognized for.what I do.
good,The company was good however depending on the time of year can be overwhelming during busy season. The pay was better than other retail jobs I have held because it started above min wage and the raises were comparable.
good,"I worked at Walmart my freshman year in college. They did not work with my school schedule, but the people I did work with made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Although it was a good few years working here, my progress at building skills have come to a stand still. Not much left to learn from. The biggest benefactor of working here was how flexible the were with an individuals hours."
good,I learned a lot about what it takes to have a job and keep it. Walmart was one of the first jobs that I have had for an extended period of time. It was definitely a beneficial experience.
good,The job wasn't that bad but the pay should have been higher for the expectations. Getting a weekend off was like pulling teeth (unless you were part of management)
good,You meet friendly and some rude people. You have opportunities to move up in the company. You might have to do other work besides your own assign worrk
good,Being a cashier was kind of fun being that you get to meet new people everyday. Walmart is actually a really good place to go grocery shopping. I would work there again but just not the one i worked at.
good,"Walmart was okay for the most art. I did not like working third shift though. I tried to get switched way before I had quit but management was unwilling to do so. I wanted to switch after my daughter was born so I could have more time to spend with my family and help my wife the newborn baby, instead of sleeping all day.I did enjoy the work itself; I stayed busy from time I got there from the time I left."
good,"Do whatever you have to do to be at work do it!!!!! If you miss work because you're sick you run the risk of loss of your job, You have to learn how to stay on task or move fast."
good,hay muy buen ambiente y me gusto estar de cajera y el trato con el cliente.
good,Very busy and on the move job. Bringing merchandise out. Zoning a lot. Getting returns becoming register trained so hopefully you can pick up more hours. Management could be way better.
good,"you start the day running around trying to find the stuff they trained you to use. then you run around trying to finish all the task that they give you to do. stressful"
good,"Enjoyed serving people and helping them find the most for their dollar. A typical day at work was helping people find what they needed, allthewhile keeping in mind their needs, as opposed to wants, and the money they were spending. I actually learned a lot about dealing with the public and politely guiding, or, correcting them in a nice manner. Management and I developed a relationship that I felt was very profitable for all parties involved. Culture, well, most probably compatible to most very large retail outlets. The hardest part about the job was most probably having to give a customer assistance and information and finding they could not totally grasp the meaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was binding with fellow employees, and for the most part, the clients. Many of which returned to the store and searched me out to help them."
good,Corporate executives will belittle your work and your leadership.  They have no regards for the amount of time and effort you put into your team and the amount of time and energy you have lost from your family.  They will threaten your job and livelyhood as quick as a handshake.  They grow you from the beginning and help you get as high as you can and then wont let you go backward.  Tough ending after spending 15 years in the industry
good,Management was absolutely terrible. Unrealistic expectations and a lot of pressure to make impossible demands. Coworkers are always fun and work hard. Great teamwork
good,Great company. I learned a lot of things with the company and met great people and enjoyed my customers on a daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and also meeting wonderful new people. Nothing was hard about my job to me.
good,"Come in and getting started with little training but I do use the skills from my last job to get me through. I've always known to make sure my customers stay happy. No communication with management hard to find one. The culture of this place is great! Sometimes the hardest part of the job can be trying to figure out some things, but I do. What I enjoy about this place the most is customers and employees. My last year in high school its hard to work for this company when in high school especially for those who need and really want to work and learn responsibility."
good,"Walmart use to be a great place to work but with so many job cuts and the expectation of one person to do the work of 5 it's exhausting. Not to mention the poor management and very little pay. However, I love the hours and flexibility for time off."
good,A typical day at work is extremely busy for me. I learn something new about the company everyday considering I'm usually always in a different area of the store most days. I've learned how to manage large areas with complete chaos occurring. There is not really an extremely hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping my customers and working alongside my fellow co-workers
good,"Worst problem working at Walmart is there will always be more work than there is time to get it done. It is not a horrible job, but it can be stressful continuously being given more tasks but not the time to get it done, then being lectured for not getting it done."
good,the managers got the associates to do nthe stock job Plus the job for they were suppose to be doing themselves and half the time the managers are no where to be found
good,The Walmart location that I was privileged to work at has excellent customer service. We always took care of the customers needs and assisted in any way that we could to make sure their experience was pleasant in our store.
good,"Walmart is where you get a job plain and simple.  You go to work, do your job, and you go home.  A career is suppose to be something you enjoy, so if you do not have plans to move up in management, do not expect to love your job at Walmart."
good,Not a bad place for students to work.  Put in your 8 hrs and go home but you will get called to come in a lot as well. The people you work with will make it a great experience or a horrible one all depends on your own attitude.
good,"nice job for 1st time job or a second part time job... most people where easy to work with and as long as you are dependable and reliable enough to get things done in a timely orderly manner, they usually just leave you to get things done with little to no hassle."
good,"Walmart TLE in Great Bend Kansas was Always Short handed 90% of the time, some days it was nice when it was slow and so we could catch up on cleaning and just BS."
good,Wal-Mart is always looking for new hires. three shifts available. full and part time available. on job training. incentives given throughout time worked.
good,"Not alot of room for advancement, but does have a reasonable schedule but expect most holidays just like regular retail service jobs, management has since changed so job may have improved"
good,I like it but managers dont really do there jobs and they dont really care if u are sick and need time off ....once they hire u they threaten to fire 24/7 other than that great place to work if u have a good support team and staff
good,"Overall, my experience with Walmart has been a good one. I've been treated fairly, and I like that my hours can fluctuate. The only issue I have is that they seem to only want to place you where they want you, and it doesn't always matter what you want."
good,It was a good place to work for part-timers.  A typical day at work was good.  I learned a great deal of retail work and management was good.  Workplace culture was awesome.
good,Friendly enviroment but bad customer service. Need of a bigger lunch area. Needs to teach employees to communicate with new hires. Has great items for sale and has them for really low prices.
good,"My location is in the heart DC, thus providing a very diverse clientele. The security is mediocre the management is sub par. If the managers do not like you, you will not succeed."
good,"It is an ok place to work, Nice building to work in and dress code isn';t bad,  There is no logic in some people and you never work in just one place .  SHould expect to work over the entire store"
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you do not have anything else to to do with your life meaning going to school or hanging out with friends this job will consume your whole day and. When you do have days off you will b extremely tired but it is good if work if your main focus
good,"My short work experience with Walmart did not give me much to be proud of.  When I signed up, my goal was to work full time for an extended period of time; however, this was not the case as I was never able to have my forty hours per week of work."
good,I did everything from stocking to cashier to pushing carts to helping people with their groceries. Got to work with some good people. Very low stress job.
good,"Was a good job for a hard time in my life. I worked here as a teenager in high school as well. easy work for low pay, basically everything you would expect from a large retailer."
good,"The management at my location sucks. I give them suggestions and they act so nonchalant towards it. The store manager and Asst. Managers do no see eye to eye. As a CSM, they want you to do the impossible. Its always short staffed in several areas when they can hire people in which they do not! What I make as a CSM is fair but should get more of how managment work me"
good,"A typical day at work had at least 1 break. However, it was always busy and crowded even as a cashier. Probably the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers, however, there were also some customers that were kind and liked to make jokes which was fun. It was also difficult to be in the cigarette lane because I did not know what different cigarettes were."
good,"Walmart isn't really a bad company. I don't mind people either, just I feel I could do better for customers if I just try really hard. But it's not that bad depending on the store and it's area. I worked for Walmart as a cashier and I didn't mind people at all. Though there is people that aren't very pleasant but sometimes you may never know how they are feeling. I work very hard and try to keep myself busy as much as possible. People compliment me saying Walmart isn't the job line I should be in cause of evil people but It's my duty and what I signed up for. I work for what I vowed to do for the store."
good,"A typical day at work is consisting of taking care of customers in a friendly and fast manner. Working at Wal-Mart you'll learn customer service. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are having a bad day, but also the most enjoyable is meeting that one customer who makes your day with the little things and their stories."
good,The management at this location was rude most of the time. I stayed there to support myself in college but left because of personal issues and the management was hard to handle everyday.
good,Worked midnight shift. Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves. Management was poor in my opinion. Departments had to be stripped and cleaned and although it was not a hard job it was time consuming. It was nice working nights. You were able to get your work done without having to deal with the customer crowd.
good,Wal-mart while had a semi-great environment the pay was good for the amount of work they demanded while I was there. things might've changed since it has been a while since I worked there.
good,Management was the downside to this company. Co-wrokers and customers were really friendly but the management micromanaged and degraded. Overall liked working at Walmart.
good,"This job was very laid back, fun and free yet productive. The training class is LONG and unnecessary honestly, but required for multiple reasons. I don't like how you can't request a schedule change until ONE YEAR of working the awful late shift."
good,No siguen sus propias políticas y sus líneas de ética solo son para poder fingir que ayudan a los asociados
good,Nao ha muitas oportunidades de crescimento na empresa
good,"Empresa grande mas com muitos defeitos, experiência assustadora onde aprendi a lidar com diversos perfis de pessoas em questão profissional."
good,Nice working with a brand like Walmart. Only thing lacking would be the wages when compared to Costco. Will look forward for the advancement with increase in pay.
good,"My typical day at work would be to get the electric cart pusher and to start loading carts onto it and bringing them inside the store. At times I would help customers with merchandise or take their carts for them. "
good,i love the other people i work with but management often expects a lot out of one person. Other than that it is a very friendly environment and there is very fair breaks and lunch times.
good,Great way of communicating with customers and assisting them in the produce and dairy departments. My team working skills improved being that there were several employees working along side myself.
good,Its fine but as a female working in the back andme personally they made me do most jobs for men like breaking down boxes in the machine. Once I got slapped in the eye with the wired and the manager said too bad it's your fault. I didn't really feel respected as a person so I just left.
good,Working at walmart is different than any other job I have had. I enjoy the pace that I get to set for myself. I am able to embrace my own strengths to push through a hard trailer.
good,I primarily worked at the same location every day but there were 2 nearby stores that I was also sent to to help hen needed. Everything about working there depended on the stores location and its management team. A good location with a good management team generally resulted in a good team of employees and a very pleasant work experience. On the other hand some stores had a very poor management team that would usually result in a disorganized store with a lot of missing stock caused both by the employees not doing their jobs correctly and theft that was both not stopped and not being properly accounted for. In my experience it was either a pleasure to work at a location or you dreaded going to work on a daily basis.
good,"En términos de pago, siempre al dia, no existen atrasos, el pago es bajo, considerando la alta demanda de trabajo, la parte gerencial alejada de los trabajadores, oportunidades de crecimiento hay, pero el sueldo no acompaña"
good,"Walmart keeps downsizing, which means they have less people with less hours to do the same amount of work. It is a constant fight to get enough hours. When you go to other departments for extra hours, your department complains because they want to keep you available to fill in for emergencies. Little regard for breaks and lunches."
good,"Wal-Mart was a great store to work at for the few first years i was there. After a while, managment and associates just stopped caring. Before there use to be harder ways to get into a position as well as drug tests."
good,"Job was okay, pay was decent, with opportunity to move up, Friendly environment, and management could use a little work. also benefits after working a full year."
good,"Doing your job isn't good enough. This is a company where you have to be in the know to advance. I've held different management positions with Walmart. After stepping down for personal reason, they made it next to impossible to move back up."
good,Buen ambient espto por algunos gerentes hay mucha limpiesa mucha revisiones
good,"Was a job I needed at the time and I fell in love with it. I felt like I was born for retail after being there for alittle while. But the place when I was there was pretty bad management wise. A lot of only promoting friends. I was promised a position for more than a year and was passed over by the store managers best friend in a different city. Which is the reason I left, but the job did teach me a lot about retail and running a business."
good,"A typical day at work involved mainly stocking shelves and dealing with the occasional customer. I learned much about how a retail store operated behind the scenes; including: unloading, stocking, merchandising, and freight organization. The management and staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful. I don't want to say that there was anything particularly difficult about the job, considering how helpful the staff is. The most enjoyable part of my job there was dealing with the customers, whether it be helping a customer find an item or even just striking up a conversation with the passing customer."
good,"This job is a decent job because of the atmosphere. The team of people that I work with are very fun, energetic, and helpful. A typical work day includes zoning product for an hour and then we unload the truck Once we finish that we take our first 15 minute break and come back to work before taking hour lunch break.Once we come back from lunch we continue to work until the end of our shift, stocking inventory and backroom work."
good,Though many people enjoy working at Walmart and there is much opportunity for advancement. It is simply not the environment for me. I would prefer a much more stable and organized work environment.
good,"Walmart as well all know is a very big company, they are so big that they forget they have internal talent, and even employees with Master's Degree. Its easy to move up but, management positions are very stressfull."
good,"The division of the Walmart.com corporation does not exist any longer. All of this was moved to Ark. So, nothing to review at this time. It was a huge learning experience for me."
good,"I worked out in the tire and lube center so I didn't have to deal with too much customer stuff and the work was always interesting, but there was this whole air of just....dilapidation..about the place."
good,"Wal-Mart is not where I could see myself growing as an employee. I need more job stability, and I really need better wages to take better care of my family."
good,Very diverse customer base which allows for growth in dealing with people and developing people skills.  Due to the pace of the business it makes other similar jobs seem easy.  Work life balance as a member of management is not so good as the expectation is that the business comes first.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the people were fun and enjoyable to be around, but it was a stressful work environment at times. Leadership changed often, and then the roles changed along with it, many people felt unknowledgeable in their roles. The pay was not enough for what was required of the job duties."
good,flexible hours for students. low wages. managers are overbearing and suck at following availability. coworkers are great people and understand the walmart struggle.
good,It pays for what i need to pay for as a part time employe still in school and living at home. I mostly stayed because of the good friends i made there
good,"I've worked at Walmart for years and while I can't particularly say I have enjoyed my time there, but it is not the worst place to work. I do enjoy my coworkers!"
good,A typical day at work is helping customers with questions they may have about a location for an item and details about the product. The main thing is getting the customers in and out with having all they need.
good,"There was no typical day as a cashier. I did different tasts almost every other day. I learned patience, always smile even at idiots, do not let customers get to you, do not let your personal life affect your business life. There were not enough managers and the assistant manager did not know what she was doing and it did not help that she was bipolar and favored hispanics. It was hard to know when you could talk to her. The workplace was okay with the coworkers. The hardest part about the job was not having enough managers and getting blamed for only having 3 to managers for the whole building. The most enjoyable part was helping customers when needed and the Walmart family"
good,"The Market Manager job consisted of touring stores daily for store operations, inventory control, customer service and talent development.  In this position, you learn multiple aspects of the company: financial planning, strategy planning, change management, HR ethics/compliance, inventory control/shrink, new store operations, innovations.  Walmart culture is of team work, individuals to not succeed teams do, customer is always right and the associates make the difference. Interacting with the associates, training/developing your team and seeing the positive results is the most rewarding.  The challenge was due to the fast pace of the company was managing time between work and personal."
good,"As a jewelry associate, I got a different experience than most cashiers or other departments received. My department didn't have many employees and the manager organized the shifts to everyone's availability. I was the only night person. So I didn't have much of a social life. The jewelry department also helped with the shoe department and children's department. So it was 3 departments in one. This helped build my customer service and organizational skills since I wasn't just in one department all day."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, but often felt stepped on and taken advantage of by my co-workers and associates. The management at Store #920 is absolutely horrible and act like high school children."
good,Very busy place. Its nice because you get to talk to people from all walks of life. And you have the chance to put a smile on their face even for a little while. The management wasn't the best.
good,Management does not take the time to really listen.  Overall the companyis pretty good at helping someone advance up into thr company. You can develop your customer service skills.
good,"I would go to work get on my register wait on customers as they came in my line. I would do money transfer, cash checks, and do exchanges and refunds on items that customers wanted to exchange or refund."
good,"Would work for them again, they treat customers and employees decent and better since new rules went into effect I worked for 3 stores 4 times over 7 years and some good some bad. But overall decent company to work for. They could care more about people than money but we all know who Walmart is...."
good,A typical day at Walmart was never organized cause you have like 3 different supervisors telling you to do three different things. I learned patients and I learn discipline
good,I have worked here for 3 months I did not get trained very well and the manager is pretty rude she was cussing at me over a misunderstanding. I work back in the deli and the job is easy. It's the people that make it hard to work for.
good,"About half the people I worked with were worth anything. I had some great managers, but they couldn't do their best because they were being stopped by upper management, e.i. store manager. There were so many chances to do great things that were stopped by higher management. The work load they give you can be ridiculous for one person to bear. Each department should really have a manager then 2 underlings. I know it has changed now, but from what I've heard I'm not sure its for the better. Although their instock now is simply beautiful and I am surely jealous, being an ex-grocery manager."
good,"Culture changed drastically while I was working, lots of opportunity within the company.  There was alot of great training within the store.  Team was awesome in Selinsgrove PA still miss that bunch"
good,"This was my first part-time job forever ago, and for what it was worth the money wasn't that bad. That said, the management at the time cared little to nothing for the employees. "
good,"Great pay, no work life balance. Pressure to pressure workers is ver high. Strong top down management..................................................."
good,"Not the best place to work. They will ask you to help in other departments,those who show great work will be taken advantage of with same compensation as those who hide in the aisles and milk the clock."
good,"Each night we get an assignment that must be done at a certain time . "
good,"Management at this company is not the best, but you will not be overloaded on the work schedule. You get good hours, but you also get flexibility with time off if you need it. It can be hard on your feet, but if you like working with others or dealing customers this could be a fun place to work."
good,I've been working here going on 5yrs and the new hirers making just as much and i'm making i think the ones that been there longer should at least make a Dollar more.
good,"Easy to promote within, good pay and benefits, you can transfer within the company where ever you want to go, globally which is pretty neat, but the higher up management is disconnected with individual stores, and its not ran fairly or consistently."
good,On the go from start to finish 12 hr days in management usually ended up being 14-15 hr days. very stressful. Fast paced always being pulled in different direction. I loved the people I worked with and I like being busy.
good,"My day generally​ started with walking the store making sure items were secure, checking that the store was adhering to safety standards. Then by lunch I would start mointoring ptz cameras and patrolling for shoplifters."
good,"The work you do is standard retail. Stock the shelves, work in the inventory systems. Help customers. It's all fine. The real dynamic thing about this job are the people. Managers, coworkers, and customers. Some are really awesome to work with or help out. However, some people you work with, you may hate. It is very hard to get rid of a person, especially a manager (this didn't personally happen to me). It's aggravating, I had to personally file a harassment claim. Overall, the pay is better than what else I've had in college, getting paid time off is nice too."
good,"Working in this field I have learned various skills which I believe will help me in the future. However, the organization and follow through with the managing staff is a bit unsettling. They lack communication and drive which ultimately causes the store to become hectic and unorganized at times."
good,Good business ethics are essential for the long-term success of an organization it influence on all levels of business improve business that will change lives.
good,"It was Wal-Mart. Entry level zone management and not much more. It was a slightly down place to work, and there isn't a whole lot of hype or pressure to perform."
good,"Working at Walmart has been an experience that I would not have the desire to experience again. In the beginning work for the company was very friendly, then after a few months things did not go as smoothly. Main issue is had was management."
good,"As a student working part-time at Walmart, it's a fun workplace to work at.  I work at customer service desk and my manager is great. She is very understanding and work every-well with all her workers."
good,"I do customer service, work freight, do claims for damaged merchandise. Unload  truck. I learnt how to work as a team, management was good, the hardest part of the job is not having the other team doing their part, the most enjoyable part of the job is completing the job on time and getting appreciated."
good,Working at kilgore walmart was an absolute nightmare. they seemed to cherrish the lazy and throw out the hard working employees. They didnt commend or appreciate the individuals who worked hard.
good,"Physical work is never a problem while working for the company. I learn new things every day pertaining to my job description. The management needs improvement, but that does not prevent me from doing my daily routines."
good,"its a good job with decent pay, However there is very little structure as far as management is concerned. in the three months i spent there, i never finished training and most of the job was spent helping customers, as the complicated aspects of the job are rarely explained or given to new employees"
good,"Too many inconsistencies from direct store management."
good,"It is a good day at work. I love my job but sometimes my ideas are not taken in consideration since I am not a salaried member of management. I usually have orientation about twice a week. The rest of the week I am in charge of the training of employees, reviewing application, and helping employees with any PTO time"
good,Unprofessional and low on staff and under pay for the ones that picked up extra work loads. Management did not respond to customer's problems quickly.
good,Stocking pretty much most of the day with the exception of daily price changes if they come up! Use first in first out to insure quality for the customer
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work! The fact that you can help someone everyday is great. They pay is okay, although I think it would be better if we could get overtime. It's always someone you can go to if you need help with anything, although not all associate are eager to help, most are!"
good,I started as a cart runner and worked my way up to Night Shift Manager. It was good for my first job. if you are fresh out of school it is a good place to start.
good,"overall the company is okay, but they could use some more professional development. The quality of the supplies can also be better. the managers really do care about your growth in the company."
good,It's an okay company. I loved the people I worked with just it was to much. They kept changing there policy I didn't like that.  They had favorites there because some people there should've been fired a long time ago.
good,"Store usually very busy, lots of customers to help, learn where all the items are located in store. Managers are very helpful in assisting you with any issues you may have. Hardest part is telling a customer we don't have an item in stock. Most enjoyable is putting a smile on a customer's face."
good,A great place to get experience with fork lift operating with out going way out of your way for certs and classes very easy going work enviroment great people
good,The management seems overwhelmed with what is on there plate. You don't get any time with them. You can lose your job for not being fast enough. They will tell you that it never happens but I have seen two instances of older employees losing jobs over production.
good,"I've work for Walmart in different locations. Due to the turnover due from my experience. The expectations are to high with the shortness of staff. The pressure overwhelms most employee and managers the the break of exhaustion. Though there are some good benefits like medical, the options of growing in the company and bonus. But the managing is very poor."
good,"It was a very nice place to work.  However, I wish that it was busier.  The pharmacist manager makes all the difference.  The pharmacy manager @ store 5*78 delegated too much authority to the head technician and to an idiot she brought over from Walgreens.   That spelled disaster.   Constant passive aggressiveness, whining, intimidations, and incessant condescending, disrespectful, bullying behavior from Sr.. Tech and the idiot creating a hostile environment.  And the worst part was that it started to rub off on to the 1st year intern, you can see the rude, disrespectfulness starting to surface from her."
good,you work holidays and your schedule is rarely set to be the same everyday or week.You could work late one night and have to be back by 8am the next day.
good,"Overall, working at Walmart has taught me how to communicate better and to better serve customers, and how to manage time to accomplish daily tasks as well as assisting customers."
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't the best experience in my life but it wasn't the worst. How I see it is that it was easy money, (start up pay is $9 per hour), and that's about it. As a self-check out cashier my job was to maintain a steady flow of customers using the self-checkouts along with keeping customers from stealing products. Walmart is a good way to get back in gear if you hadn't worked in a while and are needing some money to get you by, schedule won't be great, but money will."
good,"While I do not normally agree with Walmart, their values/morals, and policy, this particular store had good people. It was a fun place to work at 20 years old, and I learned a lot about myself."
good,Customer service money handler greeter good place to work manager was great working with customers was friendly and breaks on time.hours was not enough
good,"Acceptable, flexible schedules,"
good,"Schedules were made up to three weeks in advance, so you and your family can plan days off, doctors appointments, etcetera. Good people to work with and work for. Store was top heavy with management. I worked in a small store and had five- six assistant managers. Each one had their own ideas which often conflicted with plans of other managers."
good,"it's a wonderful environment, management could be better , but overall it's a good place to work. Good benefits and you get paid time off! Love the staff."
good,"Be prepared to be told to work fast. "
good,"A typical day of work is to try to get all your tasks done by a reasonable amount of time without Management griping at you. I learned how to be quick with my job. Management could have been better. Workplace Culture was eh, Hardest part of my job was trying to do the best I possibly humanly could and was still not good enough for management. Most enjoyable part of my job was to seeing all my coworkers."
good,"I felt that upper management could have backed up the decisions of their supervisors more in dealing with customers. "
good,Everybody shops at Walmart stores. I personally felt that we were severely understaffed. I started working for this company back in 2003. Over the years I noticed a gradual decline in the number of employees they required to run the business. This greatly increased the responsibilities of the workers and decreased the amount of customer service we were able to provide to our customers.
good,The pay was good for my first job a nine dollars an hour. I was a cart pusher which meant manual labor but not too much. It was an overall fun experience and I recommend it.
good,I got to work in the morning feeling like.....I clock in and get ready to start stocking the best part about my job is that i have fun working with others.
good,I loved working there it's the job that becomes a career & I had a supervisor and management staff that went above and beyond. I hope that I would have had a more fulfilling experience.
good,"Nice to see new faces daily as well as the regulars. smiling at customers and meeting their needs is always a plus, it tends to make the customer return to the store for more perches."
good,"When working for Walmart, it's hard work yet will keep you busy. It's hard at times because you won't get the help you need and may fall behind. But it's nice to get though the day."
good,"The work place was very good. There was only a little drama but that is to be expected in any environment. The only thing I would disapprove of would be, being laid off without a very good explanation."
good,"Great place to work while you are in school, but not as a career. Generally the co-workers are nice. The jobs are mostly simple. The hardest part is advancement."
good,"The job is stressful because of the customers. The pharmacy techs wanted to do only pharmacy tech jobs. One or two other people besides me would be willing to help the cashier. The manager at the time would snap at employees because of the stress. The pay was less than what other companies would pay. If you signed up for the insurance, but had to take a leave of absence your insurance was cut off. One co worker would get upset when I was asked to work a front register. She would say ""Why pay her pharmacy tech wages to fill in for a cashier up front?"" The hours were ok. I worked Mon., Thurs.,Fri., Sat., Sun., 1pm-9pm (weekdays) and 8am to 6pm ("
good,"A typical night shift at work would be hard working, enjoyable co workers, nice customers, but really angry managers with no manners and taking their personal lives out on others I learned that a smile always can make even the saddest person smile back. The culture was very diverse, the hardest part of working there was staying awake because i worked grave yard shift.The most enjoyable was making people smile ."
good,"Fun work environment, big management team who were always encouraging to strive, learn continuously and succeed. Willing to train in desired position/department, as long as basic  required product knowledge was accurately obtained and without error."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, but management was a mess. The workload was sometimes tremendous for the people management knew  would work hard, while they let the lousy employees do less than the bare minimum. Other than that it was a decent job"
good,"good with scheduling and overall "
good,Good company for someone wanting to start out making more than minimum wage and looking for overtime hours when available throughout the company during hot season
good,Job advancement is tough.  The compensation sucks for those that have been there for a number of years as new hires get paid almost as much as people who have been there for 5+ years.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad company to work for at all,especially overnights. The pay is good and the people are usually really cool. If you just do your job and don't slack off it's so much easier,you can really see the difference."
good,"I used to work outside pushing the carts mostly,had to maintain the stores amount on cart . they gave some gear for rainy days and sunscreen for sunny days . managements are nice  people, and id say my favorite time was break .but yeah"
good,"If your new going into this job then it'll be easy for you. But if you have job experience it's hard. If your new, you have 4 points to spend until you get fired. Wrong! You get fired at 3.5 and then they lie saying you can reapply in 3 months when it's 6 months. And if your sick don't call in, just go in puking your guts up. If you call in and show you have proof you went to the doctor they don't care, they won't help you by trying to wipe that point out for you (same goes for your kids if they got sick). They just don't care. They'll also skip out on people that have been there for three years and give a management position to someone who's only been for 6 months with no previous management skills. Just watch out if you apply."
good,I enjoyed helping the customers at Walmart. A typical day involved checking out customers back to back. I learned to call customers by their names.  Management gave the associates cook outs on special appreciation days. The hardest part of the job as a cashier was the alcohol training program.
good,"I love working with Walmart. Meeting new people and helping customers find what they need in a timely manner not only helps them but allows and enables them to want to come back. Learning the customer service desk was quite a challenge, but with great management I was able to fully assist customers in a rightly manner. Being part of the Walmart team has taught me so many lessons about self worth, and compassion. Always putting the customers needs first and assisting them in whatever way possible has allowed me to become the best Walmart employee I can be."
good,walmart in general has terrible managment and is unorganized. they never have the right amount of cashiers so they take the floor people and take us away from doing our jobs and when we dont finish our jobs we get in trouble.
good,"Working at walmart is like any other part time job. However, management can be very unprofessional and demanding by giving a workload without taking into account shift length and management can also pick/play favorites with other associates."
good,"better leadership needed, better pay, always short staffed. this job was very consuming of your every day life but well worth it if you care about great customer service"
good,"Could use better management to help progress the willing team members wanting to advance in the industry "
good,"it was a good job, benefits are decent. They will give you hours, and the pay raise just went up also. Again it's a good start in life depending on if you like that type of work."
good,Wal-Mart is one of the most stressful jobs I have every had. The paid is good which is a positive but the way they treat you is unbearable overnight is worst they work like crazy and they do the most for little of nothing you got manager that talk crazy to their workers and don't appreciate them for their hard work and you got store manager that doesn't care for the store just wanting to have power and over use it. so is Wal-Mart a good place for the money yes and no. yes because it's pay is good but no on a respectable level.
good,No balance for home and work life. Live and breath Walmart everyday no matter what is going on in your life. Attended work daily but was not able to get any help with the bending over the conveyor belt when scanning items that caused a lot of back pain and management did not provide back braces fro cashiers. Had to be a personal purchase.
good,"The job is okay, but the requirements are a little much. There are constantly people getting promoted around you that have much less experience than yourself. I don't complain much, but I have been here for almost 9 years and all but 1 review has been exceeds expectation, yet the people getting promoted are ones just doing the minimum. Sometimes, it seems that recognition for a job well done is non existent."
good,You will have to pay attention to they instruction that's given to you . You have to learn how to deal with the customers. You have to follow their rules.
good,"When i worked at Walmart it wasn't stressful but just very boring the benefits were okay but generally i would just say its a place to go to if you really need a job and in a hurry."
good,At Wal-Mart we strive to meet expectations and meet company goals by working together as a team to ensure that efficiency and productivity is high while maintaining excellent customer service.
good,hardest part was nobody liked to laugh or joke around at all. everyone was too serious all the time. i felt like the life of the party for walmart while there.
good,"wal mart is not a place of high expectations. the job is tedious, people are rude, and no one ever cleans up after themselves. The company does have a lot of perk programs"
good,"Its not a horrible place to work for. It has it's benefits just like any other job. As long as you go in and complete your task, your in the clear from management. The people are fun to work with, it motivates you to go to work everyday. I just wish it had better pay."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, however the management skills were a bit lacking because they were all over the place, however I did enjoy working for them and did enjoy my jobs."
good,"It's a nice place to work, if you don't mind poor managers, because they tend to bend the rules for some employees, while also being overbearing on others. I was actually let go for speaking out about not having enough people to unload the daily truck in a timely fashion."
good,"Great experience for one of my first jobs, learned a lot about merchandising, sales, and customer service. Friendly work place and fun depending on management."
good,"very productive environment, i learned how to deal with different people and also difficult people. management was very difunctional but they tried to help when they could. hardest part was dealing with difficult people but that job taught me how to get through tough situations in a professional manner. I loved the co workers and also loved helping the customers."
good,"It's a place where I learned a lot of management skills."
good,"The increasing pressure to meet certain metrics has caused a stressful job to become even more so.  We were encouraged to minimize the traditional aspects of the job and to push the newer, higher revenue tasks. I found this to be discouraging.  I realize we have to make money to stay in business, but safety for the patient is job one."
good,"The best part was working with the customers."
good,Very welcoming and flexible allowing me to go to school and work. Showed me all the steps I needed and was also trusted alone at the store. Did great work with training they provided
good,"Empresa de grande porte com muitos colaboradores, multinacional."
good,"A typical day consisted of zoning and helping customers. I learned how to accommodate the needs of various customers. The culture and management wasn't ideal. On several occasions I was pulled from one task and put on another, then was asked by another manager to do another job, which created confusion. The hardest part was probably the labor or scheduling, as the schedule rotated frequently. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,"Walmart  is a place of confusion.  This was a saying of all the workers.  The operation rules change day by day,  something is done one way on a certain  day and done another way the next day.   Advancement is not done unless you are in the certain click as we used to call it.  You work hard and steady but you do not advance as your workmanship does not show.  I applied for Department Manager job three times but did not get it,  because I was told I was not experienced.  Even though I  was doing the ordering and other responsibilities of a Department Managers job.   The workplace have changed,  since the beginning in 1995.  They say  Walmart is a family oriented company but it is run by the greed of the CEO or the people who run it now, not by family."
good,"Over my years of working with the Company, I've come to discover many of the problems. You'll come to experience that the work is very bearable and even in some cases enjoyable. The people I worked with were wonderful, I had few to no issues with anyone I encountered on a day to day basis. The only real issue was the severe lack of communication between higher management and associates. It would come up off that there had been a sudden policy change, new program or even adjustment with little to no notice. In the case of the most recent Nintendo switch, it was advertised as a pre-order product and nobody was even informed of the process in which to do so. I had to hunt down management and find all the information that ""I should have already gotten"" or ""Should know what I'm doing by now"" despite this being the first console pre-order that ended up not even being taken care of by the electronics department, but by Garden Center. In short, I love the people and the work was more than tolerable, but Walmart needs to make some serious adjustments to the way they treat their employees."
good,I've been with walmart for 14+ years. Walmart has gone away from being family oriented. Along with long hours and taken away some of your off days. Need a change to be able to spend time with my wife.
good,Good place for someone looking to work part time. Friendly management team and fellow staff. Flexible with schedules. Good opportunities for promotion.
good,It was okay. The pay was low but over all the customers had a great expierence. My only issue was the pay and the fact you couldn't get over time.
good,Co-workers and myself harassed by manager. I reported several  times nothing was done. I loved the work and coworkers. Management needs work on having favorites.
good,"spent the day greeting people and checking receipts,directing customers to desired areas,some cashiering,stocking shelves and returning items back onto the floor"
good,every day starts off great and gradually gets bad depending on the amount of customers and how the managers are feeling.
good,Fast past stock is always coming in like crazy never enough help you never get bored always something to do to please the customers
good,"Good place to work For.  The night crew usually is pretty fun to be around . Can be difficult at times , especially when the managers are having a bad day."
good,Para ser mi primer trabajo fue muy divertido el ambiente es padre
good,"Being that I have a full time job elsewhere, Walmart is extremely flexible in providing me the shifts that don't interfere with the other job. They always provide me more hours when I say I'm available for them too."
good,"-The guidelines on how to handle cigarettes and alcohol needs to be updated. I was told to handle it in different ways, and this was very frustrating."
good,"A place to work as someone seeking a starter Job,overall a place not to be complacent. Not really a fun place,performing my job description. But its a work place high on safety and security."
good,I worked overnight stocking shelves. The hours went by fast. I worked alone and with others. There was always lots to get done.
good,"A day of work at wal-mart can be tiring. you work 9 hours with an hour nonpaid lunch and 2 15 minute breaks that are paid for."
good,"It is a fun environment to work in if you are working with people you get along with. Most of the management needs to be taught people skills, they are very rude and do not behave professionally with their employees."
good,"It is easy to switch shifts with people, which is nice for flexibility. The job itself is very repetitive but it is exactly as you would expect it to be."
good,"At Walmart I strived to give excellent customer service considering I was a cashier and had constant contact with customers, while not busy assisting people I would be found zoning clothing and making sure everything was sorted and folded and properly placed in it's rightful spot."
good,"Typical day included folding and stocking clothing."
good,Stocking the infant department and the diaper isle along with baby food. Learned how to be productive in a timely manner. Management is and has some management skills to learn in a few areas. Workplace had several people who like to talk with each other about others. Hardest part was getting along with others who wasn't trying to push favor on the bosses. Most enjoyable part was accomplishing my set time to have all work done plus adding other work from other areas.
good,"go to your areas and get your job assignments."
good,Beaucoup trop de tâches pour ce que nous sommes capable de donner dans une journée. Nous ne pouvons pas palier à tout les tâches car pas assez de personnel pour nous soutenir.
good,"Presión laboral extremo, sin goze de comida ni descanzo"
good,"Ritmo acelerado, no hay equilibrio entre vida y trabajo."
good,"I liked working at the Photolab but didn't like the company and the hours were ridiculous. They gave minimum hours for part-time and full-time employees. By the time I left, I was only given 12 hours/week. Full-timers would get 30hr/week. Works great for a high school student, not for someone who is trying to make a living."
good,No unemployment compensation if you get fired or really low on hours. No rehire for an entire year or longer. Long work hours depending on where you are in the store. Hardly any training. They just give you CBLs and other computer learning programs and then send you to the floor. No hands on formal training for heavy machinery. You'll have to learn that on your own. You also have to take a test every year. If you pass the test you get a pay increase. If you fail you are terminated.
good,"Co-workers were very nice and needed the work; however, if promoted, they really were expected to work many more hours without appropriate pay.  Tried many ways to not provide benefits."
good,Good job for someone who is looking for a place to start in retail or get experience in working with a group. Decent place to work if you can stand working in an environment were you are expected to do more work than others.
good,Don't let the negative hype scare you it's a good place to work. The most and biggest problems you'll have is with individual managers the company as a whole is great. Benefits are top notch. the rest of the negative stuff comes from the unions which for Walmart is less than useless so non-points regardless.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service.  I enjoy helping others, sending a customer home happy and satisfied is a great feeling.  I worked for a high volume store, which means I saw a lot of customer traffic.  The position can be very demanding at times trying to keep up with customer wants and needs especially with limited staff.  I learned a lot about managing and interacting with different types of people from customers, to associates, all the way to upper management.  Overall it was a good place to work and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"~ worked past your limit and still get yelled at"
good,Good pay for industry. Incentive program is very good. The metrics could be hard to maintain if you are new to customer service and call center jobs. The building is very nice and the company provides free food very often.
good,Working Walmart has given me many opportunities that most people gain by working multiple jobs. The environment is a safe one in which you can learn all the skills needed to either pursue a career within the company or outside the company
good,"Most days we went into work had our daily meeting to assign us our departments then went to work, management for the most part left us alone to do our work."
good,"They need to realign their business strategy with their mission, vision and values.  The store I worked for at least treated employees poorly and overworked with them without providing the necessary tools to perform their jobs accurately. This affects the customer service which is what they are all about."
good,"I was able to learn a variety of departments and job duties, which kept things interesting. Full time employees can receive benefits, but the pay is not always the greatest. The environment is busy and very diverse."
good,not much to expect just a simple retail job. basic job with a basic pay. no real room for advancement. pay is low and raises are as well. physically an easy enough job.
good,I thought it was a great place to work but you have to be a quick learner and do everything fast paced all while helping customers
good,"I enjoy working for walmart  I am a cap team I associate I come in at 5am do the top stock work freight and picks from my shift down and top stock. Bin overstock freight. I enjoy working with my managers and associates. Helping, meeting and talking with the customers."
good,"Assistant managers are expected to work long hours, which they are well compensated for. Healthcare is very good for the company. The negative aspect would be in-store to home office communication. Home office doesn't allow for enough hours for good customer service."
good,J'ai besoin de changement depuis quelques temps je travail souvent et je n'aime pas vraiment ça j'ai mieux travailler en équipe.
good,"Recruited management associates for Merchandising, Product Development, Planning, Replenishment, Marketing, Corporate Affairs, Direct Imports, Real Estate, Legal, and e-Commerce Divisions.  "
good,low hours bad management and overall bad moves on their part because of the choices they made and was not very smart about problems
good,"I cashiered the entire time I worked at Walmart. If anything the most you need to be prepared for is a lot of standing around doing nothing. They do want you to straighten your area up when customers aren't coming through. That's fine and all, but there's only so much you can clean up and being told to continue fixing your area isn't doing much. Otherwise it's a fairly predictable job."
good,"the people were amazing to work with, sometimes the management was difficult. Also the upper corporation really dont meet the needs of the workers when it comes to benefits and such"
good,"Working freight, binning overstock, customer service, cleaning, order merchandise as needed, zoning, filling in for dept. manager when needed.  Hardest part of the job was trying to be in more than one place at a time.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Very laid back environment with lots of chances for advancement/change of responsibility. Walmart focuses on in-house hiring, so if you have a degree/diploma in a field that Walmart offers while working there, you'd looked at first for eligibility. Annual raises as well as chances to change your position as frequently as the jobs are posted. A lot of micromanagement, but that's to be expected with a corporate chain such as Walmart."
good,It's a good company to work for. Reasonable pay and decent benefits. The employees are great. Upper management could use better communication but overall great experience
good,Some of the management was way to power hungry. I enjoyed the job just wast high enough pay to consider saying long term. I enjoyed dealing with the customer. Just wasn't able to get much support from upper management. Often had to deal with I mature employees under me who didn't understand what it meant to actually work.
good,when i was working at wal mart as a cashier i had no problem i love it i learned that you have too have patients working there because everyone are not the same .
good,Enjoyed my time working there and gained more work experience. I liked the hour lunch and the break room was nice. Fast paced and lots of work to do for one person.
good,Working here was hard management seem to not care when being treating by customer .it was a productive work place and easy to move up in the company .the only thing is it always seem like I was at work and never had family time/personal life
good,"Walmart employees over two million employees across the world. With that being said I went to work with an open mind, believing that it must be alight if they can keep that many people around. my speculation was right Walmart has turned out to be one of my better employers. They have inconsistencies in there wages and a few unfavorable policies but who doesn't. So all in all i would suggest a job with Walmart to anyone in need."
good,I came in at 2:00 unload the truck til 6:00 took a lunch the pull out the freight and separate the different item and took it to their areas
good,"local de trabalho bom, gostava do que fazia,boa comunicação com os colegas, minha avaliação e bom"
good,Great work environment. Great benefits. Able to help other's and meet a lot of people. Great people go work with and someone is always willing or help.
good,"A fast paced and driven work environment. Always something new to learn. Had a major emphasis on customer relations, keeping them happy was priority."
good,Its a good first job for a young person starting out without a family or while in school.  Teaches responsibility. Do as you are told and you will do fine there.
good,Running back and forth to get as much done as possible. Very nice having at least three days off though depending on what shift you are on.
good,"The hard part is: to work standing all shift long and working evenings and weekends."
good,This was an okay place to work. The pay could have been better and they could have treated there cashiers a little better then they did. The pay could have been better as well.
good,"This job wasn't hard and they did help you to stay warm during the freezing temperature, But dont expect a random job well done, and you will be by yourself most of the time."
good,You get to meet alot people (both good and bad) and the work is not too difficult. Good pay but you will work long hours and days off/vacation time is hard to get.
good,I liked working here. Some days it was a lot of work. And it seemed as if I was always asked to do things which was most likely because I did them right. Everyone was friendly and nice to me which is always a plus. I just had to leave on medical leave. I miscarried and was on limited mobility
good,"Very fast paced"
good,"The ability to move up is there if the drive is there. Heavy demands on employees if you don't mind that, pay is great. Scheduling is a nightmare. The store seems to want to run on skeleton crew and accomplish the work of an army."
good,"A typical day was busy crowds, zoning the walls,racks, and tables. Doing the go backs from customer service. I actually learned quite a bit, including how to deal with unsatisfied customers and keep patient with them. Management was the hardest part, if management had been better I would probably still be working there."
good,"The pay was low, the hours were long and the work was consuming/not worth the pay. But it was also, sorta like easy money. FT hours, consistent pay. Not the best at training."
good,"It wasn't challenging work nor was it an overall bad environment but the management was very poor. The managers rarely ever listened to complaints such as, ""I don't think it's fair that you have me close the store at midnight and then open it up again the next day at 6 am"" they would say ""I'll take care of it so it doesn't happen again"" but they wouldn't do a thing."
good,It was a a decent job and I had been with a team of people and we did a lot of different things in the store but it felt like people asked to much that we couldn't finish our jobs without rushing and others didn't seem to appreciate it either which kind of sucked
good,"El ambiente laboral es un poco pesado, las oportunidades de crecimiento no son justas, solo se otorgan a los consentidos, las utilidades son pocas y tienes que hacer labores que no son parte de tu función. Además te pueden correr injustificadamente y no te liquidan al 100%."
good,"Dealing with associates one on one every day."
good,très difficile avoir un poste de jour ou de soir presque impossible
good,"The day just consisted of cleaning a lot, and cooking. Job is not hard just continuous and can be frustrating if understaffed. You stay in the Deli your whole shift so meeting people outside the Deli is rare, but an alright job."
good,I wouldn't say it was too much of a fun place to work cause the management would allow me to be off the day of my father funeral
good,mixing paint.team work and all about paint. management was never around when you needed them.culture not the best.hardest part was long travel and not enough hours.enjoyable was 1 hour lunch.
good,"The lack of communication at times is the only and major difficulty I faced while working here. If managers were better trained to work together instead of towards single minded goals, at times contradicting, work environment and employee morale would improve."
good,"Happy productive people to be around. Clean safety environment, jobs they assign you to are very easy the brakes that give you a nice time so you can have your lunch and come back"
good,The job was okay I liked it just had to keep employees due backroom not out them all as cashiers the great part was that job got bonoys in there checks gitbholiday pay and when u got overtime your checks where nice !
good,a typical day would be me stocking the merchandise that come in onto the belt and placing it onto the carts where they belong. afterwards it would be to take them to the floor.
good,"I worked at Walmart while I was going threw high school.  They had to follow my school schedule and the amount of hours I worked due to being a young adult.  I enjoyed my time working there, because I was taught a lot about customer service and stocking.  I also was given the opportunity to work the registers and enjoyed that.  The management changed allot and made it difficult to work with me and my school schedule.  I was then let go of this job."
good,"Despite a bit of difficulty getting my Christmas vacation approved, which doesn't usually happen, work there was fairly nice. It stunk having to commute and not being able to transfer, but that wasn't necessarily their fault. Boss was pretty cool in the Pharmacy and everyone was very helpful and welcoming. No bad feelings left when I left there, either."
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers. I had a great knowledge of the store, working in different departments while stocking and doing inventory. My coworkers were very helpful during training and always ready to help when I needed their assistance. The managers were fair and very hard working. They were very understanding and motivating me to move up and apply my skills and be proud of my work. Everyone was on the same page, great communication, and working together to achieve our goals for the shift. The hardest part about my position was the hours I was working. I worked midnight's which sometimes made it hard to make doctor appointments and I was tired at home tying to keep up with a Toddler while running on no sleep. It is very multi-culture working at walmart. People from all races and cultures work there, I learned about different countries and religions working with immigrants and people with a very different backgrounds from my own. Wal-mart works hard to make everyone feel special and encourage them to move up in the company and always remember the open door policy; never be afraid to speak on any issues good or bad."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart I learned a lot here too. I was a truck unloader first throwing freight out on a skate with a 5 man crew and organizing in pallets by departments. I also learned to become a backroom inventory associate. I would locate and pick items for the stockers and also re enter items back into the inventory daily where accuracy was key. I was also a daytime and nighttime stocker here.
good,"friendly and efficient workers, learned lots and made good friends. Customers ranged from normal to weird, to crazy. Work was stressful and generally busy most days, sometimes short staffed. Nonetheless, a great learning experience!"
good,"Walmart was a good job as far as hours and pay, management was the real problem. They come down hard on your supervisors for work your department is not responsible for. Overall I would still work for the company."
good,i enjoyed the different people i worked with. i didn't really learn much. Management was okay. The job wasn't hard at all.
good,"Good work. Exposure to scale. Learning a lot with the technology stack. Good peers. Upper management needs to be fixed. Some people are extremely good, others not so much."
good,"When I would come into work, we would start unloading the trucks and sorting the boxes according to the department and aisle that it belonged to. I learned that I was not suited for retail.. Management depends on who it is. I had a manager who was sexist and hated me so working was miserable. The hardest part of my job was getting the truck unloaded in the timeframe they expected of us. 3000 pieces of merchandise in 2 hours completely sorted into departments and perfectly stacked isn't as easy as they made it sound. Plus we were short on CAP members."
good,"The experience with Walmart was before they decided to do some restructuring in their corporate offices.  Employees were not treated the same at that time as they are now.  I did enjoy the job, I just didn't agree with the way things were handled."
good,understanding team  and people are always happy some days are good and some are bad but you have to be understanding of the different customer
good,"A empresa cumpre com prazos de pagamento, adiantamento e etc, porém cobra muito dos funcionários, muitas vezes por algo que nem diz respeito ao setor do funcionário, e, quando feito um bom trabalho a empresa não reconhece isso, deixando assim o funcionário frustrado e desinteressado pelo trabalho."
good,Walmart is a good place to work but pay sucks for being there 10 plus years. what I hate most is changing manager every year. Hours and schedule is very poor.
good,I have had the pleasure of working with this company for four years. I have learned a lot about retail and management as well as working with a diverse group of people .
good,Wal mart is an ok place but it is very hard to advance to higher positions. And it is very rare that you get your pay increased. I am a very hard worker and I do not feel appreciated there.
good,"Normal day was 8 to 10 hours "
good,Can lose your job at anytime.  Always a new face. Full of challenge like time quotas. Being appreciated after finishing a job. Stock options. Being shown how to do a job ( training)
good,"The management at walmart distribution is horrible. They do not care about associates, and its a lot of favoritism where i work."
good,"Walmart is an overall good employer. As with any job working so closely with others, supervisors and coworkers can determine if the position is enjoyable or not. Obviously must have good customer service skills and patience."
good,"- Most of the employees at my location were friendly."
good,"needed more employees"
good,"The customer flow is nice, makes the day go by fast. There's always something to do or someone to help. The managment are supportive and friendly. All of the associates and coworkers definitely help eachother out."
good,"its a good place to start out if you have no work experience but i wouldn't say its good to stay too long, i would call it a temporary job just to get you going."
good,A typical day at work was ringing up customer's at the cash register. I didn't like how you could barely get the day off here without getting fired. I liked my coworkers though.
good,The hardest part of this job was dealing with cranky customers and staff members. This company is too corporate the little ones don't matter to them.
good,"I have been fortunate to learn many things over my years with WalMart. I have worked in a very fast paced environment, with little assistance. There are many opportunities available, for the right individual. The most difficult part of the job has been the abuse that some managers allow to occur in the workplace, with little or no response."
good,"I was a Cashier at WM for 9 years. It was a fast paced environment."
good,"Very busy frontend for cashiers and customer service.  Point of sale transactions cash, debit, and credit.  Promotional incentive for customers to apply for the company MasterCard.  Customer can pay off transaction on company card in the next transaction.  Promotion gives customer a percentage in cash rewards.  Cashiers paid incentive for each application approved."
good,"A great place to work,  Is still my favorite Walmart due to friendly employees and great customer. Can't say I like the management, when they get stressed and take more work out of us. Some rude customers here and there."
good,This can be a great job.  If you like a variety of task to do within one day and learning new things this is a great job.  If you only like working in your area might not be the place for you.
good,Fast paced work atmosphere as far as everyday procedures and duties. Good company to start out with if one wants to pursue a career up the corporate ladder.
good,OK so overall this is a good place to work management can be a little off but I must say there is a lot of room for growth and you are guaranteed a job if you do your work.
good,They have obserd rules and are sometimes not that willing to help the associates out when it comes to being willing to help customer too. Very busy and management is sometimes wanting to help.
good,walmart is walmart. you have your good days and bad days. I made the best of every situation with customers and managers. You learn to watch your back especially with managers. Do your job and just go home.
good,its all in who you know to get raises and new position. the benefits are great but other than that i do not suggest you apply there. i hated working there
good,"The job wasn't that bad, and it paid fairly well. However, the management at this particular location didn't treat employees very well, and it made for an unpleasant work environment. They didn't do very much themselves and had unrealistic expectations about the workload. I typically get along with others quite well, and certainly don't harbor any prejudice against management, but I didn't care for the attitude of my manager or some of my co-workers. I was working 3rd shift, which sometimes means working with odd characters. The hardest part of the job wasn't any physical aspect of it. It was dealing with the manager incessantly checking up on everyone and acting like nobody was working fast enough. Constantly being bothered only decreases morale, and decreased morale hurts productivity. The biggest hassle was having to face and organize the shelves every single day at the end of my shift because the prior shift was instructed by their manager to fill in gaps with product that doesn't belong in the gaps, knowing that my job is to then undo everything they did--only to have them yet again undo my job every single day."
good,It's retail what do you expect. Canada's largest retailer is only out for the money while having very few staff working the floor. But its retail.
good,It was ok it was my first job I loved doing the CDLS and getting trained on the computers about the different procedures and all because i learn best with pictures and videos it also help to have people in the room to help you as well
good,"Customer's  service a first priority , keeping the shelves full for our customers good team work will make the day easier."
good,"Taught Me A lot, Happy To Have Had The Opportunity. Alright Management With A Decent Environment. If I Had To I Would Work There Again."
good,"There aren't many cart pushers and there is about one on one side on the busiest days of the week and it is a lot to keep up with. Also along with the job there is a lot of isolation, even though you wouldn't think there would be with all the employees that work there.  The cart pushing job is understaffed and the employees there are overworked."
good,I love my front end team they are like a little family but when it comes. The Management team is friendly but is slow to solve problems.
good,"Walmart is a very busy, ever changing environment to work in, co-workers work well together to meet customer needs."
good,"Una empresa con crecimiento laboral y aprendizaje en el área administrativa y financiera."
good,"When working at Walmart  I learned strong communications skills with and without the team I worked with. I was able to further gain knowledge on vehicles. I learned how to work in fast and timely manner. My days consist of being stressful at times from how many and how big trucks were and how many cars we had. The work was hard but I learned to be comfortable in my fields of work. I loved the people I worked with. I made a lot of friends while working there, some I still have contact with. My supervisor while working on the truck was one of the best supervisor I ever had, I still have contact with him as well. My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make the friends I had there. Seeing my friends I made there was something I looked foward to while going to work each day."
good,They always ask you for promotions....put it off and then when something happens to you they give it to someone else within the week
good,"Being a cashier at walmart, was an okay experience. I personally hated working for walmart because i had a manager who was bery racial towards me and i had to leave."
good,It's a great workplace it's just not good for me. It's a lot of negativity going on with the store and I have to keep working for better and trying to better myself at a young age.
good,"Walmart doesn't have enough staff coverage and doesn't pay enough based on experience and role in comparison to other companies."
good,Wasn't a horrible job but didn't ever enjoy going. Most of my coworkers were nice. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the produce numbers. Life's too short to work at a dreadful job.
good,"It was fun because you were always meeting new people.  I learned responsibility and scheduling and how to work with balancing money."
good,"When I first stated here it was fun to work for them, but now they want you to be a programed robot. Management helps out only when there is no other floor workers to help with customers that are in line to get checked out. You have to do 6 peoples jobs in your job because they cant afford to have anymore people work for them in all departments."
good,"El trabajo es agradable con la gente, conoces gente familias y va asiendo un lazo agradable con los clientes. Lo malo que hay varios jefes y entre ellos diferentes tipos de ideas y mandos que al final no quejas de acuerdo con nadie de los jefes. Pero todo lo demas esta bien"
good,It was a learning experience. I learned how to interact with a diverse population in a fast paced environment. Dealt with customer concerns and merchandise selections.
good,friendly environment. the job wasn't to easy but it wasn't to hard either. management wasn't the best but i dealt with it.
good,a typical day at Walmart is maintaining a clean and well organized store for the best shopping experience for the customer. Stocking shelves and merchandising products for best point of sale.
good,"Ok, but could have been better if they would have put me in returns, or clothes. But instead put me as people greeter, which got boring. That's the reason they fired me."
good,I have learn many things with walmart for a example i have just being myself and a great employee just by helping others andputting the customer first and they are so nice
good,"Working for Walmart was more difficult. When you apply and in the interview process they ask the hours, days and times you are unable to work. I was always scheduled in to work days and times that I was to be in school. I would then need to switch shifts with a co-worker and then they were frustrated with me because I would not keep my own scheduled shift. It was also hard once they had change shift managers."
good,i liked that i was able to work midnights. but wish i had more of an opportunity to be hired on in another department when this position was done. Some of the people on my shift had no clue what they were hired for and more or less stood around dumbfounded watching a few of us most of the time
good,screwed up my schedule after I came back from surgery. I like the people I worked with there was team work but management is bad.
good,"It's an interesting job and it helps you with your  people skills. I enjoy working with my co-workers, but I think they should train a little more and also pay more."
good,Fun work place . Great team member and outstanding managers. Great place to earn extra cash . Worked around my work schedule and allowed me to do home. Work there.
good,"I used to enjoy my job. Managment changes have happened and not for the better. They took away our paid holidays, medical insurance deductible is too high,$6200, and there is no associate appreciation"
good,Productive great people like family very good place to work really like being in different departments every night or every other night makes work interesting and different
good,"Very unorganized and unprofessional. Feels like high school all over again. Definitely, a lot of favoritism and ignorance with new management."
good,Place is great but management stinks. They are rude and treat employees like dirt. And for the job/home life balance there isn't much they do not like to work with students on scheduling which is why I had to quit twice.
good,"Good job just beginning work, i began working there at a young age and it was a great place for a young adult to learn responsibility and get a feel for the working environment ."
good,"Cambia mucho de tienda en tienda, he escuchado sobre buen ambiente unas determinantes, en unas más que en otras, pero todo depende de la persona en cargo."
good,"-Gran aprendizaje"
good,Had a great experience with meeting different customers but didnt not enjoy the extremly strick attendence policy. Loved working with my co workers it was such a diverse atmosphere.
good,busy days management is okay do not really work with your work schedule when have kids cut hours down not giving you the full time hrs that you were told you would be working when started
good,"A typical day at work can involve anything depending on where you are placed at. Most of the jobs are pretty self explanatory and don't take too much effort."
good,Start off setting up the backroom for truck unload zone aisles unload truck separate merchandise stocks shelves pull freight to the floor clean up our areas and finish paperwork
good,"I was never fully trained to do everything they asked of me. A lot of times they would place me in departments that I had no experience working in, such as the jewelry counter or in produce, when I was hired on and trained as a cashier."
good,To much drama from customers in the work place for the pay you receive and lack of commitment to work from other associates.
good,It was fine working at this place i was just trying to verify an email how did i end up doing this. This isn't cool to shove a consumer into this.
good,"Since i started out in 2010 I have worked my way up to the position I am in now, Walmart has made this very easy and trainable for me to attain the position i am in now, Walmart has provided both extensive training and tools that i needed to succeed in the company"
good,"My typical work day is going into my job and getting my work done without any messing around, I have learned many great things at my previous job that helped me accomplish many tasks. The Walmart management is not the greatest, they pick favorites and not all employees do the same amount of work, others were allowed to slack off and have a lax on the job.  I enjoyed each and everyone of my co-workers and got along with everyone surrounding me, I really didn't think that there was anything hard about my job just the work load being put mostly on myself while others slacked of.  The most enjoyable part of work for me was accomplishing my tasks and learning new things."
good,"Easy to move up and not terrible work hours, micro-management is too much at times. I enjoyed much of my time here and met many new people. was promoted 3 times in 2 years."
good,"It was a poor experience. No benefits, lengthy training program, too many rules, unfriendly management, and no holiday pay. Every day was the same and it seemed as if it was a job that tested one's patience and sanity."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work. Your job title and shift determines your hours, mostly. The managers are sometimes willing to put the blame on their workers instead of taking responsibility. They aren't very accommodating or understanding of problems going on in your personal life, even though you inform them before you are even hired. If you have the fortune of working under a generous support manager than working at Walmart can be fun and productive."
good,"I learned to get along with people, best to keep to yourself and not get involved with too many people, hardest part of the job was the rude customers and the management that never supported you or had yor back, most enjoyable part was the 2 single friends that I made in the 21 years of employment there. I learned to be trusting and considerate of others and their feelings not to judge people based on their actions, learned to value others opinions."
good,"customers were typical, unloading trucks stocking shelves, how to use electric jacks and lifts, pricing. management wasn't the greatest only a few were really good about their job. co workers were really friendly. hardest part was some of the management they were not satisfied much, enjoyable part was people I enjoy being around people."
good,"A typical day at work is when I work in the fabrics, crafts, and stationary. The customer service is really good when I'm cutting fabric and they're telling me lovely stories."
good,"I work 3rd shift, it is an okay job but like with any place you work there is going to be something you don't like about the job. It is a great job for those just coming into the work force and are not sure what they really want to do. but if you have a family or your a single person with children, its an okay job. The job that I actually do is not hard at all just restocking merchandise."
good,"There's never a typical day at work never "
good,"everyone is great except for management they pick and chose who they want to bend rules for and what rules to enforce "
good,A typical work day would start out with a meeting followed by a second meeting with the maintenance staff the job required you to use a dust mop to sweep the floor and then use powered scrubbers to clean the floor the hardest part of this job was keeping up with management as management was not very good and head you moving around the store too much management made it hard to complete tasks given to you by your boss
good,its ok Co-workers where cool management was ok staging was the hardest part of the job was going home enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Everything was good until I started college a few months after I started. Managers kept changing schedules inconveniently because of corporate. Also, I had been there a while and I became a trainer, but they kept hiring new people and immediately moving them to positions that I had specified I was interested in. Therefore, I had no chances to move departments like I wanted to. Co-workers are good sometimes, but I encountered many who were unwilling to work as hard, so my line was always super busy."
good,The pharmacy is generally different than the rest of Walmart. Not a bad place to work if the technicians are good and the pharmacist isn't complacent.
good,"Management treats their associates like they are all stupid.  No advancement and benefits have changed and the associates have lost in the process."
good,Management was ok at best sometimes. Expectations were unreasonably high a majority of the time. Compensation was excellent.
good,"Good company, just not much advancement . All employees are fairly nice and concerned about each other. Management could use better communication in daily tasks."
good,"Always busy, coworkers always stressed out and snappy. Customers most of the time very rude and hardly a smile a day. Benefits were okay but wages were mediocre."
good,little to no freedom during the workday (given that this particular time of the year is extremely busy) closely monitored on productivity.
good,Overall Wal-mart provided adequate employment opportunities to balance out being a college student.  I was able to reinforce many of the management and leadership skills that I possess as well as working with different types of personalities.  The hardest part of the job was oftentimes the sheer volume of cleanup time due to the quantity of customers.
good,"A typical day at work is busy if you really do your job. Hourly employees work shifts vary from to week to week which makes it difficult to plan your personal budget.  I found management and my co-workers great.  One thing bothered me, however, and that is that a few co-workers, doing the same job I was doing  could visit with other employees for conversations that were more than a minute or two, and do as they pleased when it was obvious that customers needed to be assisted, while most of us were doing all of the work. Yet, often, they were allowed to do that.  I enjoyed assisting customers and the interactions with various customers."
good,Walmart is a great company and it is looked down upon by many. It's a good place to gain retail knowledge and has many opportunities for personal growth and development.
good,"Working at Walmart can be a little stressful depending on your job description management is the problem, not all but some mgrs .don't participate with associates trying to complete there assignment."
good,"Pay is low for what is required of each position,  Management was poor.  There was no open door policy like what was told to at hire date."
good,I ran the sports area. Selling guns mainly along with ammo and hunting equipment. Easy place to work for they take good care of their employees. Just needed more hours.
good,"It is not a good company. "
good,I had a great time . alot of work but it was enjoyable.  Loved our customers and working in every department i love to wake up for work to provide for my family.
good,I work as a fresh side associate my hours to start where good not great and they keep going down cant support my family We cant even pay our bills monthly and it just happens to be the holidays when they start cutting hours.
good,"Managing within Walmart's Canadian distribution is working within a very Fast paced environment that demands Continuous process improvement.  "
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier at Walmart however, the job was not what I thought it would, the management was rude and had no flexibility with my hours while in school. It was fast paced and I often enjoyed being in the workplace but unfortunately I could not deal with the amount of pressure that the company had put on me so I quit to focus on my studies."
good,Managers where flexible with hours and helped those who couldn't afford lunch. The worst was the self checkout. I'd spend my whole shifts there
good,"Walmart would be a great place to work if managers listened to the employees. They move managers around to different departments and those managers have no knowledge of their new area. For example, I'm in meat department and we have a new department and comanager over us. They come in and immediately start trying to change things without knowing if it will help the department. They have no idea how the department runs like the actual associates that work it everyday. We know the trends of what people buy, and usually how quickly product runs out. Management is incompetent."
good,The managers was lazy and bossy the would sit in the office and watch to make sure everyone is working then set unrealistic expectations on timeframes and then get mad cause you can complete it on time
good,"Not the best work place at all. There was absolutely no professionalism what so ever, no communication, no organization, no maintenance, no team ethics."
good,"Working at walmart was pretty fun, was always something to do and someone to talk with. The coworkers were very hardworking and nice when it comes to helping."
good,"I assisted customers with questions or concerns and maintained a clean and safe work environment. I was a sales associate, so I needed to sell products. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet 8 hrs a day and the most enjoyable part of the job was the discount on items."
good,"WalMart hires a diversity of employees. The co-workers are very friendly, but some are not the best workers. Many associates like to slack off. Management is nice also, but seems to not appreciate the work that is done. Seems like walmart needs to hire better associates that are more qualified for the job."
good,I was a overnight stocker. And it was laid back and a good place to work . my Co workers was good people and my manager was a great manager
good,De todo esse 1ano e meio que fiquei na empresa eu gostei de trabalhar o único ruim é que não pagava meus benefícios como segurança.
good,"I worked in the automotive department as a tech, management would take members of our department to work in the backroom even if we were busy and already and under staffed. Management did not always treat and speak with employees under them with respect. Enjoyed it as my first job, very much underpaid for all I did there. Was a tech but I ran the register, stocked freight, greeter/service writer and would be pulled to work in other departments often"
good,No ocupar tantos cargos en una sola persona y mejorar los sueldos
good,"Too much management not enough people to work. The harder you work the more work they give you. You will never get promoted with your hard work, the credit always goes to your lead. The people that always gets promoted fasts are the butt-kissers, it's not what you know anymore it's who you know. Sad but true."
good,co-workers are good to work with. easy to get along with and make the work night much easier. always helpful to everyone who works on 3rd shift
good,"Start the day stocking shelves, Unloading trucks, back to stocking. "
good,"It is a beginner job and I will forever be grateful for it giving me my start, but I do not ever want to go back. Management was awful, They always expected you to go above and beyond but if you needed help they were not there for you."
good,Woked for the company for over 17yrs loke any job it has its positives n negatives i have loved alot of things about y work also have disliked just as many
good,"As a cashier at Walmart I have strengthened my human relation skills and problem solving skills.  I have made several friendships and strengthened teamwork skills.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the ""family unit"" inside Walmart."
good,I loved working at walmart because I got to work with the public and interact with them. The way they handle employees when they are sick and have doctors notes I do not agree with.
good,"Boa empresa pra se trabalhar,localizaçao boa, bom relaciinamento com a gerencia,pena que era muita pouca oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"Job was demanding as we were needed to unpack pallets as the store was closing and making sure the right products were being sent to the right aisle. Was able to learn how to maximize time and figure out a system to sorting items to stock, had to figure out location of items by memory not enough hand scanners to go around. Job was going well until a local Wal-Mart store was closed and the crew and store manager were brought to the store I was working at. New Manager was inept at what was to be expected of her, Treated the crew from the other store with grace while we were treated harshly and no leeway with mistakes, Co-Manager was a courtier and would not help. Constantly had to finish the stocking and cleaning of the new crew aisles due to the fact they were hardly finished before opening . Constant Stress of Finishing others works before opening, Group Mentality, Rude Maintenance Crew, Having to finish work extremely fast to make up for others shortcomings; Lead me to leave the company even though I didn't hate the job, it became too much of a serious stressor in my life and was dreading the work Necessary to carry out daily objectives as others fell short."
good,"If you like working overnight shifts then Walmart will be a good job for you, however if you want to move up its impossible because management only wants daytime people to get moved up."
good,managers are just looking to fire you so you never become a full time employee and get benefits so try to get along with them
good,"most of the day i had to push cart manually cause  the ""cart pusher"" broke down month before i started, i have noticed i was not built for working outside at that time so they ended up training me for cashier, but they always needed carts so i didn't do it often."
good,Most co workers got along with each other work place is fast paced management was ok many different departments you are able to work in if you wanted to change up your work life
good,They need to do a better job for their employees. I would ask for a day off that i needed off months in advance and they would not give it to me. So they truely need to work with their employees.
good,"i loved stocking, i have worked in every department except deli and garden center. the walmart's i worked at most of the managers were rude and when they see hard working co-workers they use them to their advantage and overwork them to the point of leaving then wonder why they have such a high turnover rate. co-workers have always been amazing there, like a tight knit family. the hardest part of the job is the crew never being recognized or appreciated for their achievements."
good,"Great place, okay pay. Negative, employees find themselves targeted by lower level mgmt if they aren't the favorites."
good,"This store was ok to work for, the work was reasonable and easy. Only issue is that management seemed to put concerns on the back burner and not resolve them in a timely manner if at all. The employees are pleasant and fun to work with, there is a team aspect inside the store. The hardest part is that sometimes you are underappreciated because there are so many employees."
good,"A reliable and steady paycheck, along with many hours available to who ever would like to work them. Management and organizational skills are not the best."
good,"I liked working here, it was a lot of work I worked in cosmetology section and had to make sure each makeup was in correct spot by number; so it does get to become a lot of work but overall great place to work. Also had a great supervisor."
good,"mange department area"
good,Its as much as can be said about any retailer. Not a terrible place to work but not that good of one either. Has ups and downs in several areas.
good,"In this job, counting counts. Inventory associates, also known as auditors or material recording clerks, work with company supply chains to make sure that inventory is on route, on shelves and well-stocked. They are record keepers for materials, report creators and supply trackers. Modular specialists plan displays, coordinate the arrangement of merchandise and set up in-store models of furniture and clothing. They are responsible for the set-up of racks and units used for merchandising equipment, and work in conjunction with sales associates, merchandising staff, managers and area directors. Walmart is the world's largest retailer, and each store features an assortment of modular units; a Walmart store often hires and retains several modular specialists."
good,"Ok job but security wise it's too boring. "
good,Worked for the company for about 2 1/2 years.  There wasn't enough employees hired for the tasks that needed to be completed which made working for the company very frustrating.
good,"I was a good place to work with intelligent co-workers, good direction, very productive, and good interaction with patients. Some patient's were very challenging at times. There were some management goals that seemed lofty in the time constraints we had to achieve them. Their were lunch breaks, but I did not have the time to take them all the time. The had a system for waiting times for prescriptions that did not seem reasonable; especially in the areas of critical, and in-store times. This good have fixed by a little lengthening of those times. The Elizabeth store was always understaffed(short by 1 technician), causing the other employees to get burnt out. They also should have had a full-time cashier for the pharmacy to help with those waiting times. To be a pharmacist at Walmart takes full dedication to the staff and patients; and can therefore interfere with your personal life and its goals."
good,"Love my co workers but management were a different story.  I enjoyed the customers , was the first place I've worked that the customers actually were ginuwine."
good,"The job itself is easy. But the incompetence in the workplace is very off putting and may even drive you away. But if you can deal with that sort of thing, you'll be making a starting pay of at least 9.50, easy."
good,i would grow old working for walmart. when i worked for walmart i was well loved went to work everyday did my job and was even called in on my off days and i never missed a day when i was workinf for walmart
good,it is an ok company to work. for a lot of the people care about you. although some of the managers and associates will lie straight to your face. you often times have to fight just to be given a chance at wal-mart
good,When I worked at the Walmart on Truxel back in 2004 it was under different management. At that time I did enjoyed very much working with my fellow employees but the management at the time was not great. I am sure by now the management they have is good and the employees are happy with them. Also please take into consideration the reason I'm giving this rating was at the time I work there. I cannot say what or how management is on today.
good,It's an alright job with alright pay but could use friendly people to work with. You get 2 weeks of computer training then a week of shadow training watching and learning the register.
good,"While employed at this facility I grew with experiences and great work relations with co-workers, however, the Managers are lacking in communication skills with their employees. I myself had a manager that would go out of his way to find a reason to fire someone so that his own paycheck was bigger."
good,Went to work started day with meeting was picked out for special assignments or went to computer and started our tasks.management  was nice.most coworkers were nice dealing with angry customers.getting my tasks done early.
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo dependiendo del sector era cobrar, acomodar o vender con horarios rotativos, un franco al azar por semana. Se aprende bastante por varios contactos, siembre hay una persona que te enseña algo. La gerencia le falta integridad, carece de valores esa empresa. El compañerismo es por rato guerras por ratos amiguismo. Lo mas difícil es cuando te cansas que se aprovechen de vos por necesitar el trabajo, tienen buena paga pero deberían respetar mas a los empleados."
good,"Wal-mart is a great company to start off into the work force with. Unfortunately, due to their recent changes in policies, the work load has become extremely heavy for one individual. I am speaking from an overnight associates perspective. They terminate associates daily due to mainly attendance, but are not quick about hiring new associates, therefore increasing the work load for others."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for.Employees get the chance to have opportunities to grew in the company but as in all retial fields they have their pros and cons. Pay was very little for the amount of work that had to get done.Some customers were very rude and unpolite. Working for walmart was a great experience, I met extremely great people and learned alot of wonderful things."
good,"The income is not sufficient to cover expenses. Students benefit from variable working hours. For students, the income is sufficient to cover expenses. For family, the variable working hours doesn't work."
good,I worked Walmart seasonal.It was a great experience.I like with the public and your co workets are eager to help when you need it. Also Wamart great opportunities for you to grow.a
good,Too many bosses or managers who dont communicate often or well can stop your work flow. Besides that everything is alright working with the public that is.
good,"Learned the basic of supply chain."
good,I would work different areas of the store zoning the areas and keeping them stocked. And assist customers when they needed help. Co-workers were good to work with.
good,"el trabajo es muy divertido solo que en ocasiones existe una mala administración de tiempos y mala comunicasion entre la gerencia y en ocasiones hay que realizar las cosas hasta tres veces, es una empresa buena prque aprendes a diario cosas nuevas sobre como realizar las cosas y nunca esta con lo mismo siempre inovando el como realizar las actividades diarias de una manera  eficiente y con mas productividad."
good,Okay company..Go to work on time..Be about yout money and stay out of people business. Hard enviroment to work in but can be done . Works with schedule
good,"Working at Walmart was fun , but I was still in high school I recommend to anyone who likes to work while in school and like standing on their feet all day but as for me id rather do this for temporary."
good,Meeting new applicants and training them in the ways of Wal-mart. Seeing how they make it and advance their career thru hard work. Letting them know they can come to me for guidance. It was a very rewarding position knowing you were helping people.
good,Management plays favorites quite a bit so it is easy to move up but this shouldn't be a good work environment. Employees are very friendly. Customer sanctification is one of the best things about the job.
good,Walmart pays good and will give you lots of hours if you want. My only complaint is that stores and management are not consistent. Working your way up takes quite a while.
good,"Walmart it good to work at if you pick the right store in the right market each store has it's own identity.  If you pick a good store with a good healthy culture its a wonderful place to work.  If you pick a store with a poor culture it can be an agonizing place to work at.  Getting a team built is the tough challenge at Walmart and unless you have a really strong team oriented culture in the store you go to you will have trouble succeeding.  My advice is to do your home work if looking for a salaried position, walk the store talk to the associates before taking a position in a store.  If you decide to take a store with those issues have a game plan going in."
good,"I honestly felt ashamed to work here. Got along with coworkers. Some of the management were competent and accommodating; I was able to comfortably negotiate pay and they were sometimes happy to work with my schedule. "
good,"Very busy store "
good,"i have worked here for many years, and have learned a lot along the way. I love to cross train and learn whenever I get the chance, and the management is certain to praise you for your hard work."
good,A very great workplace . Full of fun and laughter. Definitely recommended for anyone. Co-workers and management is great.
good,Wal-Mart is great company to work for just the one I worked wouldn't give me as much hours as I desired. But an average day working there would consist of stocking & helping customers with any they need.
good,There's no typical day there but that's what I liked about it the managers were understanding and compassionate. The Co-Workers were nice but everyone is different. The hardest part of the job was knowing i had to wait until someone quit or die to get promoted. One thing I did love was getting a lot of responsibility.
good,Have a nice break room in the back of the store to relax. have hour breaks and the coworkers are very great to get along with and are understanding. the pay is really great and so are the hours.
good,I enjoyed working for walmart. There was some things that I didn't like. I didn't like how chaotic it was working there. I was a stocker but sometimes they would throw me in a section I didn't work in. It was always busy and stressful.
good,"Not a very good place to work, the staff is over worked the company continues to push for more stringent sales quotas while cutting employee hours, everyone seemed really depressed....."
good,"I enjoyed the job itself, but the people and politics of the job are a little bit too much to handle at times. The manager I had was great and knew his job well. BUT they switch management and am stuck with someone that does not know how to correctly do my job and has never worked in the area before. So at times make sit hard to get things done when you need help because he also has to find help, which for a Manger to ask a normal employee an answer to a question he should know is unacceptable to me."
good,"I have learned to work and adapt well in a always changing environment. I have great customer service skills and enjoy working with people and getting to know our customers. I love working in a team and also separately when needed. I look forward to working customer service and always meeting new people."
good,"Management was absolutely terrible. However, I loved working for Wal-Mart because of the many opportunities for advancement. If you work hard at this company it is very easy to move up. The management team will give you goals that are hard to meet because of the lack of help and breath down your neck to make sure they are met."
good,"Daily work life is based off of your market manager alongside with the store manager. Depending on those circumstances the company can be a great place to work at and for, or it can be a living nightmare."
good,"This walmart needs better managers, ones that actually work. When i was there, it was more important who slept with, and not the quality of work you did"
good,"As an assistant manager at Walmart,  I have mixed feelings about Walmart.  There is a double standard for all associates.  If your not in the ""cool kids"" group you are treated poorly.  If the store manager doesn't like your voice on radio... your termed,  if you limp... your termed,  if your not termed,  they just make fun of you behind closed doors.  Very unprofessional!"
good,The managers are horrible here. They cannot make a schedule right. Every single day my department was short staff. The managers are always in the back room sitting down doing nothing but playing around on there phones.
good,"pull a pallet out to the sales floor and work off that as soon as you clock in."
good,I was on my feet all day and there was a lot of physical labor. I was also really pregnant. The management was not very good. The hardest part was physical labor.
good,"This job is great for people that can withstand very hard physical jobs. A typical day consists of coming into work, being assigned a department to stock, signing into the task, and going to work stocking the shelves for customers to buy. Co-workers are very diverse and tend to butt heads a lot when it comes to working techniques. The hardest part of the job for me is lifting up to 50lbs to stock items. The most enjoyable part of this job would be once a quarter when managment makes the staff lunch."
good,I was a pleasure working with the company for sixteen years there was some changes done with the company and they have to let some people go .it's a good company to work with and to get a lot of experience it provides me with knowledge and capabilities to interact with the people
good,"After 10 years with the company I have experienced a lot of ups and downs.  I have had supervisors and managers that were great to work with and taught me many things.  I also had some that were at times unfair, difficult, and only interested in advancing their own careers.  I also had the privilege of supervising and managing many outstanding and dedicated associates."
good,I worked for walmart for about a year doing overnight stocking. It was ok while it lasted. I enjoyed the overnight because I stayed up all night anyway
good,"A typical day at work would be taking the thawed bread out of the cooler, score it and then put it in the oven to bake, package bread, stock shelves. Assist customers."
good,"A sometimes difficult job, people not wanting to work together to get things done, too much standing around and not being productive and no pride in their work."
good,"a typical day is standing about 4-8 hours or walking picking up, cleaning, staring at screen, talking to customers and more. i learned how to stock, find and help. The management kind of bad because theres no communications in departments. Some of the higher up co-workrs act bad toward some of us and dont inform us on everything. standing for to long while picking stuff up.geting to meet new people"
good,"Lets start off with Most managers as a general opinion they would have there favorite people, These are the ones who get certified and the Manager will also stick his neck out for these guys to help them save there job. Even if that means throwing you under the bus for something you didn't do. But at the same time theres not a single associate that isn't favored by atleast one of the managers, some associate get favored more but there will always be the one manager that will help you keep your job, even tho every morning they start the daily meeting by saying ""Remember, Associate any of us are replaceable at anytime. Including us managers.) Which doesn't quite put you in the best mood to do your best job. All of your co works are great people, and generally nice. Altho it really seemed like I was back in highschool when I was working here, had your teachers (Team leaders) then you had the office attendance (Managers) and a bunch of young/mid-aged adults acting like there 16 and 17, people will flirt, people are segregated to groups during breaks and lunch, (not to mentention you will get in trouble for this aswell), and you got your loners that are there because they have to be. You even got Your  foreigns that don't speak English. Overall I would say its a great first job, but to keep in mind that its not a good place to make a career from. One last thing I was never properly trained on anything until after I had taken the ropes my self and tried  to figure out how to use it, plus you will get in trouble if you don't know how to use it even though, You have never been trained"
good,Walmart management needs to re-read Sam's Made in America book. A lot of the ideals that I used came from his book. Respect for all associates. My best part of my job was the associates.
good,"The store manager, and Assistant Managers are lazy and treats the department managers very poorly. They offer no support for new and seasoned Department managers or associates."
good,"Typical work day starts off pretty slow, I've learned how to work hands on with employee and how to keep a smile on my face daily. Management was okay. My co-workers are pretty laid back....the hardest part of the job was rush hour and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,fast paced workplace with a lot of standing and bending for the work day..minimum amount of breaks steady work enviorment
good,I'm young and young people make mistakes but it's always people coming in and trying to scam the new cashiers for money and I was one that got hit by a scammer and I really don't like the way Walmart handle those type of thing because it was my very first time since I got hired making a huge mistake like that and they didn't believe me at all and thought I knew the person and I never seen them in my life !
good,make sure you work for the right people to make sure that you get the advancement opportunities that are available. also make sure you want to stay in retail if you want to be in management.
good,"My manager is a great hard working professional and all my coworkers are like family, we take care of each other. I have been working here for a year and a half now and I have learnt most all the in's and out's of the pharmacy."
good,Not good management. People often don't stay on task. Workers play around at times. Workers also take advantage of position when the time is available.
good,"The Company seems alright, your training is watching about 30-40 videos.  Dont worry about answering the phone, you will  be frowned upon by staff.  More workload than a Pharmacist should be handling alone in most stores. Management seems inexperienced. I have not learned much. Co-workers are nice, there is a resentment do to Tech pay and now they have more responsibility but pay is still very poor."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but the location that i was employed at was not an overall great enviroment to be at. I was sexually harrassed and when i told managment they started to act funny.
good,Good job low pay that's all but very Ponent people and very easy job one u on ur own. Very realiable but low paying rate. I didi like the environments and the staff.
good,"Raise amounts are not reflected in ability, knowledge and capability.  Work days are fast paced.  Management is a mixed bag, some is good and some not so good, they need better training programs.  Some co-workers excelled and others did what they needed to get by.  Managerial reports were the hardest for non native English speakers.  Stocking items was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Management was unprofessional and scheduling was hectic. Lots of mistakes. Besides that, the environment, pay and coworkers were good. Fairly enjoyable."
good,"I liked working at Walmart, it was a fun and hands on job. I had the chance to meet all kinds of people, and really enjoyed the interactions.My coworkers were very friendly and i got along with everyone well."
good,"First time working retail, but I feel training was poor. Too many managers assigning different tasks, some of which I wasn't trained for. I shop there often, on last visit old coworker , whom I worked with daily, didn't even know my name."
good,"Rude customers are to be expected, but you top that with rude bosses, and over-zealous store managers, and it is ridiculous. People are fired left and right for the most absurd reasons. The higher up managers have let their positions go to their heads,  definitely on a power trip. Also don't expect to be promoted without promoting yourself, if you know what I mean. Unless you know someone or get to know someone, you'll always be at the bottom."
good,"For a family oriented company,they don't follow the philosophy. As soon as you become salary,you pretty much lose your family life."
good,"Majority of team is young, mostly English speaking. Management isn't completely organized, and your position isn't guaranteed; scheduling can be difficult with special circumstances (ex.: night school, classes on sat)"
good,Walmart is a good company to work. You can learn alot about retail.  It's a fast pace job and requires alot of lifting and pulling. And good customer service skills. It takes hard work and determination to move up.
good,"Wal-Mart is an interesting place to work. Just like any workplace there are pros and cons to it. Everyday is different and the same in a way. You may be hired to work in, say, the crafts and fabrics department, however, you will be moved around if there are other areas that need an associate. It's not really a ""Sales"" job, however, you can convince customers to buy other things along with what they came to buy. There is no commission, and no tips; if you are offered a tip or gift you are required to politely decline. Everyday you are expected to do roughly the same thing, collect returned items and put them in the correct location, zone your area and make it look presentable and easy to shop, and assist customers. On occasion you will be called up to cashier if the front end lines are getting long, or if they need an extra person to add a number to the cashier list. My personal experience with the management team at the store I worked at, wasn't the best, but nor was it the worst. My mangers brought a lot of unnecessary stress from home to work and took it out on the associates and sometimes, but rarely, even the customers. Sadly, my management team was biased, racist, and had short tempers. That being said though they were each individually strong and worked together. They would check up on associates a few times a day to not only make sure that we were working hard, but also that we were doing alright. I learned a lot about customer service, and grew quite a bit while I was there. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people, including customers, co-workers,"
good,"job is not to tough however management is never happy and expects you to work 200 percent everyday, expectations from workers is too much and it tends to make many employees uninterested in completing their responsibilities or having a good work ethic"
good,i worked for wal-mart of and on for 2 years its a decent work place but management can be a little bit better. the attandance system has improved.
good,Working for walmart is what you would expect when you think about the proposition. You are just another employee working a low level job with no illusions about having a stellar career for yourself. The job requirements are clearly stated and easy to comply with. There was nothing negative or positive to state about this company.
good,I dont like to stand in one place cashier will be at the register all shifted long we will take our hour lunch break and get back on the register. I like to move around i will love to be challenge at work it was just to easy working here.
good,"I worked to and exceeded expectations for the company. I went on on days off  as requested and helped Upper Management as well as associates fully. Honestly, there can be a lack of support at times from upper management. I feel all opinions matter and can make a difference, but most statements are unheard. Overall, it's a fair work environment that needs a lot more guidance for the associates."
good,It is very easy to stay busy. There is always work that needs to be done. I learned a lot about retail and customer service. I enjoyed most of my co-workers and customers. The hardest part of this job was keeping in communication with most management and lack of staff. I love working the holidays. Helping customers find their products and seeing the happiness on their face makes my day.
good,Typical day was stocking and directing customers to right departments of the store.  Really no hard part about the job.   Most enjoyable was keeping my weight down with all the stocking and movement!
good,What can I say. It is Walmart. The store manager turnover rate was very high. This caused moral to be very low. You did not have any idea what to expect each day at work.
good,I quickly moved up with this company and I quickly knew that it was not the right place for me.  I was over qualified for my position and the managers knew it.  The managers took advantage of the low pay and long hours by putting me in positions that should be filled by two or more people.
good,"I learned a lot of things at Wal-Mart, stocking procedures, company policies, working with diverse groups and also how to time manage and work in cold temperatures. The difficult part about this job was the work assignments were larger than my shift and most of the time I worked without assistance but was required to have the job done. My most enjoyable experience was assisting the costumers and working with a great group of people."
good,Not a place I would recommend due to poor management and communication. This has led to a low morale among the associates.
good,"I've only worked as a night stocker at WalMart for about 4 months and it's probably been the most stressful and demanding months of my life. Our old managers were great (they switch out every 6 months), our new ones however are terrible. The old ones would have workers come help other departments once they were finished with their own, they didn't hound you to get loads of work done each night, and they made sure to keep you updated on your workload and schedule. Our new managers are down right rude, they expect each and every associate to get around 10+ hours of freight, zoning, and return carts done within 7-8 hours. They expect all of us to know how to make bales yet none of the new associates were taught how to make them and they'll throw you in a new department a few times a week and expect new associates to know where everything is within an hour and get everything done. I work in housewares, domestics, and crafts and each night we are absolutely loaded with freight and return carts it's unreal. We're extremely understaffed, we've always got remodel in our way, they rarely if ever send help, and they continue to bring back stock you worked the previous night out as if merchandise has sold out over night. One of my managers compared my roommate/coworker to his autistic cousin and another watched her constantly and always had something smart to say although she always worked hard, she quit after a month. We've had 10 night stockers, one manager, and 8 remodel quit just within the past two months, which is about the same amount of time we've had these new managers. "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me opening the studio, completed the required morning data entries and then I would check to see which appointments I had that day. It was important to take your sales goal into consideration and use it as motivation to reach out to passers by and draw them into the studio with your enthusiasm. Customers could walk in at any moment to get a passport photo taken or some photos done of their children. I learnt it was important not to assume what customers wanted and to give them lots of options to choose from. The hardest part was breaking free of your comfort zone and approaching potential clients. Those who were not expecting to speak with you but have been giving the incentive to come to the studio and take some photos."
good,"I really like itspecially when we only have 15 minute break "
good,I did not have a single good experience working there. No training was done. Had zero help for the first 2 weeks and ended up getting laid off because I got bit by a brown recluse while on the job.
good,Walmart is pretty good just need more money to get Through life .. but it is a good company to work for. I move up to different position that was good.
good,If the management was better it would be a lot better place to work. They ask a lot out of there associates with little pay.
good,"A typical day at work was great. I did my work at a steady pace until it was time to go home. I learned how to communicate with many different people. The management was okay, didn't communicate as much but they let you know how to do things. The hardest part of the job was maintaining those 15-minute breaks but I started to get the hang of it and the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and the fact that it was my first job."
good,It has ups and downs. I didn't like the fact I worked on holidays. I wish I got more time off. The job was okay over all. The people I worked with was nice.
good,Working for Walmart would be the perfect job if they offered full time hours. I currently work 23-28 hours per week and find it difficult to provide for my family with such a small paycheck.
good,"good company, depends what store you work in.hard to get a single answer to employee concerns, and a lot of turnover in new employees.room for advancement."
good,"In the busy part of the day you are very rushed, and because you are dealing with money you are watched like a hawk. I did learn new skills such as merchandising (preparing the shelves according to who is paying top dollar for a particular shelf or section on the shelf). I also learned that the worst time to work there is during the holidays, not so much fun. Co-workers tend to keep to themselves and don't seem to be very happy or friendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with such strange scheduled hours, there are no set hours(8-5, M-F etc) per day or per week, they tend to jump all over the place making work life balance almost impossible. Very rarely do you ever get a forty hour week unless you work in the pharmacy. There are some customers that are rude and obnoxious and the holidays brings out the worst in them. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time after standing on your feet all day you are ready to go home. Not really intended to be a career choice unless you are going to be a store manager."
good,"Good managers alot of good people to work with,  when i worked there it seemed like i always did a shift alone or everyones tasks. they get on your case as soon as u walk in doesnt matter if your punched in or not."
good,"Typical day is running freight, cleaning up [zoning], and doing our best to help customer with what they need. Learn how to let thing roll off of you when angry customers come in when there isn't much we can do to help them. Most management is alright but like some jobs some people have favorites and some times its hard. Most Co Workers are amazing. I doubt I will ever come across so many people that I really enjoy working with. Some days we have time management issues and don't communicate with each other as we should but most of the time its a great bunch to work with. Hardest part of the job is manly when we have those tuff customers that you just cant please. The best part is my co workers and the really good customers that just make all the bad customers worth dealing with."
good,I enjoyed learning more about working with the public. I didn't loke the feeling that I should rush my customers. Fun coworkers and management.
good,Always have plenty to do on shifts. The bonuses are great. However the management and even some employees are very immature. They only close once a year.
good,"Let me just say, I love working for Walmart.However, they do not much allow full time positions, and I could not afford to work just part time. They like to cut hours frequently. Not good for someone that needs to pay bills regularly."
good,"Valorizarem mais o funcionario, pagarem mais e não promoterem o q não vão cumprir."
good,"Since Walmart now hire non-pharmacist personnel to be our district manager to run the pharmacy and vision center, our professional lives all turn sour and miserable. you feel you are constantly being watched over your shoulder.  constantly nit-picking on everything you do. We all feel we will not get any backup support from them . Instead, they will try the best to make your days more stressful on top of filling 400 scripts a day plus Imz plus patient counseling plus MTM drug adherence plus not enough staffing, etc."
good,"My nights consist of working with my fellow team members as a cohesive unit."
good,"Llegas temprano pero no tienes horario de salida y no te pagan horas extra, al solicitar permisos te los niegan por que primero es la empresa."
good,"Amaba mi trabajo!feliz con todo lo que hacia y aprendi,mi trabajo era  justo lo que me gusta hacer"
good,I worked in the pharmacy as a cashier. I learned how to pull meds and how to use the scan system they had. Management was not that great and seemed to only help those that had been there the longest. Some co-workers were ok and then you had those that talked about everyone and when asked for help got mad because they didn't want to help you. The hardest part of working there was standing on your feet for the entire shift but I did enjoy helping people.
good,"Wish job wouldn't have been temporary but it was a good place to gain experience, some of the management team were great to work for and ready to help and listen"
good,"As a sales associate your job is very redundant, stocking the same department everyday. Helping customers is a big part of the job. Knowing your department's layout and what all the produces are so you can answer any questions asked"
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar,que da oportunidade de crescimento,só deixa adesejar quanto a aumento de salário,quando ficamos por duas vezes com salário defasado levando 2 anos para termosaumento de salário."
good,"Cashier.."
good,Past pace environment more on dealing with. Customer service. Learn a lot from the daily basis helping with a customer! The manager there ok they understand your needs most of the time they work with schedule cause I use to have part time job! The hardest part of the job is the pay!
good,Worked for Walmart for two years and still was not able to get a full time position. Hours were all over the place and drastically different from week to week. Got walked all over even though I went above and beyond my department.
good,Easy to advance with hard work and dedication. Some mangers are great to work for. Cashiering is a lot of fun if your into customer service.Flexible work hours.
good,To be honest i kinda hated walmart because they very never stick to what they say and mean the fire you over dumb things they dont work with you. They except u to suck up with the manger who are rude at at time
good,Mcmart was a tiny McDonald with little no room for more then 4 employees it was closed down from lack of business other then walmart employees
good,Actively diverse workplace with growth potential to individuals who are willing to work hard and sacrifice to get ahead. Change is as a constant part of the job and the ability to re-invent ones self is a must.
good,"I was in charge of stocking merchandise, running a cash register, and helping customers with phone contracts mainly. I also was in charge of running the photo lab and processing photos, canvases, and everything else photo related. I was in charge of binning overstock in the back of the store or picking merchandise from the back to bring out to the shelf."
good,Overall o dont have a problem with the company as a whole but their need to be more team pkayers not ever assoicatw plays by the rules
good,"dealing with people on a regular basis can be enjoyable ,and learning how to make people happy with simple pleasures in life . and as far as the people that I work with well quite a few of them are a pleasure to be around and make the job easier, and as far as management goes it sucks cause they twist and bend the rules to benefit their own needs . and the best part of my job was meeting new people all the time."
good,Bad Work Environment. Great employees that are unfortunately disenfranchised. Management circumvents the rules to illegally fire employees.
good,"Walmart does have well enough benefits to make it all seem trusting during the interview phase, but once work starts then your getting thrown around like a frisbee. It's bad enough being tossed into chaos on the first day, but if you have associates who are less caring for others, work can be like boot camp. Honestly the associates smiles tell lies, the entire company influences smiling which is common everywhere. Yet when you have the customers, supervisors, or the rare sight of your manager smiling it all is a bit irritating. PLEASE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING BETTER!"
good,Some managers are okay. I have work here for 8 years without a writeup until they fired me. BESIDES that it is a great place to work. the benefit was excellent.
good,"A typical day at work was show up, sort shelves, unload trucks, and then stock shelves, and leave. Overall, not so much of a learning experience, mostly grunt work. Still, the pay was nice."
good,i have a lot of fun communicating with customers letting them what the deal of the day or even helping them out if they needed it.
good,"I really liked working there because I got to interact with a bunch of different people. Even got to have some regulars who would come to my line when I worked."
good,"Generally a good place to work."
good,"Intense atmosphere. High expectations, decent pay, moderate resources, understaffed at all times."
good,Started there when I was 15 years old and was there for almost 10 years.  They were a great company to  work for.  Was trained in most areas of the store.
good,They won't approve vacation to the hard workers or give it vacation to the ones they like. I want to find a better job where I can move up and use my skills.
good,i didnt agree with the people in management at the time they were nasty. they did not carry themselves  in a professional manner. they were young and i wasnt use to that coming out the military.
good,"As the years went on, felt like my needs didn't matter. Wanted me to work full time hours but didn't want me to have full time status so I couldn't get benefits. Would not recommend"
good,"pull pallets of groceries, front older products, and new products, customer service,work well with others, enjoyed co-workers. "
good,Wal Mart is a decent place to work however it does not work out well for someone seeking a career unless you have an interest in upper management. Your pay increases very slightly year to year and dealing with the decisions made at corporate level is usually not in the best interest of the store level associates.
good,"Spring season very intense with little reward.  Long days with little praise.  Management continually changing.  "
good,good place for a part time job. enjoyable staff and and managements. long hours and lots of. employees get a 10% discount of merchandise so that is a plus and on sundays half of the lunch is paid by wall-mart
good,I go into work. I would clock in and then go to my department to see what need to be work that the overnight people didn't get to. I have learned everything in the store from cashier to working in the deli. We have some good management. I love working with my co-workers we work together.
good,Walmart Is a good place for people who are  just starting out in the work force. I learned to stock and tag merchandise. I learned how to provide good costumer service and work as a team. I enjoy helping my costumers find what they needed so they became repeat costumers. Unloading a truck proved to be a challenge within the time restraints  we had some days.
good,"Very easy work, decent hours to be given to staff. Good staff to work with. Management was also helpful and good to their staff. Lots of room to move up."
good,"A typical day ranged from being done before lunch and begging for more work to almost not getting done with no in between. "
good,"When I started it was a good company to work for, back in 2007, but in the last years it's become less about the associates that make the company (sam walton talk) and more about how do we make more money by spending less regardless how it affects our associates and their families. So, if you need a job- go ahead but don't get sucked into moving up and such because you might just regret it."
good,I had a good work ethic at walmart but it got to the place where it was very stressful. Most of the managers would take me from my work to work on other things which would cause me to fall behind on my work forcing me to stay later than what I had to.
good,"Uma boa empresa para começar a trabalhar, mas a gerencia da loja deixa muito a desejar."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, pero pocas opciones de crecimiento profesional"
good,"Great first job, many opportunities for growth and self improvement. Different departments for you to move around and learn. Flexible hours perfect for college students who are looking for a part time job"
good,Talking with customers most the time. Stocking shelves and getting stock from the store room to bring out when we were low on other items.
good,I worked for Walmart almost 2 years in my short time there one assistant manager basically ran the whole store. If your not in with management kiss any possible promotion goodbye. This place was full of drama! They changed your schedule constantly sometimes without notice. The hardest part of this job is you have to do your own job plus 10 other people jobs.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers.
good,As a place to work in general my experience with Walmart has been a good one. That is until recently. Now I find myself looking for another place to work which will better relate to my family needs as  new management that has come into that store is not very concerned about his employee's family welfare. The store I worked last at has become a very stressful environment compared to the other locations I have worked in. They do however have a worthwhile benefit package and 3 kinds of profit sharing available.
good,I enjoyed working at the night shift at Walmart.  During a typical day I would stock merchandise on shelves.  I got along well with my co-workers and supervisor.
good,"i show up do my job, clown with my coworkers, we all got along we work well togather of course there was your problems but nothing crazy. i would loved to stay if the pay was better or moved up."
good,The days go by fast as a CSM your always on the go. I like my job. The hardest part is dealing with unhappy customers and trying to fix the problem that they are having. Every one usually gets along pretty well for the most part.
good,"Restocking shelves, handling all transactions, helping customers with needs. The hardest part of the job sometimes was when people use to put things in different spots and had to fix everything before closing time."
good,Seems like management goes on a rampage and targets a certain department. I have seen both of my supervisors get fired or forced to step down within weeks of each other and 5 coworkers on my team get fired in the past 3 months. They still expect us to get truck unloaded and most of that merchandise stocked by the end of our shift. It is very stressful. I love the majority of my coworkers and I used to love my job until management made it too stressful.
good,"A typical day at work consist of being assigned a department for the day. Once we are assigned to our area we then go through Walmart's Cap system and pick all necessary merchandise out the bins. once all bins have been picked we then run the items out to the floor and stock them. As a cap associate we are responsible for changing counts, auditing the bins, and providing top customer service. I have obtained my walkie stacker licen"
good,"Required to pack and repack orders when necessary and weigh them according to instructions. They need to be vigilant and organized personnel as the need to ensure that inbound and outbound shipments are accurate and free of damage. Since this is a job based in a warehouse, able to operate a forklift and possess a license for its operation."
good,i have nothing bad to say other then being a cashier is alright and the wage isn't horrible but standing around all day without being able to walk around and do other stuff sucks.
good,Decent job good people to work with! I worked in the Tire and Lube area of walmart.  The service managers are willing to help the workers. Any higher managment is only concered with the customer!
good,"During my 5 years of being at Walmart I found it being a challenge in advancing to the next job level. Why you ask ?. Well for starter's being in that kind of work environment is very challenging and very competitive towards other colleagues. Not to mention there are times where bad days will creep up on you and customers will start to complain about every thing from bad customer service to about store not being cleaned or shelves not being stocked to when you're the only Associate working in that department and covering another department just so the other Associate can take there lunch. That would be a typical day at Walmart."
good,"A day at this Wal-Mart is busy, I myself know how to handle 3 departments and get paid the lowest of the three. My department is usually not too busy, but the other two can get hectic. I learned how to use two different systems of registers, how to reboot 3 different systems, how to multitask between customers and management, and how to use some warehouse system programs. Management here varies from those that ignore their assigned departments, to those that help out any associate in need. Dependable co-workers are few, but not rare. The hardest part of the job is having your hard work recognized but be dismissed entirely when you want to climb up in the work ladder. The most enjoyable part is when you can see how well you attended a customer and made part of their day great."
good,Love the people I worked with just not the job itself. I just need something that is more willing to work with my availability schedule.
good,"Great place with good benifits. If you don't mind standing up all day this is the job for you! You'll get 35-39.5 hours as a part timer and 40+ full time. If you're in school, this is not the place for you."
good,"A team effort, and environment doesn't always feel like equal team work. but it was always enough to keep busy. I liked the days at work sometimes and other days wasn't quite welcoming."
good,"Today at work, I scanned and bagged items, and exchanged money with customers. Keeping a friendly smile is the best thing you can do. Always make conversation with the customer."
good,The job was very easy there was not to many negatives about it at all. However one thing that did catch my attention was that some people were not treated as fairly as others.
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in on time, getting situated wheather I am going to do the register, self-checkout, or returns. I have learned to be careful with everything that i am doing. Doing everything as efficently as possible and providing top of the line customer service. Managment could be on the same page that could be the hardest part a out the job. The best part about the job is the customer interaction"
good,"nice place to work if you enjoy customers and fast paced learning,have to find the right manager for your personality or it makes for a tough work day"
good,"It's a great job for part-time students, or part-time workers, benefits are good, Good family store, low prices, no job security though, to much work for lite employees"
good,I'm very happy. Great people person. Good customer service. I work hard no matter what the job is. Always filled work rules and always strive for better.
good,"Walmart honestly isnt all that bad, unless you have terrible managers. in which case they are usually very frustrating and uncooperative. The work isnt very hard but the managers make everything much more difficult."
good,"I enjoyed some of the people , but it was sad seeing most if the people who work here with empty , non-smiling faces. Management needs improvement thank you"
good,"I have learned a large amount in the time i have spent there with Walmart, from dealing with frustrating customers to extreme unrealistic expectations from management. I gained necessary experience from them but moving up in the company seemed unrealistic most days."
good,The decided that they (the company) could save money by cutting hours.  Then they reduced the hours of full timers to the min. and start hiring only part time people.
good,It was very hard when my son got sick. The manager in tje pharmacy switched  a lot. I love my co workers. We worked well togather as a team. I find that very important.
good,"There was many ups and downs working for Walmart.  Walmart managers would show favorites for certain people. The people who would work the hardest would be the main ones to be getting in trouble for minor things."
good,I enjoyed my job at Wal-Mart but didnt like a feew of the people I worked with which made it hard to enjoy my job. I enjoyed the work i did and helping the customers.
good,Very busy filling and answering phones. Learned to use the scanners and handhelds for filling. My manager and co-workers were good to work with very friendly and helpful.
good,"The money was there but they are too strict on PTO days. Even if you're approved sick days, it still counts against attendance and you could get fired."
good,"I wouldn't exactly recommend this position to anyone. Management has constantly changed in the past year. Yes it pays fairly well, but the stress of being dragged all over the store may not be worth it in the end."
good,"Working in walmart as a cashier is not a fun job."
good,Friendly co workers and management team. They accommodate well to your available hours. Always try to make your work experience as pleasant as possible. Can get very stressful during the busy hours.
good,Management has high expectations of its employers with little backing. Co-workers were the best and life saviors of my job. Learned to multi task and be professional in all situations presented to me.
good,Walmart Kamloops is a great  company to work with and i  can  boldly say i have really gained a lot of  Canadian experience working in Walmart. I have been able to improve on how to interact and  deal diligently with customers.
good,co-workers got alone at work and outside. employees stay busy all day. Management had up and down days with employees. management favor other employees more the others
good,"This job was merely meant to be a stepping stone while I was completing my Bachelor's degree. I needed something that had decent pays and a flexible schedule.  I was able to work a good amount of hours while still maintaining my school schedule and homework.  My typical day at work consists of being by the department managers side and following in her footsteps after she has left for the day.  I typically do the things that she has been unable to complete for the day.  I do things that are beyond my pay grade and position.  I have learned that this company takes little notice in it's hard working associates and frowns upon people very easily.  Several opportunities have come up for me to move up, but I chose not to take them due to school obligations at the time.  The hardest part of the job is working harder than other people in the department and being paid the same.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when I get a happy customer that is truly appreciative of the work that I have done or something small that I have done for them.  It just puts a smile on my face and makes it all worth it."
good,If the upper management treated everyone on a equal level it would be a great company to work for and the moral of their employees would not be so low.
good,"It's Walmart, nothing too special about working at this company. It's one of those jobs you stay for like a year and find another. I find this job great for teenagers looking for their first job, but don't expect much. As a cashier you see, meet and talk to many customers, standing at the register, ringing up people's stuff. Not very fun, but what do you expect working at a retail job."
good,The jobs are easy but the pay is poor in my opinion. You're better off working for a grocery DC than ecommerce. Grocery is harder work but the pay is was better.
good,"training information is good "
good,"It was fun at first but I think I just want to move on & make more money , and learn my things . Walmart does do things fit associates but not that much it often"
good,"Same routine every day, how to deal with customers such as friendly, rude, slow, hateful. stand on your feet all day. 28 registers only 5 open at a time."
good,"He/she interfaces with customers daily and performs a lot of tasks which include answering questions regarding the store products, services, and policies.sales associate to go round the store periodically, introducing him or herself and finding out from customers if they needed any assistance with locating items, and following through to offering help.In summary, the ideal person for this role at Walmart must be friendly, accommodating, and have a positive demeanor and a good written and oral communication skills"
good,"was not the best place to work but it was fun at times"
good,I've enjoyed working for the distribution center in Virgina. I got a chance to meet really cool people. Most of the co-workers played as a team.
good,A nice place to work once you get a read on people and learn what you are doing. Could use some nicer more informed and useful members of the management team.
good,"A typical day would to clock in and go right to work. I have learned the basics when starting, their training technique is very good, hands on. The management is very strict as to what you can and cannot do. Most of the Co-Workers were very straight forward just to get their job done and go home. The hardest part of the day, would have to be management. If you do something wrong be prepared to get an ear full on why or what you did wrong. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing customers leaving happy with a good time."
good,"Walmart changes rules every other week , takes benefits away instead of giving!! Management changes all the time!! They do not train employees very well!!!!"
good,Over all Walmart was fun and challenging. Upper Ming. Not so friendly. Lower to middle Mng. Friendly and personible. Fellow employees fun and social.
good,"I learn to never give up on a problem, there's always some type of way to fix the issue. If you are a student attending school then this is the perfect job for you, I learned how to deal with multiple personalities as well as find something for each individual's needs."
good,it was routine every night. the management was not entirely organized and had little communicate. learned how to used a telezon and a labeling printer.
good,"I was responsible for managing the cashiers, their breaks and lunches.  I gave the cashiers change and overrides when needed.  I handled any problems the customers had.  I learned that whenever you need a supervisor to give you permission to do a certain override or return you had better get it in writing, that is what cost me my job of 7 years.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public.  I learned that management did not always have your back and if something went wrong the blame would fall on you."
good,"I worked there for a year and a half and I have never felt more unappreciated and replaceable. The environment was horrible, my co-workers were decent and the managers were only ok, unless they didn't like you. The work load was too heavy, time allotted for projects was unachievable and management didn't seem to care."
good,"Working here for me was fun, meeting new people, and helping customers and team members. It was very easy to get employed here training was very short and should think about making more time for the learning of the transactions and scenarios being taken care of in this department so new employees can better take care of the customers."
good,Most days consisted of stocking the sales floor at night. There were a few occasions when the management team failed to realize when I would show up to work. They would have certain tasks submitted then more then half way through would change my task area.
good,"I loved being able to spend time with my fellow employees. Our store was always kept clean and organized. My main problem was with the management, in the beginning they would tell us that we could come to them for anything and that they will work with us on our schedules, but when something came up they would say that there is nothing that they can do and then we'd get in trouble if we had to miss work. That is just one example."
good,A good place to learn new skills and develop a good work ethic.  Its fast paced and can be stressful at times but overall what you would expect from a super store.
good,"employees and managers were nice, hours were all over place as far as the schedule. overall it was an ok job, it was stressful most of the time but an easy job."
good,Most days I enjoyed working with other employees. I really liked helping customers. Really easy job. The management was fair.
good,"The most basic day at Walmart, I would describe as hectic but fun because it made time go by quicker. I learned that everything was fast paced and their was little margin for error.  Management was always mostly giving us a hard time because they thought we could do better but realistically they were generally asking too much of us. The hardest part about my day at Walmart was admitting that the customer was always right even when they are clearly wrong and later on getting yelled at by my bosses because I did not do everything i could have for the customer. At the end of the day, I most enjoyed my coworkers because we always had a blast even if it was the worst day of the week."
good,Was a good job but was not something I seen my self working long term but short term. Was not flexible with hours but needed something I love without feeling like I was forcing myself
good,"Días típicos en los que tenemos muchos clientes, deviamos estar completamente tranquilos y atentos a lo que pasa a mi alrededor, dando apoyo a los compañeros de linea de cajas para que el cobro de la mercancía fuese mas fácil y rápido para darle un agrado a nuestros clientes."
good,"Executive leaders are champions for innovative thinking, inclusion, development, and taking risk.  This ideology does not trickle past the messy middle. The work environment is incredibly conservative, as are the associates. Also, limited autonomy and a ton of bureaucracy."
good,"All of this depends upon department, store manager ""policies"", upper management, any help or sales floor associates in your department. "
good,"Typical day:"
good,"The job can sometimes be very stressful , especially when there are employee`s that called out or no-show. the most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction."
good,"Wal-Mart is one of the few companies that an employee can start out as a cart pusher, cashier, stocker, etc. and end up being a salaried member of management in a short time period.  The advancement opportunities are there if one chooses to pursue that career."
good,I loved my job as a unloader and found it a very fulfilling job. The fellow workers were not all as kind and welcoming as I was hopping but it made for a uneasy environment. The trainers there are top of the line and gave me a whole new training in forklift experience.
good,"The place was cool the work at and it's easy to make friends. The job is easy to do and you're provided plenty of training both on hand and computerized."
good,"A typical day at work requires a lot of walking across the entire store. I have met a lot of nice people , customers and employees, but find the management very hard to work with/for. My biggest challenge is not given the right tools to accomplish a job well done and the lack of support to do so."
good,Management didn't seem to care about employees well being. THere were plenty of hours to work and long lunch breaks. plenty of cahnces to get higher into the company.
good,"It all depends on where you work and mostly, Who you work for. Its not really Walmart as a whole but the store manager who will make your experience either bad or good. I have worked for some good, some great and then a horrible manager in the past."
good,"As a manager I was given a substantial amount of training before being placed into my actual assignment. Nothing trains you like hands on, however. There is not enough shadowing and other training elements implemented once on the job."
good,"A typical work day flow and tasks responsible for/achieved;"
good,"I worked overnight shifts from 10pm to 7am at first i like thejob but then i saw how strict they are and started to not like it,but was easy money not a hard job."
good,Wal-Mart was great the people was nice but the favoritism was too off putting it felt like you couldn't move up unless someone liked you and not you work.
good,Ok pay took away sunday premium and holiday pay working most holidays and weekends but ok benefits and place to work
good,"O que me faz pensar em um bom emprego  é ter uma base entre a empresa e o empregado ter apoio e boas condições de trabalho com todo material necessário para que se cumpra o que foi solicitado, e sim cobrar mas também se fazer elogios quando se supera e suas realizações."
good,"Not organized, A lot of argumentative employees, looking more for a family type job, so I could build a career with the company"
good,"Working there wasnt hard. There wasnt much to do, and we had to find busy work to keep occupied which i extremely dislike. Management changed too often. There wasnt enough communication on the electronics sales floor. Inventory was often wrong."
good,"Great company to learn multiply new job skills but besides that soul crushing place to work. Associates are put under so much pressure to do the impossible. Tasks are time ridiculous, 15 mins. To finish a pallet, 3 hrs to detail zone a department while helping customers shop and being part time cashier. RIDICULOUS!"
good,Able to move up within 6 months if you're good enough. The managers are just awful and don't care at all about you. If you have to travel you aren't always compensated.
good,"great hands on experience as a unloader. great co-workers and team building experience. learned, high dollar, zones, heavy equipment, cold chain. its was a first time job out of fast food. it had its down like the point sytem, some associates, management, an supervisors that have been there for a while was putting a 100% like your suppose to as a employee"
good,"While I enjoy working with my coworkers, and I have respect and admiration for the majority of my managers, it is very difficult to feel appreciated when my hours are getting cut and I'm being asked to do more in less time."
good,"Days were very long and boring, I learned about customer service and food safety. Management was friendly, but most employees were not."
good,"Great place to start, however it is, in my opinion, just a place to gain basic experience, and move on afterwards, since it is family owned."
good,Learning new things everyday in the Pharmacy. management is just fine need to be more professional. a lot of favoritism in between co-workers.
good,Overnight associates come in at night at 10pm. We have a nightly meeting in the backroom so everyone will know what department he/she works in. We go to the floor put up stock. After we put up stock we get empty pallets off of the floor and zone before the store opens.
good,"People speak poorly of walmart, but people complain at any job they work at for varied reasons."
good,The co workers and staff were so awesome! The hardest part of the job was to deal with so many customers at a time with no price tags on anything.
good,"Hours are pretty flexible, good benefits, often raises. Management wasn't ran to well, friendly coworkers overall. Very good at promoting employee's. Biggest issue is the management for the location wasn't too good."
good,I had a routine I tried to follow everyday: I started at one end of the store and work my way around the entire store. Hardest part was plugged toilets but the most enjoyable part was getting the know most of the employees. Also Management was pretty good when you needed to talk about anything.
good,I work part time as a cashier and enjoy both the customers and my co-workers.  WalMart has been very good to me regarding my requested work hours.
good,"A typical day at work is quiet and slow paced since its the night shift. During my time at Walmart I've learned to work an electric power jack, a handheld scanner and to properly make a cardboard bale. Our management is the strongest part of our store. They make sure everything that has to be done gets done in a timely matter. My co-workers are some of the most amazing people I've ever met. They make work easier and more enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is setting a modular that has a lot of little items because it takes longer for me to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing my assigned task early and lending a helping hand to a fellow associate."
good,"I enjoy my co- workers, but some days it's like non stop rude customers, and the management never have your back when it came to a problem. For me, I didn't need the hours and the money so it wasn't a problem, but there is no way you could support yourself on the hours your given unless your full time. but even then you dont have much wiggle room."
good,Great for young person as entry level management. Hard work and your immediate management will make or break this position for employee. Culture on paper is great but reality in workplace is not the same. With proper support to advance you by management could be a great position but due to shortage of takers you may be stuck in position for years.
good,"buen ambiente laboral con compañeros manejar dineros , me gusto trabajar para esta empresa da seguridad momentanea si trabajar bien"
good,"I was a shipping clerk at the Walmart D.C.  I worked loading trucks for store delivery.  It was a great experience.  Working for Walmart was great they gave you a employee discount card, and a great hourly wage."
good,"I learned a great deal about the transportation and real estate business for a large retailer.  I liked my co-workers, but management seemed to be very inconsistent across departments and divisions.  The hardest part of the job was finding work/life balance and obtaining the recognition hourly employees deserved.  It appeared in some departments there were favorites and other outstanding employees were overlooked.  Most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was the people I worked with and the community activities that Walmart was involved in."
good,stock the merchandise for the department i was in. Then i would zone it all and make sure it was nice and neat and where it belonged
good,"Good workplace, employees are friendly and tend to lend a helping hand if you need help. store is kinda outdated an a way can use a facelift."
good,"When I first started working for Walmart the company was a very positive place to work, but this last year they've made so many changes in their company that are not in benefit of their employees."
good,"They expect you to be available to work everyday, all hours, no exceptions. Managers seemed to care about voiced concerns but, then did nothing to address workplace issues, moral problems throughout the store as team members were passed over for job positions and transfers. Transfers to other stores took a minimum of 6 months and promotions could drag on for 4-5 months after paperwork was filled out and filed. Unless you were a friend of a manager then you could change position over night."
good,"Walmart is a company to help mature you for the real world. Walmart allows you the opportunity to move up in the company.The hardiest part of the job is not having the basic training you need in order to succeed to reach a higher goal. "
good,"Os ideais da empresa são bons, porém são muitos superiores se envolvendo em setores que não são seus."
good,"Working as a cashier was great I got to meet a lot of people. I learned a lot about my customers. The management on day shift was awful, they didn't know how to treat there people. My co workers was great people and I got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was the standing for long periods of time and the schedule.I really enjoyed talking and meeting new people."
good,one of the co workers made it so much harder than it needed to be. the bees by the compost sucked and was scary. working in the freezers on a hot day was the best.
good,"A day at work is basically to assure good in stock merchandise and presentation. First, I tour the floor, scan all the labels, create merchandise picks, review the inventory to correct, make order if needed. Sometimes, do interview, and for sure, assure good customer service. Check emails for any message from my supervisor, etc.."
good,"its an ok job to start off but not to pursue an career. Management is awful they don't communicate nor do they do their jobs. They do not know how to talk to their employees.The benefits are good and all but its the management that don't know how to treat their employees, they will over work you."
good,"Ring up lots of customers"
good,"Management was fair enough in giving company benefits to employees.  However, there was no chance to even transfer to another department.  "
good,"un dia tipico para mi en el trabajo era hacer zona de defensa,surtir el area asignada atencion al cliente , lo que me gustaba era los viernes  de desayuno  nos mantenian comunicado de los frutos que cosechabamos . el gerente sabia mantener el margen de las ventas , pero no con sus empleados."
good,This job is okay although there is a lot of favoritism given to the ones that are most liked. Everyone doesn't get the same treatment.
good,"I would sign in and go straight to the cash register I was assigned to.Then my supervisor would inform me of what needs to be done at that time,if there was anything specific.My main job was to help the customers with whatever they needed and to cash them out  I always kept my self busy doing things or just and dusting.I got along with the coworkers great. I learned that the customer is always right. I have a very friendly attitude so I didn't experience but one or two disgruntled customers and was told by management that they were like that to everyone. The best part of the job was meeting new people every day.And the regulars too. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers on a daily basis."
good,"I started out as a full time student employee and went from cashier to Customer service manager within a short few months,"
good,always busy  understaffed so will be trained doing many different things hours are not very good but if u work hard you can move up
good,Salarios del mínimo con prestaciones buenas le falta apoyar a los empleados con buenos descuentos con premios con buenos sueldo
good,A very busy place to work.  Loved the challenges. Though its little hectic but got to learn a lot. Great Managers to work with and got to train some awesome cashiers.
good,I only lasted a little while. I quit before it had become a Super Centre. I was young and it was my first job. Overall I met and became friends with some really nice people who still work there today.
good,"Day consisted of coming in and prepping trucks for unloading, unloading all freight from trailers, and distributing pallets with freight to various locations throughout the store to be stocked.  While I was there learned team building and how to work under a lot of stress.  "
good,"A typical day was filled with work. Management was okay for the most part, most co-workers were fun to work with, hardest part of the job was running food carts, and i found the most enjoyment in running freight/stocking the shelves."
good,"Walmart was a good learning experience and I loved working in the accounting office and it showed me that was something I liked to do, but the management was very difficult which required me to really stay calm and resolve issues in the quickest manner possible."
good,As a cashier I conduct financial transactions using cash registers by taking cash in exchange of items sold. Also balance cash drawer at the end of each shift and handle any evident discrepancies. Wal mart can be a hacked place at times and the customers can cause a very bad day. I really enjoyed helping out people the best way I could.
good,"It's Wal-Mart. Everybody probably knows someone who's worked at Wal-Mart.There's not too much to elaborate on, you can ask someone who works at your local Wal-Mart if they like it, they'll tell you. Every Wal-Mart is different, so ask away."
good,"When I first started I was part-time and I ended up becoming full time by asking for more hours. The store manager didn't like that I changed my availability and told other workers how mad he was with and I felt that it wasn't very professional. Also on my application it said that I could change my availability after a 3 month probation, I really wanted to work first shift because I have two young children. I really didn't like the way the managers treated the employees. I did learn a lot from working in the deli, as far as the proper way to clean utensils, cooking, and dealing with different types customers and their needs. I loved making the customers feel like they were somewhere friendly and at a place where their needs would be met. The hardest part of my job was closing the deli by myself , but I finished and got the job done."
good,"I really enjoy working for Walmart. The work is easy. I get along with everyone that I work with. The only downfall to working here is you hardly get enough hours to be able to support yourself on just one income. The break system they have is very great because after a certain time of being there, if you do not go to your lunch then you get locked out. So there is never a day that you have to miss lunch or miss a break."
good,Always stock to work with multiple trucks coming daily. Always products to restock and organize after busy days with customers.
good,"I have learned customer service through walmart, and that the customer is always right. I have a bright smile for each customer that comes through my line, and I always ask them how their day has been. I try to make them leave in a happy mood. The hardest part of my job is learning that I can't make everyone happy, and the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that they leave with a smile"
good,"I enjoyed waiting on the customers and slicing the cheese and meats. I enjoyed baking the bread products for the orders,."
good,"I liked working with a new store before and after grand opening, the area was a good choice. The customers and associates loved the location."
good,"existe un buen ambiente de trabajo, en donde se aprendes muchas cosas. como coordinación, liderazgo, trabajo en equipo, asi como planear y organizar. pero indiscutible mente la coordinación de la gerencia es un gran obstáculo al que te enfrentas. Esto ocurre porque no tienen bien establecidos los objetivos para el día a día."
good,Walmart was a good experience where I learned a lot. I always found that we we understaffed or i had to do more then one persons job so that got annoying. Other wise it was a good job i had no trouble with the management but just looking at the others that worked there there was no way to move up/
good,"Good first time job. Pretty simple, not alot of rush needed. Friendly co-workers and management . Discount is ok, and pay could be better."
good,"It was a great job. I just needed a little more compensation for me and my daughter. So i had found another job. I learned a lot from walmart, im very great with customers and now i know how to talk more and got more confidence. I loved working with everybody it was very fun. The hard part was that walmart was a little corrupt. It was favoritism and it just wasnt proffessional. The best part was meeting new poeple everyday. I loved talking to poeple and always making sure there having a good day."
good,very busy work place. Have to be able to multi task everyday. must work as a team. Must have excellent customer service. and deal with difficult customers regularly
good,"I learned customer service, organization skills.The management was great at helping with problems in the work place."
good,"On a typical day we work anywhere from 8-14 hours. I learned that working on timed rate is not easy, or working in -40 degrees. Management was not very talkative or rewarding. Never really knew most of my co-workers names due to the constant and vigorous work. I think the hardest part of the job was being in the cold for a long period of time, and the constant lifting at such a fast pace. I think the most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing we were getting close to finishing the day."
good,The work place was acceptable the customer base made every day a little more interesting than the last especially when the time came to activate phones it could take anywhere from 10mins to 2hrs which in most cases the customer worked with you and made it go a little more smoothly.
good,"I applied for Walmart because I needed a job. I was going to look for another job and quit Walmart within a couple months. I liked the people and the job so i never ended up looking for a new job. Things were good until about 2 and a half months ago. Walmart changed so much, I went away on a month vacation and no one bother to tell me that they changed 95% of my job description and keep giving me trouble about it. I called out one of the managers in front of a Co-manager and then the co-manager told me what has changed about my job. That's when things started to go downhill. I would recommend Walmart to others for a fun part time job but not for a long period of time for a career."
good,"I overnight stocked and it was lovely. I stocked the shelves,  maintained a cleaned area, and answered customer questions. I didn't like the pay. It was too low for me."
good,"It was honestly just work, best part of the job was the physical exercise, hardest part was keeping pace through all inclement weather."
good,I learned a lot but mostly how to talk and work in spaces with a lot of people. management was mostly good some are not nice at all. co workers made it fun we all got along mostly. hardest part of the job had to be when you get yelled at by the customers. and fun part was answered customers questions I like to help people
good,"A typical day at work had all Customer Service Manager's bustling about; sending people on scheduled breaks, managing any lines at the store, making sure the area is clean and safe, and keeping up the rate of production at the required percentage. I've learned how to be authoritative and respectful to peers and those under me, how to be assertive despite being younger than most in my field, and how to train and lead by example. "
good,"i enjoyed most of the work meeting people keeping my department clean and making sure everything was freshly stocked,i worked with a energetic team of young people myself included ready to knock the day out and take on any challenges that came our way"
good,A nice place to work.Good atmosphere.This particular store has a great management system.I have nothing further to say.
good,"I enjoyed unloading trucks and stocking furniture. I was glad that I satisfied my department manager. I had previously worked for Walmart in Abilene, TX and had satisfied my bosses there. I was unfortunately unable to do so in Irving."
good,"Meet, Greet and assist customers"
good,"Demanding fast past environment, understaffed to maximize workers production and stress. Receive a pat on back for good job instead of advancement opportunity or compensation."
good,Good chance to move up pay is alright people are alright. I worked there during high school so i didnt have that big of chance to move up
good,"I worked for walmart for almost 7 years doing different things in different stores.  Company values do not transfer very well from store to store.  In one store, we strove to give the customers as best service as possible. In another, everyone is just there to get paid.  Walmart is a huge company and it is almost impossible to make sure than every single person is on the same page.  Some times, the store will be in such desperate need for employees that those who do nothing and should not be working there, get to keep on doing the little bit that they do because it's better than not having someone there at all.  Management can be impossible sometimes.  I was at operational manager level for a while and stepped down because they did not like my sense of urgency.  Tasks are usually impossible to finish and meet high standards and are expected to just get done and as long as the final product does not look horrible, then it's fine.  Suppliers can be difficult to work with and sometimes it falls to you to explain to a customer that the product they have their mind set on just isn't there.  The biggest problem might be their P.O.S. system.  It just doesn't seem to work most of the time.  Products can say that they are being shipped, which should take no more than one to two days, but may never show up.  This could be mostly human error on the distribution side thought.  Theft is a huge problem and it is not handled well."
good,"I came in, disassembled, cleaned, reassembled, and went home. Sometimes I would have to stock or zone but it wasn't part of my job."
good,Walmart has a high overturn of people. Management doesn't stick to what they say. Management plays favorites. Always sends people to other stores but can't send other stores to help us.
good,"come into work go to my assigned location cash out customers, cover breaks. "
good,"Learned  about Wal-Mart's customer service and  how to give an excellent customer service experience, also meet alot of great people during my employment here."
good,"Walmart was a surprisingly fun job. You where mostly independent while working the registers but if you needed help there was almost always someone there for you. The low side, however, was the clutter that we worked in. The schedules where changing so often that it was hard to keep up. That and other unclear aspects made it difficult to stay ahead there."
good,It was great to go in everyday and give customer care service with the awesome associates. I found it was difficult to absolutely please everyone but still aimed to please 100%. it was so pleasing to be able to assist customer with all of their shopping and money services
good,A typical day at work would start when I clocked in for my shift.After I started my shift I would go and task to see where iI was needed for the day. Most of the times I would rotate various registers through  out the day. Some days I would be tasked to other areas like the garden center or to the clothing area. I learned that I have to be quick and productive to best service my customers.I also learned to rely on my instincts so I wouldn't have to bother my supervisors to much. A few times I would have a customer come up with a price match and was told by my supervisor that if I thought it was reasonable i could go ahead and do it as to lighten their stress load.Most of management were willing to compromise with me and looked out for the employees. The hardest part of the job was to get the customers through the line fast. I prefer to interact with my customers which makes my productivity a little bit lower but I gain loyal customers from it who i would see on a daily basis and ask for me constantly.I enjoyed getting to meet new people every day and learn a little bit about there lives.
good,"It was a great first job, but not something I could do for the rest of my life without going crazy. I was needed to work either too many hours and they didn't understand when i needed time off for school or i needed extra hours and they refused to give me over 20 at times."
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work when it was overnights and not a 24 hour store. Once that took over, customers were worse at night than in the day time. There was no reason to be rude to an employee just because their pallets are in your way. They have no other time to stock. Why are you out at 4 a.m. shopping?"
good,"A typical day at work for me is making sure that breaks are on time, making sure that the cashiers and other floor associates with registers have the money they need for the day, line managing and promoting the Wal-Mart Rewards Mastercard. "
good,"I have to say after 3 years of working for Walmart it was ok. There where up and down periods. One thing i didn't like the most was that there was never enough Jacks to do your job on time. Then you would get yelled at, complained about not being done on time, having to work overtime. Had around 20 Departments yet only enough jacks for 11. So that part was not fun having to constantly beg to use a fellow co workers jack just to get job done. Spending 10 minutes every 2 hours to find a jack is horrible would have rather put that 10 minutes into stocking, getting done faster. "
good,"A typical day for me is pretty much bringing in carts my entire shift as they never have more than one store standards on at a time. "
good,"Was an ok place to work, not as much challenge as desired. I was able to focus on the customer, and to clean, but there was little challenge."
good,I needed more money and more personal responsibitly.  The hardest part of the job was even though it was personal for the customer it became not personal for me
good,Walmart was okay. very god starting job. somedays better some days worse. didn't like how some management thought that they were better than others.
good,Working environment is good. Managers and other staff were helpful. Work hours are not flexible. Employee deserve decent pay for the work they do.
good,The job is good for however long you would like to work there. Your basically just stocking the shelves and some interacting with customers so as long as your able to do that then you will be fine
good,"Trabalho muito intenso e muita correira, não tinha tempo pra fazer nada fora do trabalho."
good,"At Walmart I would come in five days a week from 10 pm until 7 am and stock shelves. I would go to the computer and find my work load for the night, it would tell me where I would be going and how long it should take me to do the job. I would stock products that needed to be stocked and put the overflow items in the back. The people working with me were very nice and helpful when I started, management always answered my questions and made sure I had extra help when needed. I was not very fond of the hours I worked and how labor intensive the job was. I would be standing on my feet for hours at a time lifting boxes and going up and down a ladder. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some fun people, they made the hours go by faster and the job a little easier."
good,"Good company to work for if your interest is developing a career. The ability to advance with the company is easy. You have the opportunity to enroll in a 401K plan, contribute to the stocks of the company and have the company match your contribution up to 6%. You are working with a very diverse population and have a chance to learn all aspects of the company."
good,I really beleive in the old fashioned customer service where I can get to know customers as well as other associates by their name. Welcoming them to our store and taking a personal interest with any issues that might arise.
good,managment was great except for one manager who would befriend you and get highly upset if she feels you are not her friend anymore. more play than buisness
good,Wal-mart was a great company but the one I worked out just seemed like they try to get people fired that they don't like. I would love to work there it just certain managers there are as professional as they claim to be and they want you to devote your whole life to wal-mart and never call in I went to the emergency one night so I couldn't go to work cause my heart rate was super high and I didn't get out until 3:00am that morning so typically I should of just called in that day too but me being good worker I wanted  go and at least show my face and they already had there own idea about me so that's how that went but I wish the best luck  to them in the future.
good,"I worked in sporting goods and and hardware also unloaded truck on occasion , also cowworkers were nice, I enjoyed the customers espepcially reapet ones"
good,overall a good place to work friendly associates and loyal managers creating a safe work enviornment and enhancment for furthering your career
good,my overall review from working at walmart was good pleasant people and good managers.can be a good company to work for it provides good jobs and job security
good,"I love working with the public and co-workers. Unfortunately, management isn't up to par as a very well known public place."
good,"I genuinely applichiate the opportunities and the experiences this job has offered me! Even though I had to leave, I left with valuable experiences and good connections."
good,its an ok job it pay. I dont like maybe 1 csm. the job is normal and easy. I dont care for the customers a lot of them are rude or a pain in the but being a cashier aint that hard. But it gets boring alot. also they can kind of mess with you on the amount of hours you get and dont give you the amount your supposed to get.
good,co workers for the most part were pretty awesome management seemed overwhelmed at times hardest part about the job was that there seemed to be too many bosses typical day clock in go to work station set up drawer check to make sure had needed items recpt tape bags paper towels etc what I learned trust your gut feelings if you feel like something 's wrong it usually was
good,"Customers are always in need of help. I Learn how to do customer service Right. Management Plays Favorites. Co-worker are either team Players or Trying to Advance at other people's expense.The Hardest part for me was that you start one job and you get stopped to do another. Managers never on the same page. Breaks, Lunch,  and Vacations are the most enjoyable thing I can say about this Job at the end. In the Beginning the company cared about the customer and the Associate, But it went downhill when Mr.Sam Died."
good,"Okay place to work but a lot of rude customers and poor management. ""The customer is always right"" so you have to take a lot of heat sometimes."
good,"Working overnight can be hectic, management rarely communicates with each other, good pay and good benefits for full time.  Overtime is there if you want it."
good,Good place to work management was ok could be better i worked full time helping customers and co workers where great i learned how to mix paint...
good,the job was very easy and laid back . I enjoyed doing my job and going to work. It also made me happy when I know that I've helped someone out .
good,"A typical day at work is checking sales, profit, and CFF scores for the previous day.  Management meeting to set goals and get a clear directive for the day.  Area meeting to go over company initiatives and provide focus points for the departments.  Follow up on associates and train in new processes.  Conference call meeting.  Create plans to execute company directives on the next season.  Follow up on associates and assist as needed to complete daily goals."
good,"Good company, Fast pace. Job training. Good people to work with, Need more long term jobs. Hardest job. Lots of standing,Low wages, Lots of opportunity to grow."
good,"I worked for Walmart for almost 4 years and I'm glad that I've grown in the employment field, because I don't believe that i would work for them again."
good,There is no camaraderie at Wal-mart because there are 10-15 supervisor/ management positions and 100's of employees looking to backstab you or a manager to get a better position in the company since pay rates are low and raises are minimal with perfect records.
good,"Typical day at work was simple, punch in, work, punch out. Pretty easygoing job, when you weren't being micromanaged. I didn't learn much I didn't already know sadly. Managers were impossible, no relationship was formed, we were treated like children, constantly being told how to do remedial labor among other things we all knew how to do, and we were CONSTANTLY harassed by our superiors for  no reason. The hardest part of the job was the constant harassment and work interruptions by management for no reason at all. the best part of the job was, the job requirements were simple and easy to understand and tasks could be completed in short amounts of time."
good,"schedule is not consistent, hard to make plans outside of work schedule, low pay and no benefits offered, overall not a great place for advancement"
good,mgrs are not that great you have to fit in their click alot of drama in the work place. other wise it was a place to pay my bills at the time
good,"If you are looking for a part time job, you will not find it at your local walmart. they overload you with hours dispite your part time status. but they cut your hours once a month to avoid giving you full time benefits. you are constantly forced into tasks you were not hired for. you are also given shift times that prevent you from getting any daily tasks done such as any medical appointments or visiting the Dmv. but it has its good days however, the job overall is simple and you rarely have to deal with people. the fresh air is amazing and the exercise is great. if you can get past the favoritism and all the forced overtime, then maybe this job is for you."
good,"the best part of the job was the customers and helping new people. Alot of the coworkers worked well with each other, the only downfall was management. Things weren't taken care of properly"
good,"I first started in pharmacy at Walmart. I was able to do on the job training and obtained my license while working there. A typical day was usually busy, fast moving and there was always something that needed to be done. During a shift I was expected to take in new prescriptions from patients, type data, update patient's profiles, fill and prepare prescriptions, work drive-thru and register, fax md offices, answer phones, call patients with any issues, work on prior authorizations, stock inventory, order supplies and drugs, file finished prescriptions and help patients find otc drugs. Everyone I worked with got along very well and we were all pretty close and were able to work well together. My manager was flexible and understanding and I enjoyed working for him. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with any angry patients we would have for any reason. It's never fun when you have someone that you are trying to help that isn't happy about something. I would always do my best to fix any issues there were. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with and all of the regular patients I had that would come in to see me."
good,"Walmart is decent to work for, it all depends on the management team. I love working at Express, but they were all shut down in Feb."
good,"Pretty nice place to work (depending on the store)"
good,"i enjoyed my time working for them."
good,"I worked part time stocking shelves, it wasn't a career for me. Not much to say other than it was an eye opener to that side of retail"
good,i learned many advantages to being a supervisor and this will help me to grow with any company. the typical day at work there is no such thing. everyday at walmart is different.  the hardest part of the day was when we had issues we couldn't resolve.
good,"A company that is not going away anytime soon with decent opportunity to advance ones self though be prepared for high work expectations, With high job security."
good,"Trabalho agradável, ambiente descontraído, superiores imediatos que geriam com transparência. Os colegas de trabalho, na sua maioria eram parceiros, dispostos a ajudar.A parte mais difícil era voltar para casa devido a localização da empresa e o horário puxado."
good,"Days were slow and not to much to do if you kept on everything, management would always get mad though that their wasn't enough done even though you'd have to go to close but yet other parts of the store and help out just to make sure you were working. And no room for advancement."
good,You are taught to have respect for the individual in all things you do. From your co-workers to the customers. The hardest part about this job is the hours and the lack concern for your religious commitments.
good,enjoyable work environment just not enough hours are pay. When I was given a pay raise bases on my hard work and sales results it was met with an hours cut.
good,"fast paced very little down time"
good,"great company with awesome team leaders. Always low prices and always helping each other and customers get what they need. Lots of heavy lifting and physical work, but you get prenty of recovery time on your breaks."
good,The employees make this place a great job. Management not the best and don't know whats really going on and criticize on the 5 mins they send in the department
good,"Good amount of hours"
good,my typical day at work was when i had a customer came in to walmart looking for a item that he couldnt find online so he wasnt so happy about it so i try on helping him and he was just screaming at me cause he couldnt find the item he wanted .. and i told what can i do to make u happy .. and he said nothing get me your manager so i excuse my self and went and got my manager .....i learn not to talk back to a customer eeven if they being rude to you... the most i love about that job was smiling at people helping them look for what they want :)
good,"Lots of grunt work, little chance for constructive input.  Enjoyed my co-workers company."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was opening customer service by setting up cash drawers and cleaning the work area then I'd have to do the same at the Money Center. I made sure that the drawers had loans and so I also communicated with the Cash office associates.  My day consist of taking payments for credit card, car loans, mortgage payments, and electric bills.  I also issued money orders and cashed checks.  This sometimes consisted of counting large sums of money by hand.  I also did returns and exchanges, talked to billers and was a trainer for the newer employee. I learned a lot and interacting with the customers was my favorite part.  I like the fact that you'd never know who you'd get to interact with."
good,A typical day at work consists of working outside . The challenging  part of the job is keeping up with the constant flow of customers. My co workers are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,Walmart will train their associates to advance in the company. They offer benifits and a retirement plan.  They offer several different shifts to work around you lifestyle
good,"Management as with any company, your mileage may vary. Luckily my co-workers were also rather tech savy so none of us were out of the loop in the electronics department but I have heard horror stories about uniformed Electronics sales in other stores.Aside from dealing with crowds on the holiday the hardest part of the job is the inconsistency of hours, only a lucky few have a steady schedule."
good,I was very good at what I did. Dedicated and the upper management was willing to teach me to succeed and move up with in the company.
good,"A typical day as a cashier for Walmart is a stressful day. Weather your dealing with a rude customer who woke up on the wrong side of the bed or a member of management who just doesn't like you, you will be in store for the worst. Some days are better than most but the work for the amount of pay doesn't quite add up to me."
good,I was working for three years for walmart. The experience was great. I've learned a lot at this place. They really focus on diversity.
good,"empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar, apreendi muito sobre limpeza e organização e higienização. trabalhei com corte e limpeza de carnes bovinas e suínas."
good,"I was terminated for exhibiting the symptoms of depression which resulted in ""low productivity"". Management was aware of clinical diagnosis but still chose to terminate my employment. Coworkers on the contrary were very supportive and fun to work with. Supervisors were hot and cold....one was very good at resolving conflicts and being supportive, the other was a nightmare to work with who ran the back in a micromanaging nightmare."
good,"If it weren't for the pretty decent starting pay, I'd probably hate this job. The Walmart I worked at had some of the most ratchet and ghetto people I've ever seen come in there. Being a cashier is probably the most annoying job there because you're the one always dealing with the customers and don't get me started on the LONG lines due to lack of cashiers."
good,the hours can be erratic if you don't have a set schedule. managers can work around your time off requests if you put them in in advance. Most coworkers are friendly and helpful. I built a lot of long lasting relationships with the people I worked with there.
good,It is a nice job. Allows you 2 15 minute breaks and a hour long lunch. Very competitive with other stores and lets you price match other stores that sell items cheaper. Management needs to watch the favoritism with some employees. Some employees don't do as much as others and everyone will get the same raise....
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very stressful for a salaried member of management. Although the pay is decent and provided myself with good work experience for a resume, I do not see myself working in retail for much longer. The hardest part of the job is meeting business needs with limited personnel. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the associates that work in the store."
good,the people that work there are friendly and will always help you out. the hours and breaks are wonderful. i enjoy the range of thngs i can do from being in the floor to being on cash
good,everyone there at Walmart is super friendly and they are willing to help out if had any questions about the work process.
good,The hours for full time scheduled 9 hours. You get a 1 hour lunch. There are sometimes & hours with a half hour lunch. The basic of retail and stocking and customer care is what you learn. Management don't seem concerned for employees only customers or friends. Most coworkers make it feel as though you are back in high school. They create a highly stressful environment. The hardest thing on the job is dealing with peoples attitudes everyday customers and employees alike. The good thing about the job is meeting new people and being able to be home everyday when job is done.
good,"en lo particular es  una empresa  reconocida para que mejoren sus sueldos "
good,In the beginning it was great to be working for a muti-billion dollar company but everything has it flaws and this Wal Mart Super Center had a lot.
good,My dad consist of counting money and doing paper work. My co workers are wonderful and I really enjoy them. The hardest part of this job is the pay. I enjoy most is seeing a smile on the Customers faces.
good,My day consist of counting money and doing paper work. My co- workers are wonderful and I really enjoy them all. The hardest part of the job is the pay . The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customers and seeing people happy.
good,"I do count and order and work with fedex and learned a lot."
good,"Loved my co workers and bosses. I would have stayed if i didn't move to help my sister with her newborn. Great Atmosphere, kind people, and all around welcoming company."
good,"i take care of the fresh and froven department. I take care of the price changes, sales floor counts and backroom counts. I also reserve products such as milk and eggs etc. i also do all the ordering of the milk and eggs etc.I work well with my co-workers.I also work well alone. I show excellent customer service to all my customers"
good,A organização investe em treinamentos de qualificação profissional.
good,"Typical day at work consists of opening boxes of items, replenish missing items, and properly discarding empty boxes."
good,"This place is a decent place to work but, not for everybody that have a lot to do after work as you don't know when you will have to work over time and what time you are going home"
good,"As an associate your expected to work as long as possible till the job was done, which i was okay with, no argument, but then forcing us to cut said hours, making us work longer each night, sticking us in a loop then scolding us for not cutting all our overtime hours."
good,I enjoy helping customers with their needs. I enjoyed the work atmosphere and my coworkers.  The hardest part about my job was the inconsistent hours.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was fast paced and always kept you busy. I was able to meet new people and learned how to handle phone contracts.
good,"Great job to have if u cant find  a job ,never would work for them again but not saying someone eles should they really don't care about  people"
good,"It was a great experience working for that company serving to the customer improving my skills, knowledge, like cashier service, handling money and other methods of payments. And  be a multitasking employee"
good,Stable but not very productive wages . Also there is only ah certain level for growth once you have reached this you are pretty much stuck .
good,"I learned to use a scissor lift, Management wasn't the best, Coworkers were sometimes ok, but we didn't really talk much, there were no hard parts about this job, and no enjoyable parts either"
good,"The work itself was fine, wasn't that difficult. Management made things more complicated than they needed to be. Management belittles and has no respect for their employees."
good,"I managed about 65 plus cashiers. I'm also handling money all day Walmart is a great company to work for they really care about there"
good,"i didn't mind working retail. downs and up sides to it. the management team was semi nice yet, was micro managed !"
good,"lo mas difícil es saber la autenticidad de tarjetas, billetes y cheques"
good,"Una gran familia dentro del area laboral, un gran aprendizaje, ya que debido al puesto desempañado se aprende a ser eficaz y eficiente."
good,"Wait on Customers for sliced luncheon meats and various cheeses.  Also wait on Customers that want items from the hot deli bar and cold bar.  "
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but I was only considered casual worker even though they relied on my a lot and bounced me between departments and was a little  hetic at times
good,"Coming in at 6:30am is a HUGE plus and hard to find anywhere else if you don't have any degrees! Plus only working 1 weekend day a month is  amazing! The only benefit of working for Wal-Mart is actually being a department manager! It's really not a hard job, management just wants things done extremely fast which is most of the time impossible. Don't trust anyone with your personal business, even if you feel like their easy to talk too...there's so much drama at this place it's worse than high school!!!! KEEP TO YOURSELF and you'll avoid a lot of problems...seriously."
good,"Overall being a manager for Walmart was not to bad.  We worked 3 days on and 3 days off for 12 hours.  Typical day was come in at 8am have a daily meeting, divided daily task for departments, handled cash, and handled freight.  Hourly associates where not compensated for all of their hard work, which made turnover unmanageable."
good,"Started out as a stocker at night the 10:00pm to 5:00am shift."
good,Many great employees. Loved working with customers and learning something new daily. Nice to know that you have flexibility to do different things and not be bored with your job
good,"buen ambiente laboral, es agradable trabajar en esta empresa"
good,"Pros: Flexible work schedule, breaks"
good,My days at work were great with the employees along with faithful customers on a daily basis. Management was a different story. Management was only taught paperwork not people skills.
good,"Most days are fine. Regular old retail things. But you'll probably get screwed over if you need to schedule time off, whether it be certain days of the week, or just a couple days off. Even when I had filled out an availability form three weeks in advance, like they said to, I'd still get scheduled on those days. I wasn't the only person to have that problem, either."
good,"Se trabaja bajo mucha presión."
good,"Staying focused and meeting the customers needs in a friendly, timely order and manner. keeping merchandise stocked on the sales floor in order to keep customers happy. keep track of merchandise by conducting monthly inventory on the sales floor and backroom. Do MVP on merchandises to provide lower costs. work with a staff of 6 more. The hardest part of my job is not having something in stocked and a customer gets upset. The easiest part of my job is putting a smile on a lot of people faces."
good,"Does matter how good you are at the job, manager promote people they like even if they're unqualified. A typical day is catching shoplifters unless management tries to catch them, then you're trying to not get fired for managements mistakes."
good,"The hours were great at sonic, it was a fun job, full of laughter. The managers were all friends so they all went against the staff and this might have just been at the sonic I worked at but that's the only bad thing about them. other than that I wouldn't mind working at sonic again."
good,Terrible work environment. You're constantly being micromanaged and are penalized for not getting the job done. When in reality it's because they lack the employees to get the work finished
good,this company is  very  clicky and has favorates no room for improvement  really enjoyed working here at first  but as time went on there was so much drama with employees it was hard to  ignore
good,Worked the front and back office sales and adjustments of glasses and contacts.was able to learn about all aspects in the vision center
good,"My hours were never remotely close to consistent. (Ranging from 20-40) The starting pay wasn't bad at $9.00 hr to be a sales associate in apparel. I loved the ladies that I worked with in my department. The Department managers, however were a big issue. (Venice Wal-Mart) The managers over kids and men's wear were never out on their sales floors and constantly threw their work at the feet of the elderly associates in my area. The Assistant Manager over (softlines) was a huge push over and never spoke to anyone who needed to change their work style....i.e department managers. Don't even get me started on the idiotic Store Manager........"
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart. I believe that each store can improve upon their methods of getting what needs to be done, done and they could stand to hire more people at almost every location I've been to whether as an employee or customer."
good,"I had many different managers at WalMart;especially since I worked at three different stores.Overall,I believe that they had more integrity and compassion than most other managers I have been exposed to in working for over 40 years.Like I stated in job description,evey day seemed to bring a new challenge, and a chance to prove my worth both as an associate,and as a friend."
good,"My routine at Walmart at the start of each day consisted of me first, checking all fire doors and signs.  Second, I would walk the sales floor and verify all security devices were on high theft items. Next I would verify inventory reports and trailer listings from the previous night to verify inventory counts. Lastly, I would w3alk the store, secure all of my elements and make apprehensions. I would prepare any case files needed for court and all subpoenas.  I thoroughly enjoyed working as a team with all of the sales associates.  The most challenging part of the job was maintaining structure and a well balanced schedule of tasks as I was the only one in my department for all Loss Prevention for the entire store.  The best thing about the job was developing my skills through experience and working with all the associates.  I love working with people and developing a solid team."
good,"Exceptional work experience gained"
good,"Start out reverse picking bin in back room working the product to the floor and binning product back in. How to work a MC40 the management back up their employees very much they are only interested in the numbers. the co-workers are okay good to get along with. Getting up and going to work, Brakes and lunch."
good,"this place is ok to work for, they are all mostly friendly , but they do forget to send people on breaks and they are clicky. but they try to make up for it sometimes"
good,"Typical day at work we had to unload one to two trucks a day.Learned to unload trucks in a quick and fashionable matter,the management team was good except I didnt get along with one of them beacause he always rode me and always had bad things to say to me. Hardest part of the job was lefting some of the heavest products they were to heavy and noone would help me out. The enjoyable part is we had a great team"
good,"•	Use of slicers in the completion of customer orders. "
good,"its a nice place if you can put with the stress of being over worked and understaffed, great pay if you get into managment besides that you have to deal with being an associate first. And for some its a nightmare."
good,"Overall the job experience was not a pleasant one. Although i only had the job part-time as a student, i would never consider working there afain."
good,"Pour ce qui est du travail il est tres facile a accomplir, mais tres difficile de recevoir des reponse de la part des gerant. Il s,agit tout simplement de servire les clients au moments de ces achats.Pour la majorite du temps les gens sont agreable a servire et donne souvent de bonne references."
good,"A typical day at work in the walmart deli always ended in stress. I learned that if you dont do the job yourself, it wont get done at all. I also learned about the disasters in behind the deli counter that we encountered everyday. Management could use some work, theyre constantly switching departments and the one thing that bothered me most was how unappreciated and disrespected they made me feel; and im not the only employee who feels this way. The hardest part of the job was being instructed to do a job that you were never trained to do, not even a simple explanation of how to do it. Th most enjoyable part was the ability to make new friends."
good,Good place to work. Good pay with benefits. Yet lacked organization. Management skills weren't the best. Organization of the store was not up to par.
good,Day to day activities I have to help customers process a return and even pay bills or send money. Generally management have to be paged in order to do overrides and sometimes it takes them awhile to get to the customer service desk so it holds up other transactions. Co-workers are friendly and helpful especially when certain things are heavy to move onto or off a cart. Hardest part of the job is occasionally coming face to face with an irate customer. Not really great when it comes to management giving a tall order. (ie having to reset a 16 foot section of pasta sauce to redo and add in new products. was given only a 2 hour window to complete it while which customers cannot be ignored when they need an item)
good,"Boomerang tube was a great opportunity to learn another trade.  I had never done inspection, or production.  Working at this company had is perks and it also had its stressful days.  I was taught alot and and put through training programs where i was certified to use equipment to inspect our product by API standards.  The compensation was reasonable and benefits were great.  The biggest draw back was that the management did not communicate well.  No one knew what anyone had plans to do or what the work schedule was.  It was alot of fly by the seat kind of deal.  Basically a day to day type deal.  I think if Boomerang Tube would have a better core management I think this company could be one of the best production companies in southeast Texas.  They just need to find management that actually cares about their job and that actual does their job."
good,"The management was horrible. I worked 3rd shift, 10:00pm - 7:00 am. I got some great stocking experience and more customer service experience. The hardest part of my job was 2nd half of the shift."
good,I was able to learn many different areas of customer service will working here. The people are great to work with but management is a little hare to get along with. It has been a few years since I worked here so things may have changed.
good,"Walmart is a progressive organization that continually changes to reflect the needs and desires of the local retail market.   Working at Walmart had its challenges in dealing with a wild range of different cultures and geographic areas, and ensuring that the client needs were fulfilled."
good,Being a cashier is a hard job to have at Walmart because of all the people you deal with. The management is very good at working around schedules and they are caring about your home life.
good,Very hard on the associate with high work ethics because of the expectation to get it all done in a single day while others just go for the paycheck.
good,the job is ok but the pay is not worth all the work load you would have to do.  You would have your good and bad days but for the most part it's an ok job.
good,"I took the job at walmart to broaden my customer service experience, and learned a lot about different departments, and learning excellent money handling skills."
good,"loved my customers everything i did was for them to make them happy and make sure my customers found what they were looking for. i did however learn alot by working there using hand helds also computers. although it was a big also very busy store management was hard to catch at times, if you had a problem you had to run to find a member of the management team and also not very friendly. however i do believe even when you are busy you be understanding your associates do need help advise and they may need to ask a question bout something. id have to say the most rewarding part bout my job is seeing my customers happy they had a good visit at our store."
good,Breaking down pallets and stocking merchandise of shelves.  Most co-workers were friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of this job was dealing with management.  But I enjoyed helping customers and the friendships built with co-workers.
good,"Es padre cuando ya conociste todo el movientos y sus politicas pero lo que no me gusto es que no las cumples con sus politicas al menos la de que tu te vas de la empresa cuando tu quieras que ellos no despiden gente es mentira, no pagan tiempo extra, te acosan laboralmente ya que te atosigan con tanta exigencia que terminas aburriendote."
good,"Good Company to start a career.  I am grateful for the opportunity to work with Walmart, but in the end, my skills and abilities were not utilized and leveraged.  I decided to pursue more meaningful and challenging work."
good,Very organized and productive. Worried about safety but not willing to sacrifice numbers to improve safety. Most employees laid back and very helpful.
good,"el dia típico de trabajo era entrar  fichar cuando estuve en empresas y ponerme a trabajar hasta el descanso luego seguir y dejar todo bien preparado para el otro dia "
good,the management was no good. could not proceed intended job with out harassment of assisting other department that i am not authorized to do while current department is busy.
good,Wonderful people make the difference on the job. This company is very sneaky when it comes to hiring and firing people. Watch your back when you work here.
good,"This job has provided good experience with the fast paced work. It is lacking in communication between management. My co-workers are fun and energetic. I enjoy the communicating with the customers. A typical day is cleaning, zoning, communicating with customers, and putting merchandise back on the shelf."
good,Very fun work environment with a wonderful management team. Treats employees with full respect and makes it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"I loved Walmart for many years, as their hours, pay, and support staffing was such that it allowed for more reasonable accomplishment of necessary tasks throughout the day! The computer system was excellent, as was the ability to minimize errors or realize counseling opportunities or medication changes through additional systems. During the initial 6-7 years, pharmacists were treated with value and even when store staff/management weren't on the same page, we got support for our needs from our own upper management. Unfortunately, the last few years saw drastic changes, which created mostly negative impacts to patient care and staff morale. The budget was continually cut, while the demands increased exponentially! I have worked in Many different Pharmacy environments and many of those were different types of Retail settings. The way they conducted business was, of course, different everywhere, so I wasn't surprised by much, nor did I have difficulty finding ways to work with the system to the benefit of the company and patients!  The changes at Walmart are still a work in progress, but without consistency with each store/pharmacist, or supervisor that takes over, the ability to do well or even maintain is being hindered more than the overall changes, restrictions or expectations."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would always be busy, backed up lines, angry customers, as well as poor management. My time working at Wal-Mart I learned to have patients and how to make customers want to come back. The hardest part of my job was picking up the slack for those who neglected to come to work. The enjoyable part about working with Wal-Mart is having conversations with loyal customers and working with a great team of cashiers."
good,"Management does not care about employee's needs, and are unreasonable. Working over to catch up on other people's work assigned to me."
good,"Although overnights can be tough physically, there is a lot of opportunities to improve with some pressure from management and supervisors to always do the job correctly.  A typical night starts at ten post meridiem and consists of greeting customers, scanning the inventory they are purchasing, and accepting cash, checks, or credit card transactions.  When not processing transactions, my job consists of removing trash and hangars from underneath the registers and sorting them all out in large garbage bags.  Another part of my duties is to stock Walmart grocery bags, candy, and other various items such as lighters, toys, etc."
good,great place to work. Great people to work with. Always something to do loved working in the garage. didn't like it when they tried to pull you away from your job you are suppose to be doing to make you do something you have no clue how to do.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work, but I really didn't care for the management.  I really did like working as a team with my co-workers."
good,walmart is a retail store that does not really care about their employers. A lot of favoritism. And not enough pay. But for the most part it is a job.
good,"challenging fast paced work with many responsibilities, always a huge work load and high expectations on performance.  Employees are pretty much a close knit family, management are hands on and willing to work along side of the workers"
good,"enjoyed my co-workers and customers"
good,"Wal-mart is ok to work for based on their benefits.Wal-Mart also has good management in the store. "
good,Adquirir muita experiência e conheci pessoas maravilhosas.
good,"Management doesn't really care much about their employees or store performance, and many of your coworkers are insane, incapable, or otherwise obnoxious."
good,"friendly work environment and management is good,co workers good to work with.The hardest part of the day was finishing everything on time.the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and assisting them."
good,"Often times required to stay until tasking is done even when scheduled shift is over.  Very-fast paced and rewarding environment.  Difficult staffing, management short-changes hour allotment in  high-volume departments."
good,Looking for a new company to work for. Burnt out on retail work. Walmart is a good company with job security and advancement opportunities. Pay is competitive but the hours are put in to earn the compensation.
good,"My day starts out by processing and separating all media and currency and entering into SMART system, preparing cash deposits, processing change orders, answering phone calls, and reviewing and preparing accounting reports for management.  "
good,care not to say! will not say anything about Walmart besides it's a paid job. Fun is what people make it. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
good,"would all get together and cheer, and get ready for the morning. was nice, happened when the store opened. First Walmart Neighborhood Market in California. loved that store"
good,It's Walmart what do you expect? People are just there to collect a check. No one cares about the employee or the customer.
good,"Working register, and not being able to get on the floor to do the work I really like to do. I learned to do the work of the manager and how things are set up, and how things are kept track of  and ordered. And why they are put where they are, I learned that Standing at a register for 8 hours is very hard and rough on my body, and that you can meet a lot of very nice people while ring them out. management changed so often, and being there as long, they would come in  and want every thing changed , instead of asking why thing were the way the were and what works. Mind you I worked I garden center and we had 3 areas to keep up with."
good,"Working for this company is a good high school job but Policies are extremely hard to find and every manager changes it to how they feel it should be, Job security is great and anyone can advance up the ladder."
good,"A typical day at work was fun , productive and very enlightening at the same time. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with impossible task times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,Working at Walmart was like any other retail. I loved providing great customer service yet most of my co workers did not feel the same.
good,"I worked in several areas of the store I worked in. I am knowledgeable in all areas of that store. I enjoyed helping customers when I was in the Automotive Department. Sometimes the politics of the job make it hard to want to continue working there. The benefits were alright, much room for improvements to help those who can't afford insurance. GREAT management!"
good,This a good place to gain experience. You are able to communicate with people everyday. A typical day at work it can get busy some days its slow.
good,a typical day at work would be stocking fruit and keeping environment clean.I provide excellent customer service. The hardest part about this job is that cooperate changes their mind a lot about the department.
good,"Good people, pay not the best, highly overworked,  full time hours not guaranteed, highly political. But overall good people."
good,"When I started at Wal-Mart it hadn't opened. I actually helped in the process of the store opening. Each day we had different jobs but it still was all apart of the opening process."
good,"Good place to work if you are interested in retail business. Management team is respectful and understanding. Management is flexible with work schedules, around your personal life."
good,Overall good company.  Enjoyed working with some great and talented people.  There is a lot of extra processes to getting things done.
good,"My day started in the receiving department, where the entire team and I would start unloading trucks. This was the hardest part of the job since afterwards was just stocking, picking items from the bins and arrange shelves for the next day. The managers and co-workers were all nice and dedicated to fully achieve the established goals."
good,If you don't want a social life and work life balance and want to work long and exhausting hours then work here. Too many chiefs and not enough workers for the amount of work needed done daily.
good,"During my time at Wal-Mart, I have experienced some hostile customers but non the less, it was a decent work environment. During the training, they unfortunately skipped some essential, very helpful things to know but they do help you learn how to run a register and how to handle certain difficult situations that may occure. Some of the management would take their time to get to you when, for example, you order money for you register because it is running low. On the other hand, they are very easy to get along with and I have respect for them because of what they have had to deal with. My coworkers are very diverse and for the most part friendly. They had helped me immensely throughout working there. The hardest part about working there were the aggressive customers but for the most part, they were typically easy to handle depending on location and how busy the store was. My most enjoyable part was meeting so many different people who either worked or shopped there."
good,"I enjoyed working on the floor helping customers find items within the store or even directing them at other places. I did not enjoy being placed on cash as i never wanted that position. they were half hour fill in for department breaks/lunches or low numbers of employees working it seemed. When pulled away from my area to be placed on cash, my area got neglected and tasks were not completed which were questioned the next day by department supervisor. Cash  made me nervous for making sure to return correct amounts, having angry customers for when items wouldn't scan in or have no price to which i would have to make a call requesting to find item and price code. I later transferred to night shift and enjoyed working through the night. Management was never flexible to request of not to be put on cash nor made any attempt to put my insecurities working on cash any better. Most enjoyable part was when shift was over."
good,"Creeo que lo que mas aprendi es tratar al cliente y el manejo de dinero, la parte mas dificil fue la responsabilidad que tenia ya que se manejaba una cantidad enorme de dinero y lo que mas me gusto fue hacer amigos y hacer lo que me gusta que es el manejo de dinero"
good,"Its a alright place to work at, management are rude to their associates even if you go above and beyond for the company.15 minute breaks, and a hour lunch are a bonus, they make you work in departments that you werent hired to do or are in your job description, never enough associates around, scheduling of associates is a nightmare, you get a quarterly bonus if the company did good in those 3 months you get a nice bonus but usually no more than 100$, a horrible 10% discount you would think it would be more."
good,"the problem i had at walmart was just recently graduating high school. I didnt expect myself to work there long nor did i take the job as seriously as i should have. When given the right attitude you could work your way up in very quickly with some hard work, looking back now i wish i had done some more of that."
good,"I worked on customer's cars throughout the day, either performing oil changes, rotating/balancing/repairing tires, etc. I learned some things concerning cars although I am a truck driver by trade. Management could use some work as far as working with employees."
good,"I have learned to relate to a diverse group of people including but not limited to people of Middle East descent, Europeans, Africans and Asians."
good,"Fun work place with amazing work life balance. The culture at Wal-Mart is very consensus based. So, it is sometimes difficult to make progress and turn this huge ship."
good,nice place to work nice people just people didn't want to work I loved to work I came everyday never called in went in labor twice there they took care of me overall
good,"there were never enough cashiers. never enough lines open for busy days. when help was called for barely any came. managers would not come help with crowds. self checkouts were awful! they never worked properly and was nothing but a cluster. management was a joke considering they had an ""open door policy"" and was all about confidentiality but spoke about my complaints to other people. i put in a months notice of my resignation and was terminated 3 days following."
good,"Wal-Mart will always be busy as you work there. It is fun and love meeting new people, not just from the United States, even outside the country! Co-workers are so nice and very friendly and helpful at the same time."
good,Hiring and training  new associates and watching he/she become  productive members of the Walmart culture. meeting new customer helping them find what they need
good,"This has been my first ever exposure to retail. I do not really like the environment. I do like the people I work with and many of the customers but do not really like it overall. I have learned a lot about the retail side, I do like the interaction with the public."
good,I was working at this place and the management sucked and they are too tough on you for no apparent reason. I did too much work for little pay . I was not happy at all. Security sucked as well.
good,It's that the best place to work at but they have good benefit and the people is very nice. The management need to work on how to talk to people. but other than that it's I good place to work.
good,"There were good times and there were the bad times, but it was a job, and it helped to pay the bills.  The only way i would go back is if i was really in need of a job. Customer service was better."
good,"Samething day in day out not to much engaging, Two slow not what im looking for aka wont more. If management likes u then u go up if not they make u feel like u wonted. I don't mind the people i work with day by day but the atmosphere of the place is feeling of no hope of getting anywhere. But its time for a change"
good,"I enjoyed the work, really liked providing great customer service. However the management team is very fractured and the differences of opinions caused a lot of headaches for employees like myself."
good,"es muy buen ambiente de trabajo,solo que si faltaba comunicacion que el jefe directo se acercara a platikar con nosotros que te preguntara como te sientes que te hace falta aprendi a trabajar en equipo a no dejarme de la gente. la parte mas dificil fue que me movieran para todos lados que nunca estuvieras en tu area  y que te regañaran por tener el departamento sucio"
good,"La empresa tiene cosas muy buenas pero, lamentablemente en algunas areas pesa mas la politica que los meritos."
good,"It was good learning experiance,but not well run due to lack of mangment, They gave to much work for one person trying to save money"
good,"Retail has its challenges; long hours, working holidays, the occasional disgruntled customer. But it also has its rewards as well, such as great compensation, pretty good benefits, 401k matching, profit sharing."
good,"I worked as a night maintenance. My shift was from 10p - 8a. The compensation was fair, in my opinion, because I was living with my parents, so I didn't have to worried about rent or food. However, I don't consider this as a long-term job, because I don't see the opportunity for further development"
good,"I worked 12-14 hour days. 4 on 3 off. "
good,The overall atmosphere was great until the store gained a new store manager who became a tyrant. The hourly associates were what made the store great.
good,"Working at Walmart is alright, but the management there needs a lot of improvement. They do they job great management wise, but when it comes to working with associates, most but not all could care less about them and what is going on in their lives."
good,"Very unsteady hours. Had a different schedule every week, could not plane very much ahead of time because you would not know if you would have to work."
good,This store is very large in size and every worker in it contributes to it's success. The overnight crew I worked with was very informative about rules and regulation and the key to a healthy and safe work environment when it came to all positions not just Maintenance.
good,"A typical day working as an overnight stalker at Walmart consist of stocking shelves with merchandise and sometimes pulling merchandise out to the floor. Assisting customers with any questions they have or assisting them in finding what they are looking for. Management, when I worked there was all messed up, they didn't seem to communicate with one another enough. I loved most of my co-workers I worked with. Hardest part of the job was working overnight when I have to small children. The most enjoyable part of the job was working at a pretty fast pace and keeping busy."
good,"I had good hours and the people I worked with were nice to be around and the customers were nice, but the pay wasn't even a living wage. These big box retailers just don't seem to care about how much they pay their employees."
good,"I would get a lot of same customers through my line that would come to me because they liked the way I worked quickly and efficiently-which was nice, and meeting new people all the time, but you would get in trouble for standing around or even talking really- it was all about staying busy at all times."
good,"This is a big company and in a big company employees get over looked. The managers don't seem to enjoy their jobs or want to help other employees out. I mean it was a job so I did what ever they asked me to do, but I would not go back if I didn't have to."
good,"My day begins depending on what time of day I come in; if I open I have to distribute out funds to run the service desk as well as the money center. I am responsible for all monies distributed to all opening registers and surrounding registers throughout the store. I review the schedule for cashiers and associates coming in and prepare for how breaks and lunches will be orchestrated throughout the day. The remainder of the day is spent assisting cashiers and customers however needed, whether its a training question or dealing with a complaint. There is usually up to 6 customer service managers  on duty and we all take part in whatever responsibilties we take over. There are different levels of management which we try not to rely on unless the situation requires a manager that supercedes our level of management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some customer situations or when its busy and we are understaffed for various reasons. The most enjoyable part is assisting the customers and or associates that are appreciative, pleasurable, and when doing a good job there is postive feedback for a job well done."
good,"Fun Place to work at, you have a lot of interaction with customers, is great place to meet people and develop work skills."
good,la empresa ha demuestra  poca gratitud en tu trabajo te exigen que hagas milagros con poco material de trabajo muchas veces te llaman la atención por chismes de trabajadores peresosos
good,"I enjoyed working here but did not like that we were so understaffed, and had people always quiting, coming in and out through hire constantly. The supervisors were always new also and some of them had no clue of how operations were ran so it made it difficult."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed working for Walmart in terms of the work itself. However, the management at this particular store is very poor."
good,"Definitely a starter job, not a career. It was more about sales than the associates. Working alongside colleagues was the highlight of the day. Customers were often very nice. Busy days were fast, hectic, and extremely fun."
good,"I would usually be at the cash register for 8 hours and the people always made my day better. It is a little boring but I still worked hard. Management was sloppy at times, and I never meet the store General Manager at all working there."
good,From the time you clock in til the time you clock out you never know what your shift will bring.  Tasks change during the shift so one must adapt to the changing demands that are asked of you.  You must be prepared at all times for whatever question or an items location that a customer may ask.
good,"I worked as a supervisor. I enjoyed the opportunity to train and grow with others. With Walmart, I had the opportunity to become a better professional and gain transferrable skills that I can take with me forward into any career."
good,"Good place to get your foot in the door. A job is a job. Don't expect much after that. Managers are not management material. The customers are rude, so you must have thick skin. Most of the people on the sales floor have a hard time speaking English so the customer service is mediocre."
good,Its a ok job to work at depending on who your manager is i guess. its some managers who cares about the workers and some who don't.
good,"the jobs themselves are not hard, however; management shows little interest in the employees themselves. The work load is never distributed evenly and no one follows any of the no retaliation policies."
good,"Management was ok, coworkers were amazing"
good,"Typical work day can be anywhere from seven to ten hours depending on the day of the week. Work is not equally distributed and some employees are given better hours, while others just deal with what they can get. Management is good, but attitudes vary, especially when decisions need to be made. Co workers are alright, but a lot of drama, too many chiefs and not enough little Indians. Hardest part is dealing with the up and down hours, some morning other evenings, nothing regular about schedule . Best part is customers, especially the elderly and children."
good,"I primarily stocked so I always started off in the back of the store. I would either work on my own or with another person, breaking down pallets or organizing items onto a crate to stock at a later time. Management was nice but always seemed to be locked up in their office, and managers were always being relocated so there isn't really any interaction between them and their employees. For the most part everyone works on their own or in groups of two or three; you can finish your tasks quickly but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise you will be left looking around for work. Don't bother socializing with your coworkers, managers would prefer you to be doing your task on your own, unless it calls for the help of another. Hardest part of the job was trying to be active. I was able to work around the store and keep busy, but there is only so much you can do working at a Neighborhood Walmart."
good,it can be an ok place to work but the managers make it too difficult. Its not a permanent kind of job atleast not for me unless you make it to a management position
good,"This place gave me first opportunity to start job in this country, in that respect I have a great honor to Walmart.  No body can have good financial life working in Walmart, one should use it as an urgent need only."
good,its a good job for young people or people who want to advance to management but if you are in the middle of the road and want family time then its not for you
good,"It was a nice place to work. The hours were weird, the people were friendly. The work was solid and had an easy pace. It was busier on some days than others. The people i worked with were friendly and nice. The management was great and the store was functioning greatly because of it."
good,Walmart est une compagne agreables ou il est amusant de travailler mais le poste que joccupais etait desagreable et mal payer et pourtant jaimai bcp cette emplois.
good,"Un journée typique veut dire une journée de stress, car beaucoup de client et peu d'employés pour répondre au client. Donc, nous nous retrouvons souvent avec du surplus de travail. Par  conséquent on y retrouve une équipe formidable qui a le même but que vous relever des défis."
good,Opportunity for advancement varies. Workload is not shared by all managers in some of the stores. There is favoritism among managers and the people they supervise. Some stores it is as it should be.
good,"Having multiple managers and having them switch off every few months caused many problems. Those problems could be anywhere from not getting vacations approved or days off to having several managers telling you to do different things and not being able to tell them no, I have other things to do due to the threat of a coaching. Walmart as a whole is usually understaffed, usually due to low pay in the area. They are improving, but they have a long way to go and the way they structure and prioritize things needs to change into a more friendly environment if they want to keep a good associate turnover every year. Overall, it is a good place to work as a part time possibly, but being dependent on the company will more than likely resort in exploitation (as I saw at my store), something I view a company should not do."
good,"I'm not sure if its all walmarts or just this one but the managers were very lazy. I enjoyed my coworkers, this job taught me a lot some good and some bad."
good,"Good Pay and everything and a lot of stress from the managers that run the company itself. Horrible, You know more then the managers do in their life time. Never enough help, always have arguments with customers, managers never stick up for you. Its just a horrible company to work for. I'm glad I left the company and went into my school field."
good,"Over see all cashiers and cash drawers, make sure front end is prepared for the day, make sure employees received breaks on time, work on the floor and put out merchandise in spare tine. I trained as a back up in the cash office also. I loved working with the customers and meeting new people."
good,"This place is a very fast paced environment, always with long line ups in which people will either be friendly, completely rude, high maintenance or neither. Full of great employees."
good,"Take care of customer's needs,  sending money, money orders, cashing payroll checks, return items."
good,One day I was stocking my area and a customer comes to me and ask for help so I take them to find what they are looking for. I have learned a lot about working for walmart. co workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is maintain a lot of freight and the most part about this job the I enjoyed was management they were fun to be around.
good,"Go to work, clock in and retrieve shopping carts. Also help customers with electronic carts and assistance with heavy item purchases."
good,"Company is having internal people issues, turnover due to performance training of their associates and pay structure.  Internal accounting issues, i.e. inventory, payroll, and other."
good,"A big company with changes happening all the time. Very diverse employee field and very different every day. A typical day is working remaining residual freight from the stockroom, touring areas and finding opportunities for improvement, delegating tasks to appropriate associates, then follow up as needed throughout the day."
good,"It has its ups and downs, there has been some good positions and some bad. Those that are good are fun and good employees to work with, but those that are bad usually are pushing you to your limitations or treated unfairly."
good,"Work would be entertaining when working with those who I enjoyed to be around, but sometimes it was hard to get through the day after that."
good,"Wal-Mart can be a decent place to work, but they want people that kiss up instead of hard workers. I believe in rewarding an employee for hard work, not for kissing up to the Managers or Supervisors. They don't support customer service as well as other companies I've worked for."
good,"I worked at Walmart since i came to this country...."
good,"Loved working the weekend shifts because I had the most hours and I got to do more cake decorating on those days. I assisted with cake decorating, baking, packaging, and preparing food for the next day. I also did opening and closing shifts. My colleagues were great and I learned a lot from them and was able to help train some of the newer colleagues. Hardest part of the job was trying to get all the closing done when the things that were suppose to be done in the afternoon were not finished."
good,Most management were supportive and would help out when needed but had a couple micro managers that got on your case if you had approached a slow time of day.
good,Its a great starting job for people who need to get on there feet and also need something with a flexible schedule. management could be better but it depends on the walmart you are employed too. The job takes a lot of work and great customer service even on your worst days.
good,"Nice environment to work in. Descent management skills it could of been better, but great associates with good team work this job taught me more about responsibility,good customer service, and how to hold my composer with difficult customers."
good,i go in to work when i can and do my job.  if that meant using a toothbrush i did it.  i loved my coworkers and many of them understood that your family is utmost.  working when u have a loved one with worsening disabilities is hard.  walmart did understand this until the time is mean to part ways
good,It is a nice easy job with flexible hours. On a typical day I will go in to work and unload a truck. After words we do break boxes and whatever department picks are left.
good,"Working there was cool. A typical day was come in, get ready for a busy day of work. There was rarely slow day at Walmart. Like around 6 or 7 that's when everything starts calming down. I learned how to do picks and bins. Management was probably the only issue. They didn't promote people who deserves it and they wasn't as organized as they should be. My co-worker was pretty cool. I made some long term friends and met some interesting people. The hardest part is probably satisfying everyone. The enjoyable is Seeing new faces everyday."
good,It was an experience and other than the indifferent management and negativity of the entire store and the employees it was a decent job.  Definitely not something you would want to pursue as a career but was an alright part time position during college
good,"El empleo es una rutina tanto por la tarde como por la mañana, lo que aprendí es que un líder pregona con el ejemplo y no acosando laboral mente, la gerencia tiene que aprender a ser multi funcional ya que de no ser lo es difícil exigir ser lo, mis compañeros tiene que aplicarse a realizar sus actividades para no dejar pendientes, la parte mas difícil del trabajo es cuando te discriminan te amenazan cuando no respetan tus jornadas laborales y no recibes remuneración por lo trabajado, la parte que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es la convivencia con el personal y el interactuar con el personal y los clientes."
good,"The hardest part of my job was helping unload the trucks every night, while that was challenging, I enjoyed it. But the part I enjoyed the most was when I got to assist customers find products they couldn't locate, or helped them with a minor problem while shopping."
good,"My experience as a pharmacy tech at wal-mart was a very great experience. I loved my job and time there until we got a new pharmacist. he was basically about his money, not the customers. So that's why my time there ended after 15 years. I've never had as many problems as i did when he began working there. other than that I truly love what I do.."
good,"I started with only floral and worked my way into produce also. In the produce department I learned how to keep track of inventory, and do actual inventory on a monthly basis, as well as order."
good,This would have been a great job if not for the lack of efficient management.  Management did not care at all about their employees.  All they cared about was their needs and looking good for the corporate office.  Sam Walton would not have been impressed.
good,"mi  evaluacin al servicio al cliente un 90 %"
good,"I would take customers returns and exchanges."
good,"Quick work pace everyday, great co-workers who believe in team work, management big on numbers have to keep up with your daily data, learn something new everyday, most enjoyable part of job is helping customers."
good,"I would say its a busy day everyday, thats because most of the time we are short staffed and that has a lot to do with the certification, a lot of technicians did not pass it so they quit. other than that part its nice to be able to help the patients when they need your help."
good,It is not the best company I have ever worked for.  Some of the mangers are wonderful where some are unethical.  My coworkers are some of the friendliest people I know.  I think of them as family.  The work done each day is about the same.  It's extremely routine as long as we are not understaffed.  I have advanced in people skills due to the questionable behavior of some of our customers.  The hardest part of the job is being able to satisfy all of the customers while doing what is tasked to us by our managers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is simply knowing that I have a job to go to each day.
good,"The Kiosk experience is not for everyone.  I followed my former district manager from Thornton Oil to Murphy, it was exciting at first, but a lot of upper management from traditional C-stores joined the Murphy team things started going a wrong direction for me."
good,"Enjoyed working there at first but then I got a taste of the culture when i got promoted to lead supervisor, all politics and butt kissing got you where you needed to be (if your that kind of person). Hated the fact that it was always a case of not what you know but who you know that allowed you to get promoted within the walmart culture."
good,"room for growth, needs more work life balance opportunities associates are appreciative. Great job for someone with no kids"
good,this position was satisfactory however the job only provided part time possible position and had no offer of benefits or health coverage
good,Co-workers are easy to work with and overall the job is okay on a typical day at work. Management is easy to get along with. I enjoy meeting new people and talking to customers that come through the registers. The hardest part with the job is standing all day long in one area. One thing that needs to be improved in the job is that the pay is not very good. The economy is changing and getting harder for people to make a living on a little pay with a family.
good,"Daily learning and development with products, associates and customers. Helping customers and associates make the best out of their shopping or work experience. Developing all my peers and learning new tasks at hand. Showing compassion for my job and others under me, "
good,Not enough leadership from the department managers. Most employees seem content with where they are in life and career. Hard to swallow if you are a college student trying to pay bills. Guess i'm not cut out for the wal mart life
good,"You come in clock in and check your task, which that means it show you where you are going to be for the night. then you get in your zone and get your task done and you aisle clean and zoned."
good,My typical day at work consists of getting my job done. What I learned from the job was my love for people. There were some good managers at Wal-Mart and some bad ones. My co-workers were great I got along with all of them. The hardest part of the job was needing assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,I loved all my coworkers and customers. my coworkers and I became extremely close and still are to this day.  The managers were another thing. You could get a jerk or you could get someone who actually cares. its like a coin toss.
good,This job was primarily a second job. The employees were great to work with. The pay was decent in the electronics department but not for the rest of the store. The management didn't have time to manage because they were always doing the work that merchandiser would do at any other store.
good,"to make sure that i had all shopping carts inside and make sure that there are no hazards happening, and cleaning the parking lot as i'm walking around."
good,"I've been worn walmart for over 2 years now and though I work hard, don't call in, and have been trained in management/supervisor positions, I always get passed up for promotions because I'm not ""a favorite"". Hard to work at a place with so much favoritism."
good,great management until you need them then they turn their backs on you to save their jobs. great stability but the company as a whole has changed low pay management not the smartest
good,"a typical day at walmart would include clocking in, setting up for the truck unload, having a team meeting only for everything we talk about in the meeting to change before the end of the night. The management is sometimes available and sometimes not. Coworker are great besides the handful that's been there a while and thinks they can just walk around all day and not work. The hardest part about this job was coming to work only to find out that 2 out of the 5 men team called out, or everyone showed up but they have 3 people doing other jobs and not to mention that we are only allowed to listen to our manager and if we would do something for another manager we would get in trouble for it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun we all had in the back room."
good,"My job as a cashier was just a good and easy job. all i had to do was stand at a register, check out items and keep my work space clean. The thing that killed it for me was the uneven schedules, my way of getting to work at that time depended on my roommate ended up having to get to work up most 6 hours early due to that being the only time i could show up, in turn caused absences."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is a satisfied customer. My learning experience at Walmart has been fun because it is new & challenging experience for me. I like my job.
good,Learned a lot of valuable things to use in my future. Very fast paced environment. Daily touches with high level leadership.
good,General clean up floor sweep and mop. Inspect the restrooms on a hourly bases to ensure cleanliness. Dump the trash at the start of shift and round up shopping carts.
good,Fun laid back atmosphere. Wonderful people to work with. Management was nice and approachable. Loved my co-workers very nice and upbeat. Hardest part was not having a set lunch time or breaks. Most enjoyable was working with my co-workers and the customers.
good,we worked over night and the co-workers are very friendly. we worked as a team to complete our work. We got 2 days off a week and paid every two weeks. over time was offered during christmas and inventory time.
good,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for nine (9) years. In that time I have learned a great deal. I have learned how to not only deal with trying consumers, I have learned how to communicate with management and other high level associates within the company. All companies have something about them that everyone doesn't like, as do people. The journey is to learn how to communicate with those people and learn from them, it is the same way with any work environment. I have been a Department/Operations Manager for eight (8) years. There is a multitude of things we do through out a day; price changes, modular, setting displays, working freight, ordering, zoning, and communicating with the associates that are under our charge. The most enjoyable thing about my job, is laughter. I have a true friend at Wal-Mart who has helped me through some very difficult home situations and yet still makes me laugh and encourages me."
good,"I was on the front end of the store and had a good experience. My managers and coworkers were nice, but the pay was not enough. Good job for short term employment."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, they demanded a lot out of the employees to worked hard. They also work very well with my school schedule, They have a lot of great people who worked for them!"
good,"A high volume pharmacy, could have used better technician staffing.  The pharmacists I worked with were pleasant and hard-working.  I loved being off holidays."
good,it was a good starter level job. But has low pay for amount of work guven. Many managers have little to very little management skills and experience.
good,Each day at walmart was a challenge it was always different because of the freight it was never the same. I learned hard work and how to come together as a team with my co-worker it was fun being able to work with others. Managers did their best to make sure we had everything we needed to complete the job. The hardest part we had to work in the heat because it got up to 115 degrees
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, management did their best to fix issues and instruct employees in  a good manner. The company had good hard working individuals that took pride in their work."
good,"There is not much to say, just come to work and grind. This is great for a second job or if you are a student or retired. I credit this job for helping me start back going to college."
good,contratan a todo tipo de personas las capacitan para la labor.
good,it well serves the community where it is located as well as indiscriminate customers from all over.  it offers a clean and friendly work environment.  and the variety of  selection is the best.
good,"typical day, punch in walk to the front... they expect you 5 minutes early which never worked for me... management was cool managers were cycled every 6 months some better than others. co - workers were the best part about the job getting to meet new people. most enjoyable part about the job was when the store was empty and you just walked around for your shift or sorted returns."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consists of being friendly, making our guest feel appreciated  by helping, making sure they find everything alright, and letting them know that we are here to help. I have really learned to be patient. Being a customer service manager,  there are times where things can get really busy, and everyone depends on you, not only the customers but your co-workers as well. Working just as hard  as they do or even harder especially when things seem to get hard for them. Always reminding them, that we will always get through this together as a team and when they realize that most of the time we smoothly together."
good,I was required to ring peoples orders and bag products. sometimes would have a bagger at my register. required to shut down my register after hours. I stocked groceries.
good,era una empresa donde no crecias rapido pero si demuestras tus capacidades y aptitudes de trabajo sales adelante y subes y aciendes rapido asi como te respentaban tus dias de descanso asi como tus horarios dependiendo de la funcion de trabajo
good,"A typical day for a cashier at Walmart is just constant interaction with customers that are nice and mean. You learn to deal with all kind of people that way. The management is friendly, and ready to always listen to what you have to say. The co-workers soon become your work family. The hardest part of cashier at Walmart is that you are not allowed to sit down, even when there is no customer, and the never ending pressure of persuading customers to sign up for the Walmart MasterCard. The most enjoyable part about being a cashier is meeting new and different kind of people everyday, and just having fun with your work family."
good,I have always worked hard at this establishment but get treated like the lowest just based on the high school acting management team and associates that work there
good,"Walmart can be a good place to work for some people. However, I just don't care too much for them not caring for the people who do their job right. Moreover, by not being appreciative."
good,"Wasn't too bad working at Walmart. Management was overboard and too many people in ""power"" is a recipe for disaster. Not too strict but definitely taxing on the body physically. For it being Walmart, the pay wasn't bad and they did give you hours if you weren't full time."
good,"I did learn a lot from this job.  I learned inventory, stocking shelves, ordering merchandise,  making sure that merchandise is not out of date.  Management is not the best, some are better than other.  Co workers are like family."
good,I like the people I work with . The unloading and receiving system is productive. The hardest part is being in the heat. you have to be willing to do some work.
good,"at Walmart you come in clock in and see what the day has to offer, I learned how to talk to associates and spot shoplifters. management was ok a lot of turn overs. co-workers are nice and friendly. the stress that comes with the job. the enjoyable part is the hour brake you get."
good,"Assist customers with purchases, handle large monetary transactions including but not limited to: cash, checks, coupons, price comparisons and debit/credit cards. Maintain a clean, safe, and Texas Alcohol and Beverage commission compliant work place."
good,"Where to start with this job?! Well this also depends on which walmart you work at. The one I did was great for a while (5 months to be exact). If you're a student and need for sure work, definitely work here and put up with the things they give you left and right. It will pay off in the end."
good,decent work for a part time employee. wouldn't recommend for a full time job. hours are fairly short and wage isn't  very high.
good,"The company itself is a good one to work for, the trouble lies with individual stores and their management structure. As APM, you are required to report to the Market APM who in most circumstances is not near your store. In times that issues need resolving, the SM must be consulted instead. There are many communication issues from the store levels of things to the Asset Protection levels of things, a ""left hand doesn't know what its right is doing"" scenario."
good,"Started with Walmart as an overnight ICS member where I used a pallet jack to move product so I could bin it with a telson.  Also used the telson to pick product from bins and move onto rocket carts and then transfered the carts to the departments."
good,Enfoque ha la atención ha clientes y muy buen ambiente laboral con mucha oportunidad de aprender y capacitación constante.
good,"•	Answered customers' questions, and provide information on procedures or policies."
good,"Working for Walmart, has been a great experience. Management was great when coming to helping with issues. However its not the job for me, I want a position that gives me more of a challenge and keeps me busy."
good,My day was typically long and drawn out and it always seem like I was doing someone else's job. The co-workers were ok but the managers were never organized. There was nothing really hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount
good,"Hard work, keeps you in shape and busy. I enjoyed having a job that gave me a work out and make money at then same time. Standards were too high for production I thought. Some days it was impossible to get production"
good,"Assist customers at the checkout line"
good,"Challenging. Daily work can be stressful and intense. Deadlines are short."
good,"- Management wasn't that great, pushed too much"
good,Management was very helpful but some people had an aversion to new employees. Fun job with mediocre satisfaction at the end of the day. Definitely a good starter job with a somewhat lacking Healthcare  model in place.
good,Generally I am great as a CSS i love the dynamic of having to plan and strategize to meet customer needs and running around the store helping out. though i don't like how management would rather blame or bark at someone as opposed to using that energy to fix a problem. my co-workers are great it's the management aspect that i feel can do with some fine tuning.
good,"its a great thing to help others. I have always tried to help in my best ability, if its not holding the door or saying thank you."
good,"Day starts at 4am or 2:30pm for Night Shift. You pick cases of food, paper goods, chemicals, etc till all the trucks for that day are loaded. you go home. Getting 40 hrs is nigh impossible. THe guys you work with are as varied as varied can be."
good,"Teaches great leadership skills. "
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work for someone who doesnt have a lot of professional experience. Would love to work for them again just not at the particular store. Management is subpar at best. There are a few that actually do care about the associates but most dont and thats a company i do not want to work for.
good,"The job itself is good. Management is lacking in relation to associate interaction and recognition of associate contributions. Safety is claimed to be a priority, yet very little recognition of safety records. Fellow associates crave appreciation and recognition beyond a paycheck."
good,"co workers are great to work with and do more than management. i learned a lot fro, workimg as a cashier deli associate and cake decorator. its a great place to work if you can handle the stress."
good,Walmart is a company that overworks you and underpays you. My experience there as a Customer Service Manager was horrible. My store was poorly ran and not enough support or training to effectively do the job that's required from you.
good,"estaba a cargo de 27 unidades las cuales solo el dia lunes me encontraba en la oficina  verificanco y analizando cada una de las unidades sus kpi los alcances crecimientos y las ooportunidades de cada uno verificando que requerian cada unidad y resolver cada oportunidad , posteriormente en cada una de ellas se verificaba todos los indicadores de unidad desde la imagen los programas ya instalados y el cumplimiento que se esta realizando en cada una de ellas, se complicaba una parte ma s complicada es la relacion laboral y sus alcances lo que m,as me gusta es la satisfaccion de lograr conjuntamen te los objetivos."
good,"The store has opportunity for good people to make an impact immediately on the bottom line and culture of the store.  For someone who is willing to work hard and do his/her job, Walmart is good place to be able to do that.  Our particular store is very profitable without even doing the basics well.  If our store could do the basics well, it could be so profitable."
good,"hardest part- not knowing what you'll be doing that day, miscommunication, mean management, most enjoyable- gaining experience in different areas of the store, great co-workers."
good,"typical work day would be to clock in, ask where you're needed (if you're a ""miscellanious"" employee.  Management could use improvement especially as far as instructions go. Management is very vague, does not give instructions clearly or in detail.  Most enjoyable part is when the customers actually enjoy and engage in your services as well. Upside is payscale seems to be fair, typical hours no less than 32 a week."
good,What can I say about customer service?? You take care of the customer.. Sometimes management would back you and sometimes not. Co-worker were great. the hardest part of my job was finding a happy medium with management.I enjoyed working with people.
good,I provide excellent customer service by ensuring the products are available to them on a nightly basis. I work in a team environment by training any new associates. I have learned a great deal in the retail but would like to continue working in IT.
good,"Could get very busy, especially around most any holiday.  I liked that you would know you schedule 3 weeks out so you could plan things to do with friends and family."
good,"Lack of support for rural store, leaves one to manage all aspects of business. Must ensure all are on board with decisions at all times, if not its a slippery slope to manage"
good,clock in. assemble the unloading team and set up the line and then assign everyone to there zones. unload ruck then mange and or stock items on shelf till lunch.electronically manage inventory to be sent to the floor or in he backroom.
good,the company itself seems to be decent with pay and benefits. they say they are family oriented and care for their employees but the management where I was wouldn't even talk to their cashiers. I was told they didn't have time for me.
good,"Stocking products Scanning inventory Customer service. Workers where easy to work with, No benifits or working hour under 40 hours."
good,Everyday was a challenge something I looked forward to so I could gain more knowledge about the company and business operations. I learned many different ways to manage people based on their personalities. Management mostly was easy to work with and communicate to. The things I enjoyed the most was teaching and training the associates to become better at their job and prepare them for success. The hardest part of the job was letting an associate go. You never want to give that news to someone but it came with the position.
good,"I worked there for two and a half years and i can say the best thing about working there was , the overnight shift and some of the other associates"
good,I felt like working there was okay but the compensation was not that great. Employees are somewhat friendly and they were always short employees as well.
good,"Typical day at Walmart consists mainly of helping customers, stocking shelves, and occasionally doing special tasks assigned by management, such as inventory or adjusting prices."
good,"the way some managers treated their subordinate employees, they would have an attitude. sometimes they forget to give you a break. Those two things are the hardest part about dealing with working there. there are long lines and a lot of rude customers (unless you're nice to them first and you move quick) but that's anywhere basically! It isn't so bad, nice fast-paced environment and that's what I enjoyed about it. It kept you on your feet and made the time pass by faster."
good,"hard hours to work, short staffed, hours never the same each week"
good,"A typical day was stocking shelves, customer service in assisting customers with locating items in the store or at check out."
good,"too much labor on one associate"
good,"It was my responsibility to take care of the front end. All cashiers and customer service. I was also responsible for change for all departments throughout the store."
good,"buen trato y apoyo de parte de tus compañeros"
good,"Loved this job, got a lot of hours and the pay was okay. I am a college student so I was not interested in being full time with benefits."
good,A typical day would be clocking in then cleaning up my area and moving things around if its out place and then turning on the light and then stand outside and greet each customer and asking them if they need help and by then a customer would come up and i ask them what i can help them with and they would tell me what they need and i would try my best to assist them with what they may need and  some co-workers may ask me where this go and i tell and then may hold a small conversation and then we would both get back to work and when i need change or not sure about something i call my manager to assist me in whatever i may need and i enjoy helping a customer and to see a smile on the customer face.
good,"Walmart is a very good business, and I love working here, but I am not financially stable. It's a fun, easy going job, but Im looking for a more stable job"
good,"Support front end including Customer Service and Cashier."
good,"Would not put me in the position I wanted, even after being trained. Full time hours are VERY unlikely. No interaction with other employees other than customers."
good,"Walmart was a good place to learn new things, how to read upcs, manage merchandise and use tools as in pallet jacks etc , they just lack of communication at times"
good,Very busy cleaning floors all the time at night which was a good working environment with other employees. Responsibility also included keeping all supplies for cleaning on hand/ inventory was constant so we wouldn't run out
good,I learned about retail while working at Walmart never had i worked in retail. The co-workers where great to work with always working really hard.
good,The most enjoyable thing about working here is the  people I get to work with. Management  can be a bit overbearing and hard to please.
good,"Customers were friendly, employees worked well together.  Management was sub-par to many places I have worked. All around an okay work place."
good,"Working at wal-mart on a day to day basis is very average"
good,"A typical work day would consist of electronically clocking in then reporting to my supervisor to see what our daily goals are then meet with the coworkers to assign their daily tasks and work location within the store. I learned how to properly assign task, operate a register, unload trucks and restock shelves. The management was poor. They never assisted with anything they took longer breaks than allowed, they had personal relationships between the coworkers and management, they showed favoritism to friends, and they never properly trained me for the job I had to learn on my own through older coworkers with seniority. My coworkers were amazing they made sure their workload was properly handled regardless of the management problems. The hardest part of the job was putting up with the horseplay allowed during the work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and working with my coworkers."
good,is not bad but the expectation that management expects are unbelievable production rate are to high fro one person to keep up plus no bonuses and there is no equal treatment in the work area.
good,"This is not my first time to work for a major corporation like Walmart. my day consists of backroom activity which mostly remains there. I do very little if none at all on the sales floor. I work with inventory such as backstock,unloading trucks,etc. not much interaction with customer unless I happen to be on the floor and customer needs assistance. my work is with a hand held scanner called a Telzon which has many functions, it tells you what stock needs to be pulled, ordering, placing stock back in the bins or shelves in backroom and other functions. inventory associates and Dept Managers use these and many of them are not turned in by associates who sign them out and we are short at least 20 out of 40 and have to wait in line for the preceding shift to turn theirs in. management just doesn't keep up with them and they don't work properly or other reasons.it seems what I do every day is tedious. I started as an unloader which is the hardest working postion. overtime is seldom allowed unless authorized. mostly all Associates I work with or see on a daily basis are friendly and I get along with them. never have a problem with what management and supervisors directing me on tasks.benefits are good, hardest part of the job is handling of the freight after its been on the floor, open cases, product falls out, too much overstock in back room."
good,The start of the day was almost routine clock-in check tasks and head back to the backroom and start working on clearing out the dance-floor and setting up the line with the rest of the crew for the night. Than we start on the truck unloading the truck was always a treasure hunt for the back of it.
good,"I worked as a cashier for the Wal-Mart Corporation for approximately two years in two different stores. Part of my job was ensuring that my register and the area around it was organized at all times, that I could interact with all manners of customers, and work well with management directives. I would occasionally work at the customer service desk and had taken and passed the management course to become a CSM or manager over the cashiers. Shortly after passing this test I was forced to transfer due to living situations."
good,"All I remember from walmart. Is punching in, punching out. Not much job culture, Not many friendly people working here either. I wouldn't recommend working here if you are looking for a friendly fun employment."
good,"São rotinas normais do ramo da logista.Em todo emprego acabo aprendendo algo ou aprimorando o que já sabia.No caso do Walmart, só foi uma revisão.Não tive tanto contato com a gerência.Eram pessoas muito extrovertidas e de fácil comunicação.Por minha parte era pelo serviço pesado que as vezes era executado,por outro lado eu trabalhava com um amigo e isso me fazia me sentir melhor durante minha jornada no serviço."
good,"If you are looking for an intensely challenging retail enviroment with ever changing demands, this is the spot for you. "
good,"Each day was busy with customers. Learned to deal with grumpy customers and finding items for customers who couldn't find what they were looking for. The hardest part was the dealing with customers. Associates were helpful with questions or helping to locate items, great with training. Lunches varied depending on the hours worked daily."
good,"I worked in the back invoice office. I ran daily morning reports  and handed out all reports to mgmt. I would research all vendor invoices for shortage, overages, or overcharges and then would file claims as needed. I would have to figure and key in monthly cost inventories and along with having to work with the auditor when the auditor on the annual inventory when keying in the final numbers. I liked working in this position along with the co-workers and some of the management. It came a time when I reached as far as I could go and I wanted to seek another path which lead into the medical field, where I went to school and receive a certificate in medical billing & coding."
good,"Good to start out, but i would not recommend staying for more than 5 years. Working for Walmart is like working in politics you have to lie to people between your teeth and you aren't able to actually help any of the customers if you want to do your job the Walmart way."
good,Was a job as a young adult. Typical job for a young kid to have while transitioning to adulthood. Wasnt the best but wasnt the worst.
good,"the coworker atmosphere is wonderful, i have made many new friends here and get along well with alot of them. i guess we all just relate to the job we do. I bin merchandise into the steel. pick merchandise out. correct the count on merchandise. unload trucks. check vendors in. communicate with management to insure a smooth transition into the later shifts of the day. the hardest part of the job is trying to get extra things done outside your job code or above it. while trying to get your job code done aswell. but then having no thanks given for this."
good,A good place to work at. There is always something to do. One of the things I like about Walmart is interacting with the customers.
good,"t was ok. a little stressful but then again its walmart, the management didnt really understand certain sutiations but desides that the money was ok too..and i had great co workers"
good,"I tried to go back to work after my daughter was born but ended up quitting due to she went into the hospital for a heart failure. She is great now. Still has issues, but sees the doctor once a year. they were not patient with me on my sick daughter"
good,"Company try's to accommodate workers needs. Pay was low, but made up with benefits. Touchy with punch out times. Schedule request should be honored when asking for time off. A lot of computer testing...Making a regular count on hours a week would have been nice. We used to get bonus's at the quarter and lost one because of theft. They also used to get pizza or have a cookout in the bays, that was nice."
good,"My experience working for Walmart was not a very good one.  I was on the backroom inventory team and the backroom was very unorganized which caused very heavy workloads, that I was not getting paid  enough to deal with."
good,"Walmart is very adamant about taking breaks and lunches and not performing any work during off time which includes checking your schedule on the in house computer.  A bit frustrating but can be dealt with.  Poor pay and vacation allotment.  Supportive management- at least from management inside the store.  Very irritating all the anti union information they continually give you.  They should only give there stance on unions, not continually influence people how ""poor"" unions are."
good,Transportar pallets o dia inteiro não é uma coisa para que possa aprender muita coisa tornado difícil qualquer oportunidade de mostrar o seu desempenho para gestor.
good,I did not have any problems with this company. The mangers could have been more experience. customers were friendly. Easy job performance.
good,"I have been with this company for 3 1/2 years, my job consists of multiple duties due to lack of associates. on a typical day I am in charge of more than 3 departments including management duties. The level of respect served to me on a daily basis is very high due to my work ethic. The hardest part of the job to me is sometimes when tending to 4 or more areas, I am dependable and very capable, without assistance. I enjoy doing management duties, and accomplishing tasks on time and correctly."
good,Working overnight stocking at walmart Wasn't fun. I would come in at 10pm clock then stretch and then my manger would tell me what aisle i had to stock and i would go do them. It could take 3hrs 2hrs or an hr just depended on how much there was to stock that day and then at 7am if you were done you were free to go.
good,"This was my first retail job and it was not what i expected. Needless to say retail is not my strong suit. It is easy work but it's a lot all at once, with the customer flow and the management breathing down your neck constantly. I have to say it is a good place to work if its your first job but its very difficult to try and move up in the company."
good,"I totally loved my job and the management I had.  Every six months they rotate managers which it is inevitable you will get a manager that does not like you.  The job itself was great.  I was able to decorate and go full speed in each event we had.  I enjoyed my customer's coming up to me and telling me how they liked the department.  I even was able to customize for my customers and that was even more fun.  I was increasing sales up to 17 % from the year before.  However like I said, when the management changes then the atmosphere changes.  If you can make it with the management, this job is creative and gives a pride in what you do and what you can do."
good,"Walmart is not a goo place to work if you want to move out and live on your own, but if you're looking for a part time job or something over the summer it is a good place to start. Managers at the weymouth store are friendly and they take notice if you come in on time and do your job. If it were not for the fact that I do not get paid a living wage, I would have no problem continuing to be a cart pusher at weymouth walmart. There is good job security and usually plenty of hours if you want them. The most difficult part of being a cart pusher is that there are usually not enough carts for all the customers who need them. Bad weather is not usually a concern. Management will let you store use gloves, rain ponchos, water bottles, sunscreen, and other things you may need. You may be required to do a few dirty jobs if maintenance calls out, but doing those sorts of jobs only earns you praise from the managers, who more often than not will repay the favor when you request a day off."
good,Wal-mart has the ability to help you grow into whatever role you wish to persue as long as you are willing to work and push yourself to get what you want.
good,A lot of preferential treatment and no real appreciation for hard work. It was nearly impossible to advance within the company regardless of excellent intern reviews and exemplary performance.
good,"A regular day at Walmart would start with me at the a register, as the last line of communication with the customer. I would greet every customer with a smile and a positive attitude. Walmart award me employee of the month, as one of the top employees at the cashier level management would often assign me to different projects throughout the day. Although some projects proved to be difficult, it taught me a lot about organization, team work and the fundamentals."
good,stocking the selves overnight. I had to stock boxes after boxes dead in the night. There were no fun parts of this job. the management was okay they would never really help out they would watch and tell you your not working fast enough. The hardest part of that job was having everything stocked by the morning.
good,"In their pursuit to become the best, they forgot about the smaller cogs and wheels that help the engine run at the pace it does. Just check the turnover rate for walmart employees."
good,"I had a everyday routine, when I come to work I clock in, grab a buggy and start picking up the returns. Working at Wal mart taught me how to communicate with others better and look at other peoples' point of view. My co-workers always helped me whenever I messed up on anything. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. My favorite part of the job was listening to the customers/co-workers compliment me on how well I do my job."
good,"You will learn about how to exactingly arrange store shelf tags every year to fit new items, then have to creatively fit items to them due to stocking fluctuations of returns after sales finish."
good,I would work overnight pilling pallet out of the warehouse area and down stack the pallets in the lanes. Then i would place the product on the shelves and rotate stock. Then rebuild the pallets with remaining product and place it back in the warehouse and clean up. I learned more about the product and the proper handling of said products. Management left much to be desired when the night manager would hand out assignments and then spend the rest of the night locked up in the office. I did how ever like the general manager who would spend time getting to know his employees. I made many friends in the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the time allowed to get the job done. The most enjoyable was the friends I made.
good,"Creating excellent customer service, and doing daily tasks. How quickly and efficiently a job or task could be completed depended on employees working as a team, and it doesn't happen most of the time."
good,"Walmart as a place to work is great of one loves working with the public. However, as their management stands, it is not a very good place to work. The management is awful because they will not stand behind their employees, no matter the situation."
good,Only minium wage to work in all weather conditions and deal with customers and over anxious mangement. Not fun place to work  at
good,"This company's growth changed the way they treated their employees. As department managers we were required to the job of three people. They only wanted results and expected for you to achieve their goals, even if you didn't have enough help."
good,mi trabajo es facil y divertido si sabes como hacerlo vas aprendiendo a tratar a diversos tipos de persona y tomas experiencia de diversas areas
good,At times the job can be very stressful with many difficult situations that you have to resolve. Coworkers are overall very friendly.
good,"Supervisionar varias atividades cotidianas da empresa;"
good,"Working at Walmart is definitely a different kind of experience. The management is down to Earth, the Supervisors for the most part are very professional and keep their departments handled well. They give bonuses based on store performance. They also provide picnics for the employees as well as catered meals during the holidays. You also get a 10% discount card to use on just about anything in the store. My problem with Walmart, as it is with any retail, I always have to work every weekend, every single holiday, and I have no time for my children or husband. Walmart is a really good place to work if you have no children, are single, or are in a Management position."
good,"I worked in the Electronics department which was an easy job. All you do is stock the shelves, answer the customer's questions and keep a lookout for thieves. The only thing I didn't like was that we were told to always look busy, even when everything was done and there was, literally,nothing to do. Also, I was a teenager, so I didn't care about the benefits, but, my goodness, I did not understand how ANYONE, besides the managers could afford the healthcare and other benefits, it was crazy expensive."
good,The employes are friendly and are always there when you need help finding an item(s) or if you have any questions. The supervisors are slow to respond when you have a problem with a customer who is being unruly.
good,I enjoyed the interaction with my co-workers and most of my customers. I also enjoyed working with the photo equipment and the opportunity to learn about cameras and photo development.
good,"Typical day would be to run and maintain two departments. Keep department clean and safe for customers. Keep shelves stocked and zoned. Help customers and support for other departments as needed. "
good,Walmart is a good company to work for if the management team cares about it employees. But the pay is low for the work load.
good,"I have learned a lot about the people side of the business, how to be a leader and I enjoy the people I work with. I have learned a lot over the years."
good,Customer service friendly always making sure everything was in the right place for customers. Great management staff always on the look out and very comprehensive.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty mundane and tedious , I did the same thing everyday so there wasn't much change other than the day and the people that came in and out of the store. I had learned a lot about scheduling and how that affects our job and how to try to properly balance my life out between work and school and my personal free time, it is really hard to find a perfect balance of all three. Management was great i knew that if i had a problem i knew exactly who i could talk to and be assured that whatever issue i had would be resolved in best manner possible. My co-workers were okay, i mean we weren't exactly best friends but we were not worst enemies by no means either we just kind of communicated when it was necessary for work but we did not socialize beyond that, the hardest part of my job was the physical aspects of it, i was expected to push 10 carts at a time however being the size and weight that i am that proved to be a tad difficult for me so i settled for 5 and figured i would get stronger the longer i worked there and it would gradually get easier for me over time to start pushing more. I most enjoyed just  knowing I was making a difference no matter how big or small my duties were I knew that I was helping to make somebody's life at least a little bit easier."
good,"A typical day as a clothing associate for Walmart included a lot of putting things back on hangers and then placing them to their specific section. If you worked in the clothing department you were also required to be responsible for the jewelry counter, which included making sure everything was locked at all times and doing an inventory check. "
good,"I work vary hard for wal-mart, I enjoyed the people I worked with, I enjoyed helping my customers, the hardest part of my job was the clean up at the end of the dy."
good,hard to work job as your more then likely to be pulled from your position you know most to all about into a department you know nothing about leaving customers with out the help they need.
good,"Walmart would be okay for having a first job, but not trying to keep it long-term. I've worked at Walmart for a couple of years and ready to leave. My first month there was getting used to my job and then after  a year I switched job titles to learn something different. I stayed with that title for another year and a half. About a year ago team members would come and go, I would usually work with a crew of 4 or 5 a day, management would expect too much out of a small group. Now, I work with a crew of 7 to 10 people a day, and some have proven that they are lazy, though management has been better."
good,"At Walmart my work consisted of unloading the freight truck, sorting the freight, preparing the freight for third shift stockers, and also adding the freight to the system."
good,Unloaded and processed freight.  The job involves a lot of physical ability.  The company seems to just care about rate and productivity.  The compensation is great if you are able to complete the tasks each day.
good,I found it easy to work with my manager at the vision center .  He was open and receptive to me . I had new experiences with working with the dr and learned amazing things about our eyes . The long hours and long drive were draining on me but the joy of a child seeing things for the first time after getting glasses was fulfilling .
good,"I worked here while I was 17, for seven months. It was my second job and I thought having a job at Walmart would be rare, given my gender and ethnicity. I was just a cashier, but I needed a job for my student loan payments.  A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, then finding one of those price things to scan my badge at, which would tell me what register to go to and run. I'd log onto the register, turn on my light, and stand for up to 5 hours (with one 15-minute break) checking out customers.  I learned how to process check payments with those weird little machines and process WIC payments as well.  The managers cycled through about as regularly as the staff, honestly.  I didn't really talk to any co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was constant standing, and people getting mad because their 50 cent or 25 cent coupons weren't going through.  The best part, though, was seeing regulars.  One day while I wasn't working, I went to my workplace to buy something, and while I was in line to check out, a guy came in and said, ""Hey, I know you work here, I've seen you before! Can you tell me where this or that is?"" I helped him and continued on my way."
good,"Problems here and there with management and everyone not being on the same page. The hours fluctuate too much and instead of giving present employees more hours, they just keep hiring"
good,Buena capacitacion al personal.Buenas reuniones y evaluaciones permanentes.
good,easy to learn all you need is good customer service and a positive attitude. fun place to work and friendly co workers. management needs better communication.
good,A typical day at work consisted of working at the cash register and gain excellent customer service and cash handing experience.
good,"Wait on customers by finding products they need or give suggestions or solutions to solve their problems. Checking customers out in a friendly manner at the cash register. Unloading merchandise off trucks and putting it in it's proper place with the forklift. Keeping shelves stocked by taking merchandise off the steel with walker stacker. Bin overstock with gemini, pick merchandise to go out on sales floor, price labels and log in merchandise. Put freight in it's proper location."
good,Cleaned and replenished displays of produce. Kept up with inventory of produce and kept the produce department clean.
good,"WalMart is an okay place to work for the money. Management had high turnover and consistency was difficult to come by. With the high turnover of management, if you have the skills, it is easy to move up."
good,"Lots of Work, Some Overtime, Stay Busy, High Turnover, Will get experience in multiple departments, management has lots of turnover as well, supervisors do not stay long."
good,"pues es una empresa americana con errores como cualquier empresa en un dia normal de trabajo solo es llegar abrias caja y no hacias nada mas que cobrar cobrar y cobrar hasta que llegaba tu hora de comer y al volver a lo mismo a cobrar. "
good,"I love the customers who come into the store and I really don't have anything negative to say but the management is horrible. My schedule is not good and I don't really get to spend time with my family, No teamwork"
good,Managers work you like dogs and pay wasn't that good for all that they make you do I will never work there again because of the managers
good,"I don't dislike Walmart but it is not a first choice either. As a hard worker, I am always a first option when other work needs to be done. That is a compliment in every aspect but also a curse. My job responsibilities were moved up but my pay wasn't."
good,"could never really move up in the company, due too they could never replace me because I'm a hard worker.always on time an have a great personality."
good,"Wal-Mart is a decent place to really acquire experience in different areas, if you're willing to put in the work, time and effort.  However, the pay is not nearly enough.  Work can be very difficult and most associates aren't that willing to assist you in any way.  They promote a team atmosphere but no one really adopts this mentality."
good,"Tons of micromanaging, Horrible work life balance, little advancement, unrealistic task with limited resources. I find my self questioning why I even applied for this job after 2 years of employment. If leaders where groomed into the next position the career path would be more obtainable."
good,"directed associates on what to do everyday to meet a common goal for the company, management is okay, no work life balance as management"
good,"Walmart is a good job as far as a stepping stone goes. It's a good start to get more experience working. My typical day at work is to make photo orders for customers and to locate and bin Site to Store merchandise. On some days it's not easy, but I still get it done. I get along quite well with my managers and co-workers. I am a hard worker and will do what is asked of me, and a little more. The hardest part of my job is starting when I clock in. I'm the only person in the photo department, so I have to catch up on all of the day's orders because I don't start work until the afternoon. The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom to move around and talk to my managers and co-workers and ask them how they are doing. I also like picking Pick Up Today and Site to Store orders."
good,"Management was poor, they didn't seem to promote a person to do their best but simply was always quick to put blame on someone."
good,"opening up the store and prepare everything in place before store is open, also meeting new people everyday interacting with them and assisting them with anything they need help locating."
good,"I was Department Mananger over shoes and softlines. We started the day by doing inventory.  Then stocking shelves.  The hardest part of the job was getting the employees to be enthusiatic, but i know shoes are pretty boring.  I enjoyed the times wen it got busy and I worked up front on a register.  I love talking to people.  And it kept me busier.  Changed the pace."
good,"Renovation crew was good, i enjoyed work with them."
good,"el ambiente laboral es relativamente sano ,aprovrechas las ofertas de tienda,"
good,"Worked there for a year. typical work day was long but i love working with customers. The management had their flaws (Rude, never seemed to care much for certain workers) but managed the store well"
good,Wal-mart management only seems to care about the bottom line and will not compromise with their employees when life happens.
good,"Department definitely teaches you how to solve your own problems/wear a bunch of different hats. Most of the supporting teams are very cooperative. Like any job however, depends on the manager you are assigned to as to how enjoyable it is to work there. They need to build better info-structure, as for a large company the website is run too much on outdated and poor working systems."
good,"Working in the pharmacy department as a pharmacy technician, It is rewarding to see patients happy to get the care that they need and still be cared for. It is a tedious and stressful, but a fun job, despite the repetitive nature of the work. Co-workers all get along great. Hardest part about the job is dealing with Insurance. It can be frustrating, but I am relentless in my work and tough it out and resolve insurance issues. The best part is knowing that my patients see that I genuinely care."
good,"Mi hora de entrada regularmente por mis estudios era a las 4.30 A esa hora que llegaba y checaba  enseguida me daban mi media hora de comida al finalizar el supervisor decidía si me ponía a cobrar o recojia checado (todos los productos que los clientes no llevan y solo los ponen a un lado de las cajas). Mientras cobraba si se nos permitía ir al baño, tomar agua. Antes de finalizar mi turno tenia que hacer corte, sumar pagos, depositos, pagos de servicios o tarjeta, bochert's y verificar que no hubiera faltantes o sobrantes. Si aun quedaba tiempo limpiabamos cajas."
good,"For myself, a typical work day in my store starts off with:"
good,"When i first started everyone told me the same thing ""they will act nice for the first week or so but after that everyones attitude changes, badly."" where to start... The management is ok at first like they said after like a week I had worked 5-6 times but i was still training and they kept putting me on different isles almost every night so it was impossible to get familiar with the placement of product, well thats when it all changed. I started noticing the managers doing some very....questionable things... They would be peeking around corners of isles just sitting there watching. And i never did anything wrong I followed rules I did procedure so i had no idea why they were doing this. Come to find out they do this with ALL their employees of course except the ones they liked. Which became very prominent to me very quickly. Another thing that i and 99% of my co workers felt is the timers were unreasonable and down right undoable. Each task at night you have a certain time and that isnt unusual im used to that what im not used to is having 3-5 pallets with over 5-7 ft of product a piece which would take me around 3-6 hours to do give or take depending on the department and size of product but you would be given 2-3 hours for this much work. then after that 2-3 hours is up youd start to be hounded by management until your done and trust me they will make sure you know they are displeased with your speed. Let me put this into perspective, there are people there who have been working for the company for over 5 years and I would ask them how much time this should/could take and"
good,"the management is very judgemental and rude, co workers are very nosy and drama filled. the only upsides to this job is the discount card for shopping although you cant use it on grocerys"
good,"A typical work day was about 12 hours, management was good, and coworkers were friendly. Hardest part of job was making production."
good,A typical day would be okay depending on who you worked with and what upper management would be on duty that day.  Certain upper Management at the Grassfield location other than the Store Manager had issues with Micro- messaging and excepting feedback or ideas from employees lower in title. The hardest part of the job was getting to attached to people who passed away. The most enjoyable part of the job was I loved my Job and The customers and some Associates.
good,It was a standard retail customer service job. It was no more and no less what you'd expect working an entry-level retail position.
good,"* Excellent place to rapidly develop customer service"
good,"I worked for Wal-mart for little over 2 years and at three different locations.  The first store that I was at was a good training store.  They taught me everything that I needed to know about the company.  The hardest part of my day was the beginning of my shift and the most enjoyable was close to the end.  At this particular store  it was very hectic.  However, at the second  store that I was at, it was very busy all the time and it was just reversed from the first store.  The hardest part of the day was at the end and the best was at the beginning.  Managers were also great, they helped out when needed and answered any questions that came across.  Now the third store that I was at was a complete disaster.  They were unprepared for the day and disorganized.  I did not especially care for the management there.  They seem to think they are above everyone else and belittling people was something they did often."
good,"el ambiente era muy bueno te capacitan harto y te enseñan a trabajar en equipo lo que es muy bueno por que eso genera que te lleves bien y te conozcas con tus compañeros me gusto mucho ser parte de esa empresa ya que hay aprendí varias cosas y adquirir experiencia lo mas difícil fue trabajar ahí los últimos meses ya que no estaba pasando por un buen momento familiar"
good,it was a long and hard day and they like to to do more then what you are paid for over and over again no matter if your about to get off or not.
good,"I'm rather indifferent about the place."
good,"My review of walmark, there was a lot of favoritism going on there. And a lot of discrimination as well. "
good,"Friendly co-workers and managers who are helpful and enjoyable. The typical day at Wal-Mart usually starts out a little more busy as most people are doing their grocery shopping after work. It slows down and we are able to stock and clean. Once morning comes around, we become a little more busy again as everyone is off to work."
good,"While working at Wal-Mart I learned to combine good customer service with inventory management. Depending on where help was needed magement would have me work in grocery, hardware, or even unloading in the back sometimes.It was an easy environment to work in and learn basic job skills."
good,I went into work swept the floor and ran the buffer. Sometimes I would have to clean the bathrooms too. I would also get pulled for stock
good,The typical day at work usually involves clocking in at your allotted time slot and starting work immediately. The job is straightforward so briefing is usually not needed after training.
good,"On a daily basis I started off in sporting goods and help cover other sections. I learned many new skills in each section of the store such as automotive, RV, Camping, Fans and A/C, Light bulbs , plumbing paint and toys. The store was often very busy and usually understaffed, so I would have to cover multiple departments everyday. The hardest part of the job was being by myself most of the time and having too much to get done in a short period of time, because I was too stretched out with tasks."
good,"o trabalho era bom, aprendi a lhe dar com clientes de todos os nível, a conviver no local de trabalho com pessoas falsas, invejosas, como também de pessoas boas, alegres simples e simpáticas, e aprendi que a diferença é nossa gente e o importa é o cliente, a direção e gerência era muito competente e dedicada, no meu setor não encontrei  nenhuma dificuldade, e mim agradava muito com o movimento de pessoas, com os risos dos clientes e de alguns colegas. uma das coisas que eu não gostava era que eles davam oportunidades de promoção para associados que mal entrava na empresa não tinha nem se quer passado na experiência e eles já escolhiam, não seguem a política certa da empresa. Mais tenho ciência de que a walmart é ima empresa muito boa de de trabalhar. o ruim mesmo é certas pessoas que nela ocupam praticando o que não deveria fazer."
good,the work is hard but my co workers made it bearable management was ok but for the most part it was all about getting the job done FAST and have the store ready in time for the store manager
good,Acme markets was a good job to start my career off. I learned how retail works and how to run a business. This company got bought out and closed many of its stores.
good,Working here was not the best.  Nothing anyone ever did was good enough for the management. The management would sit in the office and play on their phones.
good,"O Walmart é uma escola; onde o crescimento só depende de seu próprio esforço, o ponto fraco acredito que seja a pressão psicológica por venda que acaba deixando as associados um tanto sobrecarregados devido a grande rotatividade frequente e falta de colaboradores, o que acaba afetando diretamente na vida pessoal e profissional dos associados que se mantem na empresa, fazendo com que eles acabem se desmotivando."
good,i was a cashier so typical day was scanning customers items and i got paid 8.35 and after a year a raise to 8.85 kinda low pay
good,"A typical day at Walmart, I would go in for 7 am. pick up the returns from customer service. put them away, start zoning, or had to set up for new items. My co-workers were pretty great, we all worked together if there was a big project. My manager was great to me. He would always stop to see how we were doing, if there were any problems."
good,"Dealt with rude customers on a daily basis, I learned that sometimes you just have to bite your tongue and do your job. Management sucked when it came to changing g your work schedule, they basically tell you it is either work or school but it can't be both. Some of my coworkers nice however there were some that were mean and nasty. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the rude customers, the most enjoyable part was that I got to go home when my shift was over."
good,a typical day at Walmart was pretty low key not to stressful. The management wasn't my favorite. they weren't very polite or understanding they seemed to play favorites. I loved my co workers everyone that I encountered was very friendly and made working more enjoyable.
good,I had ideas that never was implemented to help with customer service and Other than that it was what I knew and I had the experience to do my job. I still wish anyone that works for the company the best of luck and always do what is best for your life. Taking care of the Consumer population is my experience. I have the knowledge.
good,A typical day always depends on the job title. Sometimes it can be slow and sometimes it can be busy. I would recommend you read the job description before you accept the job.
good,good job able to work without management breathing down neck poor in a way that if an issue was brought to managements attention nothing would be done even if done several times
good,If your looking for something to spend a lot of time in your looking at the right place. Its a wonderful company to work in as a student however its not realistic to live off of.
good,"Under paid, under appreciated, lack of advancement opportunities, and unreliable co-workers and work ethics. Need a better retention of employees which will require investing in your employees for long term."
good,"WalMart was a learning experience, it was at first a place that helped me transfer from schools and jobs without any lapse. Started as a Maintenance employee, advanced to a Frozen/Dairy Employee, and then an Inventory Control Specialist."
good,"Typically management will give directions for the day or night, then other management will come and tell you a different task. The work time continues with different managers giving different jobs, and they all want it done immediately. I did learn different organization skills, customer service skills, among other things. The fellow workers helped me and I helped them with all problems that were fore seen."
good,"Walmart did teach me a great amount but they are not very flexible when it comes to students. I struggled to reduce my hours at work to  make it move convenient and flexible with my school schedule and was that ever a task. Never the less, i am grateful for having the opportunity to work with such a large company."
good,Working at Wal Mart was not a fun experience. The co-workers were great but the management team was horrible. They play favorites and the don't care about ANYTHING but themselves
good,I helped with customer service. I also prepared food for the customers. I also learned a lot from my co-workers. They taught me how to deal with unhappy customers in a professional manner. Management was not that good at this job. That pushed me to do my job even better. The hardest part of my job was keeping all my customers happy. Some of them just give you a hard time just because. The most enjoyable part of my day is leaving my customer satisfied and smiling.
good,"a typical day at Walmart is fun"
good,"Cashier duties, you can talk to your surrounding cashiers , I enjoyed asking people about the different products they liked in the store."
good,"Wal-Mart stores, are so large, with such a large employee base per store, that it is usually to much for management to handle. Especially since the past year staff has been cut to a minimum to run a store."
good,"I enjoy meeting the patients and getting to know them and their families."
good,"Great people to work with, but management could use some changes, I would recommend management take more interest in their employees."
good,working at Walmart was cool because you met and helped a lot of people. the pay wasn't the best but it was fair. i liked my co-workers they were helpful and fun to work with. management however never staffed enough people for the day. so you would ether have a big work load or stuck doing some other person job.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Wal-mart. I bounced between full and part-time hours because I was attending school throughout my time there. I kept busy at work and was often given management tasks to attend to. The management team was friendly and encouraged hard work and productive use of time."
good,it was busy and face paced in the pharmacy the people were great and it seemed like a wonderful company to work for. I enjoyed the time I spent working there
good,I worked part time as a cashier and enjoyed the interaction with my customers.  The employees at Walmart work really hard for the money that they make.  I enjoy working with people and handling different situations.
good,"Aprendi como se faz uma boa gestão de manutenção, planilhas e gerenciamento de pessoas."
good,"That's a job with wonderful and hard working people who enjoy working as a team. However, the pay is very low; therefore, most of associates working two jobs to survive."
good,Good place to work if you don't mind doing multiple jobs out of what you applied for and being treated like a child by management.
good,"Working at Arby's, requires a lot of patience, as it is fast food, you have to be quick on your feet, and be ready for whoever walks through that door. Customers sometimes would get their own orders confused, and we had to be able to assist them, and help them figure out what is what."
good,"I loved working at Walmart it was a great place to work. The only bad thing about the Walmart I worked at, I cant say the same for all Walmart's. But management was terrible TERRIBLE !!! the super center Walmart in chino great customers great associates but horrible managers."
good,"Go to a meeting every day get assigned an aisle to start stocking the shelves.  To work at a fast pace and do the job right the first time.  Co workers are great to work with, they help you when you ask and give great advice.  The hardest part was being on my knees to reach the lower shelves."
good,"A typical day at work is just standing around getting yelled at by customers. I don't mind the work, but I still haven't been trained and when I ask questions about what I am supposed to be doing I get yelled at by the manager."
good,Great for friendly workers who don't mind working with others. I worked back room keeping everything stocked for guest.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of preparing the various departments for the customers, while also assisting them in any way possible. I learned how to work cooperatively within such a large workplace, as well as further develop my time management and work efficiency skills. Management was competent and effective at ensuring the associates stayed on task. Co-workers were helpful most of the time."
good,As a big box employer they were in the middle of the road for overall job expectactions.  Unless you work full time it would be difficult to make a decent living.  Management quality varied by each manager.
good,The hardest part of my job is keeping a smile on a bad but I have good co-worker that keep me going. A typical day for me is working as casher and money center or where they need me. I learned to multitask in positions.
good,My work day is alway productive.  I have to learn to utilize my time wisely.  Like working with my manager and coworkers.  Everyone is helpful and work together.  The hardest part of my job is managing my time.  When you work with the public you time can pass you by.  Working in the Bakery you have to take cake orders and sometimes if a customer isn't sure what they want it can take a little longer than it should.  But customer always comes first so you have to take your time and work with them.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers, but as far as work compensation, they were very unfair. I worked full time hours, but I received very low paychecks. The HR department wasn't very helpful. My co workers were very nice."
good,"Hardest part about the job was dealing with different personalities, best part was meeting new people and building my skills"
good,In the morning check in trucks that has products to sell. I do this for the entire day but during slower times I do claims and reclamations. You have to be a self starter. most of the time your on your own to complete your job. Staying busy is enjoyable .
good,"Working for the number one company in retail is a challenge.  Balancing constantly changing directions from supervisors and managers while driving sales and increasing productivity.  Watching your departments grow from the lowest incoming sales to some of the highest, not only in your store or Division but in your Market is truly rewarding."
good,I feel that management listened to your problems but that's all they did was listen they never took any further action no matter how many times you complained.
good,ok place to work during high school. they do not give full hours and the pay was really low. you really can not work there and make a living without working another job. while it gives you the funds you need while you are in highschool. allowing you to have fun and spend money that is your own.
good,The work environment is fairly okay but I believe they could do better  at the location if they hire more help. Increase productivity!
good,"I loved that I learned new things everyday at WalMart! I constantly stayed busy. The hardest part of my job, was not satisfying the customer due to something being out of my control."
good,"Its a big and known company so you'll be able to have that in your credentials; but my supervisors never really cared for newbies, which made some days really difficult and uncomfortable."
good,It is a place a young professional can learn a lot about the Retail Business. The chance of learning is High. Management is very controlling.
good,"would check out customers, push carts, zone the registers, help in the service desk. Learned how to use the registers properly, cash handling, handle debit and credit card transactions as well as checks, wic, and food stamps. Great coworkers enjoyed all of them, hardest part was the slow boring days. Enjoyed my first job at Walmart"
good,"Lacked supervision and proper management.  Managers would have unprofessional relationships with subordinates.  Mandatory breaks are a plus so you dont get too overloaded with work.  I learned great customer service and how to make people walk out the door happy.  I loved communication with people, however, i disliked keeping up behind other employees that didn't care about their job."
good,"A normal day isn't very stressful, but can be depending on the day. I have learned how to bake bread, donuts, some cake design, markdown items, package bread and donuts. Management is very work based, they don't care to much for anything but work which can be rigid at times, my co-works are nice for the most part. The hardest part of my job is working in a freezer. I enjoy seeing people happy about the products we make or sell."
good,"I have learned a lot while working for the company. Since starting in 2007, I have worked in just about every area of the store. I have worked in the electronics department, wireless center, hardware department, been the pharmacy and deli department managers. They definitely allow you to move up in the company if your a hard and dedicated worker. The only problem I have really experienced with them is just always being short staffed and them expecting miracles to happen. Since working in the Deli in this store I lost numerous associates for various reasons that never got replaced."
good,"I gathered a lot of customer experience working there, and how to handle customers, and merchandise. I worked a lot of hours , and helping customers, answered phones, ran register, and put away merchandise. cleaned and stock shelves. Also worked at customer service doing returns."
good,"Good part time job, but no full time availability or benefits. It's a possible career if you're looking to work in management."
good,pay isn't great customers rude supervisors not much helpful all over dysfunctional  communication always have to need assistance though cash register why up front superiors and manager's get talkies to use.
good,80% walking the sales floor undercover apprehending shoplifters and entering their info into the stores system. Once a week I lead the store on safety issues by having a 15 min meeting to get and give feed back on things. I really gained a lot of customer service skills while at Walmart and feel I can master it anywhere due to it. Hardest part was apprehending but i soon learned ways to make it easier with time. Most enjoyable part was training new employees id have to say because I love helping.
good,Overall good place to work with a great work environment.  Typically a day for me would help manage 100 plus people and help make sure my particular zone ran well.  Very customer service oriented which is the most enjoyable and can be the hardest part of the job.
good,"A Typical Day at Work Is Very Busy But Informative, I Learned How To Pace Steadily From Different Areas Stocking Products, My Managment Was Intresting And Informative."
good,"en cuanto a la posibilidad de promocion de sector, personalmente es muy dificil ya que siempre contratan personal eventual para cubrir puestos por vacaciones, temporales dificultando el paso, situacion que he mencionado debido a que soy padre de familia y deseo crecer laboralmente."
good,"A typical day is my name being called time and time again while I'm trying to do my job even if I'm there by myself.  I'm only one person.  I can only do so much.  We are constantly running out of things.  Here lately my days have been overwhelming because we are short staffed.  I'll keep my opinions of management to myself.  My co-workers are great.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when I clock out.  True enough the people in the store are great, but things aren't going smoothly."
good,Handel all daily operations. Food Safety Certification. Great management team and great co workers. Hardest part of job was being on your feet for long periods of time. most enjoyable was part was getting to know and help customers.
good,"es un buen lugar para poder aprender pues se trabaja con muchos documentos administrativos, se conoce a gente muy agradable,"
good,The people you work with and the customers you deal with on a day to day bases they get to know you and become part of you life the are nice and once in awhile you get some that are cranky but that's all in how you influence your people.
good,"Provided customer assistance with purchasing apparel, assisted with front-end checkouts as cashier, controlled and monitored fitting room traffic, answered mainline incoming calls, and stocked, organized, and zoned merchandise throughout store."
good,"Depending on which store you work at, pay is actually not bad."
good,"restock shelves, interacted with the customers and was able to help them find what they was looking for at the time, great coworkers, learned the store"
good,"A typical day at work starts with an employee meeting lasting about 20 minutes. Then the overnight stockers might help unload the tractor trailers and separate and take the merchandise to the appropriate departments. Afterwards, the stockers fill the shelves in their departments with all of the newly arrived products then any empty areas are filled if possible with the older merchandise that is stored in a backroom. Finally all of the merchandise is neatly pulled forward on every shelf. The overnight shift is expected to work extra fast compared to the other shifts as there are fewer customers. This results in workers being timed for the fastest speed possible but there is often unfair treatment leading to higher turnovers overnight. This also leads to lower moral overnight compared to the day and evening shifts; their is a huge split between overnight management and the lower level employees like that of the rich versus the homeless class. The co-workers are similar to most minimum wage companies in that  some like the job while others do not and this is subject to a large variety of personalities.  The hardest part of the job is trying to keep pace with the expected time to finish the entire workload. This often leads to better annual raises for other shifts."
good,"My days were never the same. I worked in various departments throughout the store such as the money center, customer service, tire and lube, sporting goods, and occasionally in the back helping unload freight off of the truck. I learned a lot about people while working at walmart. I have had to deal with rude, impatient, negative, needy, but occasionally you would get pleasant customers that would make the day seem better. I learned how to make end caps that were appealing to the customers and would sell more of my items then other departments. I would also be put in charge of putting items on clearance and flipping modules when new products came in."
good,"Execução do trabalho não era muito fácil devido a falta de suporte do superior imediato, a equipe de forma geral era boa , cumpridora dos seus deveres , mas na maioria das vezes sem o devido reconhecimento por ,em algumas ocasiões, fazer além do que era obrigação."
good,"Very busy.  The first of the month was the best part.  Not a dull moment.  The associates were friendly.  The hardest part was dealing with outraged customers.  Overall nice place to work if in school, works around school schedule."
good,"A typical day at work is easy going and positive, my overall experience is developing excellent customer services skill. my manager is great she gives us task to complete ever day which me and my co-works  work well together, we always get the job done before her expected time.The hardest part of my job is lifting heavy items. Thought my day my manager and co-worker we get together and clean up our area before go home time that's the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"I did not like working here. My typical day at work would consist of working, break, work some more, lunch, work some more, break, and then work the last of your shift. I already knew what to do at my job since I have worked retail before. The management was more focused on the people they would see outside of work. Favoritism."
good,it is very fast paced. there are options to promote but difficult to do. Can be difficult at times but also could be a fun place to work. very demanding
good,"Enjoyed working with public. Learned a lot of different task in retail. Stocking of shelves, truck unloading, inventory management."
good,"Unloading fright trucks, separating grocery freight. Using pallet jacks, electric pallet jacks, walkie-stacker, and scissor lift. Stocking freight on shelves, clean up, zoning aisles, cleaning back room, making cardboard bales, taking bales outside to be recycled."
good,"My coworkers are often upbeat and happy, always glad to help or assist."
good,"Depending on the job I like to keep busy by stocking shelves, between waiting on customers."
good,My co-workers were great. Did not like the way new management did things. Didnt want to work with people. The best part of my job was working with good customers.
good,"It is a great place to start and get exposed to the workplace.  You are not tied to some office and you are ""blended in"" with the real world.  You get to work with a wide variety of people - you are in with the general public. You have lots of freedom to roam around the store; there is a lot of free will and things are rather unpredictable.  Flexibility is key."
good,"I worked for Wal-mart for 5 years. During my time with the company, I promoted from a part-time dry grocery associate to a Zone Merchandiser and again to an Assistant Manager. The pay was decent, though that was never a reason for me to promote. I liked my job, the job itself was great. I went from stocking shelves, to actually bringing products into the store, to setting up displays and actually making a difference in my store. This of course changed based on the management team above me. Training for management is horrible. I spent four weeks in a hotel to learn how to talk to people. The classes did little to brace you for the ""real world"" and taught you a lot about how to ""speak"" to protect the company image. Of course if you did not work prior for the company, you were shipped off with no actually knowledge about how a store works. This lead to a lot of issues within the store between managers that were not willing to learn due to their ""past experience"" to managers that would not train. The environment breeds a dog eat dog so to speak, you either learn to brown nose or you are an outcast because you do not fit in. The hardest part of the job was not the customers, as rude as they could be, or associates. The hardest part was dealing with other adults that talked about people behind their backs and later twisted converstations to fit their needs. The most enjoyable part was my associates. I worked with a great group of people that were willing and eager to serve their customers. Not to mention the 401K, they match up to 6%, insurance and stock options, if you meet hour"
good,"Pra uma primeira experiencia de trabalho ela e bom,mais pra tentar progresso e um pouco dificil,ja que os tempos pra ser promovido leva muito tempo e os horarios pra tentar estudar o continuar uma faculdade e bem pouca.."
good,A typical day at work began with knowing what the problem was that day weather management didnt order bags to our customer theft rate. I learned more about how to handle hard situations more then I did about the job. Management is very miss leading and will lie to get the most out of their employees. The hardest part sometimes was angry customers. The most enjoyable part were happy smiling regulars that loved how fast i could get them checked out.
good,"While working at Wal- Mart Distribution, I was able to load and unload tractor trailer for shipment. The hardest part of the job was working in a heated environment. Staying hydrated was the key to that issue. It was fun learning the quickest and easiest way to load trailers."
good,I had great days at work as well as terrible days. Worked with some wonderful people and met some great friends. Loved the fact of working sporting goods as i am and outdoorsmen but management was not always the best. They did not always believe what you had to say or would not always take the time to listen.
good,You basically have to do everything and get very little training. I enjoyed my time working there but was glad to move on to greater things. Lots of drama.
good,"Lots to keep you busy as long as you WANT to do so. Mgmt team made up of wannabes who play the game and hang with the right crowd no matter what their background or training is. Many unqualified and untrained individuals who don't listen to those who have years of experience to offer. If you just want to go, hang, make some extra cash, then this is the place to do it."
good,"This was a great first job that gave me the starter skills that I needed to advance my career. I learned a great deal of customer service skills, which I feel are very important. I started as a cashier, but was very eager to expand my skills and learn new things; I advanced to the customer service desk, layaway, fabrics and crafts, and the lawn and garden department. I worked at this job for a little over 4 years; I found it did take a long time to achieve seniority to get any of the good shifts or better pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and learning new skills."
good,"Walmart was a lot better company when i first started for them 16 years ago.Walmart used to give you merit raises and after 90 days now its nothing. They use to care about the associates. management has changed alot. Managers actually use to talk to you like a human being but know its threats and talking down to you, in 16 years never seen anything like it. Ive never really had issues with my co workers, the best part is working with friendly nice people."
good,"A typical day at work sees me putting out the necessary stock to fill empty spots, checking products for any defects, stocking products neatly in their specific areas both on sales floor and backroom, maintaining a clean environment for all. I've learn to work in a multi-racial environment adapting to everybody own personalities to better accommodate customers' needs. My co-workers are fun to be around and are helpful in situations that i might have difficulty with. The most enjoyable part of the job is to fill the customers' satisfaction, making sure they were provided the best service."
good,Kept department neat and tidy. Be on time is what I learned. Working as a team to get the job done. Helping people decide on what to get that looked good was the best part of the job. Hardest part was getting paid every two weeks and it was gone before you got it.
good,"i am management, I deal with customer complaints, closing, opening of the store, meetings and merchandise availability, cash handling."
good,You work very hard for little pay and have to work many different shifts. possible to learn mant different skills. Need to raise the pay for workers with previous experience.
good,This job was different day to day especially around Christmas when we were at our busiest and people were put where the store needed the help. Some cashiers were put outside on cart collecting if there was a need for them. You never knew whether you'd be late going home one day or early. Each day was a new day. A lot of people complained about the lack of open registers. Management was there to help and were friendly to their associates. It was a friendly atmosphere for both the customers and employees.
good,"MY typical day working at Wal mart is first of all walk in ,get clocked in and look at the isles and then get with my department manager.  Get my instructions and it is usually go get a rocket card full of items to stock the shelves, and just when I start getting in the groove my zone manager will come up to me and change things on me. It will change at least 30 times a day and that's why things never get done my poor customers get so frustrated and I feel for them. There is poor lack of communication between management what is that old saying oh yea to many chiefs and not enough Indians. My co workers are awesome in my eyes but they to are looking else where for jobs. The hardest part of the job is not being able to finish one task before going to the next. The enjoyable part of my job is trying to put smiles on my customers faces that part makes me happy."
good,"I just worked for the holidays, never worked so hard for so little, everyone there was very nice it would be a nice place to work if the pay was a little better. The hardest part was just standing on your feet all day they were good about seeing that you went on break."
good,"Walmart has a reputation for treating  employees badly, but it is not bad at all it's like any other retail job. Demanding during the holidays, but sort of laid back the rest of the year. "
good,"Pick up returns, take them back to department, put them away.  Customer Service, complete any unfinished task from earlier and answer phones, Sale merchandise and pick up items for on line orders, keep area clean and safe.  Repeat every two hours until shift is ends."
good,"I work in stock, which is a warehouse style position, you're payed as much as the door greater and everyone else. 11.55$/h due to evening bonus."
good,A typical for myself would start by either being on register from the time I came in until I went home or by taking care of notes left by management of things to be done for the department. I learned how to use some heavy machinery such as a pallet stacker. Management for the most part weren't to bad but the higher up the food chain you went the less personable they became and were harder to talk to then department heads. I liked a lot of the co-workers I had. They were for the most part very nice people. Managements lack of clarity in direction and communication amongst themselves. The most enjoyable had to be some of the customers and also some of the co-workers.
good,"You follow your set of tasks that you are given. The co-workers are pretty easy to work with. If you stick to yourself and complete your tasks on time and successfully, you should be OK. The management is terrible. They only look out for themselves and you cannot go to them with any questions or concerns for it will be to no avail. The hours and pay are nice, which lessens the effect of the cons of working there. The are pretty flexible with the scheduling if you are a promising worker or if they like you. They give you two 15-minute breaks and a one hour lunch. On the night shift there no more than two assistant mangers there on any given night. Which is good, so that you are not given two conflicting tasks to do. On most nights, everyone works together to get all of the work finished. The most enjoyable part was being able to do your job without getting bothered constantly. The hardest part was to keep up with the times when they weren't always correct since management were 'positive' there was no mistake in the timing you were given. You could have three pallets of freight to work and you could be given thirty minutes to complete it. On average, depending on what department you are in, a pallet could take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour if you were a decent worker. I learned that, in the end, teamwork is what matters on a job like this. All of the workers need to have great communication and put in an effort to have the best teamwork. That is the most sure way of getting the job done and accurately."
good,"Good place to work while balancing work and school, Sucks you have to work holidays such as thanksgiving but store is closed in my town on christmas"
good,I worked here for 3 years and it was a good experience. A typical day for me consisted of taking care of the video game aisle and it was a job I enjoyed because I got to talk video games which is a hobby of mine I enjoy. This was also the most enjoyable part of the job. A big thing I take away from this job is time management. My skills in this area are good but I believe there is always room for improvement in anything you do.
good,"I performed automotive maintenance at Wal-Mart. After over 3 years I learned that a career can be made at Wal-Mart, but it's not for everyone. The management would try to work with you but had their hands tied in many situations due to company policy. The co-workers were great people. Hardest part about the job was the compensation. After college I found myself struggling to keep up with bills and I was in the top 50% of hourly employees on the pay scale. Most enjoyable part was getting to work with my hands."
good,"Walmart have some awesome people working for it,"
good,I communicate with various customers make sure that they are always satisfied. I learn something new every day about my position such as working on a register. Every day I try to make sure my shift I satisfy every customer that I interacted with/
good,ive worked for Walmart for 18.5 years . Since i moved to Belleville the store is so different no chance for advancement favoritism etc . Walmart isnt for me anymore this store has made me feel this way.
good,"Sales Associate/Cashier"
good,"I worked overnight."
good,I personally enjoyed working at walmart for a short while they where somewhat laid back and they appreciated their associates that is cashier to cashier and csm's. You needed to deal with many issues and problems without the assistance of others even though this job was considered a team job. your co-workers up front were always very helpful and nice and they were never rude but management was more rude and at times they could care less.
good,"It is all about the customers to me, knowing that you can not please everyone but it is always my attempt to try my best, I learned at Walmart that no matter the situation one must hold your head high and simply smile."
good,It wasn't bad working there most of the co-workers were enjoyable but most of them acted like they were in high school spreading rumors and talking behind each others back. the store managers weren't bad but the department managers only liked the people who browned nose them so they never liked me. the only enjoyable part of the job was the few co-workers that actually tried to be firendly to everyone.
good,"A typical day at work includes a lot of different duties. We have to make sure floor is fully stocked and faced, while assisting customers. Also, we in the electronics department are in charge of stationary, and the photo lab, as well as site to store pick ups."
good,Management was not working as a team. Associates were overworked on a daily basis. Unrealistic goals set by management.
good,"Walmart was in all a nice, fun and entertaining place to work but also very stressful at times my co workers were okay but we could have used better managers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very rude customers. The most enjoyable part was learning new things and people and knowing that i helped customers want to shop there again and again."
good,I worked in the Wireless Center and enjoyed assisting customers with their cellphone needs. I was able to learn a lot not only in the Wireless Center but I also helped in the Photo Lab and Electronics. The pay could have been a lot better and benefits offered. I really enjoyed who I worked with at this company.
good,"work wasn't work, i worked with some great people who would come together as a team to get the tasks done for that night."
good,I would stock 20 - 30 pallets a night. I would take back all the overstock. i would do cardboard bales. i would also bin in product.
good,"Fast paced, constantly changing, and did anything to create a sale. Management was outstanding a made every effort to make sure their employees were taken care of. Being a sales associate during the holidays was the most stressful part of the job, but afforded me patience and the ability to think on my feet."
good,Overall a great company to work for but with the exception of the demanding hours.
good,"*days backwards u sleep during day n work at night. go in to work have meeting.then followd by down stacking pallets,then stocking , next benning"
good,Worked on the register as well as with customers. learned how to process checks both personal and work.
good,"Unload trucks of merchandise."
good,"It was a nice productive,positive environment to work in. Everyone always ready to work, everyone always maintained a positive attitude."
good,"It is hard to work for Wal-Mart. Not because the job is complicated, but because the work is strenuous, inefficient, and desperately needs updating and reformulating. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, and the people that I worked with, it just didn't fit with my family."
good,I would sell guns and knives to people as well as hunting and fishing licences. I would check people out and help them find what they needed. I learned from this company that teamwork does make the dreamwork. Its so much easier to work together. Management was pretty good depending on which one you was dealing with. I loved my co-workers they always helped each other no matter if it was their section of the store or not. I loved being able to be around the guns all day and the regular customers that i got to see.
good,"Merchandising, managing up to 200 associates, ordering, profit and loss statements, shrink provisions, internal theft, theft prevention, customer service, human resources, invoicing, cash office procedures."
good,"I had a stroke from the stress working long hours in the Jewelry dept. My doctor said if I wanted to live to not return to the job it would kill me next time."
good,its a nice place to work because of the friends you can make helping costumer's find what they need and also make friends with the shoper.
good,The hardestpart of this job was getting managemebt to help you in a certain situation like if you need their approval on a purchase. The managers there were no where to be found when you needed them and they would come after the like 10 minutes and the customer is irrated by by then for having to wait so long to speak with management.
good,"Volume Based work with daily production requirements, depending on shift your suppose to work 10 to 12 hour days"
good,"not a real bad place to work, I just don't think it's a long term job for me"
good,"Typical day at work consists of receiving inventory, entering it in the system, sorting to departments, stocking, binning over stock and picking items that can be placed out of the floor. Sometimes requires visual merchandising. Always requires quality control."
good,"Have a 15 to 30 minute team meeting then go into dairy cooler to work pick's. After working and binning remaining picks start of new freight. After new freight has been worked bin remaining freight. Clean in trash that might be left remove empty pallets, make sure everything is stocked, organized and presentable for customers and next shift. Very independent yet co-dependent job."
good,"nice people,could pay better,lack of communication skills"
good,"Going to work at 7.00 am to do modulars and stock shelves. Each day was a challenge because the modulars would totally flip around. We always worked as ateam. If needed some members of management would assist us.The associates were friendly for the most part and helpful. I would say doing a modular reset was the hardest pat of the job. We would have to sit down and estimate how long it would take to complete, as welltry to find the materials needed to complete the job. All in all I really liked the good morning meetting management always kept us well informed."
good,"I started out as a pharmacy cashier and got promoted to a pharmacy technician after I left my position for another job. They are always hiring new people, young and old. They give bonuses quarterly and that was always nice."
good,"Starting out at Walmart wasn't too bad. However, after being there for a while, you realize that they are overstaffed. The hours are terrible compared to anywhere else. You might get lucky a week and get 30+ hours, and then the next week you will have 10 hours. Completely inconsistent and that makes it very hard to make a living."
good,A typical day of work would be handling all the needs of the customers who would come through my line. I learned as well the daily routines of the customer service department as well as the Money order department and the fabric and crafts department. I liked the management for the most part. My boss was very nice and understanding. The hardest part of my job was tough to deal with customers. The  most enjoyable part of my job was the hours and security.
good,"Management is always changing, typical 6-8 work hours. Fast-paced."
good,I began working for Walmart as a grocery stocker. My hours were from 10:00 pm until 7:00 am.  For 2 years I kept this schedule 5 days a week.  Due to my wife's health I requested a transfer to the Automotive department where I was able to work 8:00am to 5:00 pm.  The reason I quit Walmart was management was required to reduce employees hours and placed me on 3-4 days a week for only 4 hours a day.  These hours were difficult to have a life other than Walmart.
good,"I have only been here a short time,so far the experience has had some ups and downs but overall has been good. Some coworkers are more helpful than others,and I have only encountered a few of the managers."
good,"Full time where available."
good,Walmart provided me with many shifts and a decent pay wage. I assisted many customers and working there helped me better my multi tasking skills. I worked in cash and sales on a daily basis. The hardest part about this job was the low amount of employees and the best part about this job was the constant movement and always having something to do.
good,A typical day was storing product in the warehouse and the co-workers were wonderful. I loved the management and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move around.
good,Great place to work.  Long hours.  Short Breaks.  The most enjoyable part is training and motivating technicians.
good,"Empresa com oportunidade de crescimento dentro do brasil, uma grande rotatividade dos colaboradores."
good,It was a decent job.to have. Some managers were great to work with. Advancement opportunities were available
good,"stock shelves all over the store"
good,"Typical day involved clocking in, finding a manager to get my keys and see what needs to get done. Follow work flow procedures and assist customers."
good,"fold tables and arrange racks of clothing in the apparel areas: mens, womens, boys, girls, and infants, also help in the fitting room as needed."
good,"I'm usually told what needs to be worked and I work it. Most of the time I stock the shelves with merchandise. Greet customers and help them with their needs. Check if there is products in the backroom for customers, if it's not on the shelf. Direct customers to the products they are looking for."
good,"great place to work co-workers are nice,good management learn how to rotate products."
good,"The job kept me busy. I did stocking , helping customers. Cleaned up messes, some cashier experience. Inventory on broken and returned items. All this is on my resume."
good,processed freight at a rapid rate I learned how to very productive and to be aware of my surroudings
good,Working with customers all day can be both exciting and frustrating all the same. It is very good experience in learning how to deal with different clientele. Depending on full or part time hours range from 4 to 8 hours with some over time during holidays. They have great benefits if you make use of them.
good,My schedule was always very random so I never knew when I was coming in or not. The supervisors were helpful and friendly and most of the customers were very nice to me. I learned how to use a cash register and how to bag items. I didn't talk to a lot of my co-workers as a lot of them were older than me. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting away from the cash register and reshelving items because it allowed me to stretch my legs. I just didn't see myself going anywhere within the company and I wanted to focus on my schooling but it was hard with the schedule that I had.
good,"My time spent at Walmart can only be deemed average. The work itself is pretty good. I help customers with their problems in the electronics department as well as use the cash registers to make any sales. The aforementioned issues arise with the staff. While there are some good co-workers, there also quite a lot of staff that I personally had problems with. The people I usually end up working with do not tend to do their jobs and instead focus on slacking off most of their shifts; causing me to have to do most of the work making it very hard for the work to be likable in any way. Upper management of the workplace is fairly good. However, they always seem to be busy due to lack of staff in other departments, thus making it harder for us to contact them. The hardest part of the job would be the amount of customers during the day. At most, my department would only get 2 people at a time, with one usually getting called to another department to help out. Having only one person in the department when there are customers left and right is very difficult to manage causing the customers to eventually get frustrated. The most enjoyable parts of the job would be the co-workers from other departments. I find it always enjoyable to converse with other co-workers during break times. The very flexible work hours also work well with my school schedule."
good,"Overall the job environment was good, but hours would be cut because more staff would be hired."
good,It start off as a good job and later on it got hard  for me to do the work that they was asking me to do. Other than that it was a good job.
good,"Typical day involved cashiering for an extended period of time."
good,Some management treated employees horribly. Some managers didn't know which department they worked for and tried to throw their weight around. It was hard to get anything done when you had to stop all the time to zone other departments.
good,"Good company to gain work experience. Many opportunities for advancement.I learned quite a bit about retail, inventory management, human resource management. Co-workers create a family environment. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet goals and objectives without necessary resources to be successful (proper staffing). Most enjoyable part of the job interacting with customers and co-workers."
good,Can be a fun place to work most people are easy to get along with. I have learned many things that are useful to me everyday in and outside of work. The hardest part is the scheduling at times. I enjoy working in the various areas of the store. there are not many areas of the store that I have not worked because of my background of learning things quick.
good,The Frozen/Dairy Associate is responsible for rotating and stocking all frozen and refrigerated items and tossing out items that are close to being expired; 75% of the time at work is spent inside of a freezer or refrigerated area. I learned how to use a pallet jack. Management is helpful and understanding and will work with your schedule. Coworkers were very nice and I became friends with several of them outside of work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frozen fingers and toes; my fingers and toes would often throb from being too cold for too long. The most enjoyable part of the job was anything team work related.
good,"Work throughout the day, stock shelves, preform counts on items, rearrange many times, organize and zone areas. Very team oriented. Hardest part is the pay and schedule of many of the positions."
good,nice place to work. helpful. always willing to lend a helping hand
good,"I really liked my job, however it was only a temp, I was told I could not be hired as full or part time."
good,"I needed a supplemental job while I was attending college. I worked in the clothing department. I attended the fitting rooms, displayed merchandise, processed returns, and answered the phones."
good,I love the people and I love the experience of it being my first job.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would start with a walk around the apparel department to make sure the clothes are off the floor and off of the top of the racks. "
good,"Working at Walmart can be hectic at times, especially during the holiday seasons.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers who felt like my family.  Management could be a little overwhelming at times, but that's to be expected."
good,"Wal Mart es una empresa en la aprendes de todas las áreas tanto administrativas,  operativas, recursos humanos. "
good,The staff was always friendly. The pay just did not match the work being done.
good,"typical day at work would be in the back room stocking,"
good,"steady employment, work well with co workers and supervisors"
good,"Ive worked for walmart off and on and management does not treat there sales associates or anyone not in management with any kinda of respect and if your kid is sick they don't care as long as your at your job and their potions are covered, im looking for a new job and hopefully never have to work for walmart again."
good,"In the beginning of my career at Walmart  things were totally different then they ended.  When I came to work I would clock in and go to the nightly meeting in the break room.  We would always end to meeting with the Walmart cheer.  I would then go to the task management system to find my assignment for the night.  If the merchandise was unloaded form the truck and pulled to floor I would then begin to work. If this was not the case I would walk my area and put out any buggies of merchandise and zone.  Some nights I was assigned to work in the backroom pulling inventory from the bends to go to sales floor. I liked being in the backroom, less mangers to deal with but the bends were never organized the way they should have been. When I first started inventorying merchandise it was easy. The people I worked with kept it clean and organized then the mangers started adding their two cents and telling me wrong when I know I was doing right. I soon start to not like it.  When I first started at Walmart I had one place to go and one job to do when I got to work. It was always the same. Then three years before I left everything changed. I didn't know where I was working in each night until I got there.  If I was put in an area I was unfamiliar with I was expected to finish in the set amount of time the mangers had on their sheets or in the task management system.  It was not a good place to be with people looking over your shoulder to every five minutes. On top of all that I would have more then one area to do in a night.  Some nights I would have 9 hours of work to do and I am only"
good,"As soon as I arrived at work i'd begin cleaning my station. I'd day hello to my fellow coworkers and ask my supervisors if there is anything I can do for them. Management was very kind to me and always seemed interested in making me feel welcome. I think the hardest part of the job had be when work slowed down, I'd run out of tasks to do. The most enjoyable were the friendly customers."
good,"You come in to work,sign into your task. Start unloading merchandise,putting it up, Zoning as you go. The managers are disrespectful. The co workers and very helpful,their is really nothing hard about the job once you know what you're doing. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping the customers."
good,"Nice place to work, but very loud and hard to concentrate.  the workspace is just a cubicle and there is no privacy."
good,"Amo trabalhar e amo aprender sempre mais . Aprendi que o ser humano é difícil de lidar , porem com o nosso jeitinho brasileiro sempre damos um jeito de conquistar nossos clientes. A hierarquia sempre bem tratada e os colegas sempre relevar seus impulsos. A parte mais dificil é quando o dia acaba e vc tem que ir pra casa , sabendo que poderia ficar mais um pouquinho.A parte mais agradavel é saber que minhas contas e meus gastos serão pagos pois eu sou uma trabalhadora."
good,"This company never is a slow or dual moment. the guest , customers , and employees are all enjoying during the time of work and also during regular shopping."
good,Spent most days changing oil and tires. Learned a lot more about vehicles than I had before. Had some good times with coworkers and the supervisors and managers were pretty decent. I loved working on the vehicles but hated having to deal with the customers.
good,I liked working there. I just didn't get paid enough. I was also going through a bad time.
good,A lot of friendly people both associates and customers. good benefits for full time associates. Plenty of tasks with a variety of areas.
good,"Day began with typical maintenance, turned on T.V's, dusted shelves and made sure merchandise is neat and accessible. "
good,WalMart has room for growth and is one of the number one companies in the world.
good,"Inconsistent management, Great Co workers. Nothing was to hard in reference to the job. I learned how to interact with customers."
good,Wal-Mart has the money to raise employees pay yet has not did so.
good,"nice place to work, people seem friendly and easy going, break time is nice as well"
good,"Actually was/is a pretty decent place to work. I had never worked in the grocery field before, this was a first for me. I have learned a lot about fruits and veggies that I never knew before."
good,"A day at Walmart basically included checking out customers and making sure they found everything they needed. I learned about customer satisfaction. The management was great at Walmart they were always there if you needed anything. I cant say i got to know many of my co workers being the store is always so busy, but the people i got to know were great. The hardest part of working at Walmart would be standing during your entire shift which really wasn't all that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers and making sure they left the store satisfied."
good,It was ok working at Wal Mart. I like the people i worked with. But i could not get by with just the pay of Wal Mart. I loved my breaks and co-workers
good,"During my time working for Walmart, I have worked in multiple departments. Every department I worked in gave me more experience of the retail industry such as cashier, stock management, ordering, customer relations and how management works in a large business such as Walmart. I enjoyed working with my co-workers at flexible hours that suited my needs."
good,When I worked at Walmart it was fun to work there in the beginning.  Then my boss ended up getting very relentless to try to get back at me because I told the manager of the store that the other technicians were being helped by the interns to pass there tests on the computer to pass them.  This was very wrong as they were filling prescriptions for people and I was certified and they were using my initials to fill prescriptions.  I wasn't going to risk losing my license or my certification for anyone so I went to management.  I ended up getting what they call black balled but the technicians did have to take their own test.
good,"A fast pace environment that keeps you on your toes and moving from one corner to the next. You get cross train in other department to help out when needed and when inventory rolls around. Management is always changing, it seems Walmart changes its management team every 6 months. Co-workers are family, we help each other out and keep each other happy and with a smile on our face. We will always lend a hand to help to keep everything up-to-date and on the sales floor. The hardest part of the job is not enough workers, we do our best to fill the gap to keep customers happy. The enjoyable part of the job is to work with awesome co-workers, as we treat each others as family, its what makes us go to work each day."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the patients. A typical day included cleaning and stocking frames, and helping patients choose their eyewear. I also pre-screened patients and taught them how to insert and remove contact lenses. I also filed patient charts and did some insurance."
good,A typical day for me is waking up and being at work at 5 am and beginning the day balancing the room and putting the money from the register bags into the computer. I only work 4 hours in the morning so after we complete this I have to get the bags ready for the next day and bundle the money. we then get the deposit ready and put it in the bags for management to recount. If i still have time i help break down money into straps. I love working with the two girls that i work with. We get along very well. The hardest part of the job is just making sure that the money matches what the computer says otherwise you have to recount and find the mistake. The most enjoyable part is getting to do the job i wanted from the start.
good,"everyday is different"
good,"I liked working at Wal - Mart .  While I was there I worked like a man which wasn't  a problem if I had gotten paid like the men.  Huge pay disparity for women in management other than that I had no problem but the Wal-Mart then is not the Wal-Mart of today.  The company actually cared about their people.  I have been to the Walton home twice.  I had met Sam Walton and Bud.  They believed in listening to their people.  I don't work there now but I am told it is not like that anymore."
good,"Walmart is extremely corporate and for a person that is extremely relationship oriented, that can be difficult to adjust to. However, it also gives the employee to be very specific with their hours and that is very beneficial."
good,"I worked in the deli section of Wal-Mart my duties included excellent customer service, quality control on hot and cold food products as well as maintaining a clean work atmosphere. An overall organized facility, sufficient management and dependable co workers. The only difficult tasks at my job were the closing expectations when placed with a one man closing team."
good,Work normally goes well but I learned that people get taken for granted a lot there. CSM's are often yelled at by customers and cashiers or mangers alike. People need for training on some of the more difficult registers.
good,"There are three shifts for managers opening, closing, and overnight; I have worked all three.  Overnight is basically to learn the store, freight flow, merchandise placement, and soft core people skills.  The two day shifts have more customer and associate interaction.  During my time with the company I learned financials, budgeting, people skills, and enhanced customer communication. A typical day includes preparing deposits, holding meetings, covering reviews, covering job performance coaching's, scheduling, interviewing, hiring, and training.  The hardest part of the job was to ensure proper training of associates, many times new tasks were created and took priority over training, so delegations and follow up became very important.  The people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job.  It was very much like an extended family."
good,there where at a lot of mixed feeling about this place. but I loved work with the people I was able to work with.
good,Wal-Mart est une entreprises qui s'intéresse au développement professionnel de ses employés et leur pousse avec formation et facilité d'horaires de travail.
good,Everyone is nice and friendly always willing to help new people out when they are in over their heads.
good,"Get to know people, and help them. Stressful, but worth it. Leaned a lot about team work."
good,"Walmart provided a fixed schedule, the typical day at work consisted of heavy lifting, placing merchandise and working in the backstore/warehouse. I learnt a lot from this job on how to work in a warehouse and how to treat merchandise. For the most part, most of the co-workers were very nice and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was working overnight and doing a lot of heavy lifting, which is mentally and physically tiring. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the store nice and organised by the end of the night so that the customers could enjoy an enjoyable shopping experience."
good,"A typical work day entails down stacking loads off of pallets from the walk in freezer and cooler. Ensuring that the sales floor is stocked, clean, and properly zoned. Provide customer assistance at the deli counter from both the slicing and hot holding sides. "
good,"smart workers, good wage scale, good safety awards, management move around too much"
good,"Wal-Mart has the tendency to be a great company, but what with the rate they are bringing in younger people and getting rid of the older people, by any means necessary, it shows no mercy.  They really have some great people working in their company, young and of age alike.  I am just being honest as this is the way that I was raised.  When asked a question, to be honest.  "
good,A day working at walmart can be fun because of your co-workers and customers but stressful at the same time because at times management do not show that they appreciate your work. I worked at the same location for two years and maybe three times have i heard good job and thank you. i enjoyed meeting new people and making people laugh.overall management was not that good to me.
good,"A typical day for me at Walmart would include, checking my wireless cell phone log, following tasks assigned to me by my department manager, and helping fellow associates with their tasks. I learned many things working in the wireless department, but the most important to me is patience. My job is to help a customer pick a cell phone provider, find a phone and phone plan that meets their budget, and activating it. The most challenging aspect is the activating process. We use a kiosk that doesn't always agree with you, but with a little patience, the customer always left satisfied. During some shifts we can be short staffed around the store which can cause some stress, but this I enjoyed. I learned my limits and cannot wait to see what other obstacles I can over come."
good,working at Walmart taught me some valuable skills but once you've learned what you can i found it is actually hard to do much else within the company.
good,"I worked at Applebee's full-time a couple of years "
good,"I used to work overnight, i learned  a lot of things such as how to work as a team and always put the customers first in everything. There was nothing hard about it. the most enjoyable part about it was that when we worked as a team and get things done as a team."
good,this is overall a good job to have but i think the management can be better when it comes to how they treat there employees all the time there needs to be more respect for the employees.
good,"With hardwork,  reliabilty, and patience, you can grow in the company and get pretty good benefits"
good,"A typical day at work was productive "
good,"Day to Day with this company there is always excitement, some of your co-workers can be the greatest people you come across."
good,Well was real crazy about the job but i really love working with people. I'm a real people person. The pay wasn't that great but the job was fun. The management was only okay but the co-workers was great and I think thats important part of a job is having great people to work with. Hardest part of the job was pulling freight and getting up and down stocking shelves. I would have to say i liked the job because I like my co workers and working with people.
good,Unloading and receiving trucks.   processing them and stocking them.  worked Directly with management and was involved in many aspects of the store.
good,Directly over all Aspects of the store.  Knowing P@L's  Managed 200 plus associates
good,nice place do teenage to start off in the work place must have great customer servic and patience
good,I loved this job. The pay was great and the people was nice. You advance quickly.
good,"kept work area clean, helped customers and other associates, printed pictures"
good,"I was able to easily learn all that was required of me through the online resources page, very helpful!"
good,"Coworkers are friendly and fun to work with."
good,Not enough staff and too much work on each associate sums it up. They always cut hours but give you more to do and not enough time to do it.
good,"Organizing and Cleaning the whole store as Maintenance Associate."
good,"Most of the time, I never knew how a day would turn out coming into this job. It would always either be a bad day or a good one. It wasn't a perfect place to work in but I did learn quite a lot from this company. I learned how to come out of my shell and be more social with customers and co-workers. I learned how to handle stressful situations such as long lines and what seems like a million different customers coming to you for answers because you're the only one in charge.I met a lot of new and cool people in some of my co-workers and no matter if they left, it always seem like new hires would always be as friendly as the ones before them. Most of them were co-workers you could depend on and have a fun time with while still doing your job. The hardest part would most likely be the under appreciation from some of management. Now the most enjoyable part would have to be the fun I managed to have with some co-workers while working because that is what kept me going at this job, knowing that the good days would be fun to go through."
good,"Wal Mart is a great company its just that the core values have not continued.  Family is not important to them its all about the bottom dollar. I love the people that I work one on one with, there are so many good people that are older and have dedicated their life to wal mart that are going to sustain the hard ship.  Managment is not at all supportive of their employees,  they are so close minded that no matter what the customer is right and we get treated like trash by the customers.  The hardest part of my job is when a customer treats one of the people I suporvise like trash and walks all over them!"
good,I enjoyed working for walmart because I enjoy helping people . when an elderly person was creeping up the parking lot with a cast or crutches it made me feel good to bring an electric cart out to them . I also liked helping people find something they were looking for . my job duties were to push in carts from the outside parking lot and when someone needed a carryout . I was also responsible for cleaning the restrooms and the isles of the store . my favorite part of the job was showing good quality customer service
good,"Decent job to start off.  Doesn't acknowledge great workers.  Pay isn't much.  Registers would be down or debit machine doesn't work.  Don't like the way customers always right, even when their wrong."
good,A typical day would include keeping work area clean and assisting customers in finding merchandise
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for a total of 14 years all together and I loved what I did and what the company stood for, I chose to leave so that I could be a active parent in my kids life."
good,"This is somewhere to work if you need money. It isn't great, but again it isn't the end of the world to work there. If you can get in good with people there it's fine, but like any main stream retail store there are going to be things that Erk you."
good,"the work days was long, you really didn't know what your work would consist of it changed from day to day. I did learn a lot From this company. my co workers were like my family. the hardest part of the job was customers. The most enjoyable part was once the day was over you got to see your accomplishments."
good,"Stocking,binning and occasionally binning.I learn just basic retail ,marketing and great customer service.They had no communication within the management team.I love my coworkers like family cause thats what they were. No hard parts of my job cause i was the best at it. I enjoyed providing great customer service and making sure the customers left with a smile and the product."
good,Very busy pharmacy with lots to do.  Never needed to be told what to do because there is always work
good,"I actually loved my customers and Wal-mart store environment. A typical day is working on the frontline of the store. I worked directly with my cashiers hands on, and customers all day. I conducted all cashiers breaks and lunches and had to balance a cash podium balance at 2000.00 dollars everyday. I also conducted at least five or more register audits daily. I gave cashier evaluation weekly of there job performance and meeting corporate quota with items scanned per hour. I loved my cashiers, and my interactions with all my customers."
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Management is okay. Co-workers are kind, unfortunately dishes are not."
good,"My day would start with me counting my drawer, making sure I have all the necessary  tools to get me through my day. For instance receipt tape and  bags."
good,"as management you really can be one, everything you do is micro-managed"
good,Wal-mart Money Center is an ideal job for a college student part-time job.
good,"Customer service management is fast-paced and required the immediate yet effective decision making skills. A CSM will to stretch little time for time consuming tasks, being sure to delight the customer while doing so. This is not my first management experience but all the while, I have learned more about myself as a leader. Other circumstances that I've never experienced before have come up and those instances have inadvertently applied growth to my management style and person. Teamwork should exist in all accounts of daily work space, the challenge is to create cohesion among employees and ultimately meet progress. I enjoy, enjoying my co-workers. After all, they are part of the team. Interacting with my co-workers, is the most favorable part of my job. The hardest part of my job is keeping all parties content: Customers, Service Desk, Cashiers, Zone Managers, Co-Managers, and the store manager, all meet at the Customer Service Manager. The majority of immediate problems must be resolved by the CSM."
good,"The schedules are all over the place so you can never plan anything. You might work in the morning one day and late into the night the next.  The work itself is ok, the other workers are friendly. most of the management dose not do there job making it hard for you to do your job."
good,"Al llegar a la empresa se tiene que checar tú llegada con el gafette y de ahí pasar a tu respectivo departamento. Ya estando ahí, se verifica la mercancía que llega y se compara que estén correctas las cantidades con las marcadas en las facturas. Durante el día se revisan las temperaturas y humedad tanto ambiental como la de los medicamentos refrigerados. Dos veces por semana se hace limpieza de anaqueles y una vez al mes se hace revisión de caducidades. La venta de medicamento es diaria al igual que el pedido del mismo para mantener el stock mínimo. Cada mes se hace inventario general del departamento."
good,Typical day involves meeting all kinds of nice people with very few grumpy customers.  Good relationships with co-workers and management.  Usually quite busy which makes the day go by quickly.  Hardest part of job is listening to little kids scream or make lots of noise.  Most enjoyable part of job is meeting so many nice people.
good,"A typical day at my Walmart for me was a very busy and stressful day, I have a tedious workload and was required to do tasks not related to my job title which I didn't mind doing because it was a learning experience but was also at the same time was still held responsible for managing the front end when I wasn't even on it. I was with the company almost 11 years and learned a lot in my time there the store managers saw a lot of potential in me and had me cross train in several different areas as well as manage different areas The hardest part was the lack of higher management and having to put myself in their place for customers and communicating their decisions to the customer, but again it was a learning experience. the most enjoyable part is the people you work with and getting to know them and seeing the ones you hire making it though their 1st year."
good,"Typically a day at work would involve going in with a set idea of what needed to be done that way to better devolp my areas. About half the time upper managment would give notes preventing my ability to what I set out to do, but it was always for the greater good of the store. I learned a great deal at Walmart, mostly that is essential to be adaptable and be willing to do different things. I loved the people I worked with. The majority of the managment team were great at what they did and were enjoyable to work with and for. My peers were a team, when they needed help we helped them, when I really needed help, they helped me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment when what I needed to get done was complete."
good,"I love this job, I loved the customer and getting to know them. You can learn a lot about people through ther purchases, its also some what of a educational postion, customer will advise you of how to's  what to's and what not to do's. They can brighten up your day in a second  and all it takes is one smile for you to feel warm. the actuasl company was not bad itself either. i dont think as a cashier all the lifting we have to do the compensation was not worth it.. its back breaking work to do hours on in, especially when you dont have the support. but overall i really liked that job."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart you always learn something different and meet different people. It was very fast pace and challenging at times. I learned how to stock merchandise in groceries, toy department, and HBA. I learn  how to locate my merchandise as well as relocate products that didn't belong in my department. I also learned how to pull my department pallet for my own department and properly dispose of the boxes. Management was a little poor it took a great amount of time to put me in the system. I have to find my manager numerous of times to either clock in or clock out. My co-workers were very gracious,helpful,and understanding. They taught me the pros and cons of stocking the products and how to manage my work in a timely matter . The hardest part of my job was trying locate items i wasn't familiar with, with out the scanner.The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to locate all my products, finish my task in time,and able to assist other employers and customers."
good,"- Low pay structure"
good,"Clock in at 4 p.m., go to the receiving area and unload trucks.  I learned how to unload a truck and organize the merchandise on pallets according to department number.  The management was okay and my co-workers made it enjoyable to go to work every day.  The hardest part of the job was pulling the merchandise to the sales floor and the most enjoyable part was the freedom to talk to my co-workers without worry of who would hear it."
good,the management was okay. they weren't really as helpful as they could have been. very unorganized. a typical day at work was just loading and unloading delivery trucks.
good,"Walmart puts a ton of stress on there employees with little in return, customers also take advantage of what Walmart stands for."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced.  The store I am located at is small but always busy. I have learned new skills to help me progress in any work environment. The hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable, the customer interaction."
good,A nice place to work. Compensation not very good. Working conditions are good.
good,I worked there for 2 1/2 years and enjoyed it very much. I had been hurt on the job and they put me on light duty in the electronics department. I enjoyed working for 8 months in that department. When i was able to work without being on light duty they put me back as a front end cashier. I preferred elecronics.
good,Its a stressful job. Short staffed and very busy at times. People only treat you nicely when they want.
good,"Stock items onto shelves, pull freights from backroom to the salesfloor"
good,"a lot of work for little pay, but the people are amazing. upper management could help a little more."
good,During my time I have spent at Walmart Neighborhood Market I have learned how to communicate more with people and I always make sure to put a smile on their faces when they leave my register.
good,"I was a cashier and my job was very repotisious consistently doing the same thing over and over...."
good,good place to work if your looking for a job and enjoy helping customers find every time thing they are looking for.
good,opening up the tire shop setting out show tires helping customers writing up orders helping out my co-workers with their jobs calling management for over rides hardest part was on the weekends when management didn't schedule enough people to work and were busy best part was the end of the day closing time
good,"I moved up to an hourly supervisor with in 6 months, Was a good position. I worked with good people, had a great 401k and savings plan"
good,a typical day working at walmart consists of helping customers and keeping your department zoned. i learned to help all the different customers needs and concerns.
good,it really depend on where they need me I work all over the place but my most spot is working in the photo lab making sure people pictures get process and then work on pick up today and layaway. Also know other departments as well.
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart until the shooting incident. After that incident when the air conditioning went out or would not be turned on a higher setting at the cash registers, I could no longer stay at the job. I left before my probationary time was concluded. I loved working with the people at WalMart and with management when I saw them. I learned how to handle alternate payment methods."
good,"When I started I had no training, other than computer training. Rarely had overlapping shifts with other employees to learn on hand experience. The coworkers were friendly and delightful. Management did not make jewelry a top priority when called for help, when it is a customer service area. I liked having a schedule of tasks I needed to complete, I loved working with customers, I enjoyed having my own space. When I asked for help or advice I would usually recieve it in a timely manner, They were wonderful when it came to working around my schedule and they were understanding about it."
good,"My typical day at Walmart, we first start off with a store meeting every night to let us know the work load then we are assigned aisles to work. We then go task in to see what aisle were on and how many hours it may take to stock the manger are sometimes good at coming to see if you need help but all the co workers are team players and when they are done with an aisle they help each other out."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. You are offered challenges which brings out your skills.
good,Wal-mart is a fast paced company. Working at Wal-mart teaches you how to come together and work as a team.Working at Wal-mart you have to know how to be multi-task in order to get several tasks completed. The management and co-workers gets along well for the most part especially when handling customers needs. You have to make sure that everyone is on the same accord or else chaos will begin. I enjoy helping people from all walks of life because it lets me know that everyone needs someone.
good,Enjoyed keeping the store facility clean while customer shop for different need.
good,"Work was relatively easy stocking products on shelves but management had favoritism, gave his or her pets whatever task he or she wanted leaving the rest the harder jobs."
good,"I did enjoy working here, i prefer to work graveyard in places like this as the people are, how do you say, a different breed. Not such a formal setting during graveyard and more fun."
good,"Por conta do cargo , meu dia é muito dinâmico. Aprendi a importância da motivação no ambiente de trabalho, onde a direção tem papel decisivo para atingir a exelência."
good,is an ok place to work they need to have more cashiers on hand at all times. hate when lines and so long and they don't open up more regs. other then that walmart is a great place to shop with great deals
good,I enjoyed my Job until I transferred and they introduced the wage cap I then had to seek other employment
good,"superação todos os dias para alcançar metas."
good,"I would get there an hour before any other overnight worker to organize and make the night easier for all the other workers. The upper management depending on what manager was there and middle management was a joke because I was mostly incharge of my area even though i was on the same pay grade as the people I was in charge of. For the most part the people that I worked with were awesome people to work with. I learned many things there like how to build palettes of freight, how to work the back room to find items, and how to stock properly. The hardest part of the job was managing people while also doing and finishing my job."
good,This is a good blue collar job. It's great for hard working people that love a physical job. They really care about their employees. Safety is the number one priority.
good,A typical day at work...was stocking the frozen and dairy areas. I enjoyed working with other associates and management on tasks that improved my departments overall appearance and efficiency. The hardest part of the job was working third shift because I felt that I had less time with my family.
good,"I have great leadership skills"
good,"Majority of the time of my scheduled shift, it's busy. People are constantly shopping and getting groceries. I've learned that patience is a virtue. My co-workers are some of the most sweetest and most helpful individuals."
good,"I didn't get too much direction and the first week I wasn't trained that much, so I had to watch and teach myself a lot. A lot of other employees would talk in a different language, there was a big language barrier. The management was not well organized and I never really saw the managers."
good,"I help customers find products they are looking for, ring up their purchases using credit, debit, cash or check.  I provide them with friendly service."
good,I was a cashier I checked out customers assisted in customer service I also handled returns. The hardest part of my job was remembering all the different codes for fruits and vegetables. the most enjoyable part was the conversations I got to have with the hundreds of customers I saw on a day to day basis.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job > Daily customer interaction."
good,Que gracias a mis compañeras aprendí varias cosa que si me sirvieron mucho.
good,muitas demandas os processos não são otimizados ocorrem muitas oportunidades sistemicas
good,I would work here again. I have at least to other times.  There are many locations and different departments.
good,This place was stressful with the minimum of hours each location had. However a good place to learn responsibility.
good,"Trabajar en Walmart me dejo de emseñanza trabajar con presion todos los dias, ya que no hay un dia igual a otro."
good,Walmart is usually flexible and willing to work around busy family and other  schedules. They are usually good about giving days off if needed. They sometimes cut hours which can be a problem if this is your only source of income. The pay is very low for such a large multi billion dollar company. This results in a high turnover of new employees resulting a lack of efficiency.
good,"The work was dull. I was on the night shift. The work wasn't a challenge once I knew what was needed, but the manager on nights expected me to know what to do without showing me."
good,"I lost time with my son due to the hours I was putting in on my shift. When I was on overnights, my shifts were usually 14-16 hour shifts and when I reached out for help to the market team, no one helped."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, a typical day at work is in between. My store has poor management, co-workers are awesome, but other than that its a cool job."
good,A typical day at work would be ringing customers up and taking payments. I learned how to handle customers in a professional way. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to the many different people coming into the store.
good,"The most enjoyable time spent at my previous job, as a whole, was the time I spent unloading trucks. I enjoy seeing the results of physical labor and the companionship that is acquired as a part of working with others with the same go getter mentality that I have. I also enjoy interacting with customers and being a part of the decisions in their day to day life. I learned to be a team player most of all, but also that if I work hard there is no goal I have been given that has not been attainable. The management team was fair and while they over saw the major points of our work I felt as if micromanagement down to the smallest details was not an issue, and our freedom to accomplish tasks as an individual was not hindered by the pressure of someone constantly standing over my shoulder. The hardest part of the job was also my favorite, and that was of course the physical laboring part. While extremely rewarding to be able to immediately see the results of hard work it can be extremely exhausting. Overall the time I spent working with customers and building strong work related friendships with my co-workers greatly surpassed my expectations of what a job can be if you strive for excellence"
good,"grouchy managers , take there frustration out on you and they don't really like to work with your hours if you have school and they are always cutting peoples hours my co workers are the best they are nice friendly and helpful , the most enjoyable part is when u catch the managers on a good day and they are nice to you"
good,"A typical day at work would involve working at a very fast pace to check out as many possible customers in the shortest possible period of time. Management was responsive and helpful, especially based on the massive load of responsibility they were dealing with."
good,llegar temprano tomar cafe estar en junta minutas del dia previo metas del dia previo minutas del dia nuevo metas del dia nuevo porra empresarial gerente opcional ir compañeos algunos trabajo extra solo para algunos agrado muy poco preferencia mia la comida gratis
good,"Enjoyed being able to help customers. Department manager and coworkers in the photo lab were amazing, enjoyed working with them as a team."
good,"A typical day at work is almost like everyday.. its a Retail store, you go by a routine.. the more time you spend there the more abilities you have to do it. the only differences ares the new faces you see.. either customers or new management team. but its all the same overall"
good,Helping customers pick fresh produce to enjoy. I've learned a lot about different fruits and vegetables since working here. The hardest part of my job is some of the lifting.
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me is very hectic. I come into pallets and more pallets of freight to work and all of it is expected to be completed by the end of the day. Being that I'm the ONLY associate in my area that's kind of a ridiculous expectation but I still manage do my best and I do complete most of the work to their satisfaction. On as to what i learned, would be my favorite perk of the job. I've learned a lot from work ethic, how to approach a customer in the correct manner, the handheld devices use to locate items throughout the store, the forklift and pallet jacks in the backroom and etc. My co-workers are just like me, looking to gain knowledge from a huge company and use that to our advantage in the ""job world"". We always talk about our job tasks and the customers and how we ""slave"" for management but its a friendly environment to be fair. The hardest part of my job is having multiple tasks by multiple managers and supervisors and being expected to complete all in a few hours time. Somethings got to give, I wish there was more communication. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer and making their day better. I love helping people and it makes me feel great when I can put a smile on someone's face."
good,"Basically, I was encouraged to personally interact with customers, employees and management staff more conveniently. This also allowed me to the opportunity to singularly make decisions based on company policy to the benefit of all stakeholders. Bluntly speaking, this company is truly culturally diverse organization."
good,"Overseeing a particular area or section of the store was a typical night at Wal-Mart.  Assisting customers as needed, lifting up to 70Ibs boxes, loading/ unloading, stocking/ re-stocking, & setting-up/ breaking-down signs and displays were normal work routines."
good,"Managers were rude, they weren't doing their job, but the pay was good for a cashier."
good,"Walmart is a easy going job for me, working on vehicles was not very hard since I am mechanically inclined."
good,going your department to the backroom to the front end then all over the entire store day in and day out takes a toll on your body i learned plenty about the company and the customers that was the best part of the job helping customers management doesnt know how to speak with people but some managers respected everyone the same
good,"An average day at work was generally an 8hr shift, checking in patients, getting them set up for exams, verifying insurance, scheduling appointments, filing, helping patients find glasses and adjusting new glasses to patients. Hardest part of job was explaining to patients about there prescriptions and them not understanding why there glasses were so expensive due to the prescription. Most enjoyable part was being able to help improve the patients way of life."
good,"It is always go, go , go at Wal-Mart. Very busy, short staffed, and a lot of teamwork to get things done. Very high expectations with few associates but you have to push through that."
good,"After clocking in, I would report to the mandatory meeting that would be held before the shift starts. We would be assigned specific task as far as knowing what aisle to stalk and what to do afterwards. The assignments would change everyday. We have the meetings so everybody would have a general idea of what needs to be done and who's doing what. The hardest part of the job is getting done in a timely manner. On somedays we would have a lot of freight to stock on the shelves but would have the appropriate amount of people to get the job done at a steady pace. We would have to work as fast as we can. Down the line I learned how to manage my time properly and  the job became easier. I even learned how to be a team leader due to the fact that a lot of my co-workers looked to me for instructions."
good,"poor pay scale, micromanagement from g.o., dissatisfied employees, overall not a positive work environment."
good,"most days I would come to work, push carts, do maintenance, help in the back, and help out customers. this was a lot to handle every day and the managers were the ones who assigned all this to me even when they knew I was busy. All this happened every day due to being short staffed, but no one was ever hired to fill the spots that needed to be filled."
good,"As a Cashier, an ordinary day at work is meeting different people, providing them with the best service possible. Managers are approachable and very helpful and the same with most co-workers.  I developed promotional skills, learned how to assist customers, process transactions in exchange for goods. A challenging part of the job is not being able to meet every customers' needs. On the upside, there are customers that who are open to suggestions and gave associates like myself the opportunity to utilize my skills and knowledge in order to satisfy them."
good,i enjoyed working at Walmart. it was a great experience working with the public and the associates.
good,pues la verdad no tenia buen ambiente de trabajo ya q los jefes abusan mucho de su puesto y ni cinco minutos te dan para tomarte un café por las mañanas
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are my co-workers that I work with.  Management is ok. I have learned some but some I already knew.  The hardest part would be putting up with some really nasty and rude customers from time to time.
good,"the typical day was maintaining a safe inviiorment and catching shoplifters. I learned a lot about retail, unfortunately there was a lack of support from my chain of command. most of my co-workers were not very dedicated and there was a lot of call-in's, the hardest part of th job was adhereing to company policy in regards to apprehending shopifters, it was very rewarding to recover merchandise that subjects were attempting to steal."
good,I had no problems with the job or the management.  The company is okay to work for and my co-workers were nice.
good,"Did not work there very long, but the pay was ok and the fellow employees were nice."
good,"Walmart cuenta con un grato ambiente laboral, ambiente joven e innovador, ademas cuenta con  horarios que son ideales para todo trabajador,  puesto que permite un equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida privada.   Estas mismas características permiten que el trabajador se inserte en la cultura laboral y en e ritmo de trabajo de manera más grata y eficiente. "
good,"No estuve mucho tiempo, pero me quedo con el ambiente laboral de walmart."
good,Wal-mart was a great job for me i was able to be the friendly person I am while working as hard as my body would allow me. The management their was not all put together but you would find a few who made sure all task were put out for the day. The hardest part of my job was the management. You have so many bosses with different task so its hard to say which one is more important than the other.
good,walmart was a long time ago but it was a decent job. i wanted a high paying job because the amount of work you do there and the amount you get didn't balance at all
good,"Being in management was extremely stressful and tough. Long hours with taking a lot of days off away. You start each morning with notes and have to execute them by 4pm. No excuses. Notes get added on to you throughout the day as well. Although every walmart may be different, from what I hear all assistants managers basically feel the same way. I did it for almost 3 years. Retail is tough. There is never enough training for management or hourly supervisors. You get tossed around from job to job and are expected to know it all. Salary is definitely not for everyone. The other members of management and hourly associates become your family."
good,"Learned how to do food stamps and WIC, cashed checks, had a scanning rate of 98%."
good,It all depends on the store you work at. The six stores worked/operate at was horrible.
good,The Things I Have accomplish in Wal-Mart is learning how to use to price scan and learning how to protect people by putting safety first and I am also learning how to manage the diary room during one day
good,"A typical day is a 12 hour shift with two twenty minute breaks.  Lots of paperwork and there is always something that needs to be done.  I learned the kind of person I do want to be and the career I want.  We have had a lot of turn over in manager in the past year therefore, I really do not know a lot of them.  Co-workers will be co-workers you just have to smile and go on with your day.  I believe the hardest part of my day is when there is no help from my co-workers and I am the only one that see it on my shift.  Making others smile."
good,I have great co workers and I love working with them. My customers are the best and I always help them with anything they need.
good,"I love most the people I work with. However, working as a 2nd shift instock, we're severely underpaid considering how much more work we do than the floor staff. Our store manager isn't approachable in any form and treats the store as a profit rather than a family like the previous store manager."
good,i go to work get register assignment and  count register and start ringing up customer
good,It is a job. It really depends on who you work with. Not everyone feels the same about expressing team effort.
good,Large corporation with decent opportunities for advancement.
good,"un día normal, revisar pantallas del sistema, coordinar y revisar actividades delegadas en un día anterior, y coordinar de acuerdo a operación de la tienda, aprendí que el trabajo en equipo es mucho mas fácil, que todos debemos manejar el mismo grado de información para que los resultados se den. Es importante el apoyo de la gerencia, la comunicación constante con esta para llegar a objetivos. La parte mas difícil de mi trabajo es que me absorbía demasiado tiempo ya que en el auto servicio así es, creo que eso era encontrar el equilibrio entre mi vida personal y mi trabajo. que era muy dinámico y siempre había capacitaciones y actualizaciones, ya que el mundo cambia y las formas de operar tambien"
good,Benefits available best part of this job. Advancement hindering the reason I left
good,The job was very easy and the only reason i left was because i went into the military.
good,"Lots of costumers"
good,Decent place to work with little room for improvement. Must comply with company rules even when the rules are wrong.
good,The managers don't take time to put someone to teach the new team members making it a disaster for the customers.
good,"Typical day-"
good,"constant work to be done, managers give you room to work, real team atmosphere."
good,"es una empresa de estabilidad media ya que  no se apega mucho a su cultura y no te tratan como empleado sino como serviente  el salario casi  creo que anda por el minimo es de tiempo completo 8hrs solo te ayuda por los horarios flexibles ya que te permite sguir estudiando"
good,In whole the employer was very fair and understanding... Only down fall was their organization skills.
good,"busy"
good,Daily responsibilities changed everyday due to store needs. I have learned that building the morale of the associates is a great thing and when people are happy at work job performance increases. Great co-workers and diversity is great in a company because it brings different outlooks and opinions. Hardest thing about this position is balance of work and life. I enjoyed meeting different types of people and the associates.
good,"At any given day in the beginning of the night I can be asked by management to cover a register and stay there to help out CSMs and their cashiers till the lines of customers die down. I usually help out at least 3 associates with their departments, and when they are helping out a customer and do not know something, they usually come to me. I put up all the freight in my department in a timely manner, check the backroom to see if there is any more, then I zone up, basically clean and straighten up, my department before moving to the next one. I'll do this more than once, at least 3 times a night."
good,I enjoyed most of my days at Wal-Mart but there were definitely times where I felt depressed to be working there
good,"Customer service is priority at Walmart. But in doing so, they have very little concern for the employees that commit the customer service."
good,"It was very stressfull... They were not nice to work for.... the hours that u got were not so good.  Had to work every weekend, with a family that is very diffcult."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very fast paced. You have customers and employees needing your help all day. I learned how to be a problem solver as a manager at Wal-Mart. I taught me how to be in control and how to resolve any issues. I learned how to be a great worker and a fast paced and adaptable worker from my employees and my managers. The hardest part about my job was making sure that all the needs of my employees and the customers were met, but that was also the most enjoyable because at the end of the day I knew I had did a job well done every time I clocked out."
good,got things ready to do my cakes or to make back up.  waited on the customers either on the phone or in person.  i learned how to do the inventory and send it in. Management was not the greatest you couldn't talk to them about the job.  My co-workers were good people got along with all of them.  nothing was hard about the job.  the most enjoyable part of my job was doing the cakes.
good,Typical day consisted of assisting customers find products in the show department and answering any questions they may have.
good,typical day at work was sign into the cash register and wait for customers to come with products and let them pay for the purchase.
good,"mi dia tipico fueron los mismos mis 8 meses estuve en la caja "
good,"There is always something new at work it is never just a typical day.  I work in the money center and everyday was different it could be a slow work week or it could be veryfast pace. On a typical day I am cashing all types of checks and sending and receiving wire tranfers, but there are those days where you have to talk a customer out of sending money to a person(s) that they do not know or those type of people that call and say you owe them money, or you have won a lager amount of money and you need to send this amount and we will send you back a check for a lager amount.  I also help in checking customer out at the front check out lines making sure that they get and receive the best customer service posible."
good,"I was getting decent hours prior to the new year, but once the new year started, I went from ~25 hours per week to maybe 15 hours per week. I had to pick up another job just to get by. This store also was horrible at granting days off. I asked off months in advance for appointments and a vacation I had planned. A month out and they still had not been approved or denied. I had to find my assistant manager and stand there while he approved them. Another issue I had was being scheduled on days that I put I could not work consistently every week."
good,"Walmart is a tough place to work at with little pay and poor hours. A typical day at work includes arriving at 10pm, attending an optional meeting with management where the truck size and your tasks are assigned for the night, often times working multiple aisles, cleaning up the trash and area. Working ICS stock picks. Clearing parking lot of shopping carts around 5am. Zoning aisles and end caps."
good,Alright job to start out with as part time. Hard to advance through the company or even get full time.
good,I worked at a 24-hour SuperCenter and that allowed me a lot of flexibility for my college work.  The pay ultimately ended up being what drove me to look elsewhere.
good,"Management is quite good. CSM's are great, very encouraging. Hardest part of the job is getting the credit card apps."
good,I enjoyed working at customer service and I enjoyed my associates.  What I didn't like was the way the Assistant Managers treated the associates.
good,"A good place for part-time work."
good,The management not interested in listening to the employees. The wages are too low.
good,hard working I loved the exercise and the way I got to know our customers
good,"was my first job"
good,Wal-mart was founded on 3 basic beliefs service to the customer respect for the individual and strive for excellence.I had 8 great years with fast passed promotions.The last 2 and 1/2 years I believe the company has lost sight of the 3 basic beliefs.
good,I was always going around the store doing different jobs I also learned to cashier. The best thing about it was I could switch up the jobs I did often and I was never in one spot of the store for long. I was never bored.
good,"it was okay to work there short term, the workers were okay but the management did a poor job of communicating."
good,"There was very little organization within the operation of the store. That was to be expected though. A 24-hour store that was the most popular shopping place in Huntsville, TX; that only makes sense. Most of the employees were college students and so that created an unstable work flow. There was always plenty to do, which was great. I was always busy. But I never knew how many hours I was going to get during the week. It constantly fluctuated between 19-36 hours. So in the aspect of coming in and knowing I was going to have work to do was great. But not knowing if I was going to be the only one in my department or if I was working that day was not."
good,"I learned a lot about retail through trial and error at Walmart.  Management was not very compassionate or helpful. Coworkers became dear friends and still are. We worked as a team. At the time I worked for Walmart lifting 72 piece dish sets and heavy multi stacked plastic garbage cans etc, off of risers manually was extremely heavy, and awkward on a ladder. I really enjoyed helping customers with their shopping needs."
good,"Good Pay and Benefits, has its good points and bad points  its a good place to work, but production is way to high really for most people to meet a typical day is go in and work all day"
good,"great place to work, management needs a little more organizational structure. other than that its work"
good,"Customers returning purchased items for store credit or refund."
good,"Checked products out to customers, count down tills, deliver customer service. I learned that I like working with people, cashiering is an easy skill for me. My coworkers were nice. The hardest part of the job was during slow times. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"In a typical day I would be checking customers, fixing pricing issues, and stuff along those lines."
good,"operated cash register on regular basis, handled money, assisted customers. I learned how to address certain people and how to improve my communication with different people. Management was unorganized and did not work on one accord. My job was enjoyable and I hardly had a bad day."
good,enjoyed the area i was working in but did not like working for this company my management was poor and if it hadn't been for my co-workers/ team members i would not have the knowledge or skills needed to preform my daily tasks
good,"~ Stocking shelf's, customer service, mixing paint, registering customers for hunting licenses, working in multiple departments, returning returns on the shelf's, pick up spills, helping others, cashier."
good,Employer was not able to provide hours and work around school schedule.
good,"Worked as cashier and greeter occasionally. Handled large quantities of money, treated customers with respect, stood on my feet for long hours"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would include meeting new people, having a good time working, and a lot of energy. I learned how to better my customer service skills. Some of the management were fun to work with but others seemed to have attitudes very often. Working at this job isn't very hard. You just have to know how o be polite. What I enjoyed most about working at Wal-Mart is knowing that I put a smile on others faces."
good,"A typical day at work consists of unloading our truck, down stacking and restacking some grocery pallets, pulling pallets to the floor, and picking merchandise. I've learned how a shipping/receiving warehouse operates. Management seems to be a bit crazy at some times, constantly checking to see how close we are to having the truck unloaded. I get along with my coworkers that are good workers, but not so much the ones that are slow, or seem to come in either drunk/high. The hardest part of my job is pulling a pallet of salt/dirt somewhere. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it feels like a workout more often than not."
good,"It has taken me quite a while to find the type of work I love doing and am suited for, but I've come to the exciting realization that warehouse work is what I'm built to do. Currently I am a truck unloader at Walmart and I love the fast paced work and the physical nature, but would like to earn more money and be with a company whose main focus is warehouse work so I can learn al aspects."
good,Great experience. Stocking and customer service made for an exciting opportunity.
good,"Typical day would be to go in, clock in and go straight to pushing carts. I did learn a lot such as time management, great organizational skills, and everyone gets cash register experience. The management can be very unfair and naive. Excellent work environment with co-workers. No hard part of the job."
good,"no life work balance, DO NOT WORK AT THE VERO BEACH WALMART! They do not care about your home life and does not matter how much extra time you give them they want more or get upset that you want to take a day off after giving up several already."
good,very much what you would expect. every wal-mart differs and much depends on the managers that's there. Even though the managers wasn't worth nothing I enjoyed my fellow employees. And one last thing to never forget about managers with power comes responsibility  and as we see time and time again man bow before power instead of bearing it in the name of the righteous.
good,"Always busy either helping customers or preparing the store for shoppers.  Management and co-workers work together to upkeep the shopping experience for the customers.  Learned that common courtesy to customers goes a long way, even if they're upset with you.  Hardest part of the job is trying to keep calm if a customer asks you about something you don't know, and also enjoyed working with the co-workers."
good,"My most enjoyable part of my day, was probably the customers.  The nice repeat customers.  The hardest part about this job was the benefits.  Not being rewarded for hard work.  Many of my co-workers were great. I really learned not to trust anyone.  Management was sort of wishy-washy.  Associates would work in circles, without accomplishing tasks somedays."
good,a typical day at work is always the same. scanning groceries and handling payments
good,Foi uma experiencia diferente. Onde não concordei com algumas coisas. A empresa agi de má fé com os funcionário.
good,Stayed very busy. Very hard work for such little pay. Management needed more communication.
good,"My first year at this store was the best year during my career with Wal-Mart.  Our management team was just that, a team.  We worked together, when we had differences we would sit down and discuss them.  THen when we got a different store manager, team went down the drain. due to his ego and severe little man syndrome."
good,A typical day at work involves working on cars. There is quite a bit of downtime. My co workers are nice people. The management is nice but they are rarely present. I learned how to work on cars before working here I had never worked on a car in my life. The hardest part of the job is not having enough staff with a high volume of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to pretty much work outside when the weather permits.
good,"es un lugar muy estable a si como muy entretenido. el ambiente laboral es muy bueno ya que no se maneja por comisiones, hay motivación para los empleados reconocimientos."
good,"Overall, not the worst job a person could have. Do not even consider this job if you want to ever see sunlight though, with the hour lunch and transportation time to and from work you are looking at a significant part of your day lost. Great, friendly and hard-working coworkers. Also, don't expect to ever get off Graveyard: I finally left the company after two months of filing paperwork and being told it was in the works before it became apparent they were not going to transfer me."
good,"I worked overnight so there weren't a lot of customers, which was good for me being in that department. I could get in the zone, get in rhythm and get things done fast. I learned a lot about a variety of merchandise and what goes on behind the scenes at your average super store. Management wasn't great in the particular store I worked in, and I'm just going to leave it at that. Some co-workers were great, others, well, not so great, Walmart isn't exactly a place full of scholars. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes for a large amount of time, most enjoyable part of the job was being able to zone out, get in the groove, do my job and get out of dodge."
good,"trabajo en equipo"
good,"Over all the day wasn't so bad. There was a lot of movement, always something to do, and the people were great to work with. Having worked in the Produce department taught me a lot about the different fruits and vegetables that we eat and only give a passing thought every day. There was the unfortunate matter of a high management turnover rate that cause some confusion among the sales associates regarding how things should be run. With each new manager, new employees would develop different ways of doing things that caused some conflict. The hardest part of the job was the lifting and the constant jetting back and forth from one end of the store to the other for this minor thing or that. There was also a constant risk of being pulled from your department to work somewhere else. The best part of the job was all of the people you got to meet and work with."
good,Not a bad place. Does various events for employees and bonuses are available when you have a good quarter.
good,"Walmart provided a job when the economy was in decline and accounting jobs were hard to find."
good,"A work day is very busy between assisting customers and managers with notes that need to be done whether it is setting modulars, counting merchandise, stocking, and making merchandise presentable."
good,"This job is great for a part-time job but I wouldn't expect this to be a primary source of income, unless you can become part of management."
good,"The assistant managers were bullies, however the General Manager was a very nice and good man."
good,"Consisted of checking out customers, overnight stocking, and customer service Representative. I learned about the store front and back as far as numbers and production. Management was average, hired poor personnel. The hardest part of the job would be when working alone with a high expectations in a broad area of work."
good,"Management lacks communication amongst each other. I learned how to provide quality customer service. Co-workers were great, we all worked together without much problems."
good,"The job at Walmart is very similar to the work environment in most"
good,"I take care of customers to the best f my abilities, keep a very clean work station"
good,"Only had a short experience with Wal-Mart. Management was usually supportive of employees. Although it did not matter to me, remodel employees were given little information about future opportunities with Wal-Mart."
good,"Wal Mart is very focused on the appearance of the store, and less so on the availability of Associates to assist customers. During the day our responsibilities included stocking the shelves, counting product of high value, and cleaning the department. Rarely do we assist customers. I am leaning quite a bit about inventory management which was a field i had very little experience in before now.The Management is always around, but seems to rarely interact with the actual sales associates. I may have spoken to my manager a handful of times in my stint here so far. Thus far into my life at Wal Mart i enjoy the company of some of my co-workers, however most of them seem just miserable, so its often times difficult to sift through the negative disposition they carry around. I went to Wal Mart to get a job. I expected to work, and since that is the case I really dont find any of my job ""hard"" or more than should be expected of me. I love talking to people, so the few times i get to help a happy customer, or turn a negative situation into a good experience, those are my favorite part of the job."
good,"Trabajo de un dia de 8 horas "
good,"Working at walmart is not for those that can't handle stress. Walmart is a fast paced, customer service oriented company that will try your interpersonal skills most days. But if you want a secondary job this place is great for working around your schedule."
good,"Initially I had a positive experience with this company.  When I transferred into the Toy dept, I served under a manager who was helpful and encouraging, but after they transferred to another store, under their replacement it was suddenly like I couldn't do anything right.  Unfortunately I've heard that this isn't a unique experiance among Wal-Mart employees..."
good,i enjoy working here. like every company it has pro and cons great culture
good,"WalMart is a pretty descent job to have, the associates are great to work around and the customers are also great.  I have learned a lot from working at  Walmart, the company has taught me customer service, safety while on the job, and has enhanced my social skills. The management team is awesome, are  very considerate of the associates opinions and issues."
good,"Be on time at work and proper dress code is extremely important. Learning new task give the opportunity to advance at a higher position in this company. Focusing on my duties bring attention to management. Team work is extremely important to any company I work for. Being a cashier can be difficult when handling cash register and all types of payments. I've learn always pay attention on job title, Focus on my customers.I enjoy every moment of my job, A criteria that fits my title that I have achieved, Great skills as a Cashier over pass years of experience's. My goal is Productive to the company."
good,for me a typical day would be showing up to work on time getting everything prepared on time working fast and effectively with a good working crew with very little incidents through out the week
good,"Walmart 1037 has the one of the highest revenue percentage of the Tri-Country Area. Everyday was a busy day. As a primary Cashier i enjoyed interacting with  the customers, they are very entertaining to work with.The Wal-Mart family there were quite durable, not as persistent i would expect but good enough to get by long days. Everyday I learned something new from ny job as a cashier. Most of the learning came from customers but the management t gave me pointers regarding to human resources related issues. Because the number 1 priority is the customers satisfaction. My southern hospitality, persistence and business like attitude was what distinct me from the rest of my fellow employees."
good,"My typical day at work consist of stocking shelves in the store with merchandise. unloading new freight from packaging trucks and placed it on the sales floor and interacting with customers based on concerns or question about the merchandise."
good,The company was not at all helpful if you have problems that might make it hard to work a certain shift. They try and tell you things that will make you work what they want.  The people I worked with were great and would teach you anything you want to learn
good,It was like having your own pharmacy with limited decision making with upper management and corporate associates.
good,It's always busy in Wal-Mart.  There are tons of customers and co-workers in the store at any one time.  This makes it feel more lively.  The biggest problem with Wal-Mart is the fact that you don't get payed for what you actually have to do and the hours are all over the place crazy.  One day you may work from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M. and then the very next day you come in at 6 A.M.
good,"A decent college job, hardest job I held was cart associate, and the most enjoyable position was produce associate"
good,A typical work day was very busy between helping customers and socking shelves. I learned so much about inventory control & learned about products that I would of never imagined. Most of the managers were easy going & fun to work with. All the coworks were wonderful to work with. Everyone always pitched in where help was needed. The hardest part of the job would be when 7000 price changes would hit and you were expected to complete them within a couple of days. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking shelves I really enjoyed it and it kept me busy.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was fun! My co-workers were basically the only reason why I stayed so long! Management needs a lot of work. There was really nothing hard about being an employee at Wal-Mart, just do your job."
good,"community health worker: using my skills with clients in two sro's, created health care survey, taught a ""houston resource"" class. used all my community health worker skills."
good,"This was my first Big Data project and I really learned a lot about analytics, and how to leverage customer data to drive business decisions."
good,"a typical day at work was good I loved the people I worked with"
good,There is never a dull moment and work is steady. Glad to be a part of the team.
good,"Managed multi million dollar business"
good,"Its was very faced paced, but the machines where a little off most of the time"
good,"Greet Customers, Stock shelves, maintain cleanliness and neatness throughout work period. The co-workers were ok to work with as well as the management team. Hardest part of the job would be working in an area for the first time. The most enjoyable would be getting a chance to work and interact with customers."
good,"the most difficult part of working at walmart was the customers. the area my store was located was less desirable than most, so some of the customers were extremely rude. the best part of the job was the employees i worked with though."
good,"The managers come everyday to distribute the associates within my department to other departments because they allow the computer to schedule associates unsupervised. And the schedule is the worst to make full time hours you need a completely open availability and they will try to schedule you for other departments as well, because it is better to have part-time associates to train than to have keep the full time associates and pay out their benefits. "
good,"well we'ld get there do a shift meeting listen to pros and cons, do the walmart cheer. then my co-workers and I would go into the back room and get started ringing out orders. put the items we ring into different sized boxes depending on what items are in the box. making sure to take out any corrosive, flammables, or hazardous materials. Then we would write the transaction number, zip code, customers first initial and full last name. and number of boxes for the order, then mark the items listed on the reciept to the box they are in adding subtotals. Take the receipt and order form, staple them together and place the number of boxes onto a pallet for shipping to handle."
good,The people I had worked with made it a fun environment to work in.
good,"Its a decent place to work. Nice people, and relaxed. Its a great environment to work in."
good,"the hardest part of this job was to keep the lines down when i was a customer service manager because management didn't provide enough cashiers to meet the demand. while some of the employees were nice and cooporative with assignments, there were some that we not."
good,I would be responsible for unloading the merchandise trucks in a certain amount of time and then later in the evening I would take the merchandise that was just received to the sales floor to be stocked.  The supervisor that I had while working there was great because he wasn't the kind of supervisor that would stand back barking out orders he would actually get involved and do what needed to be done.
good,"hours were not that great they would change everyday and the management usually did not tell you that they changed your schedule."
good,"Started on 3 rd. shift stocking shelves, became cashier, did layaway, customer service, started to train as CSM, Deli need help so went to deli. Coworkers were great to work with."
good,"I enjoyed my time as part of the management team at Walmart, but it was a two hour commute from home and became to much of a personal and financial strain to make the commute."
good,"I've worked for the company for awhile, it's easy to advance if you work hard. Management can be awful but it's not always coming from them, sometimes it's coming from over their heads and you're just gettig the frustration from them. Coworkers are fantastic, I have a second family at Walmart that I will miss immensely when I leave."
good,It was ok. It was unorganized. Overall I loved my co-worker.
good,Hardest part of this job is unloading the truck by yourself without help and the managers can be annoying at times as well and helpful other times.  Helping customers was always fun and kept things new and unsuspecting at times.  Easy part was picking merchandise in back and bringing it to the salesfloor.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart for the most part.  I enjoyed interaction with the customers and maintaining my departments.  What was frustrating was being understaffed most nights and having to really hustle to get everything done.  I do feel that Wal-Mart had a tendency that once an employee learned special skills (for instance price changes in the handheld computer), they kept adding more and more duties for that person and I know I myself became overwhelmed after a while with what all they were expecting me to do when technically, it wasn't even my job."
good,"In an environment such as you Walmart, you must be bale to keep up with a fast pace and do well with multitasking to keep on top of consumer demand. The management team at store 2005 was unorganized and lack communication at best. Both with other managers and with employees, making it difficult to accomplish much without running risk of getting into trouble from being pulled in so many different directions from multiple people. There were employees in the store from every walk of life, which I loved! With such vast diversity there is so much to learn from so many wonderful people about different places, languages, traditions, etc. I absolutely loved getting to meet, talk to and get to know so many of my customers! Helping and getting to know your customers really can bring out the best in you!!"
good,Easy work until there were too few associates to work with you to do it. Management does not listen to the concerns of employees. Some days in the summer had less than a dozen customers but with the lack of help during Christmas associates get overrun.
good,"Do tires and oil changes"
good,Walmart was a very productive place to work and the employees were very sweet and made work fun.
good,"My day would start with unloading a 2,300 piece truck with my team of associates, palletizing merchandise as it is coming off of the truck, securing high shrink merchandise and comparing it against the receiving detail report. Then I would have my team pull the merchandise out to the floor stock it, bin the residue leftover and clean my receiving warehouse and file my invoices accordingly. The hardest part of my job would be when I have two or more unloaders calling in and there are two 2,000 piece trucks to unload. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing I got all my tasks completed on time if not earlier and that I always give 200% dedication."
good,most enjoyable part of working there was the smiles i put on the customers face
good,"on a typical day I stocked shelves for 8 hours"
good,Responsibilities and experience changed based on position.
good,"Trabalhava na abertura e fechamento da loja,recebia mercadoria na area de perecivel,controlava entrada de promotores na loja."
good,"use tow motor ,cashier, unload trucks , stock  change oil batteries and tires"
good,"The people made the job. Without them, I would not have stayed there that long."
good,"First thing is to continue to prepare the store for customers by making everything presentable and easy to retrieve.  "
good,"Delegate extensive amount of tasks to associates. Tour departments to identify and solve daily opportunities. Answer customer questions and resolve issues.  Communicate daily activities with peers. Follow up on delegated responsibilities. Complete required compliance paperwork, Walk with health and OSHA inspector. Scheduling, interviewing, evaluating, and disciplining associates."
good,"Currently working on the night shift part time, unloading our produce truck and breaking down the pallets and stocking the shelves. Put the excess produces in the cooler shelves and making sure it has the proper date for when it came in. At the end of the night, clean the floors, sinks and tables for the next days use."
good,"Walmart is a good jumping off point to start your career. I have excellent customer service skills through the company. Learned team work, and how to handle some bad situations with great solutions. With training I have learned to think on my feet quickly to get things accomplished. Made some great relationships within the stores that lead to long-time friendships. Hardest part is the frustration of the management team, and trying to open door them with our concerns. The most enjoyable is the customers and associates that create the friendships."
good,"Fun job, but im looking for a career with more hours and benifits"
good,"Good overall. Knowing the company and position, management will expect a fast paced worker"
good,good work and social enviorment. advancement is pretty easy plus the quarterly bonuses are great too.
good,A lot of the time my managers at work rely on my to get unfinished work done that other employees have left. I enjoy the company of all my coworkers and even my regular customers. I always have customers who have favored me and tell me they wish there was more employees like me and they always come to me for help when they know im not working then even take the time to say hello to me outside of walmart.
good,Aprendí mas sobre lineas de cajas. Trato con los clientes y mas sobre productos de mercado ya que nunca habia trabajado en la parte de mercado de cosas alimenticias
good,"good benefits, you have to experience it.  Nothing else to say."
good,"Morning Meeting lets us know the work load and any new procedures, plus the meeting lets us know our rating as a group.  We      continue to get updates through out the day on procedures and processing.  Management, more or less is our mediator for informing us of updates.  My co-workers are down to earth people who work hard and want to do their best to improve the company and themselves.  Keep up with all the changes that are made is the most difficult part of my job. If you go on Vacation, when you come back you have to find out what the new process is.  Working and enjoy my co-worker company is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The job isnt hard.."
good,"It was a nice place to work and we all got along so well and we were all team players, as time went on things changed along with management. It went down hill with the moral and team players everyone started going against one another and all that was full-time were limited because of we had to many full time workers. we were told a few times that we had more than half the store was full time and we needed to be less than half."
good,"When I started for Walmart, I was a cashier, then I transferred to the warehouse unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I then transferred to the meat dept. where I ordered stock, checked for out-of-date products, and stocked shelves."
good,"Retail is tough. All work, no life. People and customers are great."
good,"Working in a college town, it was easy to make friends. However, management was lacking terribly. People getting fired by one manager without asking other managers."
good,"Very busy workday from price checks, scheduling, overrides, supplying loans to cashiers; to helping customers. Every day is different which makes my work enjoyable. The hardest part of my job would be taking a break on time. However with such a busy day, this makes my days fly by."
good,I had alot of fun while working at wal mart. It was more of a get by job for me. I did not see wal mart as a career for me personally. I would go back if I had to but I currently do not ever plan to go back.
good,"I had been a say at home mom with my children and Walmart was the only place that called me back. I was more than qualified for the position but I needed to get back in the game. I started as a cashier and I was very quickly promoted. They do believe in promoting from with-in, in just over a year I was a Department Manager. I had been in accounting and customer service manager. However my last promotion was a struggle because it seems getting a promotion can be a challenge for some and I did encounter that. Even though I am somebody that catches on VERY quick and is always looking for new things to learn, I was going to get passed up because the Store Manager that was 6 months older than myself said I was too young to take that position. I worked harder to prove myself and I did get the position. My co-workers and those I supervised that truly thought I deserved stood behind me and were so encouraging and said the same to the store manager. They were all like working with a big family. The mangers were very clicky and that was difficult to work with, especially when there was family involved."
good,"Working as a hourly manager is not bad, get your work done and follow orders. Could use a bit more money but who couldn't? I liked working for this company rules are simple but can sometimes be stressful, but rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart. I believe that it is a decent place to work. The starting pay is not much, however, for those who are willing to work hard and relocate frequently advancements within the company can be accomplished fairly quickly."
good,"el ambiente con compañeros es muy agradable, desafortunadamente en cuestiones de apoyo de gerencia no se cuenta, ni de jefes inmediatos, lo mas difícil es que nos exigen llevara acabo ciertos procedimientos y la misma gerencia las incumple."
good,I really liked the job but I was only temporary and I wish I was full time or part time at Wal-Mart.
good,A typical day at work consists of returns sorting customer service and processing claims I have learned a lot at walmart working in different departments such as battery returns counts inventory etc with management there is just no communication as well as the associates the hardest part I would say is dealing with the the management changing the policies
good,the days are long but full filling if you enjoy people good place to work and grow
good,"Every day is different. May be troubleshooting problems with automation equipment, forklifts, fire system, lighting, etc.  Supporting operations departments with fast customer support and efficient, safe repairs."
good,"Things are always changing and you won't be bored, there are many opportunities you just have to win your managers over to get it."
good,"a typical day at work for me was handling money and answering customers questions. I learned from working with Walmart that its a great environment to see people from different races and cultures come together and mingle and get along. I also learned the importance of teamwork and that it takes more than one person to run a company as such as Walmart. I loved my manger and my supervisors they were very patient with me and answered my questions and concerns that I may have had. my coworkers took me out of my shyness and made me talk to all of them and I appreciate and love them from the bottom of my heart I felt like they were my second family and I don't think they even realize the significance that they played in my life. my hardest part about working at Walmart was money management because money has to be counted just right and cant make a mistake I was nervous about counting large sums of money but I handled it in a professional way and over time I got more comfortable around it. the most enjoyable part of my job was having the knowledge of answering customers questions, I loved when a customer asked me questions because I felt important like I was officially a Walmart sales associate sometimes it felt like are you talking to me just because Walmart was my very first job ever and some moments just felt like a dream and I very grateful to have had this opportunity to work for such a great company"
good,"No work life balance for salaried managers.  Current personnel needs classes to learn innovations: store associates are way behind, the company relays to much on computer based training and most of the associates are just trying to get through the computer training without retaining the information."
good,"Good for when I was a student. I found it very helpful working at walmart in developing myself and career opportunities"
good,"Actividades sencillas mas no distingue sexo y las labores pesadas se realizan por igual hombres y mujeres, aprendí  del trabajo en equipo, las metas de ventas, mis compañeros siempre atentos y dispuestos para lograr objetivos, lo mas dificil era tener que esperar para poder bajar las mercancias pues habia solo un montacargas eso hacía que mi trabajo no rindiera. Lo mejor de estar aqui fue la relación laboral con mis compañeros"
good,"I was able to meet lots of different people from all walks of life. I enjoyed managing my associates and working hard to get things accomplished. The most difficult thing was working ""extra days"" with no end date in sight. For a year and a half, solid, management worked 14-16 hour shifts 5-6 days per week. This was following the store falling on hard times and losing profitability, before then, life was good. We worked our 3 days on and 3 days off and 8-8. If I knew that I could be placed back into an organized enviroment where I am able to tend to my responsibilities, I would go back in a heart beat. I enjoy managing people and working towards a common goal!"
good,"I worked 3rd shift inventory control. I learned a lot about how a box company keeps up with their inventory and how it is the heart of the company. I enjoyed working under some managers but there were some that forced their authority when unnecessary. I pretty much enjoyed all my co-workers. Each had their own personality that made them who they were. There weren't really any hard points in the job position, its a nonstop paced position and enjoyable."
good,I took this job as a transfer from Sams Club when I moved from pa to florida.  it was a decent job for an income at the time. Management was supportive. The pay was not bad for a cashier and you received two 15 min breaks and an hour lunch for every regular shift. That is more than ive ever received at any other job.
good,Meu dia de trabalho era bom exceto o respeito de um ao outro não tinha muito trabalho em grupo .
good,"I have learned different techniques to solve problems as well as finding out information about products in the store. There are all kinds of people that I come in contact with everyday, there is always at least one way to connect with them to give them a good experience. Talking to and helping each person always provides a new way to assist the next person in the future. The hardest part of the job is finding a way to keep busy. Being a cashier at the business requires a person to stand in one general area for an entire shift, with multiple people handling their own areas, you run out of things to keep you moving. By far, the most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with. We are all from around the same areas so we have been in contact with each other at some point prior in our lives or know the same people."
good,Going in knowing that it's all about you making a good impression on your guests.  I learned that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.  The majority of management was a breath of fresh air to work with.  They made it worth coming into work each day. The hardest part was having to say good-bye.  The best part was that it really felt like a family environment.
good,"I learned how to manage my times and how to do multiple things at once, i had great and wonderful co-workers we help each other, care for each other, love each each other, and protect each other. the hardest part of the job was some of the costumers really don't know how to treat those who's caring for them. and the most enjoyable part of the job was when elderly people i love helping them they so nice and appreciate everything you did for them and i also had a great support group our manager respected us they don't take advantage of you in the contrary they always try to help you if you need anything"
good,"It is a ok work environment.  I'm just ready for a career.  I learned how to handle money, cash checks, and I have gained a lot of customer service experience from Wal-Mart."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas, como fazer pedidos, analisar parâmetros, diversidades, recebimento, relatórios gerencias"
good,The company of Walmart itself is wonderful if you want to advance and work your way up the ladder. I know not all stores operate the same way so I can only speak on my experience and that has not been good. Management is not all professional and the weak links in our system of operations really makes our chain bad. Not everyone is treated fairly.
good,On a typical Day I would receive freight and stock the shelves untill they were full and then do inventory on what was left. The most I learned from Wal-Mart was time management and inventory importance. My co workers we good people I very much enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was getting everything stocked in the cold areas in the amount of time given. The most enjoyable part was the diversity of people that I was able to meet.
good,OK job. pay wasn't good and the work wasn't good either. did alot more than i agreed to when i hired on.
good,A typical day of work consisted of ensuring the customers got what they wanted and maintained a quick speed while checking them out.The management at the location I worked at were not the best. They talked about inappropriate things and did not do their jobs as told they would when hired.
good,"It's a great place to work when you're first starting out. The management and other employees are fun, but at the same time everyone seems miserable with Wal-Mart, and that can really be a damper on a good mood day. A typical day at work consists of cleaning and cashiering and pleasing the customers. The hardest part of the job would probably be tolerating rude customers, but the best part is when the customers do take the time to appreciate your help. Management seems a little unorganized at times because they're always running around stressed about something so it seems like they take it out on the lower staff."
good,This position with this company was great I love working people.
good,"I've learned great customer service skills, packing purchases, counting and handling money, pushing promotions and providing helpful information, essential learning skills and also training."
good,"learned merchandising and inventory"
good,"E uma empresa boa de se trabalha mais falta dar valor os funcionário"
good,"Promised insurance after 1 year of work. Then in one year was told you had to have so many hours within 6 months. Usually, only full time employees had enough hours."
good,The job was ok wasn't there that long but it was an ok experience with the co-workers
good,"Qualité Étudiant est un bon premier emploi à occuper, il permet aussi d'exploiter un certain côté d’entrepreneur ship. "
good,My time at walmart was pretty cool for the most part but the hours and pay didnt level out.
good,"Checking in customers to their rooms, daily paper work, counting the cash drawer, help set up breakfast, clean laundry for the next day, guest interaction, finding places for guest to eat and have fun, talking with guest about there daily activities. "
good,"era um dia de trabalho sempre puxado na qual descarregavas as mercadorias as vezes das carretadas que chegavam abastecer a loja aprendi a ter organizaçõa e planejamento de venda , a direcao era de boa convivencia os colegas de trabalho eram generosos e prestativos a parte mais dificil era a carga horario estencisa de segunda a segunda de ter no dia 15 horas de trabalho a melhor parte era o abastecimento organizado."
good,Always available to help customers. Enjoyed my department manage and working as a team. Pleasure working with my co-workers.
good,"A maneira que eles tratam os empregados não gostei, somos meras ferramentas para dar lucro."
good,I would clock in and would be given tasks to complete.  I would go to the back room and freight from the day shift or the previous night would still be there.  I was constantly asked to move to another area when I finished my work.  Everyday I would finish my tasks noticing other co-workers would remain to stock slowly.  I worked as hard as some of the managers but getting paid minimum wage for numerous amount of tasks.  Co-workers would take longer than expected breaks and this was brought up to managers but still no action was enforced to prevent it from continuing to happen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out.  I know that I made a difference from my hard work.
good,"I thought co workers and supervisors were good. Working , I knew from the beginning, was gonna be tough on my body. I didnt like management. Seemed like they had favorites and never gave warnings even tho rules weren't taught 100%. Unloading the truck was the hardest part. It was tough. Pulling the freight on to the floor was the easiest part of the job."
good,"work front end, made sure all cart pusher and cashiers took break in a timely manner. make sure customers returns were handler properly. made sure all register were open per store plan, made sure money center had proper change, did key turn transaction, register audits. Enjoyed working with co worker. ."
good,"A empresa no geral não é ruim, mas a função de salario é complicado, fora os horários que são muito ruins"
good,"Aprendi a trabajar con tarjetas, a distinguir lo falso de lo verdadero y a trabajar  a la par qe mis compañeras."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a learnig experience. I enjoyed being around the new people I meet and helping the customers, but I did not see or feel that famous Wal-Mart culture. I really did not get the feeling as management and employees were as one."
good,I enjoyed going to work at walmart. The associates are friendly and easy to get along with. I made many friends. I enjoyed the interaction with my fellow employees and the customers.
good,work was fine just wasn't enough hours and was hard to transfer
good,"I liked working for Wal-Mart, but I screwed up taking an extra break."
good,The company was a great company but organization is much needed
good,"Work was not hard and at times could even be fun. It's always interesting to learn about new products, buying trends, changes and innovations. "
good,"It was a labor intense job. I believe in equality in the workplace but i think it needs to be measured accordingly. Pay rate was same for man and women. Women would try to get away with flirting with guys to get easy work and ""clicks"" would evolve and they would try to give heavy and hard work to new or unliked employees. If it was a gradual work scale where the number you did correlated with the top pay and lowest pay you could get would make their turnover rate less. The inequality of women workers trying to get the same pay for lifting cereal boxes as opposed to men lifting kitty litter boxes needs to be addressed."
good,16-20 hr days are the norm. Walking blisters on your feet and on the job harrassment by upper management are the regular routine.
good,".Llegar fichar entrada.saludar al supervisor e ingresar a la caja con un monedero con dinero para iniciar el labor."
good,Associates make the job easier - family atmosphere in the stores
good,"Walmart is a great place to start out, but unless you're planning to go into management, it is not a good long term plan. The benefits are decent, and they do offer the option to invest in the company's stock, but the starting wage is low, and not enough to support a family."
good,Working at Walmart is a versatile and productive job. This is not a sit back and relax job. There are so many thing you can learn within the company and so many skills you can do to help you move up within the company. You have to apply yourself and put yourself out there in order to learn.
good,it was not too bad i been working there for  6 months and it was just my starting point since i just move here in 2011
good,Great customers service fun enviormente register  working on the
good,"Great place to start off, but not very promising when trying to get promoted."
good,"My manager was real understanding, most people in the store didn't like her but I got along well with her."
good,Typical day consisted of helping assist customers with info on products. My co-workers were very helpful with learning the job.
good,"It's a good company to work with, they provide you with health benefits, pay for your college funds."
good,Everything was good with the exception of massive hour cuts.
good,"I started this job working midnights which was the shift my son worked. It was my intentions to help him since he had no car. However I soon realized after lifting heavy cases of canned goods and  "
good,Its a great job to have that pay well.  Unfortunately it seem that workers that have been there for year seem to get fired.
good,"At Wal-Mart the job as pharmacy tech was fast paced and at times very stressful, but made for a fast work day and I learned a lot from working there."
good,"This was an ok job the pay seem pretty low with job experience. The management was ok, but they were not always on the same page when it came to different matters."
good,"Decent place to work to start out at. Management is very cutthroat greedy people who only care about their own advancement rather than being a ""Team"" as they should. Easy to promote if you brown nose/Buddy buddy enough."
good,Helped me advance in my social skills in the work field.  Learned how to organize better
good,The best part about working for Wal-Mart was the benefits. I do not feel the employees get the credit and respect that they deserve. I met some of the hardest workers I've ever came across working at Wal-Mart.
good,it was a good job fun people to work with.  i was a cashier and provided excellent servce for walmart.  my co workers were the best but management on the other hand was not. overall i liked the job.
good,didn't really like this job they treated there employees very poorly
good,it is a ok place to work as a high school student but not as a career.
good,"I loved where I worked. I was training to do many things in the company and had no write ups. I do not know why I was let go, considering I was training for overnight manager. I made many friends, co workers and customers. I was very outgoing and always wanted to learn more. I take that with me to any job I am at. I loved being around people and I would love to be doing that again. I see this as my chance to get away from cashiering and into a new field of work. I am excited to see where things take me."
good,Was very disappointed in management as they would say one thing and then never do it. Had one manager say she was going to fix a problem with produce so that a customer could buy it and a half hour went by and it was never fixed come to find out the manager decided to go to lunch first.
good,Worked nights and learned cashier skills and housewares.Was part time no room for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and service our clients vehicles efficiently and timely manner,i learned change oil and tires,rotate and balance tires,fix flats and learn to build skills for customer service.Management is good,my coworkers and i work together to get the job done,the hardest part of the job would be to work in the cold weather with the doors up and the  most enjoyable part of the job is to see the smile leave knowing they have received the best service."
good,"A filosofia da empresa acobertava as perseguições e grosseria da parte da gerencia, assédios morais educados e entre linhas."
good,"Could be very tiring, but at the same time it is also a rewarding one.  Working here, gives me the opportunity to meet new people and learning how to deal with them accordingly.  Being with my co-workers is a challenging, where I find everyone having a different work habits, negatively and positively.  The hardest part of the job, is when we have nothing to do, during those hours where the store is so slow and we have only few customers.  Meeting new people and having new friends are the best part of it."
good,"I work in the Bakery as the Merchandise Supervisor. On a day to day schedule, there would be a baker and a cake decorator. They manage all the baking of bread and orders. The cake decorator manages the cakes and any orders. I would help where I was needed or work the merchandise onto the floor. After completion of this, I would assure counts are accurate, orders are completed, price changes are completed and all my associates tasks are completed."
good,"There are many opportunities to learn at Wal-Mart. You will do a variety of tasks, this gives you a good overall training for a retail environment."
good,"cooking, cleaning, serving, and whatever else needed to be done."
good,"Assists customers with finding products as well as answering questions. Completes duties of a register associate. Ensures different departments are cleaned, dusted, and wiped shelving."
good,"Wal-Mart does not work on logic.  There are many plans that just do not make any sense.  Management is either hit or miss.  The managers are either really good or really poor.  As an associate, there are many days in which you feel you worked hard but go home feeling like there is an overall lack of morale."
good,"fast paced"
good,"My typical day working at Wal-Mart  was always cleaning up someone else's mess. making sure all signege and price tags are correct, stocking merchandise in my department, (hardware) answering phone calls for said dept."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The co-workers and management were wonderful.  I enjoyed the tasks every day that were new, different and exciting."
good,"The Company is something i loved, what their beliefs were inspired me to work hard and create an enjoyable experience for anyone i helped, my fellow co workers were awesome the managment was alright a little confusing here and there but overall a good happy experience"
good,"- Doing overrides, interviewing, schedules, training"
good,"un día de trabajo normal, llegas te saludas con tus compañeros y te presentas en tu área , revisas si tienes algún pendiente lo realizas y acomodas tu área y atiendes a los socios , lo que aprendí es a trabajar en equipo aprendes a a tender a los socios los ayudas si buscan algún articulo o sus dudas, la gerencia pasa te saluda revisa tu área te da algunas instrucciones de si se debe hacer algo . la parte mas difícil llegan hacer los socios puesto que hay que tratarlas con amabilidad y respeto y en ocasiones hay personas muy especiales, lo que mas me gusto es que me hayan dado la oportunidad de poder aprender de varias áreas y eso es bueno puesto que adquieres mas experiencia y en ocasiones te llegan a mandar de apoyo a otros sam s debido a tu experiencia."
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced job, hands on, got to meet new people everyday"
good,se hace la junta de 10 min y se comiensa con el trabajo en la tienda se hace la clave z y se sigue acomodando mercansia
good,i was a stock at Walmart worked over night. stock shelf and help with customer if need.i would finish my work and in the backroom with binning .
good,"A typical day at work included your basic receptionist duties (filing, copying, data entry, answering the telephone, accounts payable/receivable, etc.). Since this was my first job as an adult I was able to learn a lot about the traditional office setting. Management was understanding and flexible as were other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the learning and implementing phase of the job."
good,"Keeping all products in Produce Dept. was up to date daily and rotated. Help all customers that came in the Dept. as much as possible. Made all order that was needed per demand was put in that day. Have morning with management to see what was top issues of the day."
good,"I would come in, and start all the equipment up and count my register drawer. With this job I learned to be prepaired to see all kinds of pictures... good and bad.  The management was horrible here but the co workers were mostly friendly. The hardest part of the job was changing the chemicals in the equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be able to see the smile on the customers faces when they got to look at their pictures."
good,"ok hours"
good,it was ok it was fast pace keeps you busy. love driving the forklift power jack. unloading boxes doing picks stock food
good,"From the time the pharmacy opened in the morning until it closed at night it was busy helping patients get the prescriptions and questions answered while being mindful of the laws associated with the filling of medications..  I would take in prescriptions, fill them, and check customers out. We had to check and put away the drugs each day, check for out-dates, file log copies of the prescriptions received, as well as take in prescriptions off the IVR system.  I learned a lot about drugs and the way they interact with individuals.  The pharmacy manager was a great guy to work for and I learned a lot from him.  We were a pretty closely knit group of coworkers and worked well together.  The hardest part of the job was first thing in the morning when there were up to 70 prescriptions waiting to be filled.  I enjoyed the job and enjoyed meeting and working with the customers."
good,"Its a job, one that I took to get me through college. It's not ideal, but its enough to live on."
good,"Work is good i enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with stressed customers but i deal with them as best as possible to get them out happy. I enjoy socializing with my customers so they have a good experience. I learnt how to deal with things in a calm manner, and ways to solve most of my work related problems without bothering other workers for help."
good,It's a good place to work to meet people. The insurance is great and there are 401K plans and stock options.
good,I started Wal-mart as an overnight cashier. Later I moved on  to being a customer service manager. I enjoyed working with everyone there. I had a LOT of coworkers. Everyone had unique ideas and personalities. I learned patience mostly at this job. There are so many people you deal with on a daily basis that a little patience and tact can go a long way. The hardest part of my job was realizing that I could not please everyone as hard I as tried. The most enjoyable part was the overall retail experience.
good,Typical day was working in the kitchen cooking and cleaning.  management didnt care about the associates all they cared about was the money.   cleaning the fryer.  I enjoyed my co-workers
good,"I worked in multiple capacities while employed."
good,"I had a lot of fun making lots of new friends. I was the first female to do cart pushing at this Wal-Mart and everyone there was pretty excited about that, but the amount I was paid for what I did seemed a little low as well as the tongue lashing I would get."
good,"It cold have been better, long hours, no breaks,etc..... It was terrible"
good,Working for Walmart was hard due to the fact that it required a lot of walking and standing for long hours. The job was easy and not over demanding.  Enjoyed working wiih various customers and meeting new people.
good,"Wal-Mart provides employees with plenty of opportunities for growth and career development. However, employees will make have to make steep sacrifices to succeed and get ahead with this company."
good,A typical day is filled with energy and is sometimes pleasant when most of my happy customers come in. I learned that being myself puts a smile on customers faces. The management was horrible. They had no order with some of my co-workers who were all over the place and fighting customers. There wasn't a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part is being praised by my customers.
good,liked it but a lot of times unorganized. people were great. liked working in the tle place and dairy/frozen trucks are fun and cold all in all it is a pretty good place to work
good,"I met many great people in my years with the company. It was a great learning experience that shaped the early part of my career. However the pay raises are hard to get, and few and far between for the amount of work that is required for specific positions."
good,"I moved around the store. Overall it is just a retail position though. You show up, find what needs done. Prioritize and go about your duties. If people leave me alone I am very productive. It is when someone came in and said I was doing the wrong things or I needed to do manager duties that I struggled."
good,"Work was easy, relaxing at times. Most co-workers were great people in helping and assisting me if I ever needed it. I learned so much with customer service foods, time management, and food responsibility. Management was disappointing at times with asking of excess amount of tasks at times, not noticing when associates needed help, or even helping them when they did. Hardest part for me was balancing my department with 3 other departments that my Assistant Managers kept wanting me to help with while I was the only one in the own department most of the time. Even when other departments had 3 or 4 associates working at a  time they would pull me from my department even though I was the only one in it. The best part was getting to work with my Supervisor, she was very helpful and kind. Anytime I would start to slow down she would get me moving back up."
good,Walmart siempre ha sido una cadena importante de autoservicio y por lo tanto gran generador de empleos. pero no es una buena empresa para crecer y aque el salario es muy bajo y por crecimiento aumentan poco.
good,"Standing at a Register for several hours at a time, pushing through items and handing out receipts. Helping co-worker at the doors by giving them breaks. I learned how to talk to and address customer needs. Mangers were very helpful and understanding. Co-workers were friendly and helpful, great at. Hardest time was dealing with unhappy customers but the best part was the nice people that worked there as well as the friendly customers."
good,"OK for a part-time job. Pay could be better. Sometimes one manager wants me to go to the registers, and five minutes later another manager wants me to go to my department and clean it up. Very confusing at times."
good,"My day is usually the same - help some people with general issues, stock shelves and run the register. The people I work with are amazing. As long as you stay positive around them, your day flies by an it only gets better and better. Management is usually pretty sub-par unless you need them immediately. Overall they are some of the nicest people I have ever met."
good,It was okay job.  It was fast pace job when you are working on the truck.  My most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers as a door greeter.
good,It is a nice place to work because for the most part you go into work knowing exactly wat you are supposed to do that day. And most of your co workers are nice. managment could really use some training and maybe learn to take better care of their employees.
good,Fun job. I learned a lot here and gain lots of customer service experience while at it.
good,Typical day at work as cashier. You can expect to have up and downs with the people
good,"It's a good job for someone who has never had a job before and is looking to be paid more than min. wage. Most of the time your co-workers are really nice and friendly, but there's also a few who aren't that great. Management here sucks and a lot of the time they treat you like garbage."
good,Over 25 years of working for Walmart store 1157 I have learned alot. Making sure the customer is number 1 and taking pride in my job and my assigned area of the store. I have more knowledge of cumputers and being self motivated to get the job done. Management has been a challenge sometimes but overall it wasn't bad. Most enjoyable part has been the customers.Making friends with most all of them and making them happy and satisfied that they found what they needed do to me.
good,Typical retail environment with the exception that everyone is always depressed.  The customer's seem depressed to shop there and the associates seem depressed to be working there.  This is the place to work when you can't get a job anywhere else and most people treat it as such.   Benefits are next to nothing.  Pay is below what most other retailers pay.  Good for college kids and wives who just want a job to get out of the house.  Managers are mostly do-nothing observers who you usually have to hunt down if you want to talk to them.  It is possible to go an entire day without seeing a manager.  I worked for almost 2 years and never even had a conversation with the store manager.
good,A typical day of work depends on the weather as if its a sunny and nice day that's usually how the day does. I learned to make the absolute most of all the resources that I have at my disposal. My co-Workers are good people that value hard-work and try their best to make a living. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the uncertainty of the weather as it can change at the drop of a hat. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is hard work and helps to both build up a tan and to get in and stay in shape.
good,"At Walmart, it was a friendly and fun place to work everyday. I learned that understanding customer service is very important to be successful at the job. The management overall seemed very positive. The co-workers were very nice and they were friendly. The hardest part of the job was that I wish that I could have caught all of the thieves in those stores, but unfortunately, that was not the case.The most enjoyable parts of the job were being able to stay happy and have fun while being at work."
good,my walmart experience wasnt the best but im sure not all walmarts run the same i got hurt and they didnt wanna give me benefits to go to the doctor the managers just kept talking about loosing thier bonus
good,It use to be ok to work for. The people that work there are nice. Pay is good.
good,Scanned merchandise and took care of returns and exchanges as well as other customer concerns.
good,"Put away all returns, stock new freight (movies and other merchandise throughout the department), pick, fill and bin Pick Up Today orders, bin Site To Store orders, answer phones, wait on customers at the register and answer customer questions about all the merchandise in the department and retrieve desired purchases from locked areas."
good,"• A typical day consisted of pushing carts in any weather conditions that my employers saw fit such as: Blazing heat and thunderstorms. I was a cart pusher and little else. I provided Customer Service occasionally."
good,"lot's of work evry day for the most part"
good,A typical day is walking into the unknown. Things and information change everyday. Multi tasking is a must have qualify. I've learn to always prepare and have a game plan as well as a back up plan. I've enhanced my situational problem solving skills. Communication with customers of all moods has strengthened my social skill set. The most enjoyable part of work is the Friday morning meeting. It rejuvenates and galvanizes the team for the next week.
good,A typical day at work was hectic with no proper management to lead associates. I did learn a lot from the positions I was involved in however I found myself figuring things out on my own nine times out of ten but once figured out the tasks became much easier always a learning experience. Management was very poor didn't know what was going on half the time and the other half felt like they didn't even care to try. My co-workers were all great very hard working at least the ones i worked with personally and got everything done as a team without managements help. The hardest part of the job was trying to take on certain tasks alone when it was supposed to be a team effort. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with my team on the overnight IMS crew.
good,"On an average work day I organized merchandise, took inventory, and rotated stock. I learned how to interact and communicate with a variety of different personalities. The most difficult part of the job working within the limited time frame. My direct co-workers were very team orientated and always willing to lend a hand."
good,enjoyed my time there. the location was new and had alot life in the building
good,I work very hard to deliver customer services to each and every customer that come threw my lane. I have learned to be very patient with customers. I get along very well with my co-workers. Our management does there best to make our job easier. The hardest part of my job is that I don't make enough money or hours to pay my bills
good,There is a lot of red tape for everything. The hours were descent. They give regular scheduled wage increases.
good,"Don't get me wrong, Wal-Mat is a great company to work for. Sam Walton had the right idea but every job isn't for everybody. I did learn cool things like working with a talzon and how to read labels.  The managers seemed bi-polar all the time. Maybe because it was night time. My co-workers made a lot of drama which I despise so there was really no communication with many of them. The hardest part of the job really was the people. The fun part the the actual work."
good,"My day would consist of being put in a 30 degree cooler for hours on end only to have a 15 minute break for every two hours. With little complaint about my work environment, I'd be treated by some of management as if it were my first day on the job, even after working there for several weeks. The best part of the job was the great people I was fortunate to work beside and spending half my time working on my own. The hardest part of the job was the working conditions; always working in freezing conditions caused physical pain and discomfort."
good,"I like working here at Walmart, the managers are good at what they do and they help out when needed."
good,"The managers are easy to work with associates are friendly"
good,Working at this particular Walmart was satisfying. My coworkers were good hard working individuals.
good,Generally I enjoyed working with the people in the store at Wal-Mart. though with some of the requirements they asked us to do at times it seemed that the pay was not equal to the work asked of us.
good,"Over worked, not enough help, Management does not back you up. Unreasonable expectations."
good,"Working at Wal mart was definitely a huge difference compared to my previous job at lowes. My job itself was nice because I was always busy regardless of trying to keep myself busy. There was always something to do next in the dairy department. The job itself required stocking milk, and other dairy products, helping customers, and making sure my work environment was safe and clean. My fellow co workers were very friendly and easy to work with and I felt lucky to have such great people to work with! The management lacked when it came to communications and I sometimes felt like credit was not given to those who deserved it but overall the job was a great learning experience and I felt privileged  I was given the opportunity to work there."
good,"Its always busy managing and cleaning wal-mart every night. Having to work at night shift is very tough. As one of the members of the management team, we are assigned tasks each must complete, from cleaning, wiping, waxing, and washing one area to another. "
good,"- Constantly deal with the results of management's horrible decisions"
good,"i unload trucks and stocked items, it warehouse work, help others and did work alone"
good,"Supervised and directed activities involved in overall operation of supper center"
good,"Boas empresas e concretizações de projetos."
good,"my workday was anything but typical never coming across the same thing twice"
good,we have had to do much more then what is on our job description. we don't get treated well. our back store manager is never any where in sight he doesn't help us even when we are short on staff and he doesn't manage at all nor is he good at it. not being paid enough for the amount of things we shouldn't have to do.
good,The company fires people for working. In other words the company was firing people for working past their five hour mark. I feel the company knows that people are applying all the time so they can get rid of people.
good,I work overnights and in a typical night all employees work freight.  They are timed and if someone doesn't meet the time they are written up.  The co-workers are hard workers and some of them are enjoyable to work with.  Full time employees hours have been cut or fired and now the company is employing temporary part time employees.
good,"You must like working with people at this job, which I do. I was a cashier at the walmart store. I handeled money and merchandise on a daily basis. I also did light cleaning around the store, and shipping and recieving in the back."
good,I really liked my job and the people I worked with. being there is like being with family for 8 hours of your day. if any one needed help with work or personal everyone always jumped in to help. I didn't care for our management. its like they all would for get where they came for and always be rude. walmart is not a company that tells their works thank you for anything that they do. it would be a lot better of a place if their management had more respect for the people that work under them.
good,Had a list to follow some to m rd equipment didn't work lots of team work
good,"Great company to work for but if you value holiday and time with your family, this will be a difficult place to work."
good,A typical day at walmart consist of cooking food and serving customers. Cutting meat and completing orders. Team work is definitely required in completing most tasks. I've learned how to work the spark system. The hardest part of the job is stocking the deli area while helping the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing our customers come back and visit us.
good,everything in Walmart was great the people there especially. but the wages that walmart gives you...is awful! NO body can live off of $8 an hour
good,"You get to your department and have your daily start-up meeting. Stretch then your off to the races. They always have ""GOALS"" that you need to meet but NEVER enough Unloaders hooking you up with good freight. They always bring you hard to process pallets or pallets you have to look up that take valuable time away from your production standards they keep you on. In DA receiving they have been through 3 manager changes and multiple associates since my 7 months there. I later transferred to RSR B1 and they are even worse. They show you a few things and then send you on your way. This building doesn't tell you that you are not meeting production goals until its time for you to sign off for that Step. Since my time there they have had a GM & A HR manager quit and they fired a HR manager with 13 years under her belt for some BS. The new school of Managers and GMs that they have there now are out to ""Clean House"". They are not trying to better this place, they are making it worse. They do not value overtime nor do they appreciate it. It's all about production per hour there. You're expected to make it even though you do not have the materials to make it. I've seen so many good hard working family people get fired for production and for ""Lack of"". Great pay for Delaware but hard to stay here under these conditions."
good,"Siempre fui una persona que solo se dedico a cumplir con lo que le correspondía, si tenia mis minutos de descanso,en el comedor aveces habia algo para tomar calentito ,para comer casi nunca había nada. Aprendí a trabajar como cajera, es lo unico que agradezco a la empresa ..Me gustaría si que aya mas control con la gente , muchos no cumplen con lo que la empresa pidió desde un principio,lo peor cuando le dan oportunidades de crecimiento a gente que no se lo merece ya que lo primero que hay que aprender es respetar a nuestros compañeros."
good,As a worker at Sonic I knew the day would be long but I made it through because of the co-workers I had and the customers that came made the job a lot easier that it was.
good,"As far as my co-workers  they are fun but the managers are messy."
good,Working at walmart was hard work (I did many positions but ended at truck unloader) some jobs are easy as cake while others (truck unloader) get WAY under paid for how hard the job is!
good,The company has changed over the years. I want to work for a company that recognizes knowledge and skills to help move up in the company.
good,i would clean the bathroom and clean spells up and swep the fell  i work 26 yourd a week  i load if jesus clean my up my miss i can clean other people miss  going frome one spell and have to goth to another sometime    i like like be aound people
good,"-on rentre, on poinçonne, on fait une réunion de personnel tout les matin, les caissières se font assigniez une caisse qu'on démarre. Puis on attend les clients, on scan les items qu'ils désirent acheter."
good,"Working at Walmart is a challenge. The actual work tasks themselves are usually simple. Cashiering, stocking merchandise, cleaning, etc. Customer interaction makes things much more interesting though. Sometimes the needs of a customer will take you far beyond your standard daily routine and you may not receive appreciation for doing so but this is necessary to provide good customer service. My coworkers became the best part of the job as everyone adopts a ""we're in this together"" kind of mentality."
good,"dia   de trabalho era corrido porem de muito aprendizado"
good,"good working conditions"
good,"There is a lot of room for advancement with this company, if you can handle the schedule changes and changes in management."
good,ok first time job not very much room for advancement. also for the work you do wish the pay would of been better same with benefits
good,"The company was okay to work for but I was hired as a part time but let go at Christmas saying I was seasonal, which was hard for me because of my kids. I stocked items and learned about the bar codes and matching prices. I enjoyed being around others and helping them."
good,They do not care about their people. Will not work with you on days off. Management is a bunch of kids. You do hard work in the bad with no pay.
good,the management at the newburgh walmart was less than satisfying. They did not and do not treat their employees very well. The co-workers are generally good people and hard workers. The hardest part o the job was the physicality of unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun you could have with your co-workers while still exceeding expectation regarding to work deadlines.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work but they were very preferential in their promotion from within process. Sometime they would not even open a position and just slide someone they wanted to have the job into it.
good,"can be long and hot or long and cold depending on the weather, lower level management are helpful upper level not so much wont speak to you directly, co workers are nice and friendly, hardest part of the job is not climate controlled, the people you meet and friendships you build is the best part off the job..."
good,A typical day at work involved restocking the sales floor. The employers were understandable and helpful.
good,if u dont want to move up in the store then do your best and it will be a great place but if your not like that  then most of the time you will have to pull underhanded tricks and do only what is needed other wise they will fire you and try to get you to come back so you can never move up but there a few gerat managers there that are overlooked and to find them is rare
good,"A typical day is always chaos, the stigma of the company gives customers an impression that the employees are not human and I was constantly yelled at, argued with, called names and even had items thrown at me. However the raises are better than you would expect, the direct supervisors are fair and understanding. In contrast the corporate and store managers are not. As I was a highschool student they worked with my schedule without issue."
good,Great people both customers and employees although very stressful work environment.
good,"They are good in there own way. They benefits are excellent."
good,I choose to do alot better and i did alot better when i left. i feel sorry for the people that are still working there working so hard for close to nothing
good,Wal-Mart has become a hard place to work.  Fewer employees are being employed and one person has to do the work of three now.  Everyone gets frustrated because management personnel never has the time to help them.  One thing I learned is to never move up to management without expecting a head ache.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart. I enjoyed the customer service experience as well as the advancement opportunities that were provided. Compensation was workable due to the 40 + hours given weekly. The only problem that I had with the job was balancing my work schedule with my personal life schedule. My schedule varied weekly from early morning shifts which could start at 6am, day shifts which could start at 1pm or evening shifts which could end as late as 2am. Morning and day shifts were fine to manage but the evening shifts were difficult."
good,"Wal-Mart has very loyal employees and staff. Other than that, it isn't a very good company to work for. No good benefits are administered and the higher level employees such as supervisors and management are not interested in employee happiness with the job or with them. Their only concern is with the sales and what the customers complain about. If an associate is leveling a shelf (stocking) and doesn't stock or level as taught and leaves holes or unfilled spots, the management never notices or tries to correct this. Causing a poor outlook on the store."
good,"Its really fun working in Walmart, all the co - workers are very co operative and caring. we do all kinds of work, like stalking, zoning , returns. Everyone does everything, there are no specific duties for a certain individual. All of our staff is very hard working., Especially on weekends we are really busy, we try to make customer experience better. Our management cares about their staff, they appreciate our commitment to work. Hardest part of the job is to market Walmart MasterCard, we need to convince them by telling them the advantages of Master Card. I enjoy working at Walmart and spending time with my team mates."
good,"As every day in Walmart,it is usual to have a long line of people to attend.Handling money and accurate changes is something to never miss.Co-workers only have fewest minutes to interacting each other.Many hours standing up is part of our everyday routine,and I take it as granted to do exercises."
good,fast paced job. learned how to work well with all kinds of different personalities
good,I like working here  it is interesting working back in oregon there are a lot of divers bunch a challenge every day
good,"A typical night at work, just to stock merchandise that are stacked up about 6 to 7ft.high and on 8 pallets. The merchandise had to be stocked on the shelf properly and neat at a certain amount of time, cardboard had to be cleaned up at a certain amount of time to avoid clutter."
good,Photo printing and editing for the best customers in the world was the  most enjoyable job I have ever had.
good,"lo que no m gustó fue el salario, ahí no dan salario por productividad, pero hay un buen ambiente de trabajo y lo mas dificl fue aprender a usar la caja"
good,I hated working here. Too stressful. Too much work for little pay
good,"Claims associate worked with all members of management, associates and vendors on a daily basis.   Learned how to control inventory. Hazmat teaching proper disposal of hazardous materials.  Constant learning environment."
good,I have learned that retail employees are under paid for the work that they perform.  My co-workers are wonderful and very proud of the what they do.
good,Average retail work environment. Opportunity for advancement. Low average pay for most positions.
good,"I was responsible for keeping my area zoned, stock items when needed, help customers with questions and concerns, Locate and retrieve items in the back room for customers, mix paint, cut fabric, make fishing licenses, help customers take out heavy items, bin items in the back room."
good,"I processed ordered, checked inventory, would help with unloading trucks and making sure the orders were correct and that they go to the correct departments."
good,"A typical day consisted of going in, zoning the shelves, and floors to see what needs restocked, and placing shoes back on the shelves, and helping customers find what they need.  I learned how to stock shoes in their correct places again. When I was sent to work in the software in the clothing dept., I loved the coworkers there, and enjoyed that, and that was the most enjoyable part of working there.  The hardestpart of working there, was getting the large boxed of shoes out of the warehouse to restock the shelves, They were very heavy and I had to quit due to the extreme pain from lifting those boxes."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers find products, performing phone contracts, and helping in the photo department. The best part of the job was the co-workers and a few helpful managers. The hardest part was being forced to work outside of my department on various occasions. Also, some of the management was not helpful and did not work well around school schedule."
good,"I miss the shop and all the people I worked with, I enjoyed my work and was known for my skills  at work and off, They had great benfits and the management was fairly good for the most part thee only thing I didn't like was working on sundays but I learned a lot about people and there needs helping people find what made them happy was the high point of my day."
good,"My coworkers we nice but try to get to into your life."
good,"My typical day at work was unloading truck"
good,"I worked at Walmart for almost three years as a produce associate. A typical day of work consists of culling fruits and vegetables, unloading the freight truck, and assisting customers find produce. Management was friendly yet they demanded the best perfomance from employees.  My co-workers was enjoyable to work around. The harddest part of the job was decreasing the size of produce pallets in a specific time limit.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new produce."
good,"While this used to be a great place to work, in the last 5-10 years this company has become a virtual slave market. They purposely under staff, forcing the first-line managers into an unbearable pressure cooker. They purposely understaff yet place more and more responsibility on each individual to perform more. When they do perform more, they cut staff even more."
good,handling the money and cash register while helping the customer with the check outs.holding conversations and interacting with the customers during there visits
good,"A typical workday at Walmart is very busy. I have learned a lot about retail and what it takes to keep customers satisfied. Management is not so good because eighty percent of the time their not on the same page, Some co-workers do not work together to make the work day run smoothly. The hardest part of the job is when others do not do what they are suppose to do which makes the next person job harder. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management recognizes you for your hard work and effort."
good,"good place to work for young people who want to work in customer service. it was a job that gave me some hours, and some money so i didnt complain, but it wasnt for me."
good,"Walmart was ok to work for. At the time I was there, the management would not give breaks when they were due. I would actually work untill my register locked me out."
good,"This was my first job and I have held it for over a year now. My store itself is okay, the managers aren't too lazy and know what they're doing. The real problem is the fellow associates they're extraordinarily lazy. My job is relatively easy but extremely time consuming. I have to clean the shelves in produce one area per night, as well as sort through every piece of fruit we have out on the sales floor. Because my job is easy, my boss is always talking about how I am lazy and don't do anything all night. The disrespect level is outstanding all over the store, but I'm told that's just how retail is in general. I work 40 hours a week and have set days off because I am overnight, but day crew gets really bad hours."
good,"Typical day at work is make sure that the customers and satisfied, I learned that being nice to people no matter if they are in a bad mood or good mood treating them nice is a big part of doing good customer service. Working with my go workers and making sure jobs are done right is part of team work. Hardest part of my job is dealing with mean people .  Enjoyable part is just doing a good job no matter what."
good,walmart was fun but managemet had no respect for thier employees
good,"Most days in L&G consisted of working as hard as a landscaper might. Loading bags of mulch and rock ALL DAY into someone's vehicle. Some days consisted of just watering plants, cashiering, and helping out customers as well as cleaning. I loved working there, just hated the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is the attitudes of some people. You will get the biggest jerks on the planet, male and female coming in. Just make the best of it. It's only temporary."
good,Very strict and demanding. Well take all your time. If your a full time student not the job for you.
good,The formation to long. The training is to long too. The delevry assistance isn t help for the truck driver...
good,Co workers was fun to be around and respectful. Management sometimes put too much on one person when they know the person is able to multitask.
good,"Instrumental in Inventory cost and control,Trained and managed 12 associates and achieved significant improvements in their productivity. Maintained a high level of customer satisfaction through attention to detail in defining needs."
good,"Would come in of an evening making sure we had what we needed to do our jobs. Checked the schedule. Loaded our merchandise, headed to our isles and started our night of work. Making sure the shelves we perfectly stocked. Helped customers through the night if needed. Once we completed our duties for the night, we would move on and help our fellow co-workers finish and clean up for the night. It was very fast pace and we worked together well to complete our duties for the night."
good,"The hardest part of this particular job was the constant change of store management. The rules were never the same from month to month and consistency was non existent. It was a large scale store with a lot of different employees all mixed together so there was some bumping of heads. I learned at this job that the best way to get things done, was to do just that; go to work, mind your own business and get things done."
good,"My most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was being in constant contact with customers and constantly receiving compliments from them for fulfilling their needs in a positive and timely manner."
good,Walmart was a great company to work for as long as you have open availability. There is always a chance to move up or move to another department. There is never a dull moment. I went from a door greeter to cashier to backup Customer Service Manager to Cake decorator. Customers weren't always the friendliest but generally if you are nice to them then they will be nice to you. Co-workers were awesome to work with. Everyone was always nice and helpful. It was usually like one big family.
good,"I worked with fun people on a daily basis and had challenges that kept things interesting. The co-workers had great attitudes and loved their job equally. The hardest thing about my job was showing up, meaning it wasn't very difficult at all."
good,"It's an company that focusing on the community,that  have open door policy,have good co workers.i like meeting customers and learning new things from them how we all buy and eat differently. I do  enjoy  Conversing with the Customers. The Scheduling can be rigorous as been by one self for many hour with fast pace enviroment."
good,"A typical day at work while at walmart was usually fast paced and full of projects. I learned how to read a plan-o-gram,use a telxon,run a register,and file claims. Most of their management works with the associates. The hardest part of my job was doing difficult task's by myself and the most enjoyable was always learning new things."
good,"I worked in the Electronic Department, it was easy because most of the Customers questions I could answer because of my knowledge & hobby for games, computers, and electronic which made suggestive selling easier and enjoyable."
good,"The hours are good, people are friendly but its just a matter of time before you get fired and everybody knew it."
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart is hard to explain, due to the fact that retail changes everyday. I run the electronics department, and I am over 10 associates. First thing I do a run through of the department, and check the outs that we have on the sales floor. Next thing we take care of the inventory log for the high dollar merchandise. Then create a schedule routine for the day to get new material out or purge the back room. Hardest part of the job would have to be the paper work for the dollar amounts gained and lost. Fun part is talking with the customers, learning from them and teaching them as well. Building the relationship with the co-workers has been fun to build, we have gained new associates but lost some as well. Building a team has been an expierence making everyone work together but also know what we sell and how to keep it stocked."
good,a fast pace place to work where you never have a dull moment flexible
good,"Flexible hours, great while in school. I cant say too much else because that is what I used it for."
good,"I provided customer service, loaded and unloaded trucks, operated the forklift, scissor lift, walkie stacker, and the electric pallet jack, I did all the training for the equipment, and kew how to work every department in the store. I also did all the carpentry work for that store and some of the stores in the surrounding areas."
good,Wal mart is an ok company but not good place to start for an retail career the coworker i had where easy going and fun to work with so it made the job worth the wild and also i was in high school when i started this job
good,Working at Walmart was never dull.  Things changed everyday and customers needed to be helped.  Advancing in the company can be expected by those people who work hard and are dependable.  I loved helping customers and getting them what they needed.
good,"It was a pleasure working with my co-workers and assisting customers. This job worked with for me because of my hearing disability which I enjoyed. Work schedule was very flexible. "
good,"work I had to nights and management and co-workers were never seen, long hours and work load were rough but could be worse.  Best part of the job was the pay, was making two dollars over min wage."
good,"The management always made sure breaks were given on time, however they will pry if they feel/hear if an employee is having a personal problem. No room for compromise in scheduling/transfer if an employee has to move or has a scheduling conflict at home."
good,walmart is a very busy place. cutting hours and not having enough employees to handle flow. i did love working with the people. Management was not around when you needed them for most parts. some we great.
good,"cash register"
good,"A typical day at work start with a meeting to get everyone organized in their departments for the night. Once you receive your assigned department you immediately go to work down stocking the freight left for you there by the unloaders. Once this is done you start breaking down boxes and stocking the products. Most nights a feature is also included in your freight, when this happens you have to use your judgement to place it strategically. a good placement will ensure the product moves quickly which makes room for your next feature. This was the part about the job I loved most. The other great thing about working overnights at Walmart was my co workers. some of the best people I've ever known and im still close with them today even though i no longer work there. The only reason I left was because I am a single parent of three, in school full time and Walmart only pays minimum wage with a .25 cent raise once a year.  It was way to much work for such little pay."
good,Wal-Mart is a typical retail work environment if you don't mind working long hours.
good,I enjoyed working for wal mart. I have to say that the schedules were very flexible for me. I worked in the produce department and it seemed that I was my own boss at times. I enjoyed to work at my own pace. The management was not very personable. At times it was like they could not differentiate staff from customers.
good,Many hours high stress level. Relocation frequent and required
good,"good staff"
good,A day at Walmart isn't to hard. I unload trucks all day. It makes the time go by faster. I get along with Every one i work with. My Managers are very far and go to get along with. I learn how to work with people and to sale.
good,"So far in the two years I have been at Walmart, I have been blessed to work alongside with nice and understanding supervisors who are willing to listen and respond to any concerns. Walmart has helped me practice my communication and team work skills. Overall I have been enjoying my experience at Walmart and have made many friends."
good,I love working with others. Customers always come first. The hardest part is not having management that backs up their employees.
good,Learned alot from this job about people and motivations.  The company has gone down hill.
good,"Cons:"
good,I liked working for Wal-Mart. The people were fun to be around and the customers were even better (sometimes).
good,works not too bad management doesn't require skill of work being preformed
good,"-lack of cummunication throughout upper managment"
good,"I loved working for Walmart untill one of my managers took a picture of me without my permission then proceeded to post it on Instagram with a derogatory comment. From the time the incident was reported till the time I left, my schedule was changed without me knowing numerous times, my hours where cut even though i was the only associate in my department, nd my normal morning hours turned to afternoon hours. The crazy thing is corporate reniged on there decision to fire her nd instead demoted her yet she was still in a management posistion."
good,"fast paced, lot of cashiering, customer service"
good,"*the typical work day was filling the floor, cleaning, and helping customers"
good,"Walmart has core values, but I rarely saw management abide by them. I do believe that all jobs are not for everyone, and this was not one for me. The hours were good, the pay was good for the type of company."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, they are very honest, open and smart people.  The compensation was somewhat lacking."
good,"After getting to work I would report to my supervisor and they would assign me to a register. I would help people check out and communicate with them to have good customer satisfaction. I learned how to handle good amounts of money and deal with a large amount of different people daily. Management was tough to work with because they have favorite employees and would favor them, The other workers were either really young or really old and didnt all get along with each other. The hardest part of that was being able to satisfy every person and all their difficulties in the store. The most enjoyable part was getting to work in a laid back manner and seeing so many people."
good,A typical day involved working diligently to ensure that issues for stores across the United States and even internationally are resolved as quickly and completely as possible. I trained many new associates and was a Subject Matter expert for our area. The hardest part of the job was managing the projects that were rolled out without any supporting documents or guidance for how to troubleshoot them or warning that they were coming. I developed relationships with the project leaders and worked to get the information needed for our teams.
good,"I liked working for Wal-Mart  in AZ but not in MO"
good,"I worked overnight and learned to run the cash reigster, a baler, and to use a pallet jack. management was kinda over the top on some things, co-workers kept you company and always challeging you to work harder. Hardest part was task time. Most enjoyable part was the employment were fun to be around"
good,its not a good place too work and or move in your field.. management is awful .
good,The company is a okay place to work; however the work is constant and sometimes stressful.
good,"Walmart was my very first full time job. I worked as a customer service representative behind the returns counter. My tasks included answering and directing phone calls, taking returns and compensating the customer, sorting merchandise and delivering them to their correct departments, and occasionally ringing up customer orders if the register became overwhelmed."
good,"Trabajo tranquilo, agradable, a traves de el adquiri experiencia en lo que es el trato con las personas, paciencia, respeto hacia el cliente, atención y disponibilidad para lo que ellos necesiten o pregunten, amabilidad, compañerismo, respeto entre compañeros de trabajo, ya sea hacia superiores o de la misma categoria y se crean amistades. Lo más dificil del trabajo es el trato con los clientes, la paciencia e slo fundamental y respetar la opinión del cliente."
good,All in all good job but you will not get rich at this job.  You can make a career here but you would need another income to live.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good job besides the lack of employees, you have to be prepare at all time.. they will be days where you will have to work by yourself and do oil change, battery and tires jobs. Its not just because of employees but the lack of scheduling by management but at the end I learned to be more responsible and more confident in my job just base of the negative and I feel as if I can tackle on the whole day by myself without any trouble on any car I run into"
good,"I worked here,i enjoyed the work,i leaned puncuailty,team player,custermer service.the management was not all good.my co-workers were fun to work with.the hardest part of the job,was working by yourself,maintaining 400 carts by yourself,cookouts"
good,Walmart is a good starter job. They offer good benefits as well if you can be hired as full time. Also a good part time job for those in school or retired. Can possibly be a career if sales is your goal. However there is an endless line of managers to go through if you have a problem either as a customer or employee.
good,"very busy, continually looking for ways to improve customer service and associate work life balance."
good,"A typical day at work for me depends on the department I work in that day.  I work as a cashier and a cashier at the customer service desk doing returns.  If I am a cashier, it is helping out my customers by ringing up their groceries/products, receive their money and give back their change, bag their belongings with great customer service. If I am working at the customer service desk, then I do returns with great customer service. I have learned with these jobs is to be an asset to my customers and make sure they are satisfied. Management here could use some improvement.  My co-workers are cool and we all get along just fine.  The hardest part of my job would be when customers come in with a bad attitude and give me a hard time.  My most enjoyable part of my job is talking and helping my customers and giving great customer service with a smile."
good,"there are no constants in this job, whats good one day, you will be penalized for the next."
good,I learned to sell and promote products. I learned how to order products. I learned to to build products and display them properly. I learned how to be a cashier.The hardest part of my job was having to cover several different areas at a time. The best part was helping a customer leave my area very satisified. I also enjoyed working with my friends. I really enjoyed helping the customers. A happy customer always made my day go great.
good,it was a good place to work at I just wish management treated us better and talked better to there employees
good,"Cashier/Customer Service"
good,Stocking produce products and responding to customers needs and providing great customer services
good,This was my first job and it was great since I was shy. I learned how to interact with colleagues and develop relationships with customers.
good,"Although I did love my job, many things made it hard to come to work with a smile on my face. Management was never on the same page when it came to policy and did not like when associates needed time off. Working at customer service was even more of a challenge, especially when a customer would be rude and derogatory to me and management still assisted them."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart with the public. However did not enjoy the work politics. Management in the beginning really cared for you but as they were cycled out and new came in it got worse.
good,"Manage employees, ensure merchandise is on shelf and available for customers, perform customer service daily"
good,es una empresa socialmenete responsable y con algunas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part day to day, sometimes it would get boring because you get stuck on a terrible job for multiple days, but for the most part it was great. i Loved the people that i worked with, and most of the managers. One thing that i didn't enjoy about working at that Walmart was the fact that the store was so messy and unorganized, and i also felt like the training should have been a little more so when they throw you out onto the floor you know how to deal with situations a little bit better. It really felt like a steep learning curve that you had to find out all by yourself."
good,The communication at this particular store was not very clear to many people telling you what to do and not agreeing.  Most management would not back up department heads so as not to tock the boat.   I did learn from the management that cared to take the time and properly train us.  I enjoyed my job overall though it was high stress to lack of communication.
good,"I would start my day out by counting are till to make sure it balance before my shift.. then I would give register assment to the  cashier. then I would go and verify the returns at the service desk.,make sure the cashier would get there break or lunch on time, my coworkers were a pleasure to work with. Iwould do any thing mangerment would ask me to."
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is a ok company but can be stressful, I think my co-workers make your day you interact with different personalities everyday"
good,"Walmart cuts hours, underpays you. Since no one gets hours, customers don't receive enough attentions. they give you crazy shifts so you cant really go for another job and if they find out you do indeed have another job they'll cut your hours some more. Upper Management does not appreciate anything you do."
good,"You stay busy, you must work detail oriented, and  pay attention to every one around you. Always an open door to speak to a manager. Co-workers work together and help each other any time possible.The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet every customer's needs. The most enjoyable, when the customer leaves satisfied with my customer service, and with everything they came to purchase, and maybe more."
good,Overall a great place to work but the salary is very low for a mother/father with school aged children.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. I learned a lot of people working skills. The management team was great and i enjoyed working with the team of employees i worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an unhappy customer.Working with the public.
good,There was a lot of routine there.  Customers were the only thing that was different just because each of them is so different.  I was there ten years and I have taken a lot of good and bad  lessons from them that have showed me how to be the best associate I can be.
good,"Night shifts "
good,"Management was rude, very disorganized and demanding. my position was underpaid but was interesting. My freight team were very good people."
good,"Come in see where Im  going for my sheft."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of doing the main operations of my job. Oil Changes, Tire mounting, repair, TPMS Sensor install, reset, Fuel injection services."
good,I had to work very late hours which in the end resulted in me having to leave the company.
good,I have learned alot working their.. made my experience working better to improve my life for future jobs.  Every customer that I helped were special that is what makes your business making them happy.
good,"I loved working here. Most of the customers were nice,coworkers were nice. Just one or so of the management associates decided to come and go whenever they decided, which sometimes made dealing with the customer and getting their needs and orders completed difficult. "
good,"Worked the cash - register, checked out customers, cleaned a small area, received payment. "
good,It is an ok place to work until you have a family crisis and need time off. I was there for 17 years and left because I had to choose between my child and my job.
good,"I enjoy interacting with the customers, but you basically work paycheck to paycheck."
good,I am very grateful to have a job with Wal-Mart and to have learned alot about the retail business.  I particularly enjoy my current position in Asset Protection.    
good,Fast paced environment is an understatement.  A typical work day was never the same.  The company would have different directives everyday.  I  had to be able to change me direction sometimes in minutes.  I had deadlines to meet everyday.  It kept me interested and excited about my job.  I have learned to be more patient by more vocal in the goals that needed to be met.  I learned to work with a ever changing management team to meet the same goals and directions in purpose of customer needs.  We achieved our goals daily to ensure instock was there for the customers.  If it wasn't for the customers there wouldn't be a job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers faces when they received the help that they needed and left with what they came to our store for.  I also enjoyed leaving feeling like I accomplished something everyday.  The hardest part of the job was to coach people for things they needed to improve upon.  But I knew that it had to be done for improvement of my area.  I did get better at it as time went on.  I believe that the people make the company a better place to work.  If you have good people you will have a good team.  If you have excellent people you will have an excellent team.  Training goes a long way to better improve my associates to ensure a smooth process.  Holding people accountable and being fair is on of the most important rules and standards to live by.  I do not ask people to do something that I wouldn't do.  I dig in with them.
good,"Sick all the time.  Worked overnights.  Also sold Prepaid Legal at the time.  I worked with the stores to replace their Cisco routers and switches, downloaded their software off the WalMart intranet.   Used the step by step directions already put in place to keep stores on line with the Home Office."
good,I worked overnight so the environment was pretty relaxed. Mostly I worked as a cashier so the job was easy.
good," My typical day was filling  the meat wall, damages, mark downs. And customer service."
good,I really didn't have a good experience working here. The management was not structured and they were not very trustworthy. they also made a lot of false promises.
good,"Commis au service à la clientèle"
good,"In my opinion a store is only as good as its management.  If a walmart has the right people running the store it is great, someone who loves their job, has good communication skills, and takes pride in their work."
good,"My over all experience with walmart was good, working with other associates, and customers. The only downfall for the company was being under staffed."
good,A typical work day would be steady getting the customerd in and out. Most of my co-workers are team players willing to assistant in any way. The hardest part of the day would be when we were short supervisior staff and you would need a key swipe. Whiling waiting as the employee trying to keep the customer happy. Most enjoyable part of the job is when most of your co-workers are professional meaning not having a attitude.
good,"I started out as a truck unloader and it was more fun than I thought it'd be. My coworkers were good people and management was easy going but respectable. I moved up fairly quickly, within 6 months I was a customer service manager. I enjoyed how challenging that job was, it required a thorough understanding of the rules and guidelines. I was responsible for scheduling cashier breaks and helping with returns. Eventually I moved to overnight accounting. I liked how laid back that job was. There was a lot to do but I had an office to myself, a radio, and was left alone most of my shift. When they cut the hours in the accounting office I had to stock shelves. It wasn't unbearable but I decided I wanted to move on and seek new employment."
good,"Very nice atmosphere. I enjoyed the early morning pep rallies, really kept you motivated during the day."
good,"Replenish shelves that are bare or low in stock and mark each item with a price tag."
good,"sometimes you feel as though you are the only one working."
good,great place to work if you have no bills that have to be paid as you get no over time and no raise for one year.
good,Terrible customer service from most fellow staff memebers.
good,"it depends on which shift you come in on. If you clock in at 6:00 A.M., you are baking bread. If you clock in later, you do the closing chores."
good,Wal-Mart was a good place to work although I did not like the different hours each day.  It was very busy and I liked that since I am not a person that likes to be idle.  The management could have used some work but as far as my co-workers I had no problems at all.  The hardest part of the job was unhappy customers and trying to make them happy.  Sometimes I could and sometimes there was nothing I could do to make them happy so I had to turn it over to a supervisor.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers and talking to them. 
good,A typical day included balancing the needs of the company with the needs of the employees under me.  I learned people skills in interaction with management and salaried employees.  Management was in flux.  I had 3 different Area Managers in 1 year.  The hardest part of the job was interacting with and keeping customers happy.  The most enjoyable part was balancing of the items needed to keep a business growing and profitable.
good,"We start off being slammed on the weekends more work than hours to get it done."
good,"A typical day at work included managing front end employees, ensuring all policies and procedures were conducted appropriately, resolving customer service issues, maintaining a safe and clean environment for customers and employees. I learned to always hear the customer's needs.  Customers will continue to come back if they are treated with respect and are heard when there are concerns.  Management was not willing to implement change conducive to growth and development of the company.  My co-workers admired my desire to try new things and my customer centered approach.  The hardest part of the job was having a customer compliant and tracing where the breakdown occurred to prevent future customer escalations.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all of the customers and employees on a daily basis who were always willing to embrace diversity."
good,"un día típico demasiada gente impaciente,aprendí q siempre ahí que empezar el día con buena predisposición y mucha paciencia,a manejarme rápido con la plata y tratar de dejar siempre conforme al cliente la gerencia bien organizados y humanos. mis colegas muy pocos con buena onda la mayoría hasta diría que mala predisposición para con los ""nuevos"", lo mas difícil lidiar con la gente que muchas veces va alterada y tratan mal e insultan a los empleados,lo mejor conocer a mis compañeros y en lo posible siempre generar buenos climas de trabajo que el sistema anda a la perfección y no perder tiempo con los clientes."
good,"A typical day of work began by setting the back room with pallets on the floor in appropriate position for distribution from the truck. Then each team member had a position on the line with one person unloading the truck. When trucks were complete, certain pallets were pulled to the floor and certain sections could be stocked by our team until a later hour where all pallets were pulled to the floor for the night stocking team to work."
good,"I worked the christmas holiday which was a very busy time, everything and everyone was busy. Management was all over the place so sometimes we didn't have a manager around for help which led to unhappy customers. "
good,A typical day at work was very interactive and challenging.
good,"llegaba a recibir mi efectivo, me asignaban una caja y comenzaba a cobrar, atender a la misma vez al cliente vendia tiempo aire y otras promociones que tenian aparte de cobrar tarjetas y otros servicios habia prom ociones para cajeros del mes por tener productividad y otras aptitudes mas, lo gane 3 veces de 22 cajeros que eramos me llevaba bien con todos y mi jefe directo siempre me daba consejos de como ser una mejor persona y responsable aprendi a tratar con todo tipo de personas y ademas luego yo estaba en atencion al cliente y aprendi que por mas dificil que este un  cliente tu debes de guardar la calma y tratar de resolver sus necesidades lo que mas me gusto fue que aprendi atratar a las personas con diferente caracter y necesidades lo mas dificil fue que tuve que salirme por el sueldo "
good,Stocking shelves and neatly stacking items fully on the shelves and responsible for throwing any trash away into the baler. I learned about stocking displays on the other side of the store. Management was actually average and I loved working with my co-workers because we could get everything done before our shift was over. The hardest part of the job I would say is zoning the shelves making everything look neat. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the actual stocking part.
good,"A typical day at walmart is dealing with customers that just dont wanna look for things themselves."
good,"I always had something to do, so my day was always over before i knew it."
good,Walmart is a great experience. You can have fun and meet new people. the Friensho[s...\
good,"i learn alot from wroking there,i would work there again the management could be better"
good,"If you currently don't have a job, I'd recommend at least applying to Wal-Mart. They have decent scheduling capabilities and they're everywhere. I myself worked as an overnight stocker. I was easily making more money there at 20-30 hours a week than I have at any of my full time jobs elsewhere. Just beware, management under the ""Co-Manager"" Level are highly uneducated, and will more than likely create more problems then solve the ones you needed. This is not a job where you try to get to know everyone, it's a job where you show up, do your job, and keep your mouth shut most the time. Alot of people, especially overnight crews are going to try to gut you for hours so unless you knew them outside of work, best bet is to just work quickly, quietly and get paid."
good,"Optician, pre doctor exam testing, eye wear lab technician; Electronics Dept. sales; "
good,"Very understanding when it comes to working around peoples schedules for school etc."
good,The most enjoyable part was to get to know my costumers and their needs.
good,"I liked to cashier position, I was not there too long due to the fact I had to move back to NC"
good,"A mi me encanta cocinar, iba y realizaba lo mejor pero habia una gran incomodidad y luego me lo hicieron saber que era muy buena en mi trabajo pero no querian mujers trabajando en ese sector."
good,I didn't hate working for Wal-Mart but I could say it was a place that had one to many chiefs and not enough Indians. information got lost in miss communication. works would get blamed cause they follow what one manager tells them and the other didn't like it. They have great benefits however only if you work more then 38 hours and Wal-Mart tries hard to make sure you don't work 30 +.   
good,Management is ok. good co-workers.  Learned a lot about retail.  Steady work.
good,It was a fun laid back work environment and it is possibility or stability and progression within the work place.
good,favoritism at the location I worked. production required even when freight is low and  voluntary time off.
good,"Im just glad I dont work there any more, the managers are not fair, after you been there for years, they find away to fire you."
good,"Working for walmart has been a pleasant experience. My job was fun and the people that work there are generally friendly people. Management seemed to pay no attention to the efforts of their workers though. Some employees would come in late everyday, and back from breaks/meals late everyday and management never cared. It's good for them I suppose, but not good for the workers who are actually on time. "
good,"•	Collaboratively spearhead full-scope store operations including customer service, loss prevention, asset protection, merchandise management, staff leadership, and employee relations."
good,Good job with average pay and good benefits. Poor management.
good,"As Produce Sales Associate a typical day consists of culling produce, keeping areas stocked, making sure environment is presentable to customers. Engaging customers when in need. "
good,"I had worked at Walmart for two years under the previous to current, management, I covered more departments than in my original job requirements. I was spoken to for questioning my superiors ability to perform my duties, even after one had made an error and had to go to court as a result."
good,This job has been very beneficial to me in order to help me get through college and pay my bills but it is not a job I would like to continue doing for the rest of my life.  I would rather be using the skills I have learned in school and feel like I am doing something more valuable.  Management does not seem to care about their employees or the fact that we can't do our jobs successfully without them providing more help in our departments but they still expect everything to be done. 
good,"Non-stop, never-ending work"
good,Was given my assignment and worked at my register or out in the lot. Worked on whatever task I was assigned. Was often moved around to help other employees.
good,"the persons I worked were good, hard working people.the best part of the day was when someone smiled and said thank you for all your hard work."
good,It was a very great environment to gain more knowledge on customer service but the employees were the issue. 
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. It was my first job and I will always remember how much working there taught me about work ethic. 
good,"I was hired for a cart attendant from the get-go. I was paid $7.90 hourly for the entirety of my employment. A typical workday for me was being outside and bringing in carts. Many days this was a task I had to do myself as call-outs were a common thing here. If it was too sunny or rainy I would have no coworkers and I would constantly have to pick up the work they would've done. This wouldn't have been a problem if I had the managers send out extra workers to help but this was not something that happened very much. Over the course of my employment I had at least 4 coworkers either get fired, quit, or transfer to another store/department because of various reasons. This was the hardest part of my job. Having to maintain a steady quota that was meant for more than one person. This meant that many times I had to stay later on my shifts to help out due to my ""perfection"" attitude. I eventually had to leave due to the dwindling condition of a family members health. While I was there though, I had the pleasure of working with some of the best managers in all of my work history."
good,"Show up, clock in and then off to work. helped customers with there needs."
good,é uma empresa boa de grande porte mas com o tempo as pessoas começaram a ficar sobre carregadas pois muitas procuraram outro emprego...
good,"Era muito bom trabalhar nessa empresa eu só sai por motivos salarial ."
good,every employee was ok we all work together my job wasnt difficult at all our manager supported and help if we had any problems
good,"Aprendi muito profissionalmente nesta empresa que afinal é uma multinacional. Com muitos desafios em alcançar metas, apresentar bons resultados, aprendemos ser humildes uns com os outros, nos ajudamos. O melhor lugar que ja trabalhei, onde mais aprendi como profissional e principalmente como pessoa, apesar da rotina desgastante que é o varejo."
good,Typical work day involved being understaffed. Breaks were not given out properly. Management was not dependable and usually were trying to do the best they could with the staff on hand. Learned to just more patient in the team sense of the work. Co-workers worked hard and were great people. Lack of staffing was worst part of job. The constant flow of customers was the enjoyable part. 
good,"Location:"
good,"I learned a lot from this job especially from my co-workers and customers. This whole job was a great experience for me.  "
good,"Long working hours and not able to work well with difficult schedules or time off requests. No room to grow. Really fun to work for and coworkers are great but not alot of communication with managers other than a select few. "
good,"I love my coworkers and managers, however Walmart as a company does not value its' employees and it shows in compensation and benefits. "
good,"Ever changing work demands"
good,"Fun place to work.  Fast paced.  Learned to take inventory and make sure all inventory was accounted for.  Unloading, and unpacking were the hardest parts of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know different people."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and all the different departments I was trained in at Walmart. The only thing that I disliked was the lack of understanding when it came to family, illness and other such personal incidents."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. Management would not work with my school schedule and work schedule. I was hardly home and never got to spend time with my son.
good,I worked in a fast paced distribution center. High volume output frequently. Learned how to seriously be safe in a dangerous environment.
good,Its a good job if your fresh out of High School. Most of management are not people that work well with others. The benefits are very well for the type of job that it is.
good,They throw you into your job with little to no training and expect high demands.
good,"This is a good company if you just want benefits. I worked full-time and only had enough money to pay for the benefits for one person. "
good,"Wasn't to bad to work for. they were very stingy with there year end raise and didn't have much control over your department in whet we carried. I was also hard having a store Manager that never left his office and had no idea what was going on in his store."
good,"Love the days when we're busy!  Filling prescriptions and answering the phones, are the majority of the work here.  I also run the register which gives me the chance to directly interact with the customers."
good,i liked working on the cars. i enjoyed the people i got to meet 
good,"The work experience is roughly what you would expect from working in retail, consistent but lesser hours on occasion, minimum wage, low supervision, and can feel very rushed at certain hours."
good,"* A typical day at work for me was going to work clocking in, scanning my badge and getting assigned a register.. then getting my paper for my meal times and breaks. cashing costumers out the correct and right way. Once your day is done you leave."
good,"pay is scarce the hours are all over the place, no stability."
good,"Though i work in the TLE bay, i am constantly pulled inside to do other work due to the fact that we are very understaffed. When that doesn't happen I'm usually outside working on customers vehicles. The hardest part of the job is keeping my patience with management due to consistent mistakes."
good,It's getting considerably hard to advance in this company. New programs everyday push you to the next level. Hardest part is pleasing management overall. I've learned a lot in the retail business from this place. Odds and ends. 
good,I am fortunate to be the shoe associate which gives me the freedom to really spend time chatting with customers and offering assistance. Working to keep the department neat and orderly can be quite challenging however. My co-workers and management are all hard workers and people of integrity.
good,work on cars and trucks and clean shop. good co-workers.8 hrs day no overtime.
good,Working for walmart was fun and easy going but the management had no way to deal with a hard day. They didn't know how to spread employees out to compensate for over goods in one area. On he other hand though everyone was very nice and it was fun to meet nw people while you worked.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things on the job daily. "
good,"It depended on what hour you go in. Could range from putting out all of the salads for the day and going through all the meats and cheeses, checking dates and stocking the cold cases. Or picking up on dishes or long lines of customers if you go in on a later shift."
good,"They offered a good discount, a lot of available hours, and offered good benefits."
good,"It was a fine job at the time, mostly just handled sales transactions and worked in the clothing section. However, I felt like the management did not know me personally because there were so many people working there. "
good,"A typical day at work would include running a cash register, showing firearms to customers, selling ammunition, selling fishing and hunting licenses, and making sure the department is zoned.  I have learned the basics of running a cash register and completing a 4473 form for selling firearms.  Management is consistently changing but I would say that we have a good team in place right now.  A few of them have really helped me out in my time with the company.  I like all my co-workers and think we have a pretty cohesive unit in my department.  I wouldn't say there is anything that I have a hard time with in regards to my position.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction with customers.  I deal with a lot of different customers each day and I take satisfaction in making their day easier."
good,"A typical day at work was busy with many tasks to complete and many customers to attend to. Working at Wal-Mart definitely changed my view about working in retail; it is a lot harder than it looks. The management was good for the most part, although I did not like a few of my department managers because they seemed to treat some of us in the department a little unfairly.I liked most of my co-workers and got along with all of them. I think the hardest part of the job would be when there were hardly anyone there to work that day except for 2-3 people, because at times when it came to lunches and breaks, you could end up having to run both the jewelry and clothing department (including the phone and fitting room) alone (which I have done several times). The most enjoyable part is being able to successfully help a customer. "
good,"very fun enviroment , plenty of work to do , always crowded , i love dworking here"
good,A typical day meant fats paced interaction with a variety of people. The hardest part of the day is quitting time when i'm enjoying my day. Most of the co workers are quite pleasant.
good,"Um dia de trabalho começamos com start up e depois íamos para as nossas áreas de trabalho. Nestes 9 anos aprendi muito seja com os colegas, gerencia e meus subordinados. A parte difícil era quando não tínhamos como receber os caminhões agendados, e a parte agradável era quando conseguiu ir para casa com todas as oportunidades do dia resolvidas."
good,"Depending on the position you fill, your never bored. There is always something to do or someone to help. Management is usually easy to get along with with the exception of some."
good,• Contributed customer service skills to team and maximized the effort to enhance productivity while providing quality customer service.
good,Overall this is a company that assists their community to their fullest degree. Has great staff and management. Trains their staff to provide excellent customer service.
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart was fun, fast paced, and exciting! I loved but i also hated that i was cross trained to stock, run cash register and be a sales floor associate.I liked the fast pace work environment as well as being able to interact with the customers. On the other hand when your crossed trained and they are short anywhere Wal-mart loves to pull employees whenever and from wherever they want. I really liked this job the only catch was their scheduling."
good,I learned Inventory control and how to properly stock shelves I also learned good house keeping skills while working and I learned how to manage my time while working in various departments.
good,"I worked overnight stocking groceries, the first couple of weeks were difficult because I had just been cleared to work by my doctor for breaking my arm in half, and got some metal plates installed. The work is a bit physical but easily manageable if your in decent shape."
good,A good place to work if you're going to school. Steady paycheck and overall great co-workers.
good,This was my first job and my location was very dysfunctional.
good,I learned how to have confidence in my approaches with customers. The management team for the most part were okay. I really enjoyed working with my co workers. The hardest part of working at Walmart was lifting so much pounds a night. The best part of the job to me was having supportive co workers that you could go to for assistance.
good,"Most days at this job, time flies by which is good when you are on your feet 7-8 hours of the day. I have learned that when dealing with a customer you need to let them know that you care about their concerns and/or situations that he/she is going through. Sometimes depending on what the customer is demanding it gets hard to smile and acknowledge their problem to the fullest, but I have learned to smile and show that I do care about their problems that they were having in the store that day. Management at Walmart is very short staffed, meaning that if you are having a problem at the register it can take up to 30 minutes before a manager comes to see what is wrong, which in the long run not only makes you wait, but it also leaves customers waiting in line therefore making customers very uneasy because they just want to get out of the store and go about the rest of their day. My co-workers are the best co-workers anyone could ask for; they are so considerate of one another. Not only do we work hard as a team, but we have so much fun-one could barely describe it as doing work. The hardest part of the job is when a customer complains about something they need to return or exchange and you would gladly let them do it, but then a manager tells you that type of sell is not allowed because they purchased an electronic item and you (the employee) has to tell the customer that you can not do the sell which unfortunately sometimes makes the customer unhappy and irate. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you just had a rush then it starts to slow down for a bit and you go redline"
good,"WalMart treats their managers as glorified associates, expecting them to do their own work as well as any work not done by associates. Work on the salesfloor is done first, admin paperwork generally gets done on your off time."
good,I work Monday through Friday. I started as a shoe sales associate and worked my way up the ladder. I am now a pharmacy technician. I like the people I work with but the pay is not enough for a family to survive on. Another con is walmart policies are always changing or their adding on some policy.
good,"Work day is typically full of tasks and projects to accomplish by end of shift. I've gained more experience as a leader working with other leaders to come up with creative ideas that will benefit customers, the department and the store as a whole. The management team is supportive and open to opinions from associates. Hardest part of the job is doing it all while still maintaining excellent customer service. as difficult as it may seem, it is also doable and rewarding."
good,I love being Busy Love running the register and meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work. walk in punch in go behind the customer service counter to acquire a work radio that courtesy clerks were required to carry for when a customer needed help inside the store with either bringing their items to their car or helping them retrieve a large or heavy item. Put on a safety vest go out into the parking lot and push rows of shopping carts into the store by hand, help customers when called to on the radio until my shift ended."
good,"I loved all my co-workers , hardest thing to do is push a loaded pallet of sugar"
good,Pues mucho trabajo en temporada aprendi a tener en orden tu espeacio de trabajo para no hecerse dificil la busqueda de los productos en el tiempo que labore alli muy mala administracion mas por parte de recursos humanos pero de alli todo bien los colegas amables la parte dificil lidiar con consumidores que te dejan los productos por toda la tienda pero me gusto el estar activo en todo el dia no te aburres.
good,Stocking the shelf. bin the over stock. Pull the truck. The hardest parts would be the lefting
good,Basically when I worked there in Springfield the store was so busy it felt like I was doing the work of 3 people. The best part of the job was meeting all the great people who do work there and becoming friends with them!
good,"we are always busy ....hard working , i have learned speed and accurracy and valueble customer service"
good,"great place to work, very busy, great benefits, loved working here."
good,"Stocking inventory on the sales floor and assisting customers in the home, grocery and health and beauty departments."
good,"Walmart, as a company, has good core values."
good,its an ok job. good benefits and pay
good,"Working at Wal Mart was about overall, an average place to work. Major cons, and pros at the same time. Leveled out."
good,"bom local de trabalho,mas as mundanças de horarios dificultavam um pouco."
good,"i would usually help customer out wit bills, money center etc,"
good,"Receiving freight, labeling it and proceeding to throw it on the line. I have learned many computer skills, and proper techniques of lifting. Management is always being switched around we have many people to go to though for issues its called the open door policy. The hardest part of the job is the physical ability you need to do it, its hard on the body. T he most enjoyable part of my job is the long weekends we get from Saturday through Monday."
good,typical day - check in - go to work area - chat with customers - get all of your work done :) - chat with coworkers - go home
good,Busy fast pace. Mananagement didn't always hier enought help to do a professional service to its customers. Perpared bHot And Cold Items. Ran a fryer and a meat/Cheese slicer. Customers were great.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being treated wrong by my department manager, or working by myself in the cooler. I learned how to bin items, and pull picks. The management there was the nicest. If you went to them about a certain problem by using their open door policy it did no good. They would report what was needed to be reported, but wouldn't do anything further. A couple of my co-workers were friends of mine before I started there and they were great, and a lot of the other people I worked around were great. The hardest part about this job was the heavy lifting when I have a bad back. What I enjoyed most about this job was being able to work by myself for the most part on the weekends."
good,I work ten hours for four days a week where I've learned the ins and outs of shipping and receiving. The hardest part of the job is working through the weather elements in a warehouse. The most enjoyable part is the diversity in the co-workers.
good,"The people are fun and the management is very hard working. The store is clean, ran with a strong hand, and everyone can work well with each other."
good,As a member of management you worked 50 plus hours. Had managers that expected the job to come first.
good,"I usually work in the dairy or in the backroom, however my managers use me in all different parts of the store because I know them all well. Using a gemini (work electronics) we pick merchandise out of the backroom and take it to the floor for the associates to work and put it back in the system after it has been worked. I've learned to deal with different people and a variety of personalities working with fellow associates as well as an array of customers. The hardest part of the job is everyone working together and on the same page. It seems as though management between nights and days aren't always communicating the right things and we tend to redo a lot of things over and over again. The most enjoyable part of the job is the few friends I have made which make the job worth it however a better opportunity is wanted because this is not a career and I want to start something I can evolve with."
good,I feel the pace of their growth has outdistanced their ability to find qualified people to run their stores. I spent a majority of my days correcting stocking problems from others and stocking the product they could not put up. It's hard to function properly when you are not able to do get to your own responsibilities when you are constantly dealing with messes and don't have authority over those that you depend on to help you.
good,Hard physical labor. Learned how to change tires and batteries on most cars and trucks. Management was professional. Co-workers were friendly and knowledgeable. Hardest part was physical labor. Most enjoyable part was interaction with people.
good,"I am currently used as a floater to the produce, meat, dairy, and frzen departments. I stock the sales cases, and correct counts and place orders for the dept. managers and assess throws or damaged product."
good,"Basic Cashiering, handling money. Customer Service."
good,"What I remember when I worked there is that freight is very heavy and very mixed when it comes on pallets. This job could be fun, but it wasn't for me."
good,"A cultura desta empresa é excelente, mas não cumprida como seu criador gostaria que assim fosse. A gerencia deixa muita desejar com relação a relação lider/associado base."
good,"La empresa Walmart (Presto) es una empresa que permite el enriquecimiento de sus empleados, se hacen constantemente cursos de capacitación para fortalecer el conocimiento de estos."
good,"Uma empresa que permite aos seus associados crescimento. Com pessoas muito agradeveis de se trabalhar,"
good,"Typical day was showing up and dealing with rude customers. You cant make everyone happy no matter how hard you try. The management isnt much help most of the times had to take the hit for mistakes that werent my fault. The best part was my co-workers built strong relationships and the support shared was well needed. Learned its complicated to successfully run a business without the structural support, organization, and the correct attitude. Without the heavy demand of the essential everyday products this company offers, i doubt they would stay in business."
good,"A typical day at work I would start counting money and sorting coins and bills in cash drawers.Ensure the amount is correct and there is adequate chang.Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas,and greeted customers entering the store. Scan iteams and calculated total sales"
good,working at walmart was a good way to learn customer service and to handle problems in a fast efficient way.my managers were great but they wouldnt switch my possition when i asked because of sexual harrassment. my co workers were great people and hard working. the hardest part of the job was just when it got busy some days. the most enjoyable part of my job was everyday. i loved working there.
good,"It was kind of difficult, they would always change their minds at a drop of a hat, other then that it was good. I liked to work with the customers."
good,"It is a good place to work. The benefits r great they paid 18,000 for a sergury i needed. Management is not that great on other hand. They do not care about employees or thier family. Other than management it is good place to work"
good,I enjoyed my time here. However it does not leave much time for a home life or time with your family.
good,"working with the public is always a great experience! Although the managers expect to much out of a person, working with the individuals on a one on one basis can be fun and entertaining!"
good,"The typical working day is hectic, trying to keep the salesfloor stocked, but management only cares about the back room. Management and other associates very friendly, but pay and benifits are stiff and hard to qualify for"
good,"a typical day at work is a lot of conversateing with customers and fellow employees. I learned how to work a cash register, and help customers with any problems or concerns."
good,"A typical day at work involves manual labor with a maximum lift of 65 pounds, providing top-notch service to the customers in produce and surrounding areas, culling, crisping, stocking, zoning, processing throwaways, working management notes, breaking down pallets, putting away freight, cleaning, setting COMAC and modulars, building features and displays, performing electronic duties such as counts, and modular verification."
good,"Boa de trabalhar porem é puxado o serviço, pessoas bem comunicativas e relacionamento bom com gerentes e lideres"
good,Wal Mart only cared about their statistics and profits versus employees and their benefits
good,A la gerencia no muestra interes en tu estado de salud solo le importa la produccion
good,"Getting stock to stock shelves with, I learn that it takes a lot of people to stock the store when new items come in. Management is always willing to help, co-workers learn to work together when the job need to be done. hardest part about the job is sometimes you have to pull those plattes with heavy items on them by your self. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting, and helping the customers"
good,Some of the hours that they want you to work are ridiculous if you have children at home. Sometimes can be very strict on cetain things but overall its an ok job.
good,"A typical day at work included interacting with customers and making sure the store was always clean. I didn't enjoy my co workers, they didn't seem to enjoy their jobs very much. The hardest oart of the job was interacting with my co workers yet the most enjoyable part was learning how to trust myself in giving opinions and help to others"
good,"Loved the customers, loved the work, however, management at this particular location is biased,and dishonest"
good,Wal-mart was a good company it was just time for me to find a job for what I went to school for that's why I decided to resign.
good,"A day at walmart usually go's well, fun energetic, always busy,putting returns and stock up, zoneing, making the store look presentable, but most importantly delivering the best customer service possible. I have learned you have to treat each customer according to their needs. Help each other out at busy times. management is something to be desired, they could be a little more appreciative, and more respectful to the underlings that make the store what it is. point out the positive and not just the negative. The co-workers are great they come together when things need to be done, friendly environment. The best part is making the customer happy knowing that you were the one that satisfied them with wat they were looking for, i dont think there was a difficult time at work, except when us floor associates get called up to be on the register when the cashiers are overwhelmed, so we have to work harder to catch up on our work."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very stressful , its not enough workers, some workers have to work at least 3 departments a night. The co workers are wonderful , their all about teamwork and getting the job done. The hardest art about the job in wich i currently work is that there are not enough people and it makes the job harder."
good,Some of the the co-workers were great to work with others did not want to work as a team but wanted to put off everything on others causing them to not be able to get their own work down especially when it came to some of the department managers. I also did not like the fact that you work and do your job and yet you did not get recognized for the work you did because others especially department managers took the credit for things they did not do. I had a bad experience with company. I am sure that other department managers did not act the same way but the experience I had was not good. I will say that store management work well when you had family emergencies and understood. Also I loved the fact that you could limit your availabilty so you could attend church and they stuck to it and did not expect you to come in on the days you were not avaiable.
good,"customer service, binning and picking of merchendise from back room, facing shelves."
good,calling management in the stores and talking with associates about the incident that took place. Getting video from apc associate. Talking with customer that had the incident in the store taking the report.
good,"I really enjoyed a typical day working at Walmart. You clock in, see the greatest friends in the world and at the same time you see your regular customers greeting you with their friendly faces. Some specific customers would search specifically for you, so that you can brighten their day with your beautiful smile and warm conversation. Each day was filled with enjoyment."
good,"A typical day at work would depend if I got the opening or closing shift. If I got the opening shift, I would start up all the machines, put away the daily stock, help customers as they come and go, complete the daily cleaning log. The closing shift included helping the customers as they come and go, completing the daily cleaning log, organize the lab into a neat place, cash out at the end of the night, and shut down the machines."
good,Walmart was very good about hiring part-time employment. As an employee you are trained and deligated to go to any department when needed for customer service or team help.
good,"You meet new people everyday, and you are constantly moving."
good,"Greeted customers as they approached the check out line, assisted them with questions about a product. Handled cash and/or credit card payments."
good,"I didn't like workin here due to the fact that alot of the employees complained about working, and also some co-workers tried to hold a managers position when it was not their title."
good,we unload trucks restock shelves i learned the areas of food and freigh goes etc. managment was really poor they changed the routine contiuesly times managers come in late
good,it is a job. Didn't really like it. poor management. too much work...didn't pay good at all.
good,"Bem produtivo, aprendi as responsabilidades de um analista de estoque, um bom grupo de colegas."
good,A typical day at work. I arrive in the mornings at 8:30 am or 7:00 am
good,"Aprendí bastante gracias a la capacitación que me brindó mi subjefe, compañeros agradables."
good,Always busy and always met interesting people as well as getting to know regulars. You aways learn something new and are always on your toes.
good,"My typical day at work consists of first clocking into the system and heading to the Management office to sign out my keys. Most of the time I have a wait of 2 minutes to 20 minutes depending on where Management is at the time they were called. From there I would go up front to the wireless store where I would count down the money in the registers, turn on the computer's, and perform out daily audits and put away any freight that came in from the previous nights truck."
good,i enjoyed working for them but once i got hurt on the job they said they would give me therapy and then they denied it because they said i was hurting because of my pregnancy..and till this day i hurt and i had my baby 2 months ago. they never gave me an xray or followed up.
good,My day at work consisted of providing top quality customer service to hundreds of customers a day as a cashier in a fast paced retail environment. I learned to be a efficient and valuable member of a retail team. I also learned how to successfully interact and work effectively within a diverse work team.
good,"Um dia normal no emprego se dava em chegar, abrir meu caixa, conferir o dinheiro, atender os clientes passando suas compras, fazendo pagamento de contas, efetuando recargas de celular, prestando informações, ao longo fazer retiradas de dinheiro do caixa.. e ao fim organizar e fechar o caixa."
good,store open 7 day week 8 to 9 pm
good,"Using multi-tasking skills to assist customers, answer phone inquiries, secure merchandise, answer basic technical questions."
good,Signed in each day and was grateful to have the job. Made sure my working station was clean and orderly. I initially helped set up the new store. Worked as a clerk at a cashiers station. They were very patient with me and my learning from scratch. Co-workers were congenial and kind. It was hard to deal with some of the customers very bad attitudes. Most enjoyable to be working.
good,"My experience with walmart is fairly mixed across the board.I found that i was always on the same time each day everyday regardless of what was needed,The department was knowingly understaffed in a department that usually has eight.There was at the highest only three people including the department manager for the department meaning the extra work was passed onwards.I had one direct manager over the department above the department manager being one of six assistant managers,two co managers and then the store manager himself.This would lead to some miscommunication on problem's when my direct manager was unavailable.Due to understaffing of different area's of the store itself,more than one department would be staffed with one person being at the most i watched three departments at any time.The compensation and rate of performance review's were very good but I felt underappreciated always,Mostly getting praise from other assistant manager's or both co-managers just not my own manager with my work.The reason for my departure was never clarified by management with the store and corporate itself when they were suppose to contact me and help resolve the issue,sadly nothing was done for me despite my follow ups."
good,"the job is really easy and doesnt require any hard work. The managers are awful, but as long as you stay busy, it isn't too bad. The pay is not good at all and it is hard to make any decent money at the job, but its not bad for a college student or a supplemental income."
good,"fun place to work, tho there is favorites, and they are pretty much invisible, there is slight amount,"
good,very busy atmosphere co workers were very friendly an the most enjoyable part was the co workers because they understand what you have to deal with sometimes
good,"My typical day at work is in I come into work a 8am and begin my tours to our accounting office to check to see if there are shortages from the previous days transactions. I investigated the shortages for internal theft, mishandling funds, or policy violations. I review the previous nights high dollar merchandise checkin process to verify that we were not short merchandise from the warehouse. I investigate shortages for internal theft as well. I check for any accidents and if there are I investigate these accident claims throughly. I respond to security threat on he premises, and call law enforcement if necessary. I supervise employees and create schedules for the employees. I hold weekly weekly safety meetings and ensure safety on the premises. I assist with any apprehensions of shoplifters and apprehend shoplifters if needed and process the shoplifters. I ensure accuracy in our back room operations and On hand accuracy. I audit pallets for accurate On Hands and audit back room bins. I conduct price change audits to ensure price changes are taken accurately. I conduct internal investigations and external investigations. I go to court and provide in depth case files and testify when needed. I assist in other stores and travel to other stores to conduct pre inventory reviews and High shrink reviews."
good,"I worked as a cashier and checked out customers products, and stocked shelves with returns when it was not busy or took returns back to customer service from up front at the registers."
good,it was not a good place to work too many people telling lies i had too be nice to to people i didnt like
good,"Working here was great over the course of my schooling. At first, I was allowed to keep my job and come back every summer. However, as the managers kept changing, so did the rules. Soon, I was forced to quit and apply to be rehired every summer at an even lower pay grade than I had started at four years prior. I decided at that point to find another job instead."
good,"A typical work day was to come in, and check what needed to be done, and do it. To always stay proactive and keep the place stocked and looking nice."
good,Very high volume with customer service. Make sure the customers are happy.
good,It was a great job and the Co-workers were very friendly and the workers were able to get fifteen minute breaks and and an hour lunch anything that you needed help with the managers were always there it is a really good job
good,"No other phrase seems to fit this job better than this. Daily I would have to wake up at 8 pm and get ready for my shift that started at 10. After reaching the store I would be greeted with the all smiling, yet tired faces of my coworkers who, while either much older than me, still acted as if they were in highschool with all of the drama that entails. Management was at best helpful and on task, and at worst it seemed as if asking them to do anything for their subordinates was arm twistingly painful. The produce night shift was monotonous and repetitive, there was almost no change to what we had to do, and while that was nice it became boring after a while. I did learn a lot about the upkeep of produce and the difference between a ripe and overripe fruit. The most difficult part of the job was pulling down freight, at 2 a.m. during our lunch break at freight truck would come in stacked to the ceiling with produce products, and since I was never properly trained in the usage of electric pallet jacks, I had to use a hand drawn one and pull them down. The best part of the job was working the salad wall, they would come in these lightweight boxes and all I'd have to do was check the dates and toss the bad ones then restock with newer ones."
good,What can I say it was walmart. It wasn't bad work. It was fine for what it was. It was often fun because of my coworkers
good,they tell one thing some else tells u to do something else i didnt enjoy it at all i was the only cart push on the lot at night if 1 buggy was it was write up for me
good,Start the day opening the shop open door trun on the compreser change oil. look for problem comeing from oil pan like strip oil plugs tire checking for defect ftnd cuase of problem like lump broken belts i ilearnd alot to be almost a team leader hardest part of job employe who dont fallow job rules ur day go by fast when busy
good,"A typical day in the facility consists of a repeat of the previous day at the job. The work flow/load is fairly consistent in terms of repetition. Providing customer service and completing tasks handed down from managment are basically your main focus. The only issue is with this particular company is that there are more managment postions then associate positions. In other words everyone wants to play the role of the ""boss"" leaving a great of confusion amongst the associates as to what is top priority.The better part of the job is getting along with the people who are on your level and actually acting as a team."
good,"We have our morning meeting where the manager tells us the sales, the profit and any other information we are to be told on that night. After meeting we grab our supplies we need to do our job if they are available. We check into our takes that we are to begin and run the freight. After each task er are to take any overstock to the back and take care of any trash. We are to report to the manager if any issues in our times if they have not come to check. We are to own our areas we are given meaning doing all live freight the pics from the back room and the zone to make the area look fresh for the morning. Then we inform the manager and go to help others if needed unless its the end of the day."
good,Most associates are very hard working and friendly but those who don't help out as much get away with it too easily. A job well done isn't always appreciated and the hours are not very flexible. Benefits are only available to those who have been full time employees for at least 6 months and there is very little opportunity to become a full time associate.
good,It was always interesting and there was always something to do
good,good place to work if are trying to go to school.and was able to give you hours as well.
good,"a empresa oferece varios beneficios, promoções, ambiente familiar, otima comunicação com colegas."
good,load trucks at a rate of 400 to 650 case per hour. I've been ther ten years and work as hard or harder than anyone else. And people who been there half the time as me have a better chance of furthering their career.
good,There is a constant workload. Co workers where okay to work with.
good,"i learned allot about safety, productivity, organization, and many other retail aspects of the working community. a day on the job is very productive, you learn something new every time you come to work. the co-workers are friendly and very helpful, while management is understanding, bun not very helpful."
good,"I learned about electronics, meat and enjoyed the cashier job more than I thought I would. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet so much. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday."
good,"I worked at Walmart for a few months as a summer job to earn a little spending money. It was a good experience in the sense that as a cashier it allowed me to be independent and strengthen my communication skills. However, the hours were crazy and I was given the most hours they could legally give me without having me work full time. Similarly, I was hired as a cashier, but was often asked to complete various other tasks that I did not receive proper training for. While these are minor frustrations, it was still upsetting to feel that management was not there to listen to the concerns of their employees."
good,wasn't the best place to work. some co workers that worked there longer got away with taking longer breaks and not helping others that need help. management were on cellphones on the clock and didn't know much.
good,Fast paced work
good,the high powers do not communicate well with the workers and workers are not treated with respect as they should be.
good,"Yes, it is the stereotypical review of wal-mart."
good,Wal Mart is a very busy place to work. I have learned many different things at Wal Mart. I have some great associates and my fellow assistant are the best. The hardest part of my job is explaning why we can't hire enough associates to take care of the customers. The mose enjoyable part is when I see someone succeed.
good,its challenging at times but fun too
good,not great pay. pay is low. . Not great upper management..But love working with the public
good,"The worst place ive ever worked, dont get pregnant and work there you will get fired"
good,"Working for this company was a experience, It was much need in management help on floors for new employees that was a problem for me at first. There is not enough training on the floor for new comers to get the hang of the cash handling the way that they do things. As much as they would start the day with meeting of cheers and getting everyone in a good spirit, the days would end sometimes down, because of some of the managers who were in charge of different posts would not help employees in a timely manner whether new or old to ensure the customers the best possible quality service they deserved."
good,Walmart is completely able and willing to work with any and all schedules. Ideal for someone who needs a job while attending college.
good,"Alot of work expected to be done in a short amount of time, expected you to do more than what a person can actually do. atleast for my job title"
good,"In my five years of working for Wal-Mart, I can honestly say that my shopping experience as a customer will no longer be the same. Wal-Mart is known to many as ""Corporate America."" Sure, the company has reasonable prices and great deals, but behind the scenes is less than to be desired. Most members of upper management act like they really value employee opinions, but the truth is they only seek positive attention from their superiors and will do whatever it takes to reach that, up to and including operation by skelton crews and decreased hours per shift. Management has high inconsistancy when it comes to communication, follow-up, and assigning tasks. The impossible is always expected by unforeseen miracles. I am remind of the old saying, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."""
good,very busy stocking
good,The most hardest part of my job is having to stay woke all night and putting up with a bunch of non-sense.Such as walmart mamgement firing everybody on overnights and working the ones that are still there extra hard.
good,"Walmart is exactly what you would expect it to be working here. Your hard work tends to go unnoticed, managment seems as if you don't have a life outside of work, and long hours. Pay is about average and the work you do is fun and the people you meet are awesome."
good,they put to much work on just one person.they do help you if you fall behind.
good,"12 puls hour days, Start-up meeting with associates to discuss daily workload. Managing associates , workload, and meeting budget goals. Daily staff meeting to meet building goals and objectives. Collaborating with peers to share resoucers, equipment, and staffing."
good,"The job overall would be nice if mangement were on the same accord, I love my job and also love working with the other associates, also I love the customers, but management seems to try and put more on you then they can bear. It doesnt pay as well as it should but it pays the bills."
good,"We toured our area's in the morning and asked questions about the dept. ( outs, missing labels, incorrect prices, flagging ) to our dept. mgrs. Some of our associates lack training in this area. I helped mentor some of the management staff as they were new to the program and teach them the daily needs that had to be completed on time. unloading of the trucks on a daily basis within 90 minutes was the diffacult task that seem to be the hardest for them. Dealing with the customers and making them happy was the best part of my job."
good,"De modo geral é uma empresa boa para se trabalha, um local sem pressão contem suas formalidades, mas sem obrigatoriedades pelo menos no meu setor."
good,"Ordered merchandise, stocked shelves, built displays, customer service, ran register, trained new associates, unload trucks, inventory control. In my time as Garden shop department manager the department had the highest increase in sales for 3 months straight. Some management team was great but most upper management member made promises and did not keep them. Co-work were great to work with. Hardest part of my job was believing any thing management would tell us. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with our customers and my department co-workers, and turning the Garden Shope department around."
good,"I worked the seasonal Night shifts as a stocker; every night began with a little preparation and then right to work stocking shelves, not too exciting. One hour into every shift we had an employee meeting which frequently felt like a waste of time, since we were expected to get a high amount of work done within our shifts every night, and the meetings were very much a personal pat on the back for management, instead of being informative for employees."
good,"Overall Walmart is an ok place to work for the night shifts are a little rough, but its a ok paying job."
good,"Treated u far but, favered some employees. loved who i worked with the store was neat and organiezed."
good,Every day was routine. I learned to count fast and enter the data into the computer correctly. I also learned how to work with pickups from armored guards. Management was not my favorite in this company. My coworkers were wonderful and friendly. The hardest part of this job was remembering every detail and making the numbers show up correctly. I loved the people I worked with and the skills I learned.
good,"I have worked here since freshman year in college and I was able to get by with the pay that I was receiving. They were flexible and allowed me to work around my school schedule. Although I have found that after graduating and two school age children later that the demanding hours and lack of full time positions are not meeting my needs. It was good while it lasted but as my needs have changed, it is time to do something different."
good,"We processed freight as quickly as we could according to vendor specifications, I enjoyed working in a fast paced environment. Liked the steady hours."
good,Great for meeting people. You must be very friendly and good with people
good,"I've learned how to manage and train associates, developing them in their roles to be successful in their careers. I've also learned to use time management effectively in order to proactively get things done. Peers were fun to work with but management team didn't seem to have a good control over operations. Every day was always something different. I enjoyed working with my peers developing and training associates, but our management team above us proved to have ineffective leadership."
good,stocked shelves with product. it was hard work and i did not enjoy working at night.
good,"day in day out, work helping with all the job needs in a work day puting up an out ,stock.for sale"
good,"When I first started the job was not too difficult. My crew consisted of 11-13 people depending on day of the week. Gradually, work conditions worsened after people either quit or were fired. For a lengthy duration, my crew consisted of 3-5 members, and we often had to handle the workload of three people. Management was bad at communicating. Every department operated on skeleton crews. And, if management could get the same production out of less people--regardless of overworking the people they did have--they thought nothing of it."
good,The few people who do work hard are told to pick up the slack of the others who don't do their work. It's exhausting and I've watched it happen well over two yrs. I received exceeds expectations each time on my evaluation yet was never considered for management though they told me this is the kind of person they want as manager. I was stuck in a corner doing my job and several others'.
good,Working for walmart was long days but the pay was good and you can move up in the company but once there you miss show immediate results;no excuses
good,"I would get to work clock in and go to my department to see my manager and see what needed to be down for that day. Then I would get started with my day, whatever it was. Stocking shelves, helping customers, cleanning the department, running the cash registor. I would do what ever needed to be done."
good,"The managers at Walmart do not respect employees who are underneath their job title. The managment is very disrespectful even when you complete your task the do not praise your accomplishment, they just complain about what else needs to be done before they leave for the day. There are supposed to be no reprecussions for expresing a complaint but this is not true. The management does not care about their employees just their paychecks. The co-workers on the other hand are what make it bareble to work at walmart. They are kind and helpful in getting work done."
good,Its a fairly good job.. pay isnt as great but sustainability is great
good,It pays the bills. It is hard to switch positions at Wal-mart which has forced me to have to find a new job because I would like to work days.
good,wal mart is a fast pace job full of great people. the customer makes the job fun so many different faces every day
good,"Being a Cart Pusher at Wal-Mart had its advantages, but unfortunately the management at most of them makes working there dreadful. A manager once told me the rubber in my shoes would keep me safe in a thunderstorm, so there was no point in coming inside."
good,"I started as a Store Standards Associate, who pushed carts and cleaned the store, for 8 months until I was promoted in to the electronics department. My job now, as a sales representative, is just to give information on a variety of products and put stock out in the mean time. Since we don't work on commission, we can give customers our honest opinion on products."
good,"Typical day for me at work was coming in folding clothes, answering phones, assisting customers with purchases. Management at this job were pretty much people i wouldnt want to consider working with again. My coworkers varies because there were always different ones. The hardest part of this job was dealing with my management because they were sneaky people."
good,I like assisting customers.
good,"I liked working here only thing for me was management, I learned a lot about retailing from here and great customer service."
good,"Every day very multi-tasking but i enjoy being able to stay moving around..I have gained knowledge of communications,organizing,maintaining office skills.Most of my co-workers at this store are very freindly and i enjoy working with, they make the daya little brighter and time a little faster."
good,"The typical day at work starts with everybody gathering for production day statistics. Then after the meeting, you inspect your lift, and pull orders until your work day is finshed. They have a great management system set up. The supervisors are great agents to the employees. The reason why is they explain what upper management is doing, as well as what we need to do to hit the goals for our department, and as branch in general."
good,Working at Wal-MArt was a exciting job to have. My typical day consisted of assembleing product for customers and for store displays. Everyday was a day of learning something new. Management was helpful if you needed them. Co-worker where nice. There was nothing really hard about the job I had there. Meeting the customers was very enjoyable.
good,"A typical day would involve clocking in, checking the bays at the front of the store to make sure they were filled with carts for customers, then you would proceed out into the parking lot and begin rounding up stray carts that had been left outside of cart corrals by customers or bringing the carts in the corrals up to the bays. The management would go between the extremes of ignoring the existence of the cart pushers to yelling about how terrible the parking lot looked regardless of the efforts of the employee(s) with demands that it be cleared within 30-45 minutes."
good,"I thank Wal-Mart for the job opportunity and allowing me the opportunity to gain experience necessary for moving forward. However, the constant chaos and disorganization is overwhelming and unnecessary. Wal-Mart has the opportunity to be an even greater company to work for but instead, focuses all of their energy on the imaginary excellent customer satisfaction. The pay is not worth the stress, at 10.30hr for a MANAGEMENT position is disgusting. So long Wal-Mart, I will not miss this corporation one bit!"
good,"Long boring days at work, i've learned how to stock and bin which is apart of inventory management. The associates around are good people to work with and hard working people. Hardest part of my job are dealing with the managers, reason being is because they don't treat you like an adult. Most enjoyable day are the lunch breaks."
good,"It depends on where you're at, but management does show some favoritism to different departments. It's not the best, but not as bad as everyone says it is."
good,"Enjoyed working with co-workers,Some of the Management was uncaring about employees. I cleaned machines, cut meats and cheese. I was always dealing with customers."
good,"A short time in my life that enhanced the features I lacked the most sometimes; patients. Busy season and paying attention is a must especially to people, some need help others do not, and those in between. My leadership skills increased while I maintain my thoughts because no one is perfect. Management was lost in some cases while others didn't care which shows a decline in the profit marging while losses increased. I am a people person so being a cashier was fun, had no problems there but leaving was not fun. I took with me what I learned the most and that is if you are not sure of one thing or another; do your research to clarify any misunderstanding and always listen to everything before putting your two sense in."
good,Good company to work for. The company wasn't just in field of interest.
good,"Typical day involved swiping in to let the system know I was there, and walking down to the front end to operate a cash register. Occasionally stocking front end shelves with items like magazines, candy and other misc items."
good,"I begin my day on the register inputing customers' food and beverage orders. I am somtimes asked to use my customer service skills to cash checks, produce money orders, and processing walmart credit card payments. As well as restocking and reshelving inventory products."
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart is clocking in, then going to my department and begin to first either help customers if there are any then begin to straighten up the dept. from what the other shift left. I would do price changes, returns, zone, answer phones, and answer customers questions as well as check them out. What I have learned is to do price changes, manage associates, do management responsibly s like order items to restock the shelves. My co-workers were awesome to work with and I had to help train some of them which was a pleasure in doing so. The hardest part of my job was dealing with black Friday crowds and their demands. That was rough. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the cool new items that was available in our department. Also dealing with customers and answering their questions was awesome too."
good,"I would stock shelfs.water flowers, help custmers and load cars. I learned how to cashier, and to work well with other people."
good,é uma empresa boa pra se aprender muito sobre logistica trabalhar em equipe da oportunidade de crescimento o ponto negativo e que cobram de mais e trabalhamos sobre pressão
good,"era la misma rutina a diario aunque aprendí a ser servicial y amable aunque los jefes eran un poco estrictos y manejaban la situación a su manera aunque no nos gustara entre compañeros hay un buen ambiente de trabaja, ayudándonos unos a otros y conviviendo lo mas que podemos gracias a ellos aprendí a trabajar en equipo."
good,Grato ambiente de trabajo pero bajos sueldos y sin beneficios para sus empleados
good,create purchase orders
good,"Cashiering is not a difficult job when someone teaches you correctly. Extensive customer service Is needed to work at Walmart. I learned for sure that everyone is different and need to be treated according to their personalities, within reason. Not all of the management is fair and you have to learn who you can and cannot trust, pretty much just like any other person in the world. The hardest part of the job is not offending someone. I wouldn't do it intentionally and I don't believe many people would, but the simplest and most innocent statement can be misconstrued into something that you did not mean. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"I worked for this company for 15yrs and gained alot of management knowledge. I had alot of training and mostly have good memories. I will say, I have little respect for my last store manager for the way he treated me."
good,A company that caters more to the bottom line and less to customers and associates.The average day is assisting customers mainly in the bicycle and sporting goods departments. I learned a lot of customer service and people skills working with so many different cultures and personality types. Completing tasks for managment inside or outside of department. Management needs more training than they are receiving. They don't seem to care about customer service really. They just like to make sure their notes are done. Priorties are different with every manager. There is no consistency. Coworkers are a great bunch of people. The hardest part of the job is being pulled off customer service to do something that can wait. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet people from all over the country and the world. I really enjoy the diversity you experience at Walmart. I love to see the genuine appreciation in a customer's eyes when you've made their day better.
good,walmart is a good place to work. fellow employees are very nice and helpful. management could be a little more involed when it comes to employees but it is a big company with alot of employees.
good,A typical day was going to whatever department that was needed.
good,I would come in and get on the clock then begin to go to my assigned aisle and start to stock freight.
good,I really enjoy doing inventory and stocking . My day usually consists of zoning and working freight sometimes i go in the backroom and pick merchandise. I get along with most co-workers and we try to work as a team.
good,"Sometimes the work on my job can really be typical concerning not enough workers for the job and hours being cut short. Sometimes it may be a disagreement between me and a co-worker,I still listen to what they have to say and sort the problem out. The hardest part of the job is when a truck comes in and I have to put out the foods that are missing. The customers are ask for different foods so, I'll stop and assist the customers that what makes me feel good."
good,It was an ok place to work. They have you doning a lot of differnt jobs in so little time or all at one time.
good,"Llegar revision de bitacoras, acomodo de mercancias, revision de correo, revision del personal"
good,"I was young when I worked for Walmart, but we always had so much fun, there was never a dull moment in the Walmart life. The management always kept you on your feet always had something for you to do and working hard. My co-workers were all friends by the end of the day, we all had something to give to the Walmart team. the hardest part of the job were the late hours and then getting up for school the next day. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers they were so fun."
good,Walmart is a company that does not endorse much of a work life balance. This can be overwhelming for the management team.
good,I loved working with people. The job kept me busy. Management was not good. They did not go around my family needs.
good,I did enjoy my job and those associates that I worked closely with.
good,"Not much to say, Walmart is ok! The days go by quick because your constanly busy"
good,WalMart is in the process of hiring all part time help and eliminating the higher paid employees. 17 1/2 years as loyal associate
good,"Wal-mart loves to walk all over you. I was being paid cashier wages for working in the money center, customer service, layaway, and electronics with out the proper training for any of the areas. Had to learn by doing it myself... It just wasn't wort it to me any more"
good,"I would go in and seperate skids that came off the semi truck, then take the loads to the designated aisle. I learned that anything is possible if the team works together. Management was always walking around and lending hands where they were needed most. my co-workers worked together every night to get the store done. The hardest part of my job was after i done all my work i had to make sure all the other aisles were also done. I enjoyed meeting new people and working with the public."
good,"This was a very demanding job which was not a problem but the management did not work with you very well and they required things out of you that you were not trained to do. They tried to work around my school schedule but was not always successful. I learned to work with a team, work on the computer systems, run register and learned all the different parts of the store."
good,"Everyday was a different learning experience, a new program was coming down from home office on a regular basis, and because of that it helped me to be able to learn quick, and to be able to teach what I learned. The management staff, as with all companies, had their pros and cons, but they helped teach me and guide me to become the successful manager that I was for the time that I was employed with the company. My co-workers were very friendly and extremely helpful with any and all assignments that needed help completing. The hardest part of the job was delegating task and following up on the assignments to see if they were complete while still helping customers and associates, but even though it was hard to manage, I was able to get them complete because of the team work of the associates and management staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction that I was able to have with the customers and associates and their different personalities, although were different it made the days there very exciting."
good,Has a very dedicated staff that focuses servicing its customer with low cost products at a constant high volume.
good,"I worked at Walmart over the holiday season. They were very unorganized. The management team were never on the same level. They all had different rules and opinions. I was hired on as a cashier and they moved me to the customer service desk and didn't even think to ask me or let me know in any way. It was terrible. Little to no training for the positions that they stuck you in. Getting yelled at by the customers because you don't know how to do your job and thinking, well, if Walmart would have actually trained me I wouldnt be having this problem."
good,I learned how to manage my time and get done what i had to do in my time alloted my co-workers were great to work with. the hardest part of the job as dealing with all of the constant changes we had. the most enjoyable thing was not having someone over your shoulders all the time.
good,working at Walmart usually goes by quick because its usually so busy especially during the holidays and weekends. I've mostly learned how to work with costumers because not all customers are happy. And my co-workers are OK i have a few close friends but most of them do not know how to work as a team. The most hardest part of the job is trying to please a costumer without violating the policy because some things customers want us to do we just cant do and that causes a lot of problems. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when the management shows their appreciation for all our hard work.
good,Started at Sams Club. Loved the warehouse enviornment. Loved working with customers at the membership and return desk. Moved to Elizabethtown before that club opened. Enjoyed working customer service/returns and the money room
good,la parte mas dificil es las subgerenta q ase caso omiso a las reglas ante eccolap pero ella exije q se cumplan y cuanto a ella no lo ase ase contaminaciones crusadas y se la pasa comiendo en todas las areas
good,"I enjoy working with people, like making guess smile. The only thing i dislike abut the store is the benefits"
good,A typical workday includes checking in Freight and Customer Service and cashing out customers. Ive learned good customer service makes the difference. Being kind and courteous makes a big difference in a customers day. My co-workers are one of the biggest perks of the job. The people who work for Walmart can truly be the nicest people in the world. The most enjoyable part of my job though is the people I get to meet and help them with their electronic problems.
good,A fast paced work day with constant goals and changes throughout the work day.
good,"La atención al cliente fue prioridad en este trabajo, aprendi a trabajar en equipo para lograr la satisfacción del cliente colaborando también en la reducción de perdidas y mermas para la empresa."
good,"It was an Average place to work, management was nice, and co workers were too. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate/ mad customers."
good,"A typical day of work was making sure all deadlines were met,and taking care of all client,making sure that everything was confidential."
good,"tive uma boa experiencia,crescir muito profissionalmente superei minhas espectativas e da empresa"
good,This was a good job for the moment. Provided many opportunites for advancement. Decent job.
good,"é uma empresa muito boa no sentido da cultura e do respeito e também com relação ao pagamento em dia, benefícios, etc, mas acaba exigindo dedicação extrema para atingir os resultados."
good,"A typical day a work was one of many priorities and challenges, which I enjoyed. I learned so much about retail, merchandising and product development in my positions. Mangement seemed to be overwhelmed with responsibilities and there needed to be more time devoted to development of associates. The hardest part of the job was finding enough hours in my day to include more personal development and pursuit of advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was being involved in the product development process -- finding and developing items to be placed in the stores."
good,Its not a bad place to work if you just looking to make cash.. You have to deal with alot of managers pulling you in different ways to get the things needed to be done. other then that its a good place to start on work experince
good,don't allow yourself to give up on your dream and get stuck working there forever
good,I would go in and grab a cart that had items that needed to be stocked and process them amongst the shelves in their respective place. Not much was learned through this employer.
good,Worked overnight assigned in frozen section. Too cold working in a freezer. Good relationship with co-workers.
good,"day at work is that you are very busy.dealing with alot of customers. the managers,"
good,"The job it self wasn't hard, management could and should be better than what it was. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. The most enjoyable parts when some of the manager would get together to visit the sick kids at the hospitals and bring them little happies that really made my day."
good,Several of the people you work with are nice but the customers can be difficult at times. Management most often sides with the customers.
good,Overall I like wal-mart but the main problem I had with them was the amount of pain I was having and they would not work with all of the surgeries I had to have.
good,"Job tasks were simple, but managers and supervisors liked to yell at everyone. Co-workers were friendly, except the odd few. Management was poorly executed. Hardest part of the job was listening to the negativity on the jobsite. Most enjoyable part of the day was working by myself inside the back of the 18-wheeler."
good,"I used to enjoy work, now they have a ""more work with less people"" policy..therefore the employees have to ""slave"" and do work that is intended to be worked by two or more persons..I no longer have the joy I had at first, and I have been there for ten years.."
good,"Facilidade no aprendizado, agilidade, pontal, boa aparência, boa comunicação, etc..."
good,"The whole employment with Walmart wasnt a total bust, but some things arent what they seem to be. Management tells you when you start that the customer is number one priority, but I really dont believe that is the case. I think that the Walmart system is built around prices and not customer satisfaction. They preach and preach about helping the customer but all they are concerned with is the actual purchase and NOT the customer as they so tell you. They have these lessons on the computer that are supposed to help you better learn the area and job you are in but the reality of it is that everyone and I mean everyone copies and cheats just so they dont have to sit and go through all the lessons because the actual lessons really and truly do not have hardly anything to do with what you are working on. Sure there are some key points that the lessons have but overall they will not make you smarter nor will they allow you to have more knowledge in the future to help customers who are in need of knowing specifics about a product. As far as benefits and pay I would say that benefits are above average and the pay is right around normal for the area that Walmart is in. The managers are all different in their style so I cannot say as a whole Walmart is horrible on management but I can say that they could give the managers alot more training on how to actually treat the employees instead of treating them like just another body like some managers do. I just believe that Walmart has changed from being customer friendly to profit friendly..."
good,"I work overnite 10 pm to 7 am shift. I provide good customer service, I also stocking. I learned to be more responsible and productive about merchandising. My managers are supportive, my co workers are just ok, they are helpful."
good,Working for Wal-mart was a mixed experience. At times it was fun and exciting and other times it wasnt. It wasnt a great experience when the store would be filled with customers and the store was short staffed.
good,Very busy fast paced environment with face to face interaction to a diverse customer population. Retail company where customer satisfaction is the main focus. It's an equal opportunity employer where you get to work side by side with people of all age groups and ethnicities. Work is performed independently and as a group. The most enjoyable part is meeting customer needs and exceeding there expectations.
good,"I hated this job, it was fun at first but it just got worse and worse. The store manager was driving the place into the ground because he didn't know how to run the store correctly. They cared nothing for their associates just the manager."
good,Walmart is an alright company to work for the management has a real problem throwing higher ups names out to get you to try and be more productive and if you do something they dislike don't be surprised if the look for the smallest things to get rid of you maybe it was just the store i worked at but the pay was terrible for the jobs you had to do but it payed the bills i suppose.
good,Very unrealistic expectations from management and very unorganized operations. They are not willing to work with their associates to set schedules that work good for them.
good,"Although I worked part time and the pay was low, it was most gratifying to greet and interact with customers upon arrival to the store. My co-workers were polite and caring people and management made every effort to ensure subordinates were trained and supported. The hardest part of the job was accommodating the continually varying work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was interrelating with and serving the customers."
good,"Go, Go, Go from the time I step into the door until I leave. Co-worker are good people. I learn something new everyday about the customers and from the other associates. The hardest part of the job dealing with some of the crazy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that most day fly by."
good,"cleaning lobby's bathrooms balling carboard zoning, unload trucks"
good,Checked stock levels and reordered merchandise as necessary.
good,É muito agitado.Eu aprendi um pouco de cada coisa pois fiquei em quase todos os setores da loja.A gerencia é muito boa.Eusempre me dei bem com meus colegas.A parte mais dificil é lidar com clientes estressados ea mais agradavel é que eu tenho todos os meus beneficios.
good,"Over all great experience. Would defiantly go back. Wish they had set shifts for those of us who have kids,for more family time."
good,"Work was pretty fun i learned there are a lot of thieves out there, the management was bad and the co-workers were fun ."
good,"fast paced company with not enough training time on the floor and to much training in a class room! learned how to deal with unruly customers on a daily basis and keep my co-workers calm in stressful situations. the hardest part of the job was not being certain of you schedule on a regular basis, the most enjoyable part was working with the public for me."
good,Fun being around coworkers but little advancement due to management favoritism
good,Stocking overnight can be exhausting depending on the department placement. The physical is what determines that factor. Management is reasonable for the most part. The Co worker seem to be fine. But seeing lazy people get easier jobs is understandable but frustrating at the same time.
good,"The employees who work here are amazing i miss them the most, it's kind of like a family. With a new store manager who no one gets along with and just puts up with her makes a vey stressful envorment for everyone. All the assistaint managers are amazing and try to help in whatever way they can. Very busy store in the summer and not busy in the the off season so hours get cut way back but if your in school the work with you very well."
good,"Workplace is fast paced and full of lots of great people. Unfortunately, you will hardly ever get your breaks as required by laws, many of the management team will not communicate with each other and will often times give you conflicting information. You will get hours and they do give several pay raises throughout the year, at least 1 Merit and your annual depending on your review"
good,"Typical day at work is fun, yet stressful."
good,"I interacted with incoming customers and helped them with various food and other grocery selections, as well as assisted with loading and unloading incoming products throughout the store."
good,"I interacted with incoming customers and helped them with various movie and video game selections, as well as ideas for future purchases based on current selections."
good,It was a great place to work!!! They were friendly and compasonite. Co- workers were fun to work with. Hardest part was shceduling. The most enjoyable part was satisfying customers.
good,"My day starts with finalizing the previous days transactions from the ATM, to register deposits, coalating/distributing reports. I investigate all anomalies and report the final results to the management team."
good,"As with most employers, emphasis is placed on cost cutting and 'doing more with less'. However, customer service suffers as a result. In addition, employees are at the mercy of computer generated schedules which supposedly are designed to maximize efficiency but have the consequence of being inflexible, with little or no regard for individual needs."
good,"Walmart is a very somber company to work for in my personal opinion. Day-to-day tasks and responsibilities were at par and to be expected in retail, and the general feel of the facility is pretty enjoyable on most days. However, the lack of communication between members of the management team along with said individuals personal egos makes the job overly stressful on the crew. Managerial conflicts as to what an associate should do or not do often puts associates in tight spots. This often has certain associates on the hot seat with certain managers. Half of said managers having little interest to what an associate might have to say about the situation."
good,Working hard and providing wonderful customer service. I learned wonderful people skills. I learned how to supervise an area. I worked with wonder people.
good,"Aprendi como hacer un inventario, manejo de efectivo.Etc. No me gusto que las horas extras se me pagaran con tiempo, mis amigos eran buena honda, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue que aprendi muchas cosas nuevas"
good,Basically late night stocking making sure the shelf's are full. Sometimes running the register as well and helping cashiers. The job was a third shift job I really did not enjoy because of the hours and the schedule at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually having a job.
good,"Between the two states I worked in, I really enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. Everyday was something new to do and I enjoyed coming to work with my co- workers. The management at the time were very nice people and took my concerns and improvements seriously to maintain a positive work environment. We all had good days and bad days, but working during Black Friday was a pain and a lot of miss communication going on, besides that it was a nice place to work at."
good,"I loved the job I did for walmart. I walked the entire store for 8 hours straight looking for shoplifters. It was exciting, fun and different every day. I would still be at WalMart if it was ""WalMart"". The company itself is just not a very family friendly company. As a single mom, they were not understanding with my child getting sick, or not haveing a sitter. I didnt have issues alot, and maybe it was just the store I worked for, but the management staff was not nice nor caring of their employees at all."
good,Walmart was an okay job.
good,"I enjoyed my career at Wal-Mart, the job itself, the co-workers and the customers. I had fun ringing up patrons and chatting with them. I began there as a part-time cashier and quickly became a Customer Service Supervisor. During my time as a CSS I created a system to improve the service at the front end by always having cashiers available to greet and assist people. All my subordinates responded well to the training, mentoring, coaching I provided. It was a wonderful environment which translated in very minimal absenteeism, tardiness or turn over."
good,In Wal-Mart you would come in clock in and check in at the supervisor station to be assigned a register. Operate the register and clean around my area for the time being and asist with any customer request.
good,"Responsabilidade bem distribuida, gerência atenciosa e crompometida com o bom relacionamento no ambiente de trabalho."
good,I've learned a lot about working with others and how to handle situations of stress with multiple other persons. The hardest part of my job is taking care of things i would normally do on an 8 hour day on a 5 hour day. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people and see their relief when i've helped them find something and save their time.
good,"Enjoyed Working for this company, the management staff was very friendly and willing to work with you on any situation, I had flexible hours which made it easier for me to care for my family! the pay wasnt great but when you value your employees and show them that you appreciate them it makes it better and you will continue to work there."
good,"Agood place to be with great people to work with,and a place to understand howto manage your time and run a company. This is a place to learn how to get a job done fast but right and safe,and fill great about what you have done. Also enjoy working with others that depend on you."
good,"I would go arrive to work and either change tires, oil changes, wipers, and other tasks. When it was not busy would sweep the garage or clean other things up. I didnt really learn much at this job. I already new how to do everything i did there. THe job was overall an easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on all different cars, becasue I have a passion for cars."
good,"I really did enjoy my experiences with my customers meeting different people every minute of the day as great, the managers where the kinds who have their favorites which is what made my decision to leave the company."
good,Co workers easy to get along with. Management needs to do more hands on work.
good,"Working here allowed me to work as much as I needed to. If I needed to, I was allowed to work over time. Very flexible."
good,Its a nice company to help build your experience but nothing I would settle with.
good,"It was fun, crazy, wild and hard to work for this company. It goes from a slow and simple day to a very chaotic ""wanna bang your head against a wall"" day very quickly. I really enjoyed my experience and I want to go back."
good,Outside pushing carts. Manager were busy talking and not helping associates when they ask for help. most of the co-workers go to other departments to horse around or try to hook up with other co-workers. Working on a holiday or when there is a sale .
good,"Good working environment, the only thing that I had issues with was that the company changed store managers 3 times while I was employed there, and it just seemed no one cared anymore @ times."
good,"it was an okay job, jus didnt like to stand in one spot for 8hrs i like to work but the wer very limited on lettin you work."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart is decent work. The management at my particular store was somewhat lacking and I have noticed many negative changes in the policies over the years. However, the work environment was rather relaxed and the work itself is normally not too demanding."
good,"I still remember the day where the power went out and my assistant manager asks me to give flash lights to associates so the may continue working. My co-workers get upset, do not want to do the job and want to leave. I toll them you leave on your own you fire yourself. We can go and negociate because to me It is not secure or safe to work in this deep darkness with flash lights. And at the end the come down. The following day when the Store manager come in He was very upset because we stay there working in the darkness. The hardest part of the job is to make me drive forklift in the rain and to deal sometimes with some stubborn associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the task in done on time, all departments zoned 100%, salefloor well cleaned before store opened."
good,A fast paced work environment that is always changing. Making sure that the customers are taken care of and handled in the most respectful way.
good,"En esta empresa tratan muy bien a sus asociados existe un ambiente laboral muy bueno, lo único malo es que se trabaja demasiado para pagar poco, y creo que aquí no toman muy encuenta el grado de estudios para alguna promoción y eso perjudica a los que de verdad se esforzaron por tener alguna profesión."
good,A typical day consisted of having a meeting at the begining of the shift. Then you were either placed on a line for receiving or given a truck to unload. My co-workers were awesome with the exception of one. They all worked together pretty well to help each other out and were professional. The hardest part of the job was the constant lifting and bending along with the heat. There were fans but they didnt always do the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 4 day work week and the paycheck.
good,Overall Walmart is a great company. You learn a lot about retail and customer service. You meet really nice people and more than likely your days are fun. One thing I don't like is not being able to work over time. The management team is a biased when it comes to associates.
good,"a typical work day would include servicing cars. I learned how to perform routine oil changes, balance and rotate tires. Management and co-workers we very hands on and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working in extreme weather conditions. The most enjoyable part was learning about the parts of the cars and how they work."
good,walmart was a good job but unorganized with scheduling and certain items and data sheets.
good,"Meu dia-a-dia era corrido e bem satisfatório, aprendi varias funções pertinentes ao meu cargo como fiscal de frente de caixa e auxiliar de tesouraria, meu gerentes eram bem presentes e prestativos e preocupados com o bem estar da equipe para que os clientes ficassem satisfeitos, o relacionamento com meus colegas de trabalho era bem prazeroso sem maiores dificuldades , a parte mais gratificante era o reconhecimento por um bom trabalho desenvolvido."
good,Clean machines daily to keep a clean work place the most thing that i enjoyed the most about wal-mart were the custormer experince that i had meet lots of people with interesting stories
good,"A day at work at Walmart was, most of the time, very boring and slow. I worked in the apparel department so all I really done was restock clothes, assist customers with fitting rooms, straighten up the workplace area, and reset modifications. I, of course, had to always have a great personality skills with awesome communication, which was not an issue at all. I didn't really like the management because they all seemed so unfriendly and rude, and they didn't really consider any employees' ideas or conditions. There wasn't really anything that hard about the job. I learned more about the clothes department, and how to reset modifications to a department. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was probably meeting the new customers and getting to know them."
good,"Trabajar en esta empresa es muy estresante, se trabaja bajo presion y el salario que ofrece no se refleja en el esfuerzo que el asociado desempeña"
good,Over all learned alot about the company.
good,I enjoy working with my co workers however the company is not family friendly. I have 2 small boys and hardly get to spend time with them because Walmart doesn't want to work with my availability without cutting hours. I need my hours in order to care for my family and isn't able to do that without working extremely late shifts. The management is poor and only look out for themselves and not their workers. Advancing is very difficult as well they constantly overlook individuals who put in extra work to be noticed for positions.
good,"I enjoyed the staff at walmart, but my (what seemed like permenant) position led me to be unhappy."
good,"A typical day at work started out as waxing the floors and detailing shelves and the flooring. I also had to do janitorial work. After I had been there a few months the managers liked how fast I caught on to things and asked me to become a stocker. I really enjoyed it. I was fast and did my job accurately. My co-workers were nice and friendly. I socialized, but always got my work done before or right on time. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that I worked over-nights and it made me sleep during the day and I wasn't able to spend as much time with my son and family."
good,"I learned alot of people skills working there, as well as learning to work well with time limits."
good,"train associates, merchandising, inventory control, community outreach, store planning"
good,scan and bag items while doing the occassional price match as well as handling customer complaints
good,i enjoyed working for walmart . but sometimes some workers are treated unfairly .
good,"I would describe a typical day at work as ""ALWAYS BUSY"". The hardest part of my job was the shift that I work, the graveyard (overnight) shift, however, what I like the most about my job is when I know I always make a customer leave the store with a happy face."
good,"My day would usually start out with me arriving in the parking lot and sitting in my car with a book until it was time to clock in. I'd usually be on the register for an hour or two, directing customers and cashiering, while my coworkers went about their business elsewhere in the department. The most of the managers were all quick and happy to hear a misgiving or lend a hand. Most of my coworkers were very friendly and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was when a young lady was hired on and got friendly with a man in upper management, and the rest of us (myself and coworkers') hours were all cut and given to her. I would end up with only four hours per week because of her, and my some of my coworkers got none at all. She had an awful attitude towards all of us and when we were finally able to have our grievance heard, she followed us to the specific office and over-spoke us in order to get her side in first. As far as I know, she still works in the same department and hasn't made any new friends due to her actions. Nasty coworkers aside, my favorite part of the job was being able to successfully help a customer with something they needed. It made me feel good to know that I was helping them with something."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wal Mart and enjoyed the challenges of daily tasks performed. At times I found myself stressed, due to most days not being able to perform daily tasks in my area (zoning, pricing,etc.) because of supervisors and management pulling me to go to different areas all my shift. I understood why, but sometimes I would get discipline notices for not completeing tasks in my area, even though I was pulled out of my duties to help in other areas of need."
good,I enjoyed working a this Wal Mart for the most part. I worked with some of the most hard working people. As well we had a great bond with each other.
good,"A typical day at work would be slicing meat, cooking food, and any other duties assigned. It seemed that the management was sort of biased but over all I loved my coworkers and interacting with customers."
good,"i would review the walmart retail experience as excellent for people who are seeking long term management positions as salaried with a college education for bussiness and n eeded degrees, lower positions arenot well paid and lack many benefits then other positions in the job market. My backround excels in handyman type services and the use of hand and power tools which i do not acquire much of at walmart."
good,"A typical day would involve me interracting with customers, asking questions attempting to determine the best items for their needs at the best prices. It would also include me verifying previously filed paperwork, cascading information to my associates preparing them to advance within the company. At Walmart I learned the power of effective marketing, the importance of having the right products and having them in the right place at the right time. I was very privileged to learn some very important lessons from some very amazing people while working at Walmart. I take great pride in knowing that I was able to train my entire team individually and to see them use the things that I taught them and feel comfortable speaking to people using these techniques. The hardest part of my job is staying updated on the latest and greatest gadgets and accessories. The most enjoyable part of my job is educating people about the new products and services offered and how they may make life a little more cost effective and convenient."
good,"The work was good an steady unloading trucks all day, there were far too many computer classes that made no since as to pertaining to working for the company. Management hates anyone that is smarter than they are or speaks their mind and will pressure you into quitting because of it. Threats to your job are made before a problem exists to create a docile work environment."
good,lots of work on holidays. Inventory 20 hour days. outside in the rain very ruff work.
good,"A very nice place to work, but getting time off was not the easiest thing to do, and management seemed to come down on associates for little things, instead of focusing on the bigger picture at hand."
good,"Aprendi a organizar a loja, mantendo meu local de trabalho organizado."
good,"It is walmart, some benefits are better than you expect some are worse, but overall you are just a number"
good,"Not very welcoming among staff/co workers. Seemed like everybody was out for themselves, no team work, wasnt very organized."
good,"A typical day at work would be to start stocking items off of a pallet. While I would be working on this I would have to run the cash register and run the photo lab while assisting customers in stationary, toys, electronics, photo, shoes, and the baby department."
good,It was a good place to pass to day. Being a military household it gave me a place to meet other people in the area.
good,"I did price changes on clothes, worked the fitting room and put up freight."
good,"This was a good place, even if I didn't get to stay there long due to a relocation."
good,"The company truly cares more for the business than the employee. If management doesn't like you then you will be gone, but if you were like me, and management does like you, they will allow certain things slide."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart consists of checking in merchandise and delegating tasks before heading to other stores to train their depaartment managers
good,Very hard to move up the corporate ladder but a decent job for a teen or someone in school.
good,"Great place to meet new people. Co-workers become family. It's a place where customers service is at the top. No matter where you are in the company, customer service is the priority. Learn new things everday."
good,"Good experience no hard feeling just poor management, Unfair treatment to employee's,lack of leadership"
good,"Walmart, is the working poor they pay you the least amount possible and work you to death, when i was there i was a dept manager making less than some cashiers i spent my holidays working overnights to have to take the time off because they wouldnt pay the over time even though i put in the hours, and dont even think about ever getting sick after three times in one year they will fire you."
good,"TYpical day unload trusk,sort out product .inspect product to insure quality."
good,"On a typical day at wrok I would load trailers. Both by hand and with equipment. (PR,PE,and forklift) We worked at a pace that varied, but that was constant."
good,"A typical day at work consist of cooking, cleaning, cashier, and prep. I learned how to do multiple things at once. My mangement never had any issues with me. My co-workers liked working with me and always did their part at work. The hardest part of the job was cooking and serving at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers"
good,A store that was just getting acclimated to the new overnight positions. Management had quite a bit of flaws. Their sympathy for the people who did well in the company was limited...ie while there i had some pregnacy complications however the days I did not come in a doctor filled out a LOA packet for that I didnt get a chance to submit before being terminated. They stated because the packet was not submitted before the incident (that I had no control or expected date of what was happening) it was basically nothing they could do. However I did have the form filled out and paid for it to be filled out by my doctor.
good,It was ok to work there but the management wasn't all to good it would have been nice to work a normal shift not 4 hrs here or come in late nite
good,"I worked at the Deli. What I basically do is provide for the customer with meat, cheese, and different varieties of food. I mostly cut meat and cheese and some times I cook and prep chickens, and some other times I'll go stock up chicken and frozen food. What I learn is how to communicate with different customer and how to treat the customer too."
good,"A typical work day is clocking in, going to the CSM podium, usually on register 17 at the Cigarette corral, going to assigned register, checking customers, zoning behind register, red-lining for customers."
good,"Day is full of confusion, mis-communication, etc. The people that I work with are the best. There is team work which I like but sometimes it is hard to get management involved with the aspects of the associates..As they say, anything can happen if only it ""is for the benefit of Walmart."""
good,"I Loved the customers,its not important what I may have learned there because I am no longer there.Management, walked around saying are you done yet ,you should have been done,always down our back,but every hour they were outside smoking a cigarette.Hardly ever knew what was really goihg on. Hardest part ,listening to management harping on us,most enjoyable,going home."
good,"Showing up thru all sorts of weather and looking to see if there are any new messages for cleaning that night.Checking in with the night shift manager for new assignments.Ordering janitorial products, con-"
good,Pay is min wage. They do promote from within the company mostly. Scheduled hours and amount of hours changes weekly.
good,"They don't treat you as a person, they don't care about your needs or values."
good,"It was a good job to get through school. If you want to work odd hours and holiday hours, then this will be a great job for you. I did not have much room for advancement because I did not want to move into their management program."
good,"hard job, each day is alittle different than the one before it."
good,"Has job advancement, work hard to acheive it, Learned alot in management. Had it highs and low days."
good,I did all the baking for the day of work and broke out the stuff for the next day to be baked plus stocked shelves as well as helping customer and cashier
good,I worked for WM when I was in school and they worked around my hours nicely.
good,"Working there was crazy loud customers, rude customers, nice customers just a mix of it all. I learned how the pharmacy works and got to see how walmart is ran. Management most of them were very nice but then a lot of them were very difficult. Most of my co-workers were great but the selected few didnt do anything but talk the day away and didnt do much work. The job wasnt hard and i enjoyed working with the new friends i made."
good,"I worked this job for awhile. The pay was good and so are the benefits. It was physical work but that is good. Plenty of exercise! I would sweep and mop the floors, clean bathrooms and offices. Everyone was friendly and I liked my job. I didn't have a manager over my shoulder per se. I enjoyed that. The temperature of the warehouse was definately the worst part of the job. It seemed it was either burning up or freezing in there! All in all a good place to work!"
good,"I begin my day by getting rid of all the out of date merchandise in my area.I then help my supervisor with counts.Afterwards i began to stock the shelves with fresh merchandise.Throughout the day I help multiple customers with their questions and concerns.I've learned patience,understanding,and better communication.The management is okay.I really enjoy my co-workers and i've made several good friends.Working in the coolers is the hardest part of my job.The most enjoyable moments are helping customers and the company of my co-workers."
good,I loved this job for most of the time I was there. When changing District Managers it was unbearable. I didn't make the change I guess. Normally very flexible I could not flex to the point the last District Manager expected it may have been personal so I do not know how to judge this.
good,. Responsible for up to 20 cashiers at a time
good,"Aprendendo muito na empresa,bom relacionamento e boa comunicação com os funcionários e pessoas de cargos elevados. Colegas de trabalhos muito desmotivadas que acabam influenciando outras pessoas com o mau humor. Creio que não a parte difícil,gosto de lidar com coisas novas e diferentes cada dia é um novo desafio."
good,A typical day at work is gettign thrown into new jobs from different departments. The management abuse their power. They walk around and just sit in the office. They dont do hard labor. My co workers are fun to work with. They make your day go better laughing nad talking while we work. I have learned to get things done and do it right. The hardest part of the job is when you are trying to help customers and they get mad and scream at you for something you didnt know or do. The most enjoyable part is meeting some of the customers and hearing their stories.
good,"It was not all that great a typical day at work included providing fast friendly customer service and maintaining a clean work area. I learned to smile even when having a bad day and to work well with others my co-workers were not always doing what they were suppose to it was like they couldn't wait to leave. hardest part of the job was having to deal with irate customers, and the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction i got from doing a job well done!"
good,"The time I worked here they changed and changed and changed. Sometimes for the better sometimes for the not so good. Long term benefits are worth sticking it out at this company,"
good,"i love meeting new people and associating with them all, the pay never seems to go up.. they have their favorites"
good,"typical day woul be very busy, learned their would be special treatments from managers to certain people, management can be very rude, really wa not that had of the job, only when u r doing things on ur own, enjoyable is my co wrkers and customers"
good,"I loved working with the customers, working at the customer service desk was definitly challenging, but it was different everyday, no two days were alike."
good,as an orderfiller it is a very physically demanding job.The pay is the best part about the job.the effects of orderfilling could have an everlasting effect on your body.simply stack boxes weighing up to 75 lbs up to 7 feet high on two pallets using a headset.
good,I Learn to speed up to get the work to done/co workers are friendly i meet a lot of friends
good,"A typical day at work was standing at the cash register waiting for customers, sometimes it was busy, sometimes it wasn't. Weekends would be very busy, we would always have to wait on CSM's for a long time. Especially for breaks or cash orders. They would usually just stand at the podium and talk to each other while our lights were flashing. The wages were really good, and the hours were very good too. I always got maximum hours, and a good hourly wage. However, I would book off time 3+ weeks in advance, and I would still not receive it off. The management, for the most part was good, but the Duty Managers were the best. Department managers weren't that great, they were very stuck up. The hardest part about my job was dealing with angry, rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and having conversations while I rang their stuff through. Also, meeting new people such as other employees there and making friends. I learned a lot of codes for fruits and breads, etc. I also learned how to deal with displeased customers better."
good,I worked night shift at Wall-Mart stocking and rotating dry grocery and dairy. I worked with many different types of people. Most of my supervisors were very strict and rigid. I learned a lot about working with other people and how to work well in a team.
good,I was there for eight years.I started in high school and at the time it was great. But as I got older and started a family it didn't work out so well
good,walmart is not the place to be anymore. they are becoming more and more corporate and implementing horrible policies that really hurt you as a sales associate.
good,"The attitude can vary on the store. In MY store our customers and the job itself is excellent, but the way the store is ran is horrible. The management team does not like working around school and doesn't like you if you arent open to work whatever hours they want. For example they will work you till 11pm and expect you to be right back at 6am."
good,"a fast pace job to work, if you accomplish your missions dailyits a in and out place."
good,"I worked in the Garden Center as a Sales Associate, though I was on the register the majority of the time. I loved the customers that came into the Garden Center versus the people out in the main store. I had fun tending to the plants and interacting with the Gardeners. It was very fast-paced, and you had to know your stuff about those plants! The managers seemed to have taken advantage of us since we weren't part of the main store, and didn't give us enough water during the summer time. They always thought that we didn't work our best because we had to handle plants, but I can assure you that we did! It's a tough job if you can't handle the heat of the summer and cold of the winter, but it is a job nonetheless, which I was appreciative of."
good,Issues between staff.
good,Diverse work place. Lots of personalities and interactions with customers
good,"pretty slow job, hard to get fired. Managers don't have much drive"
good,"Arrive at work clock in begin shift. Greet customers with a smile and light conversation while processing thier orders. Management is supportive and helpful,always pleasant and easy to get along with. Co-workers are pleasant and also easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the long hours of standing,bending and lifting of heavy objects and the shifts being anywhere from 7am to 11pm. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers I meet each day."
good,"Wal-mart is known for being the biggest retail company in the world, however, working at the retail end I would have to disagree. I did not like working at the store level. Management had there own kind of people for advancement and if you were that person you did not fit in and was mostly rejected for advancement opportunities."
good,A day at work consists of repetition and constant customer interaction.
good,aprendi a ser mais responsavel criar objetos correr do que quero
good,We start at 3:30pm set up the belt and unload the truck
good,"A productive Retail job that keeps you busy most of the time. Sometimes can be stressful. We have a few good managers that are there for their employers & some that don't care or appreciate the work you do. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help/teamwork, no family time because they work you the same crazy hours week after week. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people & the customers."
good,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart as a Courtesy Clerk starts off by entering the premises, scanning the parking lot and taking note of the current customer per shopping cart ratio. Upon entering the building it is mandatory you clock in and out accurately, just as your shift starts and begins. You may find yourself waiting by the machine to clock in as everybody is trying to do so at once. Upon exiting the building towards the parking lot after clocking-in, I grab a vest to make myself more visible and check-in with my ""CSS"" and they will give you a walkie-talkie and tell you where you are currently needed."
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart for a vast majority of the time I was employed there. It was a friendly family oriented work environment.
good,"Califico como bueno por lo siguiente, es un ambiente laboral en el cual descubri mi habilidad para lograr trabajar bajo presion constante y logros en base a objetivos, el mismo ritmo laboral te obliga a desarrollar la habilidad de organizacion y ejecucion de tus actividades, estas rodeado de todo tipo de compañeros de trabajo tanto de los que estan dispuesto a ayudarte como de los que estan dispuestos a actuar en tu contra (esto ultimo es algo positivo si se analiza de forma detenida), lo mas dificil es obviamente que por el ritmo de trabajo muchas veces llegas a perder cierta informacion concerniente a tu area, aun asi la adaptacion al ritmo laboral te ayuda a conocer las formas de informarte."
good,clean up area. service customers. contact manager of issues. and deal with customers needs.
good,"You were okay as long as you gave them blood, sweat and tears. The pay was definitely not worth the work you had to do. I am one who gives more than 100%, and they took advantage of that. It was better pay than most of the local jobs at the time. I liked helping customers and had pride in the way the department looked when a job had been completed. A typical day at work included everything from stocking shelves, cleaning, pulling merchandise from the warehouse, paperwork, counting pills, ordering product, and being a cashier. It was a rewarding experience in the end. I did learn a lot from working there."
good,If you like work and enjoy people this is the place.
good,"A very busy day no matter what time you are scheduled for. I have definitely learned different Action Codes and procedures. Management is alright. There is too many Chiefs and not enough Indians.It is like a family enviorment. We all work together as a team. The hardest part is when you have a rude customer and no matter what you try too do to please them it just doesn't work, so you Smile and keep going. Helping customers with something they need or the satisfaction of hearing a Customer say,"" You are a Sweet Cashier or You are doing a good Job-Your fine. Or when a CSM comes up to you and tells you how much Faith they have in you and you are really Appreciated!"
good,"A typical day at work consists of changing oil and tires, and servicing customers vehicles. Management is decent, but does not always listen to its employees. Some of my co-workers are great, but some do not have a very high work ethic. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers that are not as ambitious and hard working as I would like. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I can work on automobiles. I love the feel of turning a few wrenches, and getting a little greasy."
good,i liked working for walmart. i quit this job with 2 weeks notice for a full time job at intelenet global. everything was fine with attendance and other things.
good,"Learned many different areas of the store, hardest part of the job was working overnights. most enjoyable part of the job, was when the supervisor said good job. a typical day at work you were assigned to an area to stock goods."
good,try to stay busy
good,"A typical day at work varies, you may have a good day or your day may be horribly from management to ungrateful customers who tell you all day that they own shares with WalMart. I have learned that customer service is not for everyone because some people don't value your feelings or how words affect you and WalMart doesn't seem to be founded upon being a Family-First establijment first any more. Management is terrible at times, just depends on who your manager is. Management can be selfish and unconsiderate of employees needs. Employees are always depressed and it seems like a never ending aroma when you enter. The hardest part is recieving unappreciative results from management and customer alike. The most enjoyable part of the job is basically the employees because you have someone to lean on who understands what your goin through. Management either doesn't give position advancement or if they do you will not be compensated."
good,"I worked at walmart for about four years,its a good company,sometimes accurate information wasn't given"
good,Working for walmart can be fun at times. In my opinion it isnt an adults job and should be kept for teenagers unless looking for a management position. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule and the pay rate isnt the best it could be. The best part of the job is people watching and helping the customers.
good,"Working at Walmart was going really well in the begining, i was able to get everything completed to perfection and on time. I learned a lot about upc information, stocking, using a register, tellzon,pricing gun unloading the gm/grocery trucks etc. The management there was half way decent, i mean they are only human, but they could have stayed on the same page with eachother a little more. i enjoyed most of my co-workers i usually get along with everyone because i am very outgoing and a people person. The hardest part of my job was leaving, i really enjoyed most of the work that i did."
good,To greet cusomers and handle returns.I learned how handle moneygram transactions and cash checks.
good,"I enjoy my job, everyday. I really enjoy person-on-person customer service. I love teaching, I'm evening getting a degree in it. I love my co-workers, they are fantastic. We cover for each other on days we need extra coverage, often take late lunches/breaks when the schedule doesn't allot for the people working, and work VERY well on projects and customer service. The pay was not fantastic for the expected work-load, and the hours were terrible...but the thing that made it worse were the managers."
good,You really get alot of hours and you get to know the customers well.
good,The days all seemed to be repetitive. I learned better time management skills. The management often times seemed confued or overwhelmed by the workload. My co-workers were very easy going and we got along well. The hardest part of the job was picking up other peoples' slack. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers and the friendships I built with co-workers.
good,"Working at Walmart was a very eye opening experience. A typical day at work was very busy, filled with stocking the shelves and maintaining a safe environment for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I could help people find things I knew about. The most challenging part was the hard labor dealing with freight."
good,"I was responsible for loans, pickups, reconciling tills, and managing the front end. I learned that working with the public is one of my specialties. The management was poor. Sometimes, advancements were based on who you knew, not what you knew. There really weren't any hard parts of this job. The most enjoyable part was being able to assist and please customers."
good,Working at Walmart will help you meet a great variety of people and experience an enormous diversity. Management is well structured and often rotates. The hardest part of the job is trying to perform too many functions at once. This can be exhausting.
good,I started at Wal*Mart when I was laid off from factory work. I applied for holiday help and was kept on for 4 years.
good,"Wa l- Mart has two speeds, fast and faster, if you like going all out work here, Wal - Mart always gets a bad review, and yes there are some bad staffing in some of them, including but not limited to upper management, but if you can find a store that has a great staff, then you'll be happy there, Down side to Wal Mart the Insurance could be better."
good,"My typical days at work were very busy and sometimes didnt feel like there was enough time in a day to get the things done. As an Inventory associate 4 pm was my deadline were my work had to be done. I learned that urgency is something that you must have at a job. Also I learned that the customers are the most important asset to any job. If it wasnt for them we would not have the jobs that we need. Also keep them happy, make their experience a great one, and always take care of them. My co-workers were awesome. Always made the day bright and fun. Always willing to help and teach things that you want to know how to do. Hardest part about the job was dealing with the stress. There is so much that they need done but never seems like you can get it all done or if its the way they want it. Management are very helpful but also have their flaws. They are always there to listen if your having a problem at work, at home, or just having a bad day. They are always willing to teach you things. Their flaws are communication, and making the work time very stressful. The most enjoyable part of the was the people. The customers and the co-workers. They make the day great."
good,"Fast pass, Fun day, Co-Worker in my department treats me like I'm in high school and is quite rude, when I do have post-secondary educationf. She refuses to let me do things in my way. I have to do it her way. Managers are nice and understanding. I love what I do. customers and all but one co-worker are nice. I enjoy my job."
good,I've learned customer service very well. It is a fast paced enviorment that can possibly turn into a carreer. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home and knowing you made a diffrence in someones life.
good,It was never the same day twice. It was always something different no matter how you tried or wanted it to be the same.
good,Several objectives to complete. Learned how to work well with others. Friendly and helpful management teams. Hard working co-workers.
good,loved working with people very chill exelent co workers fun envirement learnd how to associate with others
good,"I cashiered, bagged the merchandise, answered questions for customers, worked in the Customer Service Department and Layaway Department, made change for the cashiers, audited the cash registers, answered pricing questions, maintained cleanliness in the front register area, made and utilized cashier's breaks, trained new cashiers. I learned a lot of inter-personal relationship skills and customer service skills, I also learned to solve problems quickly and efficiently. The management was generally supportive and helpful. My co-workers were agreeable and co-operative. The hardest part of the job was during the Christmas holiday shopping season, but that season was also exhilarating and challenging. Sometimes the merchandise was physically heavy to lift, and my muscles fatigued. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting with the customers as I helped them."
good,"Working for Wal-mart has not been what I expected it would be. I do not mind hard work or being busy, in fact I prefer it, but it seems that for the most part the efforts of those who work hard go unrewarded. Sometimes it feels as though you are viewed as expendable because well...in truth you are. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. None of my job is hard, in fact I rather like (as I have previous stated) being busy, given more responsibility, and working hard. I always do my best and work my hardest regardless of the circumstances as that is just who I am."
good,The pharmacy is an amazing place to learn about medicine and the peers are fantastic to work with!
good,productive place to work meeting people and to be with such a well known company.
good,Everyday day was pretty much routine. One good thing that came out of working at walmart was my customer service skills.
good,I had to quit for health reasons which are now resolved. Some of their ways of treating managers was not applicable to my personal situation.
good,"I would get to work around 10 p.m.. We had a lot of IMS people quit and a lot of stockers quit time and time again, so I had two full time jobs. First I would go to the back and pick out all the picks for the night and unload all the trucks and drop the pallets in the desired places. I would go out afterwards and help finish downstacking. After downstacking was over, I would rotate between helping stock and working in IMS binning the back stock. If I was able to finish IMS early, I would go back out on the floor and stock some more or help zone. At some points the whole store only had 3-5 employees between cashiers/stockers/ and IMS, some nights we didn't get out till 9:00 am in the morning. I would train the new people as well, help coach on stocking techniques or teach IMS. My co-workers had to be the best part of the job. The hardest part of my job was having to be in 3 or 4 places at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people and learning how to do all the things that were expected of me. Everyone tried really hard, 2 people of management still thought it wasn't good enough, but the rest of them were pleased with the overall dedication and how much got accomplished between just a few people. I learned how to be responsible there, how to manage my time better and to become very adaptable. I had no problem taking on the extra work, I understood, I just wish instead of everyone always being threatened to do more, that instead a simple ""thank you"" or ""good job"" would have been great. I learned there how to use an electric pallet jack, a hand jack, and an electric"
good,"It's Wal-Mart what can you say. You have your good and your bad. I did enjoy working here because I love meeting new people and talking so this was great for me. Very rarely did I have rude or mean customers to deal with. They are very willing to teach you anything you want to learn within the company, and they do work with you on your schedule which is great."
good,High energy and fun.
good,An average day at work consist of making every customers experience a memorable one and keeping them wanting to come back over and over again. I have learned many things like how to supervise a large group of people also how to be a better team player. The hardest part of the job is calming down mad or unsatisfied customers and the best part is making those same customers and happy and have them wanting to come back time and time again.
good,Always running around like crazy. Incompetant management. Great Fellow Assistant Managers. Most associates work hard.
good,"I would start the day at 8 am or 11 am first thing I would do after clocking in would be go to the computer check e-mails, tmat and enter task for my coworkers. after that I would go out on the floor and make sure that the phones, ipads, and ipos were loged in. I would try to split my time from time to time so I could work in all my areas. My asst. Mananger would give me notes to take care of some of the coworkers didn't want to do notes but would do them anyway. The store mananger started out to be ok but with a few weeks of her being there something changed, its not good manangement skills for one to tell you that training wouldn't help, thats not giving you a chance. the hardest part was having to deal with no asst. manager and a department manager for some time everything would fall on me. enjoyable part was when we would do our job and have fun."
good,It was an okay place to work but nothing i would make a career out of.
good,"Working for Walmart is a deceptively difficult job, particularly for floor associates. Management asks a lot of you in a given day, and they don't always give you the tools to do it. A large amount of discipline, diligence, and self-motivation goes into meeting or exceeding their expectations."
good,In a typical day I would over-see the work of over a 100 associates along with daily reports and deposits. I would also deal with customer situations and do coaching for improvments when needed.
good,"I liked it there, I jus felt I needed better and the pay was just too low for my lifestyle"
good,what can you say it is Wal-mart. Sometimes there are nice people some times there is not.
good,Working for walmart was pretty good but not where I wanted my career to be
good,co-workers are nice and location is good. plenty of hours available and ample chances to move up within the company
good,walmart was a good place to work but when it came to scheduling they didnt take into consideration the employees avaiblity when they created the schedules
good,I enjoyed meeting and getting to know some of co workers and managers along with customers. I would to have recieved more hours with the store rather then be cut down a few days a week. Wal Mart has many good oppurnties for advancement and moving up the ladder but it does take a while. Cashiers and people greeters need to work on their people skills and be more friendly with customers.
good,Walmart is a great company. You have some good and bad people. All days as a cahier you will meet a lot of different people.
good,Wal-mart always had work to that needed to be done. Additional hours were offered.
good,Working for this company makes you feel like you are apart of a family. Although things become stressful at times it's a fun place to work. I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,"It isn't as bad of a job as employees claim to say. It's decent wages with decent amount of effort by the employees. Looking back, it wasn't a bad job. Had fun, made friends, and learned a lot about people and employment. Definitely a good job to get started in."
good,"they offer a lunch room, give bonuses called my share which is excellent according to volume of sales, offer lockers , pay is fair and annual evualations is according to your work done in all fairness. hire seniors as well as handicapped personnel. all in all an excellent company to work for . your energy will get you a good promotion and they have discount on emplyoyees purchases which is really a nice incentive."
good,This was a job that was a passthrough while I went to school and at the same time I earned customer service and communication skills
good,A job but not a career! Try to find a better company to work for that cares about thier employees and seek that job!
good,This is a good place to work but still needs management from a worker/cunstomer point of veiw. Needs more feedback. This is a place for someone who wants to stay busy and interact with people.
good,Wal-mart helps you to learn all facets of the retail industry with it being a one-stop shop store. If you're interested in being retail oriented this would be the place for you.I've been in retail for 15+ yrs. and I've definately had some new learning experiences working here.
good,it wasnt all bad but between my son and me getting sick the had to let me go. in a work enviorment like that you need to be able to preform alot of stuff. i choose to not get the coustomers sick and if my son needed me i was there. my son comes first but i need a job to take care of him. so i need a job that i can juggle my son and work and eventually school.
good,"I currently work at walmart as an ics associate, i like the work but i only make 7.70/hr working part time, they will not move me to full time because they don't want to have to give me benefits."
good,"Simple job, very basic procedures, no real skill needed to perform job requirements. Fast paced at times."
good,Overly stressful job. Management had no respect toward employees. Day to day requirements were hard to meet due to understaffing.
good,"It was a great place to be able to move up in the company, employees are very friendly."
good,"I love my job and what i do, I just need to find a job with better work hours, and better pay. I feel that since i have the knowlegde and education that most people do not have; have i should be making a little more."
good,"Wal-mart is very productive but management is disorganized and unprofessional. Inventory and stock employees are unprofessional. However, they do provide good customer service by making sure all customers are satisfied."
good,"There are some people I like working here and some people that I don't. The management isn't too bad, although is depends on who is working that day. Their computer based learning is terrible and leads some people to quit before they start."
good,This is a great company to work for that has easy advancements and opportunities into management.
good,"walmart is your tipical retail operation,nothing speacal about it. personally i would not recomend to anyone,simply because of the way the store is run.the one good thing that i can say about walmart is they pay better than any oyher retail store."
good,"I worked grave shift stocking, the hardest bit was staying awake. It was a simple job put stuff on the shelf the benefits were ok and the team moral was ok it payed the bills couldn't keep much of a social life working nights though."
good,"customer service, I handled the money, and greeted the customers and keeped my area cleaned stocked when needed"
good,"Fired for working overtime and being 7 minutes over a meal compliance. But they would hire me back. No way, get enough people so you don't have to do the job of three people."
good,Overall Wal-Mart is a good company to work for if you don't mind low pay!
good,It was a good place to work. The managers didn't really take any notice of when I put in the request to move to a different department.
good,it was a great place to work. the pay was good. everyone was nice. learned a lot.
good,I worked the night shift it was ok but not the best sometimes. Nights felt a little long because the work was done pretty fast. when I got married is when it got harder because I needed more money to support my family. It was not easy to get on to the day shift which fit my new situation a little better
good,Gave me a lot of my customer service experience. Always willing to please the customer no matter what the situation.
good,Walmart is a very flexible with college students and it's other employees. It does have some room for advancement and the benefits are decent. The pay rate is above what I expected while working there.
good,always hiring also always firing. scheduling is random management stick with each other and does play favorites must become management to get full time and to get benefits.
good,"Walmart would not have been so bad an experience if the culture in the stores matched home office vision and expectations. Burn out fast, resources to support volume inconsistent"
good,Overall its a pretty good work place and to improve or learn how to deal with all sorts of people
good,"Worked as a TLE service writer...actual job was very enjoyable, but some confusion as to what management deemed as ""most important"" frequently pulled to different locations which made my designated location suffer, but good reviews, must be a team player and be will to do whatever is asked"
good,I like working at Wal Mart because of the great employees I worked with. I also like helping others. It is a great place to work for if you need extra money.
good,Walmart is an alright place to work the benefits are decent the work-life balance is okay the pay is fairly decent but Walmart doesn't necessarily have the highest standards for employment
good,Higher up management could make more of an effort to support their employees. Seemed like they didn't want to be too involved in the actual work of their front employees.
good,Not a bad place to work. Better than most. Good location since I live up here in the high desert. Not much slave driving for the good pay. Overall for a greedy corporation as all corporations are I believe Walmart does try to be better and fair.
good,"Benefits are good, they work with your schedule and pay well. Management gives conflicting orders and training is poor so you have to figure things out on your own a lot of the time"
good,"Though there are many perks for working there--- employee discount, major financial help getting more college education (certifications, associate's degrees, bachelor's degrees in a variety of  programs), health and medical benefits--the perks as a whole do not outweigh the starting wage rate. For example, to get health and medical benefits after 90 days, you have to be listed as a full-time employee.  But the premiums you have to pay for the health benefits, you might as well be working part-time without the benefits to get the same amount in your paycheck.employee"
good,Somerimes the hours and days are not good schedules for people with families.Easy place to get hired Pays well okay job not much to say. Overall its decent
good,Team meetings at the beginning of shift.  Give assignment and or duties to complete by end of shift.  Team work to make sure everyone has completed the task at hand.
good,"Work hard, get paid less. The annual pay raise is only 20 percent of what you make an hour.    That really sucks.  I’ve been there almost 10 years and the new hires make $1.13 less than me."
good,"I was employed here but not for long I enjoyed working here as a walmart employee the company was wonderful, and I had no problem with anyone . If I would do it all again that is fine."
good,"I found the job was good if you desired a job that was also a decent exercise, should you feel the need to be getting more fit while working. But the demanding nature of the job and the somewhat low pay was kind of demotivating. Was expected to walk/stand/lift heavy objects for very long periods of time (I worked 10 hours shifts) Breaks are frequent enough with one 15 minute every 2 hours. My biggest complaint was managements inability to pinpoint where any problems within the team were. Constantly being blamed for any of the stores shortcomings did not help improve cap 2 morale or work ethic. Other departments seem to look down upon Cap 2. If you can find a store where your Cap 2 team is thriving you are probably going to enjoy the job."
good,Una buena empresa para aprender buena escuela en cualquier área
good,"Would recommend this job at all times, worked with personnel schedule when needed. Manager has open door policy to help employees with any and all questions or issues."
good,"Walmart was good for giving me a task and leaving me to do my work. They also had two fifteen minute paid breaks and an hour lunch on an 9 hour shift, which helped to break the day up and not make it feel so long."
good,They really don't care about if you pregnant or not n sick they work you so hard the mangers are disrespectful and its hard getting back n forth from work
good,"I never had an issue working here, however some of the managers are not very smart about their positions and some are just power hungry and its ridiculous"
good,They are a great company over all the only thing is that the HR department does not tell you everything about the company like the main is in arkansas and 2 hrs ahead i got fired because they did not want to fix a mistake the system made
good,changes at this time can work on giving employee more hour to work.need better communication with between employee have they work with you on keeping store clean  .
good,Sorted packaging of items and assembled displays for local stores. Loaded conveyor belts with outgoing orders to stores and customers. Picked and packed orders for vendors as well
good,Pay is decent and hours are consistent but it's hard work for sure. Be prepared for management to not be very lenient. And dealing with customers is the best part of the job.
good,"I had a great set of team members behind me, but got pushed onto nights, and got jerked around at my expense and my quality of life, and lack of sleep"
good,"They always make sure your busy but make sure you get your breaks, they always make sure they know where their workers are at all times they dont let anyone go with out someone knowing"
good,Love working at Walmart but constant verbal harassment was always an issue. As well as unfair hours and hour cuts. Also no extra pay during busy holidays
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. I was a laid back job and a lot of the people are really good people to work with. I had to go back to the hospital because they told me they could not work around my school schedule once I was accepted into nursing school.
good,It’s typically an ok job but it’s has its challenges especially when it come to one best way because every process takes people to work as a team to make a process work
good,The management was great i enjoyed my cap 1 team. The point system threw me off i was out sick and they wouldn't take my doctors note. They give room to move up in the company and its always changing.
good,"It's retail. If you're getting into retail, then you should know what you're getting yourself into. Comments about how bad management is needs to be taken with a grain of salt as management changes within stores."
good,"Bad management, little to no equipment required for the job, and poor expectations. Managers required me to finish a 8ft pallet of groceries by myself in less than an hour."
good,"A typical day at work varies. In order to advance at this company, you need to have a positive attitude every time you walk through those doors. That will make the difference."
good,"Good job to have , good benefits . Worked customer service manager and online grocery pickup  . Also worked as grocery and gym sales associate   Been there 4 years"
good,"The job was really fast paced, management was good, the staff was  supportive when you needed help. Staff was friendly as well. Scheduling wasn't as flexible as intended. Even though it was assured Walmart had flexible schedules."
good,Its not  much to like or dislike. I work the weekend shift but I haven't work a 36 hour a week. They send us home a lot and some times before we can clock in. I live to far to drive 40 min and turn around the second I get to work.
good,I loved working at Walmart but now I can’t pass the darn assessment for my application to even get to them ! Walmart was a great place for me and kept me busy which I love !!!
good,Depending on the department the requirements can be difficult to adjust to and perform but overall a good staff and management team will make your work life both fun and helpful
good,I would work there but its to many judgement folks thats why i got quit but i would love to work there again its cool its some nice folks the pay good
good,"For the first few years I was very much enjoying the place I worked for. But once rules and management started to change, it got less enjoyable. My coworkers were very nice though."
good,"Their attendance policy is terrible, they don’t care if you have a doctor’s note or anything they will still give you a point. Other than that it’s a pretty decent place to work."
good,Walmart needs to update it's human resource policy to include better opportunity the processes for its employees. The management scene to only care about what corporate management feels is the highest priority which is clearly profiteering.
good,"Walmart is a sustainable place to work if you want a part time job, working eight hours apart.  I, myself, need more hours, and a regular scheduled shift.  "
good,"Some of the co workers and wonderful. The work is hard and challenging."
good,Workers were great when working but management was awful. Some managers were amazing and the rest were pretty bad. The pay is really good but not worth working there.
good,"Extremely hard to move up in terms of management. Most of your coworkers are slack and expect you to pick up their weight, management caves to any customer request if they threaten to call corporate."
good,"This job has you bouncing every where from different departments. You will get crossed trained in different departments to help the need of the store you work at. You will know how to stock products on the floor, stock in backroom, customer service to many more depending on the store needs."
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, mejor que mi bodega au"
good,"I appreciate that Walmart hires people to cashier that need a walker to get around. These people would be living off $1,000 a month otherwise. It’s not a great job, but it’s the big employer in town. What else are you gonna do? There are some people that have been there for 20 plus years. There is someone there I’ll refer to as “Spice” and she likes to start drama. Snaps at you and when you stand up to her she takes it all personal and spice will try to get you! There are some good ones too though. Lots of chances to promote to dept manager but so many people step down from it? Not worth the littler extra? No help? I don’t know why."
good,Salario bajo para  los trabajadores de media jornada
good,The attendance policy is not fair. The pay is also not very good. They are not flexible with the hours. The food prices are high now and customer service sucks
good,It’s not that bad of a place to work but your coworkers will only want to see you lose they are grimy and will do everything in there power to get you fired.
good,"I learned patience and how to be a better person and more friendly. I loved my job. But the changes within the company changed the attitudes of management. There was no confidentiality. If you had a problem you couldn't go to management without the person that had a problem with knowing your name. The open door policy wasn't what it says it is. The attitudes of coworkers were awful. There was no teamwork. My customers were my favorite. Getting to talk to them and hear their stories were the best. I loved my job, it was the people I worked with that made it hard. There was favoritism. It all depended on who you were as to whether or not you got to move around the store and move up in the company."
good,"Management could be really strict but its a nice place to work. I got to learn some skills such as making canvases, teamwork, and communications with customers"
good,"While I was at Walmart I would get treated unfair by a manager treating another fellow Asian better and giving him more breaks and wouldn’t care if he was late. While I had to do my job and his, never complained about it until I was late 1 day and she then decided to report me. Very unfair.?!"
good,"It was a job where I made money doing the job, cuz it was a job and whatever who cares it was just a job so suck my wonker bro. Dad why did you have to beat me with the buckle end of the belt, that wasn't necessary dude. Anyways, bye bye."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work part-time. The personnel managers were very flexible with my school schedule. Even as a part-time employee, I was promoted several times."
good,...Walmart is a alright job tbh you just have to be careful about who you know there it can become a very toxic environment but the job is a good job.
good,You have to deal with annoying people.. most of the time they complain a lot regarding their purchased and you can’t do anything but to give them Customer Satisfaction !!!
good,"fast pace, self check out I watch 18 registers. meet alot of people everyday, learn about the job every day, like the work, customers can be nice and some just have bad days."
good,Not fun. Management are not friendly. Pay sucks. Very strict on attendance and hard to work for. Time and pay are not worth it a getting paid every two weeks.
good,Great experience and great staff. Love helping customers. And also love tge flexibility with shifts. Managers was great to learn from. Great co-workers.
good,"I love to work and form strong bonds, they have good workers and a strong foundation , I’ve been there for eleven years and I enjoyed it , it’s a good place to learn and grow"
good,"It can be a career job if you want to pursue positions within Walmart, or it can be temporary. During my time there it was temporary at the time since I was in school."
good,Good place to work. There is room for advancement and pay raises. Several shifts that allow for parents or students. Benefits are good for full time employees.
good,Walmart is very stressful for teenagers that are trying to balance school or other things. They give you a lot of hours if you want them. Other employees respect you and are always there for you if you need help.
good,"The other associates overnight were the best part of this job. Direct managers were great but upper management was not.. alot of favoritism, but that's pretty much with any job"
good,"Nice people, regular customers, flexibility was good, friendly workers, great opportunities to move up in the company, always smiling faces , good company"
good,"I enjoyed the first 10 years at the company and then after getting a new supervisor, it changed everything.  It was all about what you do for me now and not what accomplishments you have that got you to where you are."
good,"One of the better jobs in this area however, in order to reap any benefits must be full time and that is really hard to do here. I really resent having to fill out a minimum of a 150  characters"
good,"Depending on what department you get placed in will determine how much of a workload you will handle. Simple work in terms of complexity but task times can be unrealistic due to residual work carrying over from a previous shift or improper inventory management. Overall, if you can keep a consistent and prompt work pace no job will be to difficult for you in this company."
good,It's alright place to work they just need to be more lenient for people and stuff you really don't get no time off like you like and it's a problem if other people call out because you got to do there job plus yours several times I had to do my job plus other people's jobs and they get mad if you use your ppto time they don't like that management needs to be more understanding
good,"Normal"
good,A security guard position helped me get better with my people skills . It’s a big and busy store so you’ll experience a lot and get to see on how to handle situations in different manners.
good,"The management was not very fun to work for, they acted like they just did not care about the employees little to at all. The rest of the employees were very pleasant and great to work for/with."
good,Walmart when I worked there was not too bad it was my first job and didn’t feel much happiness though in that Walmart and I was overnight but it’s so-so
good,Longs hours and very rewarding.   Lots of incentives for working hard.  Great place to advance career and get good warehouse management skills.   Have the ability to relocate anywhere in the U.S.
good,Working at Walmart gave me more experience with customers and the register. It also allowed me to learn how to work at a quicker pace to get the job done.
good,They do not fire the employees that under preform instead they let them abuse the point system so they can leave and not get fired and throw the excess work load onto the other employees.
good,"Muy absorbente cargas de trabajo  , por  fusiones de áreas de trabajo---"
good,"just stocked products to walmart shelves. used pallet jack to unload trucks, emptied trash, the hours were good for graveyard shift.   the hardest part was lifting heavy items that need to be stocked then i hurt my shoulder."
good,Overall my time at Walmart was more good than bad. I enjoyed my time there as an employee. My team was great and we all loved working together to get the task done!!!
good,Great workplace relationships among employees..Certain people in management were rude and unprofessional.  Some were great and very professional and would get out on the floor and work with you on very busy days.
good,my time at walmart showed me that if your not with the right group then you won't have a place with the company that could just be the vidor store but i've seen it happen multiple times to different associates
good,"- Tuition Assistance programs."
good,Walmart Online groceries was a great place to work when you need a steady job. Never found the work hard it was a very straight forward job. Enjoyable job
good,It’s ok the people are nice but you do a lot of work for little money 💰 there is always stuff to do and keep busy the benefits are ok but you got to wait a year
good,"Great benefits and fair pay. Very long hours each week and little to no work life balance. Wonderful training program facilities across the nation but, rarely taken seriously in the field."
good,You have to sell master cards in your three month probation period or you’ll get fired .... a plus is you get a discount card for 10%.... dress code of black and white
good,"The staff are nice. But the overall job I have to say lacks. It was a great opportunity. The type of work you do isn't too bad depending on what you're doing. Managers are very friendly and always backing you to move up or find better opportunities for yourself. They are abundant in giving second chances to people. Meaning they give too many of them. We had one guy, he was 19 and just lazy. Unloading trucks, we would take apart 5 to 6 pallets for every 2 he'd do. Stocking shelves, he would always opt to stock the paper towels and toilet paper, but never the juices and waters. He always chose light work, was always playing death metal in the warehouse (even though no one there liked it and asked him to turn it off) and always ran his mouth to other employees. But management would never let him go."
good,"Great place to work , easy way to move up in the company , works with school and over jobs schedules , just bad management teams .  Too much favoritism  not enough leaders"
good,"Customer service experience can be gained there and you will have opportunity to do a lot of different things such as communication, money, products, and customer appreciation."
good,"Working at the specific Walmart I did was definitely an experience. There was very little training. Hours are fixed and not very flexible. My immidiate co-workers were very nice and helpful, as well as my immediate department managers. However most of the upper management was a mess."
good,"Going from union to non union is a drastic drop in pay, health insurance becomes a joke, corporate is destroying employee happiness, no team work from AP to sales associates."
good,"Everything about the job was fine aside from the managers/supervisors. Anytime you need something, they’re always too busy talking to each other to help you. And then they get mad at you when you aren’t doing your job even though you can’t because you needed their help. No one keeps them in check."
good,"I do not wish to include any information regarding a company I used to work for. If there are any questions that you should have, you can easily ask them."
good,I have nothing to say about Walmart other than there not being enough hours in a week. They are very inconsistent with their hourly wages. I have been there over ten years.
good,"A typical day at work is good, it can get slow at times or can get really busy. The hardest part of the job is to try and get to everyone when you’re the only person in the back and you have multiple orders on the way. It would be noce to have more than two people in the back."
good,"es un lugar en donde aprendes mucho de logística"
good,you begin to feel as though corporate is using the associates lower on the ladder to further their own stature in the public eye move up the ladder if you are not opposed to having the appearance of lying
good,"Good working environment and gives you time to do personal work while balancing with the job. Also, manager was very supportive and treated everyone equally."
good,"Positives-staying busy has the time go by faster.  Occasionally I learn something new but basically I'm a cashier and I cash out customers."
good,this was my first real job. it helped me learn how to work and taught me responsibility.  though it was not a place I wanted a career at it was a great start and intro to the world of working.
good,I worked there 2 year and loved it until they decided to fire me over something extremely petty and wouldn’t even prove to me that what they were firing me for was actually appropriate
good,it was nice experience with my co worker at Walmart. environment was good and respectful. good training was given which really help me to understand and polish my working skills. the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck which is really uncomfortable time for me.
good,was nice but I worked there after I got into a serious motor accident an my ability to work was reduced an I j=had to walk with a cane but the manger didn't really like the fact that I had t use a cane cause I didn't have it when I interviewed
good,"Whats to say turnover due to low wages and conditions are the biggest problems work ethic almost nonexistent. This company has advancement potential for anyone starting out or wanting to make a better life for themselves."
good,They need better management and they also need to learn how to communicate with there employees it’s just not a establishment You Would Be Comfortable With The Management Is Not Good
good,The job at walmart was great I had fun with it and I felt accomplished after the days work. The management at walmart is not the best they dont really care about the employees.
good,"a typical day would involve working around people who weren't happy to be there and do their job. They hired people just to have bodies there, which made the job harder than it should have been, and longer days."
good,A great job to grow from and gain experience even though there are a few flaws Working there. Hard workers at wal mart end to have a lot thrown at them it may seem like it’s not worth it but after while they take notice and move you up i the company
good,Not a bad job at all just not the place for you if your going to have attendance issues but the management is great they’ll work with you as long as you can commute and show that you want to work
good,"Benefits only offered to members of management, very difficult to move up on the company, job security doesn’t exist you can be replaced for the next person for the smallest mistake, or if management just doesn’t like you."
good,I learn that you work hardest when you have someone next to you to help around. Always stay positive even when at work bc the way you approach to someone is the way you affect to them on the day even when they’re having a bad day always smile back and they’re day will be brighter.
good,"Overall the company is a good place to work for. They are very flexible and respectful with your hours. I learned how to communicate with people, even if they give you a hard time."
good,i like to work with walmart but the hours are less at walmart during winter and it will not make success in life over it a good experience work with wal mart
good,Décharger le ou les camions pour la soirer et placer les commende de maniere stratégique dans l'entrepot et sur le plancher .
good,Es una buena empresa para adquirir experiencia pero no para trabajar de por vida
good,Es una empresa que podría tener un mejor rendimiento.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but the only downside would be how management lacked training. I enjoy enacting with the different customers and different skills that can be learned.
good,Enjoy what I do but too many changes for the worst over the years. Only cares about the bottom line. They pay is great but management is expendable. Constantly reduced in the company.
good,"Management was not concerned with worker happiness or confidence. It was a place to work, but you had to make it fun for time to go by. No passion for the customer, and more of a corporate approach than a mom and pops style like a grocery store should be. Favoritism is a very common thing and it shouldn't be. If you enjoy your job, it shows in your work, and that radiates to the customer. People prefer the smaller store as opposed to the super center down the street, because it is faster and a friendlier environment. The lower level employees are great, but not appreciated by management. Not a healthy work environment."
good,"Average hourly retail job. Nothing fancy. Average hourly retail job. Nothing fancy. oooooo I just love working there , the benefits were great !!!!!the people were great the customers were stupendous."
good,"If you can work fast and hard, and don't mind learning you can progress in Walmart. It's a job that values customer service, reliability, personal reliance and organization. The hardest part of the job is the most important, and that is the customer. Even after four years of sales floor experience I still get surprised by some of the questions I am asked."
good,The company came off as strict and hard handed and then I saw that they didn't really care who broke the rules although they were really friendly. And the employees were dishonest in their work and lazy yet didn't get disciplined.
good,"If you are a cashier the job is boring and stressful, if it is other area then is ok. It is a nice experience for a first job if you are newcomer or student."
good,"It was a wareHouse job I got threw simos the mangers where young in sometimes not up to task , also they got real strict at the end unprofessional wise like if you didn’t have work they would send you home couple days later your fired ."
good,I worked in the back unloading and organizing various shipments.  I then would take the product onto the floor and fill sections as needed.  Management here wasn't bad.
good,"working there was just like working another job, the workers were cool. the hours werent that good if it was the slow season. its a very busy place to work"
good,"Was an OK place to work at first but overtime you realize how bad management is and how much you're under paid, not a bad place to work while in high school or just coming out"
good,I started working at Walmart   back then I was getting the training I deserve I was happy ready to face the challenge.   We had a team! I was scheduled to work at other departments besides deli I didnt mind doing more in fact I didnt mind I wanted to do more this happen in Aransas Pass in 2001-2012  Ibichanges at Walmart bi
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is as great place to worker, the co-workers a are friendly and it's a fun environment, there is room for advancement, However, sometimes it is hard to get more hours."
good,"mi estancia en la empresa fue grata sin embargo, creo que se necesita de una mayor capacitación y reconocimiento del personal que labora dentro de la empresa"
good,"cashier, clean register keep belt clean stock bags take trash out, they over work, although you do get your 15 min breaks on time.  its an ok company to work for"
good,The work is decent. The work is not very hard. Coworkers are kind. Staff is very kind and accepting. That's it. Good hours and excellent training it's very nice.
good,The company are good and flexibility at times.but most of the people are good and friendly. The job itself are very busy and give you as lot of knowledge. Christmas time are very busy and employee are very cheerful.
good,"It's A Good Place To Work, You Constantly Stay Busy And There's Always Something To Do At Least At My Store. Very Busy And Alot Of People Show Their Appreciation When You Take Ur Time And Answer Customers Questions."
good,"Boa empresa, bons funcionários, bons colegas de trabalho."
good,Some management and associates is okay to work with how ever others show sexism and racism towards others or they don't really care about what is actually going on and ignores you. There is also too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart everybody was so nice and helpful. I also enjoyed assisting customers and i loved to put a smile on all of their faces. I would definitely consider working for walmart again.
good,"Co workers are friendly as well ad mangers, flexible schedule room for growth, there is an employee discount, fast paced environment always something for you to do"
good,I had great experiences and poor overall I loved my Wal-Mart family.  Helped build up the inside when I was currently 6 months pregnant and worked hard.
good,"productive and fun workplace, learned the Canadian work experience"
good,"Being a student, immediate supervisors were flexible with my schedule, though store supervisors would regularly remind me my priority was to the store first.  Learned, I was being underpaid, according to new policy, and was regularly ignored when this fact was brought to light."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consist of zoning , doing returns & helping customers . Sometimes I do freight or help in another area . My job isn’t really hard it’s actually easy . I enjoy helping others & being apart of a team ."
good,The store I was worked at wasn't really care about workers. They only want the job done their want you to work fast. Management team only care about themselves.
good,"Typical work day at Walmart would consist of clocking in and immediately going to your workstation, if you're a cashier you will constantly check out costumers in a fast manner."
good,The management does not schedule well or communicate with each other. My availability was given to HR when I was hired and never was my schedule correct. I was always scheduled when during football practice and games.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for of you don’t mind hours getting cut at certain times of the year  if you make full time the benefits are pretty good
good,"Walmart is making several changes to the structure of their stores, which has eliminated a lot of management positions from the stores. Not sure how this will affect the operation of the business."
good,Good place to work if ur availability is open and friendly people .. good benefits .. managments okay .. but depends where u work .. salaries okay and the attendance policy could be better only get 5 pts ..
good,"Customer satisfaction is number one priority. Walmart is always looking for energetic, friendly and hardworking individuals who are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Sometimes that might mean doing other things that is not directly related to your job description. Keep in mind that it is just a job and don't feed into the politics of the work environment."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very busy, and a lot of walking. I  enjoyed helping  customers . The hardest part was not enough equipment to do the job."
good,"I Really Enjoyed Being A Cashier At Walmart. I Enjoyed Customer Interactions. And The Scheduling Was Great. The Only Down Fall Was The Very Strict Attendence Policy, Making It Hard For A Mom With No Other Family In Town To Help With Kids. They Fired Me While I Was In The Hospital With My Daughther Who Was 6 Mo Old And Had RSV. Then Gave Me My Job Back And Never Gave Me A Schedule And Put Me Down As Job Abandonment."
good,There are many hard working people at Walmart that I feel don’t get the credit they deserve in my opinion.  But overall Walmart is not a bad career if u like retail and choose to go in that job field.
good,"The work is not difficult and it's what you'd expect."
good,"working at walmart had helped me a lot to grow as a person but not much more than that. after working there for almost a year i feel like i haven’t learned nor advanced in my field of preference. although i’m surrounded by good people and management, i feel like this job is lube tech and that’s it. nothing more nothing less."
good,"A very good job for teenagers, but not a place you would want to stay. Between ineffective management, unfair requirements, and an average pay, this job also has very little chance for advancement."
good,"It was an all in all okay experience,  looking to go forward and making something more of myself. I would like to see myself doing better but Walmart hasn't let me succeed in my goals."
good,"Walmart was ok to work for, co workers were sometimes jerks, but most of the time helped you out any ways. Just be sure to get comfortable shoes, you'll thank me later."
good,"I started out at WalMart as a Cap 2 employee. I unloaded the trucks, put away the products and assisted customers on the floor. I also worked in Electronics doing the same thing and ran a cash register."
good,"this job was a great experience. however, this job does take advantage of it employees. some management were nice and enjoyable to speak with, while others seemed as though you had to prove your worth to them before they would treat you with respect. Generally a day at Walmart begins by asking where your position would be that specific day. depending on busyness, most cashiers go to a register and most self check hosts go to the self checkout areas. however long your shift is, you spend it in this spot, helping customers with checkouts, explaining how the devices work and solving any issues that may arise that would not need management to help."
good,"There are some really great managers there who take associates into consideration and recognize them for all of their hard work, they give them associate of the month awards."
good,"Working at the facility is a good place to work, you work hard and have long hours. But like any facility management always needs work, most of the time they listen to what you have to say. But a lot of the time it seems like it just goes in one ear and out of the other."
good,Company has changed a lot and not for the good. Longtime associates are being dropped to part time associates and their insurance is being dropped. Sad to say and not fair at all.
good,Typical cashier and customer service duties. Ok job to pay the bills. Nothing really interesting or exciting but ok job. Managers can be annoying putting pressure on you to sell credit cards to customers.
good,"*stocking and making sure isles are nice "
good,"Working in the garden center was good physical labor. I really got to learn about different kind of plans that the store carried and how to care for them. I was able to help customers with their garden center needs along with dealing with difficult customers. If I would help them with there need I directed them to someone who could, defusing the situation, to better help them find what they needed."
good,Good people and work environment  with management that is understanding of personal needs .  Not much chance of advancement .  Company is not utilizing my ability and training
good,Every time i asked for a more flexible schedule i was refused which hurt me because i had to call of or come in late many days. At the time i was taking care of my 6 year old sister just to even get 2 days out of the week changed to the schedule i needed i had to go to the store manager.
good,"Walmart doesn't pay enough for the amount of work they want you to do. They never train you properly on the job."
good,If you work hard they will work you hard and require you to do the work of the slackers. If the slackers dont finish their work it gets put on you and if you can't do it you are the one who gets in all the trouble.
good,They fired me because of occurrences because I was sick alot because I have swollen tonsils and and pooped my pants went home and I told matt the assistant manager that I'd use pto but he didnt care and fired me
good,"They time you on your ability to complete a task, which is pretty impossible, depending on what department you are in. They claim they are family oriented but don't really care and most people have extended family."
good,The work hours were fair and it felt like a workplace where I had a sense of purpose. It was close to my home and easy to access. I could provide a well needed service to my neighbors.
good,"Stocked shelves, Worked different isels everyday, switched up working in the back of the store to the front of the store, sometimes had someone working with you in your isel and sometimes hy yourself."
good,"Spend days as a corporate drone. Managers become petty. Pay is good, but there's an incentive cap. Shift work is reliable, but becomes stale after a few months."
good,Good company to work for good benefits but is very difficult to spent time with family specially if you are in a supervisor position work environment can be hard in some stores depending on store director
good,"I loved my job and what i did, the challenge is when new people come in and try to change things. The store was a pilot store, so new things were always been tried and in the long run, it turned out they did not work."
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. Not consistent with work due to constant restructures. Depending on Manager work life balance can be tough. Overall I would recommend to work here
good,I did pets every day stocked pets then bring everything that won’t fit to its right spot in the back one side had bag food the other side had boxes like treats and stuff and cat food
good,Not nice to people and people are rude managers don't listen to you very well and it's busy all the time and not enough cashiers and always a line at checkout
good,Walmart was a great place to work with great benefits. The pay is great and hours are flexible. Everyone there is super accepting and sweet. I appreciated that.
good,"When I worked at Walmart my hours and days were inconsistent. I was a full time associate, so I was there all day and almost everyday. Sometimes I would work seven to ten days straight with one day off after, sometimes two days off. Management was great when I first started, but they suck now. I made a lot of great friends, I knew almost everyone in the store. I worked in almost every department. I know hardware/paint, fabric/crafts, electronics, sporting goods, toys, lawn and gardens, pets, the whole grocery side, the pharmacy and HBA (Health and Beauty Aids). I'm also register trained."
good,"For a first job or something on the side it’s fine "
good,"Really liked managing and working in Photo Department.  Also, worked in Electronic and Toy Department too.  One summer transferred out to Lawn & Garden, the to a Front End Cashier."
good,wal mart is an average company to work for.  they do have good benefits and stock plans. but do not expect to get 40 hours per week on a regular basis
good,Competitive and happy to work with my co workers .stressful sometimes but still manageable.The treatment to the employee is not fair to all.The store was not properly arrange by sequential .Lots of products are always out of stock.
good,"This was my first job and I loved it, the only downfall that I didn’t like very much was the respect from managers to new associates. I was kinda treated poorly by my manager."
good,"Walmart has a pretty nice family culture. The biggest problem in my opinion is upper management. They have no respect for the workers, and far too much micromanagement.   Some managers are very good, and some are not very good at all.  When you are asked about some things at Walmart, it is difficult to rate them properly because there is good and bad."
good,They play favorites. Will promise you anything and everything just to give it to someone who kisses there hind ends. They are most of the time unfair. They do not understand department and will tell you to hurry up when clearly you cant
good,It's a good company to work for. They have great benefits and the management is amazing to work with as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact and help customers.
good,"You can get employee discount. They are very flexible with your schedule and the coworkers are cooperative, helpful and supportive and they are easy to accept to switch your hours."
good,I'm not sure what to say here. I am simply just trying to find a higher paying job then Wal-Mart's $11.50. Bi weekly. I don't have much to say about walmart. I like them. They are okay. But working 3rd shift and dealing with certain management there is very difficult not to mention i barely make it every week paying my bills/rent with that 11.50.
good,"This job can be both boring and frustrating. The managers are lazy 90% of the time and unless your they're favorite they don't pay you much attention. The store is unorganized half the time, which is bad if your someone that has ocd. unless your able to be pulled to do more work to get hours going through the day, your gonna be bored out of your mind, and don't even get me started on the customers when its a busy day. "
good,"Its an okay. the pay is not great. you only get alot of hours during the holiday season..     WHAT YOU DO PLEASE DO GET ANY TIME, its only for mangers."
good,"Each day is busy, love working with people of different culture. The hardest part of a day is trying to get everything done but the best part is the team I work with."
good,A typical day at work as a cart attendant includes working mostly outdoors for the most part of a work day in all types of weather. The people tend to be nice.
good,"The benefits are good and nice perks. However, the scheduling sucks and after the holidays they cut hours for months. Then before inventory they want you to work overtime."
good,"A typical day at work was to work the merchandise at the sales floor while helping the costumers too for their needs,adjust and verify every display on the department making sure they had the correct price. I learned how to be very responsible, to work on a clean environment and I learned how to control the inventory for shoplifters by locking the merchandise on special cages, also I learned how to upload trucks with merchandise. The hardest part of the job was working on a fast-pace when the store was very busy by the costumers, I had to adjust and work very focus so that way i wasn't gonna get stressed and  my work wont be affected. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say that was that we was working as a teammates and we was able to help each other until our work task was completely done."
good,Walmart was a nice and good job very respectful co workers and managers. Learned a lot in a few days and it’s a pace work place you have to keep up...
good,a normal day at work i learned to be sociable with customers but the management is horrible. the hardest part of the job is trying to stay up at most enjoyable part is working.
good,Have to be physically fit to perform the job. (Lifting many lbs. onto pallet to be loaded onto semi.) Working long hours -- 12 hour workday. Quotas required.
good,Ok company to work for. Not the greatest benefit. Lack of job security and outdated technology. Very poor number of vacation/sick days. Location is very undeveloped
good,"Decent job, flexible hours  for the most part. Management doesn't show much interest in employees . Employees aren't held accountable . not much room for advancement."
good,Walmart trusted me to supervise and be in control of areas on both sides of the store. Working with various types of people and learning how to be successful within the company.it opened management skills to me.
good,Management seems to be focused on their personal goals and not the overall goals of the establishment.  I've seen management undercut each other just to achieve their goal.  Lack of teamwork.
good,Been there for 28 years trying to get a transfer to store or sams club had a accident and broke my ankle be less stress on my leg other than that I enjoyed my job
good,"Too strenuous a job as cashier, even the very young found it difficult on the belts....too much heavy lifting and repetitive work, I was in constant pain...."
good,Walmart is a difficult company to work for due to the quality and quantity of people who shop and spend time there. It makes it difficult to be in a manager position.
good,I really enjoy helping patients with their eye care needs and performing customer service. I feel a sense of accomplishment when they come in confused on what to order and after I explain and show them the different options they have a clear understanding of what they are getting.
good,"Has diversity. "
good,fast job that you will have to have skills in i left cause someone try to steal my bike and damage the front wheel of my bike and. some of the mangers are not nice and wants you to be already hands on. but done let my experience sway you from working there you may like it and do good at wal-mart
good,Walmart is a place to work it’s just that I was doing school and work got distracted.. I was a cashier it was a very friendly environment I would recommend new employees
good,Walmart is a good company overall and has multiple benefits that can help you in your future or as you grow old .If you are not interested in turning it into a career you’ll notice you’re getting underpaid for the task you have to accomplish .
good,Wal-Mart has gotten to the point were they only care about money and less about the employees and customers. I have a manager that all he does is sits in the office on his phone
good,"Working for this company was great, because everyone I worked with was easy to get along with. It was easy for me to learn everything. "
good,For the overall rating in I give Walmart a three because the pay is alright but the job is pretty cool and the people there are very helpful and willing to help when needed.
good,"Consistently busy throughout the afternoon and evening, busiest on the weekend."
good,"L'impolitesse des clients peut parfois  être dure à supporter si vous n'avez pas  de patience ,mais ça permet de forger une patience, de la tolérance en tant qu'individu."
good,The hardest part of my job is listening to a boss tell you to do one thing when you know it's not going to work. Especially when you've done these things correctly in the past.
good,It was a pretty good job to work. I had got some experience at the time as well as being able to communicate better as an individual. I had learned skills that i could take somewhere else to use successfully.
good,I loved my job when I actually stayed in my said so department (electronics). When short handed in other departments they call you over and expect you to stay in department you weren’t hired on for. They pay wasn’t worth the amount of work they had me doing. Loved my department but it was unorganized. We had 3rd party vendor sell contracted phones and I don’t think they did a good job with customer info aka counter and/or just thrown in drawers.
good,Got it's good and bad qualities. Not a hard job. Do your job the best way you can. You will be fine. Learn what your store has in it. Customers are going to ask where everything is at. Be polite and respectful. No matter what.
good,Its an okay place to work. Employees are nice and friendly and its very convenient to town. Some of management is helpful. Work schedule is okay until they cut hours.
good,"Good learning experience, great teamwork, and management cares about their employees as well as their customers.  Even with being a massive organization, there are always areas to improve."
good,"Walmart as a first job is a great learning experience as to how most retail stores operate, as well as experience in other fields such as customer service."
good,"Management was great treated everyone like family , they’re flexible with hours , pay could be better. Full benefits , customers are the best part you meet all types of people and build relationships"
good,"People you work with can be nice, but there can be an excessive amount of work to do. They can pull you from your department to ring the registers and be disappointed when you dint get your work done in time. Pay could be higher, but overall not too bad"
good,I don't have anything bad to say about this company it was good when I worked there. They pay good and give you a lot of hours. The workers were good to get along with.
good,My role as a CSM is very stressful and highly underpaid. One bright side is that you'll learn how to perform in a very challenging environment and deal with angry customers
good,Walmart Is a great company and they lead in customer service. They’re a world wide company and they give back to the community! The management is great!
good,"Long hours, pay could have been better, holidays chaotic, management some good some not so good."
good,The company is sometimes good to work for... Just really looking for more of work life balance for family and a career work place where I'm more comfortable at work as well
good,The work environment is great with fun and energized people. However the management likes to micromanage a little to much. Also they expect one person to do too much.
good,Walmart offered me great pay. The employees we nice and helpful especially on my first day. I enjoyed the steady pace of the position I was working and appreciated my friendly co-workers
good,"I have been with Walmart for a sometime and its a really great job, management is always there to help you if needed. I would rate working for this company about an 7/10"
good,"Hard work is expected, especially from night shift, to get the store pulled together.  Too many managers trying to rewrite the book and do things their way when corporate enacts a new program.  It's simple....See the book.  Be the book.  If everyone did their part, there is not a company on earth that could stop them."
good,"Depending on your location, Walmart is likely to pay well. In my personal experience it's also pretty hard to get fired and there's plenty of chances to move up. That said, I've seen about five or six full manager rotations. And there's a 90% chance whoever you have over you will not be the type of person you want over you."
good,They would allow employees to recieve discount and bring food to the breakroom. The supervisor were very cool and interactive. They connect well with their customers.
good,The starting pay and quick raises are nice. However that’s about the only good thing. I didn’t get the shift I wanted and probably won’t be able to switch for over a year. The managers don’t really put forth much of an effort to train or explain anything. And there is no holiday pay or sick pay. Also the production percentage they require grows monthly. It’s very overwhelming and underwhelming
good,"I’ve never felt appreciated at work. Not necessarily because i need it to preform well just different from other employers. It is a work environment where it forces you to have thick skin because sometimes customers and associates alike, don’t have the utmost respect for others sometimes. If you’re looking for a place to get a paycheck and go home, then this is the job for you. Even though it’s relatively easy work, I think they should raise the wages to be more competitive"
good,"A typical day includes staffing, scheduling, inventory maintenance, prescription verification, patient counseling, medication therapy management, immunizations and wellness screenings"
good,This job would bring me join and I really love working at Walmart its my favorite store and place to work. And I feel like this company could change people life because it brings joy.
good,"allows room for growth, very friendly fast paced environment. No Department is too difficult must have a friendly personality and not get irritated with problem customers"
good,"A typical day at work would include being productive and active with the customers making sure all floor sales are okay and assisting any customers. In my department you learn how to have active people skills and how to interact with people. The hardest part of the job would be management really didn't care about it's associates the scheduling was pretty poor, but I did enjoy the people and just being in Walmart was interesting."
good,I love working at a grocery store I can get my jod done. I am a hard worker I am good with customers if customers need help I will help find what they need.
good,"Very fast paced workplace, Management was sometimes helpful. Good employees typically. Sometimes the customers make the job difficult. The pay was competitive."
good,Walmart Distribution has excellent company employee service. Career advancement needs to be fixed as far as pay. Supervisors are easily approachable and will help to ensure proper quality of work.
good,As i have worked in the nursing home businesses for a total of almost 3 years now i can honeslty say this wasnt my favorite job. Every one knows that a nursing home is hard work and things dont always run very smoothly. I feel that the management needs to step up and be the management needed for teamwork for this location.
good,Litterally kept watching and harassing me waiting for me to make any mistake wasnt a comfortable experience at all hoping the next time I work at this business it's not the same harrasement
good,It is a nice place to work especially if you’re a college student they will work with your schedule if you just talk with management. I recommend this job if you’re a people person like I am.
good,I liked this job because Walmart is always busy. Your day goes by really fast and you enjoy interacting with the costumers. Good job environment overall.
good,"Working for walmart helped me much more with costumer service.It gave me opportunities to grow in their company, even though I was not there to stay for a long time. It was simply a temporary job until school was over."
good,"Not much to say about this company than what everybody knows. Not really good benefits. Most managers apparently don’t remember they came from the bottom too and they may treat you bad sometimes by yelling at you. Honestly, if you can handle that you can work there for 1 or 2 years until you find something better."
good,"Walmart needs a lot of improvement in management. At first the job was great, after awhile I felt as I was being taken advantage of and treated like a slave."
good,flexible hours; low pay and doesnt care about employees; open door policy; not consistent hours and absentee policy isnt sufficient; feel used as though only work when needed for important events or holidays
good,if you're not used to working overnights i don't recommend it because it drains you and you get no time to do anything with your family and loved ones
good,Just an alright place to work! Good for in between jobs. Most of the staff and people there are very friendly and nice to work with. But nothing more than that.
good,The work environment was very pleasant for as big of a corporation as Walmart is. The management and supervisors were always very helpful and on call when ever a question was asked
good,It is great in the beginning. Obliging. Nice. Act like they'll work with you then pull out a bunch of rules everywhere - hold kids emergency appts against you etc
good,"Depending on locations managers can be a burden and like to contradict themselves but others will be support and helpful. In terms of work, it is not physically demanding"
good,Some of the front end managers are nice and care about how they treat you. A typical day at work is very busy. The hardest part is dealing with all the different types of attitudes.
good,Constance oil and tire changes. Help build great customer service and communication skill. Learning good teamwork in the workplace. Making customer happy was the best part of the job.
good,Overall a decent company just looking for something more. Something with possibly better benefits and better management. Pay was decent at first but raises came fewer and fewer over time.
good,"It's Walmart, so the pay is bottom of the barrel, and head office only cares about you so far as to not get into legal trouble. That being said, depending on the location the management are often very acommodating and the job itself can be decent if you like socializing with strangers."
good,"Overall working at Walmart as  a customer service rep was a good experience. I love to work with the public and enjoy helping people ! Working in customer service is basically being a problem solver , I enjoyed helping customers who was once angry about something best part was solving there problems  and customer walking in upset and leaving with a smile !"
good,"ótimo local de trabalho ,agradável e alimentação dos funcionário boa"
good,"Great job some good people,assis.man was poor man. Skills,there job skills need improvement  and the hrs kept getting  cut,they need a union to protect the hard working associate s and they need higher pay for assoc."
good,"Overall, Walmart is a decent place to work for. They have flexible hours. The staff is friendly. They have great customer service. The job is fairly simple to complete."
good,I come to work every day and do the same thing i make sure everything is in right place prices are right and so on and so forth I unload the truck and put the stuff in the department that it goes in and after truck is unloaded and everything is in its right Department we work the Department's and put the stuff on the sales floor
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar el problema son los encargados de las áreas ya que ellos toman una posición muy estresante
good,Depending on what store you work at it can feel very unwelcoming and you can get caught up in drama very fast if you’re not careful especially with management
good,"I enjoyed my job which is why I stayed there for so long, but due to my poor management I decided to leave and find something better or more consistent."
good,Typical day at work can be hard sometimes. Because it feels like you're being pulled everywhere and that you're under paid and not appreciated for the work you do.
good,"Not very people oriented, very poor communication between management and management and staff.  Management does not inspire morale nor encourage quality customer service"
good,"My experience is bumpy, as not only is the management always fluctuating, but some coworkers aren't the friendliest or best working. My best advice, go for a department that isn't OGP"
good,A nice job to start with getting better with the working environment. Nice people. Teaches you great customer service skills. Staying busy with a lot of things.
good,"It is a good job to start with if you are seeking experience in retail, however there is not a position that provides a living wage without reaching a management level so if you want to work there as a life long career I would start at a young age so you have time to move up."
good,While working for this company I felt valued as an employee. I enjoyed going to work. I enjoyed the people that I met during the time while being employed with this company.
good,"Walmart has a long history of providing comprehensive health care and benefits to their associates, and the quality plans that are offered are among the best in the retail industry."
good,"Wal-mart can be a really good start for you to be your first job at 16. Wal-mart gave me a chance to show my real side and my real emotions, I even got a great chance to make various of favorited customers that I still know today!"
good,"Not a bad place to work with plenty of opportunities to learn and do different things, the company just seems like it's moving in a different direction to help itself and not it's employees."
good,Pull pallets from trailers and stock shelves with items and make bailes of card board boxes and keep overstock room in order and maintain cleanliness so no harm can happen
good,This job was a job that I got at 17. I was bring home roughly about 620 every 2 weeks which isn’t bad at all if you ask me. But honestly is about how you make the job
good,The good? Easy to get on and paid fairly well for what it is you do. The bad? They prioritize tenure over skill and have a ridiculous way of dealing with time off. Management tends to be either entitled or ignorant but you don’t have to spend much time engaged with them
good,Walmart has great pay but does not care about their employers or their well being. Walmart is a very money hungry company and does not care much about their employees.
good,My experience working with Wal-Mart was good. I went in with little experience of accounts payables. I left with a wealth of knowledge of accounts payables processes..  I believe that the information obtained will help me greatly in my job search..
good,Would love to be able to go back. I really enjoyed working there as a reg employee. But not so much as a manager that’s how I lost my job they knew I didn’t have any experience at the time
good,"There are good people to work with and are fun to be around, but the management suck and if you are a miner it is hard to get hours depending on your availability."
good,I found everything good. The managers were so good. Pay rate was also satisfying. I Would recommend this job to my friends. Because it is hard to find Job like that.
good,"It's not bad but not great, management feels like they're setting you up for nothing or failure, managerial retaliation is heavy, and frankly there is no care for seniority."
good,Cashier dealing with money all day making transactions greeting customers as they walked up to check out helping customers if it was needed helped at the customer service desk
good,When I first started at walmart I had little to no experience at that type of work..Within a week I had everything down packed and it was AAA's if I'd been working there for months..I enjoy learning and the experience that comes with it..
good,"Walmart is not the same place anymore.  We have set guidelines/rules, but nothing is consistent, it depends on who you are, etc.  Very frustrating place to work."
good,"As a cashier you will stand at the register, operate the belt, scan all items, and accept payment. It can be both rewarding and draining to constantly engage with customers so I would not recommend if you are not comfortable talking to strangers."
good,"Honestly, at times people are not treated fairly. But nanagment disbyhier best to resolve e the issues. Great people work there. Nwnwnwnwnwnwnwnenene.s.snsnsnsnnsms s.sns.mmejjsjsjsjjdjdjjsjsjskxuxuxuu DHS jejehshxuxjejjsjdhjj DHS sjjsnjs hi uxjsnenjsh zdx jjdjwjjs."
good,Company over all is ok but can be difficult at times with giving hours. Easy work and friendly associates. Customer can be difficult but if you remain calm it is easy to deal with
good,"it's a decent job, but some of the management can let the position get to their heads. they'll overwork you. but it's not always like that, the place was turning over a new leaf last checked."
good,You would get close and become friends with co-workers. If you needed help they would assist you. You could always put in a code and request help from supervisors if you need help money for you drawer
good,Walmart is not a bad company. They tend to focus on what’s best for the company instead of what is best for everyone including the employees. It’s hard to do certain things because it feels as though you are expected to be a robot and not have a social life when that is not how it works.
good,Walmart corporation is more concerned with profits then bbn its employees. The  floor managers are more about the employees then the store managers and the corporated office
good,Iam ying vang i well working in company iam the good worker if i helping my coworker i have to finished my job before i going home i like to work overtime.
good,good place to work for some one whos looking for a job in customer service i recommend it plus you get benefits and the pay is good i had fun while i worked here
good,"Managers do not work alongside employees - they work over their employees. The relationship is akin to a security guard and a prisoner. "
good,It is a good place to work. The pay is better that other places in town. The point system is ridiculous. They care about their store (WalMart). It use to be the employees  customers then the company. But not anymore. But I'm there every day doing my job. Helping customers and sevring the community.
good,It was not entirely a bad work environment. Mostly the problem was some of the people and some harassment issues by both some coworkers and customers but they were mostly handled.
good,Walmart would not be a good career choice for young people. Walmart is all about making money for corporate. They care little about the employees and same for customers. Walmart believes they are so big and have little competition thus the customers have to come to them!
good,I enjoyed working on a team and meet new people.I also enjoyed the fact that I could help people with questions they may have. I try my best in every situation.
good,This job was okay for the most part. For me the downside was being a department manager over 2 separate departments and didn’t have reasonable help under me. Eventually got very overwhelming and I had regrets for taking my promotion from truck unloading
good,"Coming into work being greeted. I learned a lot about electronics. The hardest part of my job is running back and forth from electronics to the photo center."
good,"They do not care about their associates, management or hourly. There is no work/home balance. They do not care about anything but money. Nothing like it used to be."
good,"In an ordinary day the job was busy and a full days work. Always helping customers of course, making sure the shelves were stocked, and making sure all the products were pulled forward for the customers."
good,It was a good place to work. I felt valued but it didn’t matter how hard you worked you will still get paid the same. Learned a lot and grew a lot while working here.
good,"A typical day at work is building your cart to clean up spills, clean bathrooms and pick up trash. I learned no likes to work at Walmart. Management is fair"
good,Daily interactions with customers who also shop in Walmart were great and that leads to more business for the auto techs. Building those relationships also help bring in other customers.
good,"The overall work isn't horrible. The ideal practices are nice and efficient when put to use. Sadly, not everyone holds to those standards, and they are often set aside by a ""just get it done"" mentality."
good,Great company not so great employees but some were amazing to work with just wish some of the other employees were the same my experience was not the greatest
good,"depending on who you work for depends on if you like your job. you do get paid a bit of money, 11 dollars an hour is minimum but you have to be able to handle the managers there"
good,Working at Walmart helped me learn a little bit more about being a people person and working with others. I’m glad I had the opportunity to work there and experience that.
good,its only part time work. But its not hard to stay employed it is really hard to get fired. they always need people and you work short handed all the time.
good,They have cut hours so low that a family can not make it . mangers are very gpood and need the help but corporate want approve it the people there are like family very willing to help you out with any thing no
good,"My Day start with putting out freight. Most of the time I have to zone the department because it was shorthanded the night before. I do the job of two people because of the cutback. Often work in other area to help put out freight. I have a secondary position which is Jewery, some morning work as a phone operator. I have learned to micro manage my time, also I've learn to pierce ears and work on jewery. My immediate supervisor work as harded as I do. I must say I enjoy the customers some are repeat and others are new but I enjoyed the conversation and helping someone when they are looking for that special item for a special occasion."
good,The typical day a Walmart was customer service stocking merchandise and working in a team environment. I learned a lot about customer service and product knowledge. One of the most enjoyable things about it was decorating cakes and seeing how happy kids were when they got their cakes.
good,The work can be repetitive with stocking shelves and taking the products off of pallets but provided a paycheck and opportunity for me to gain experience with my coworkers as I worked alongside them.  The culture is designed to be enthusiastic and progressive so that there is always improvement.  The hardest part of the job is the same as the most enjoyable part being the interactions of myself and my coworkers along with the interactions with customers.  The people that I have worked with have been a great help at times but they can also be a hindrance.
good,When I first got in with Walmart  it was good work was fine and the people  there were ok too but it was hard to get hours  they didn't  really put me on the schedule and in the end of December they didn't put me on the schedule at all so I decided to leave and try to find something better
good,The working environment was dirty and so much was expected of us it was difficult to get little tasks done without criticism of not getting everything done in one night
good,It is a great experience but the management lacks organization skills to make the work go smoothly and quickly as possible. You have to work hard to in such a company.
good,"La empresa como tal tiene muy buena cultura, para la aplicación en los asociados y fomenta la igualdad de géneros y con la diversidad de personas que laboran en las diferentes áreas de la organización, ademas esta muy conmprometida para apoyar a los trabajadores a lograr sus metas y apoyar al crecimiento tanto de manera personal como de manera profesional para la creación de nuevos lideres."
good,"Una empresa sólida con iniciativa y profesional, "
good,This company is constantly changing to try to improve customer service and sustainability. Employees are treated fairly and with respect...………………………..
good,They could handle treatment of employees better. They pushed me around a lot and put a lot of overreliance on my shoulders. I am fortunate to have found my way out.
good,"A typical day at work was, hectic and fast paced, I learned how to stack and everything, the management is cool and respectful, the hardest part of the job would be the hours having to work over night and sometimes over 12 hours is sometimes a hard thing to achieve."
good,it was ok i just wish it paid more and was a little bit more flexible but there was some very nice people that helped me get through the work day. Not only that but pto was nice as well.
good,"Walmart has been a fairly easy experience the job task is repetitive and takes little in the way of analytical thinking to get the job done. Pay is low, but that is to be suspected at this level of employment. Overall I have enjoyed my time at Walmart for a starter job."
good,management was scary. everything else wasnt to bad. didnt care for the way management would pull you from your department to do other department work and than ask why your department didnt get their work done in it.
good,"Everyone says Walmart is the worst. It is a very good high school or college job, but i wouldn't want to make my career out of it. That said, many people do make their career out of, like the current ceo who started as a cart pusher."
good,Strictly business. No room for socializing or getting to know co-workers. Dangerous environment. People get injured a lot. Extremely High turnover rate.
good,Great place to get into to get you’re feet on the ground so that you can build yourself up and pursue the career field that that you really want to be apart of.
good,I realized that this was not the career I wanted to stay in but I appreciated all of the experience I received from it. I left to pursue my education and I have graduated with my Bachelors now.
good,Walmart cuts employee hours with out talking to the employer. Management never agree with any complaints or any employer. Employer are promise raises and they don't management don't comply. There is a lot of discrimination
good,Great place to work for people that are retired it's a great place for people to work as high school students as thank you college students it's a great place
good,Walmart was okay..i worked there for almost two year and i was able to move up positions to make more but management is not the best and allot of favoritism
good,"Unfortunately not reaching its potential in employee satisfaction and vendor relations.  On a positive note, I did my best at my position and met many wonderful people."
good,Walmart was a good learning experience.  The management was difficult and didn't want to listen to concerns but it was good overall.  I had a variety of jobs that I performed so I learned a lot.
good,"You have always to work fastly, Some managers are good and others not. They hate mistakes. The launch period is long enough to be relaxed and to continue working after your pause."
good,Very click like employee environment Some teamwork. Micro management from managers disconnect from Manager's to employees. Great learning and working with customers
good,The Assistant Mangers coming into the company have no retail experience and cant really answer the questions sometimes asked there not knowledgeable about whats going on in this retail world and they never come back with any follow up.
good,Muito bom obrigada mais poderia ser mais fácil pra mim por favor responde mais nada
good,"While Walmart is not my idea of a long term career, it served its purpose as a part time job to help pay for my college bills. The hours were fairly flexible for someone in my position and the pay was not unreasonable."
good,"Overall it was a good experience getting to learn how to manage people, assign tasks. Many associates seemed unhappy with some of the tasks that they were given. Good benefits"
good,"I feel that the family company feel, died with Sam Walton.  I don't think that his ideals are followed any longer, and I feel the company has suffered for it."
good,"Its was okay, it was a job. They paid okay and gave me good hours. They were understanding for doctor appointments. I only don't like it now because I wasn't approve for leave of absence to have my son."
good,"To achievements your goals and working hard so that you can reach your goals and dreams comes true "
good,Working at Walmart was fast pace. It's a very busy store so that meant a lot of hours were given.  I think for a part time job it wasn't the worst place to work.
good,"Walmart is alright to work at, but if your looking to advance there seems to be a problem with promoting within Walmart. It’s been difficult transferring as well which hurts when your moving. Management seems to prioritize efficiency over associate care and job satisfaction"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work during college. However, I am approaching my senior year of college and would like to see other career options related to or not related to my major or minors."
good,"Great benefits, good pay, but not family friendly. Difficult to have a schedule where there is a fair work/family balance. Company does not care how much you get to see your family"
good,"This is a burnout job with very high turnover. Not much appreciation for hard working employees. Too much favoritism."
good,Overall half the staff and employees was great not all of the customers where nice as me or great but that’s any job Wal-Mart is okay in my eyes but maybe great to others
good,Always happy to help employees go above and beyond for the customers to meet their needs. Company has lots of employees in each area. Room for growth within the company
good,"A lot of False Accusations from Customers Due  To Thier Demeanor "
good,"If constantly looking to advance, unfortunately you can do it all like show up to work (to include days off) to continue advancing your career. Seniority definitely plays a part in the decisions for advancement."
good,"Clean backroom before unloading truck,unload trucks which takes 2-3 hours with a team of 8-10 people. Our support try's his best but lacks teaching methods. Everyone is super cool and new   Associates don’t have trouble fitting right in. The hardest part is the dealing with mangers sometimes but not all of them. The best part is meting new people and making connections to our costumers and fellow associates."
good,Good company to work for but also not so good. A lot of favoritism and people not getting what they have been promised from the start. Guarantee 40 hours
good,Good company policy but ridiculous policy that punished employee for every mistake no matter how small. Lack of communication especially when employee was not at work when new rules were announced.
good,Era o maior do mundo. Mas com a venda os Walmartians for rotulados
good,Walmart helped me gain customer service skills and provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my communication skills among others. It was a friendly work environment that allowed me to grow in the company within a couple of months pushing my capabilities and responsibilities. I perfected multitasking and maintaining a positive attitude towards customers and employees my coworkers.
good,"management sucks"
good,"This job was okay. Everything was good. my co workers were friendly and well going. The reason I wouldn’t give this a higher rating was because of the hours they would give me. I was a part-time employee getting 35-38 hours a week (a few hours shy from full-time). At that time I was a full time student, with a lot of pressure from school and work."
good,You’ll have good days and bad days just like every other job. It’s all about how you handle situations. Working with the public can be very stressful at times too.
good,It was okay. Just need to know how to work with a school schedule and kid. But its a good place for your first job. Just don't have kids or be in school
good,Walmart was ok. The one i worked at didn't have alot of loyalty there. Managers didn't seem to really care about the employees. It was everyone for themselves. Thumbs down.
good,It was OK but some managers are rude for no reason and randomly go on a lot of LOA's. Some where nice but most of the time there was no training. Just here you go figure it out.
good,"The money was great, you have to be willing to give up days off or have a VERY flexible scheduled. I had to hug my phone because i could be needed at anytime."
good,Their attendance policy is very strict. As a new employee you are not permitted to miss any more than 3 days in 6 months. That's unrealistic. People with families have things happen. I know when I get sick it lasts more than 3 days. I don't feel they care about their employees well being. They would rather us go in sick than miss a day. I think that's unfair.
good,its Walmart don't expect too much. you are a number within the store and company. do not expect to stay there for the rest of your life unless you want to waste your life away.
good,"Supervisors were almost always to give advice, and workers were always willing to help if a team member was needing it. Everyone was always doing their part."
good,Walmart is a place that is based on a team that turns into a family. in have been with the company for almost four years. In the beginning i loved my job and everything the company stand for but that has changed. now im not receiving any hours.
good,"It can be high school or college all over again, but opportunities and advancement is good."
good,A very different company constantly changing without a clear plan. It’s only geared for upper management to flourish. The regular works are expendable.
good,"fast paced, with opportunity for advancement. always willing to promote people and give them a fair chance to shine. some associates aren't always tolerable though."
good,Clock in and begin to retrieve carts from parking lot. Then clean up any mess from the cart section or outdoors. The managers are fairly nice and helpful. Stressful work environment.
good,"Non climate controlled warehouse work. Company expects unrealistic goals. Manager/Employee favoritism. Company implements new policies or procedures that aren't 100% complete but expects employees to adapt and still reach goals with no down time given. Decent pay, good benefits,  4-10hr shifts wkdays or 3-12 hr wkend"
good,"Coworkers were easy to work with. Management was overworked and understaffed. Claims to be family oriented, but yet did not feel as though they wanted you to spend time with your own family."
good,I believe that Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you need lots of money like many people . It wasn’t the greatest job in the world and the management wasn’t the greatest either but my checks were lovely as long as i was assigned enough hours .
good,Walmart offers multiple benefits related to college and financial support. There are managers that push you to complete your tasks under the given time.
good,My job was to make sure I greet all my customers and along with that makes sure they have everything they came for today; lastly thank them for shopping with us
good,During a typical work day the managers doesn’t really do any work. The workplace  culture is very unprofessional. If you know what you’re doing when you training then the job is so simple.
good,The Hardest part of the job is lack of consistent communication. Nobody seems to know exactly what is going on from day to day. When things pile up it becomes difficult to get back on track.
good,I did not stay long enough to right a complete review. I was laid off before the end of year was put started around Thanksgiving. Barely have me hours
good,"I loved my job at Walmart, you get a long well with coworkers, lots of benefits, and flexible schedule. It’s very busy so your time flies by pretty quick"
good,"Fun place to work ,the employeess are very  nice and they look after each other, the hardest part of the job is working in the freezer  ,the job is ok"
good,"No piden mucho, lo malo es la rotación de personal y aveces se carga demasiado el trabajo, exigen y en mi caso no dan equipo de protección adecuado. Se carga muy pesado y a veces hay preferencias."
good,I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things. I like helping management reset and get out new inventory. I am always willing to help in other areas of the store when needed
good,"The typical days used to be going to work and doing what my job title says to do. cook, customer service, and make sure my crew is doing what they need to do. They have now added on making sandwiches which is mainly morning crews job along with training more new people. What I have learned is that your opinions will only matter when it is convenient for the managers. Also, I have learned that when you don't have time to do another person's job they will write you up for it. Management is terrible. They are all over the place and some of them befriend other associates to the point where those certain associates get special treatment. The hardest part of the job is meeting the manager's demands and worrying if we are overproducing or under producing. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers and helping people who need assistance."
good,Wal-Mart is focusing more and more on the grocery business.  The online pick up today grocery is flourishing.   This aspect of the company is helping out customers that don't have the time to grocery shop.
good,"Making sure your area clean and neat"
good,I love going to work for my fellow asst. I work the job was born hard I was to the point to where I was the only person running my dept I have no asdt. No asst. Manger just me as the dept. Manger I go know help and my dept change twice a yr so I reset it in myself stock my self and plus everything else you have to as a dept manger the job is hard and very stress full to the point where we just had an asst. Kill herself but the pay is good
good,"What I learned on my job, and my goal was to work in every department at that store so that I could become a deptartment manager. I took the test and past it. I did not get the position. I felt that I was not treated fairly. I was 'always on time, never missed a day not unless it was an extrem emergency. Always worked at other stores  when they needed my help. Even worked on the remodel team if I was asked to come in early I did. I felt as though they did not treat me fairly. Also I got to learn every department. Also could tell you where everything was located at in that store."
good,"Although I was able to advance quickly in my career with Walmart, I was not compensated fairly for the position I held. My management team was difficult to work with on a daily basis."
good,Great atmosphere wonderful company to work for customers can be nice  and employees be nice for you can be nice. Bright future can be felt working for them.
good,"typical day at the job was clocking in, get everything set for the start of your shift. I had an amazing supervisor so it wasn't a hardship. took the job for flexible hours"
good,"1. Different every day."
good,Its a good first job I recommend unfortunately they are not giving me the hours i need so i have to search else where because i have 4 children and bills to pay
good,With Walmart you need to be able to handle change that goes on all the time. You could take 4 days of vacation and somethings has changed. Management also changes little things that sometimes make no sense why these things happen.
good,"Pretty much what the title says. Mostly just ""a job"". The work was pretty hard some days but I felt I was paid adequately enough. The managers were inexperienced and not always the best but mostly left us alone."
good,"always a full nights work. training new associates if required, learned how to use floor jack, compactor, bailer, MC40, great co-workers. all workers worked as a team, always helping one another if needed."
good,Wal-Mart is a hard place to work for. They seem not to care about your well being. They have a point system. That sucks. It is their way or no way. To many chiefs.
good,It's a good place to work for if yu  Have a good managements you team.  I like working there so I got a new management team the job I had was every easy for me
good,A Day at work with this company consist of stocking and helping customers as best as possible great and assist customers as much as possible the customer is very important
good,"Good company, helped me maintain a job while I continued my education. Great benefits and great consistent workload. Disadvantages would be poor management and poor scheduling."
good,Walmart is a place to work if your going through school. I wouldn't make it my last stop. You can learn alot of customer skills because you are involved with many personalities.
good,I didn’t really like to work at Walmart and my managers were not really nice to me. I loved it when I first started but now it doesn’t really fit me. I want a job that fits me the most.
good,"This job takes little to no experience. Faced with little to no challenges. Same thing, different day. Management always criticizing in a negative way."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Walmart consisted of assisting customers with jewelry, helping out with register, and making sure clothes looked organized and presentable."
good,This is a busy company work for. You have to be outgoing person to work in this complaint and also people person. Management is some what ok. They need work their employees care
good,"I was working every single weekend. My co-workers ALWAYS had every weekend off. I was usually alone. The only time I ever had them off was through request. When I did that, the dept was a mess by the time I came back Monday. On top of that, I always closed on weekdays. "
good,"While working at Walmart, I have built an enormous amount of communication skills. I can't thank Walmart enough for the benefits I have received. Thank you so much."
good,"was given management training and lead teams in the fresh food departments, upper management was at times hard to communicate with.  Wages were not enough to live comfortably and many do not receive enough hours to pay for housing."
good,its a good place to work at if your just starting in the industry it use to be a lot worse with trial by fire mentality but now they do a lot of training .
good,"Friendly work environment "
good,"First time I've worked for Walmart. Not a great experience. Always lots going on. I collect carts from the parking lot and helped customers carry their items to their car. It pays good, but the environment could have been better."
good,walmart is walmart it’s not a bad place to work if you need a job! i worked in the tire and lube department! walmart is good if you want something steady!
good,"Walmart is a great place for a first time job. The managers are very nice if you need help. They go through alot of training to help you succeed in your job and moving up in the company is easy if you work for it,."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, when everyone does their job. But it's not a place where you ""grow"" or ""learn something everyday"". The management is good and works hard to make sure the store is running well."
good,"Reviewed reports and looked for discrepancies."
good,Walmart is a fast paced and fun place to work. It also provides outstanding customer service. Walmart has taught me so much and it has allowed to grow as an individual.
good,I havent worked for this company for 5 years i have no real opinion that would matter theyre making me do this review to submit my new resume and i have a minimum character number to hit
good,Wal-mart would throw BBQ for the associates and community it gave me an scenes of connection to the store and the community. We would give the community a chance to win games gift cards and money. Wal-mart was a friendly company.
good,I Loved Online Grocery Shopping For Customers But Management Sucked And.Some Managers Were Rude And Showed They Didn't Care Too Much About Their People That's In Their Department
good,"Looking to get a great chance to showcase my work ethic and grow within the company."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of unloading and organizing products off of the truck into stacks for various areas of the store. Afterwards, products were moved to the respective areas and staged for the stocking crew. Once the initial unloading was done, the grocery truck was unloaded. Once that was done, the unloaders would clean the back room and help the stocking crew, if there was time. Management was strict about deadlines and efficiency. The hardest part of the job was learning the entire store by department numbers, but the best part of the job was being able to memorize them when unloading the truck."
good,My department OGP(Online Grocery) has an amazing team and wonderful manager. But absolutely no support from higher management as well as nothing substantial for giving 200%. Most work as minimaly as they can. Instead of the store manager getting them to work better they have the people from OGP to pick up the slack.
good,"I've been with Walmart a few years now.  though pay and benefits have gotten better, its still not a great company for employees.  I love working for Walmart however now that im a single mom I don't make enough money to provide for me a my child. or have the stable hours I need."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work team friendly good experience on using some new technology problem solving and experience unloading trucks everyone works as a team and helps get everything done at the end of the day
good,"I really do miss Walmart & working there. Helping customers, and doing my reshop.  & getting my tasks done. One thing I didn’t like is how the managers talk to you. But I miss working with that company a whole lot. But as I went into other Walmart stores. I witnessed a whole big difference in how other stores treat there employees. So I just figured it was just the store I was at"
good,It is a place where one can work and be with good people. There is just a need to raise the rate especially for the per hour people. The job is difficult and an added compensation is necessary.
good,"Most work days were good having friends that you make during your time working there. Sometimes it gets frustrating because management never knew what was actually going on. An example is that during the time i was a cart pusher, we would tell management that there is only one person outside trying to clear out a lot of a super store, and they would never send help to the stockman so we would struggle sometimes not being able to take our breaks until the last hour of work, also when we would tell  them that majority of cart are broken and that we do not have a lot they never listened to us and always complained about there being no carts even after saying hey we brought in all the carts from outside about 70% of the carts are broken in the back. where it then took them 3-4 weeks to get in new carts but in that time of waiting for new carts we were still constantly yelled at for having no carts inside even though there were no carts available outside for us to go grab."
good,I liked it but wasn’t the job for me i had a lot going on at the time and i felt like me being in school wasn’t going well for me and working at the same time
good,"You will never find consistency at Walmart.  Everything always changing.  They try to make efficiency more important than anything else, including employee wellness and acceptance.  Your job isn’t secure and they let you know that too."
good,There were times I got no breaks or lunch. I was always having to do other peoples work. Including CSMs. Even when new positions were available they hired outside instead of looking within. And the customers are just awful.
good,I worked as an overnight stock associate. You worked in the store with few customers and it was typically pretty quiet and relaxed. The Job was physically demanding and you were expected to finish tasks in a timely manner. You worked with a relatively small team and job tasks were delegated into sections. Once you were done with yours you would assist the person the next person. You are expected to be self-sufficient. Overnight management was pretty supporting and helped work on the floor with the rest of the team.
good,"Other than having to work by yourself and ending up having to do the work of 3 people, it isn’t that bad of a job. Don’t let them take advantage of you and definitely stand up for yourself."
good,"the job its self was not a hard job at times it felt very rewarding, to me it was management that lacked a lot was not really helpful when needed and did a poor job at treating employees with respect"
good,"My time here was short lived but it was great job if you enjoyed getting paid decent money to basically work out 10 hours a day. Very physical , very fast paced, and the pay is alright. I lost probably 25 pounds and was able to get a brand new car within literally 5 months working here. Order fillers are literally the backbone of this company and they go through them like nothing. But with the demand for the job it's not surprising. Expected to hit a 100+ rate while having to deal with jams, cases breaking while constantly standing and bending lifting anywhere from 2-70+lbs throwing usually 4500-5000 cases per day per person. My recommendation is apply for asset protection if available because I wish I would have when it was. Just be aware if you ever get injured, it is a huge hassle dealing with the whole process of trying to file a simple injury claim to cover your days off. It is a literal nightmare. But other than that, great place to work."
good,"In working for Walmart, I would recommend it to the younger generation to have a starting job, unless you have the correct management team for the store. That’s the key to employee success and having employees want to make a career out of Walmart."
good,"My typical work day included making sure merchandise was put in the proper location and putting stock on shelves. I learned a lot from Walmart. I learned how to multitask and adapt to the diversity around me. Management is great! They work with you and beside, not the typical assigning tasking and moving on to the next thing"
good,"•	Establish or identify prices of goods, services or admission, and tabulate bills using calculators, cash registers, or optical price scanners."
good,I don’t mind Walmart but it wasn’t my favorite job. Reason being it was too much drama and they weren’t flexible with hours when I was in school and when I had school functions
good,"People are ok to work for. CSM and some management are not respectful. Not enough hours and steady hiring. Cut hours too. Easy work as a cashier. Will try to go back during the summer,if they will hire me back."
good,"some of the team memebers where pushed around by some of the higher ups ,and when the higher ups alos got caught up in a problem with others the seem to just ignored them."
good,"Administrador con poca capacidad de personal y preferencias a cierto rango de puestos. "
good,"Really it wasn’t that bad of a job; I worked as a cashier and had relatively flexible hours. I had been hired on at part time which meant up to 32 hours, slowly I began noticing that I was being repeatedly scheduled for 40. Which for personal reasons, I just couldn’t work. It was a hassle to change your “availability” and took 3 weeks to go into effect, ultimately leading me to leave the job."
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. It was a good first job. The pay is great but the job itself wasn’t my favorite. The managers aren’t extremely helpful and you kind of have to figure things out on your own
good,I learned how to build racks and break them we rebuild the whole wal mart an that was a good experience if I can I would do it all over again but it was less time
good,i like working in this compony. I recommend to people around me my friends or family and who is first job in usa as a second language or who doesn’t have a high school diploma.
good,"We were forced to work sick. We were told if we needed to be off for illness, we had to get it approved. We were threatened with getting fired if we were sick."
good,"Depending on your position, you can either have a very busy day or a very slow day. Management is all over the place, they do try to help you but sometimes it isn't enough and you might have angry customers. The workplace environment was mostly organized. The hardest part of the job is having to do someone else's job, when they're on the clock. The most enjoyable would have to be the slow days."
good,"management is quite supportive but the rules and regulations are too firm to not be able to have work and life balance."
good,Walmart distribution centers need to have more supervisors and be more in sync !(clock work).........................................They need to update there systems an realize that they are working in the stone age.
good,"The job was important to me,it taught me and helped me,it helped by teaching me how to develop better communication skills,it taught me how to be focused in a distracting and stressful work environment."
good,This was an ok place to work. I enjoyed the pace and customer interaction. I would do this again. I worked with a lot of great people. I'm sorry I had to leave.
good,Good working environment for someone who likes to work with their hands. For me it was an easy part time job because I like to work with my hands and I like helping people out
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Turnover is pretty high and the deli was always short-handed, but it wasn't the worst. Everyone got along pretty well."
good,How much a great place to work they have a good work community and it’s very easy depending on the department get It’s better when you find a friend to work with so that you have somebody to talk to
good,"Work is typical retail.  If you are in a department you like it's fun.  The pay is not great, the health benefits and stock purchase plan are good though."
good,"Wal-Mart has flexible hours but no full time hours. Most of my training has been on the job and just learning as I go, the people I work with are supportive but the management not so much"
good,enjoyed dealing with customers at customer service desk had great co-workers and friendly management would get hectic sometimes but actually enjoyed the face paced environment
good,Great job for anyone that needs a job. Store discount could be better but coworkers are fairly nice. People can be rude everyday but some customers make your days so much better and you look forward to seeing them.
good,Its been a journey working here learn lots of things meet new people. And you will also learn your self worth and find that you deserve so much more as far as a job.
good,Walmart has every job  under the sun. if you want to law you can do that. Whatever you want to do you can do it at Walmart. There are opportunities at Walmart.
good,"A standard day of work at Wal-mart is based off of the position you are assigned, but it usually entails answering questions and stocking shelves. There may be some customers that can give a hard time as well as some hours seeming off."
good,they over hiring and don’t have the hours to provide for me . They didn’t live up to their word given to me about that . Can advance in the company ..
good,"I have met some really great people there and enjoyed working and getting to know many of my co-workers.  I have been touched by their kindness, encouragement, and professionalism."
good,I enjoyed working for the company.  It was my first job and I did not have a reliable car and worked over 30 miles from the site. I now have a new car and can work anywhere.
good,"I stocked shelves at Walmart during the take end of my senior year in highschool. Working there was fine, they gave me hours that were flexible with my schooling. I ended up leaving, because I was getting repremanded when I could go to work, because I put my focus into graduating highschool."
good,"Retail isn't for everyone. I loved working in customer service, but unfortunately you can't really make a decent wage interacting directly with customers. As a result, I decided to shift my focus to my other passion, IT."
good,It was an easy job. It was just very unorganized. Working the register was the most easy thing. Working the self check out was also very easy but a bit compicating.
good,"Not enough team work when it came to unloading trucks. 2-10 shift was too long. Other than that it was a good work place. The pay was good, but every two weeks seemed long."
good,A lot of opportunities to move up in the company but the salary is not enough to sustain my needs. The experience is really excellent. Multitasking and good leadership and helping co workers  especially new to Canada. It was a fulfilling job for me as a manager.
good,I think that it overall was a good experience because I tried to have a positive attitude. It's contagious and helps when working anywhere. We also had good QUARTERLY bonuses.
good,"I started working there late May and it was good for three months but after that it just went down hill. Management was poor, a lot of people were calling out, our crew kept on getting smaller and smaller with the managers expecting the same amount of work to get done. The owner of the store never introduced himself to any of the floor workers and never really spoke much to us. If you’re looking for a quick buck then go ahead and apply just don’t stay over 3 months."
good,The only thing i can say about this place is that there was a lot of favoritism and conflicts between coworkers. If it weren't for the conflicts i would still be there.
good,"Cashiering at Walmart wasn't too bad until you had customers up in your face about a price, which cashiers have no control over. There was a definite favoritism shown in the store I worked at, and always some sort of drama, but that seems typical in a workplace. I believe the pay was quite fair for the job I had."
good,Working at Walmart was very fun in the beginning. You don't really have many problems at all until you get sick. Walmart doesn't really care if you bring in a doctors note.
good,I enjoyed working there for the years I did. A lot of good people worked there which made all of the difference of having a good work environment. Management plays a big role but that is with any company.
good,"Depending on the department you work in it could be a very great place to work for."
good,"2 years working at Walmart made me realize of strict the retail business is, every one is a cog in a machine If you need to work together if you want to accomplish an goal. Sadly working at Walmart not a lot of that wasn’t happening."
good,"It's a good company to work for if looking for fast pace work environment. Ideal for someone wanting to directly work with public, competitive pay, nice work schedules"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work.  I developed managerial skills and had the chance to help others learn and grow in their career.  It is a continuous job where the ""job"" is never done.  There is a lot of customer service and must pay attention to detail."
good,"My time working for Walmart was mediocre. At the start I was trained so well. I knew exactly what I had to get to done every night and working as team made things easy. Company policies changed halfway through my time there, which made for some management changes as well. I ended up quitting as a result because it was too much work being put on being so understaffed."
good,This is a place and people work here for times and in this place peoiple work here. It is a building that has people who work there and that's fine and okay
good,I worked for the company for 2 1/2 years. I lost my job because of false accusations without a proper investigation. I’ve read so many similar cases like mine and the exact same thing happened. No proper investigation and not by the book like they say they are. Management is also bad. They protect the people more that are higher up over the regular associate. But even though all that bad I’d still go back because the team I worked with was great and paid very well with great benefits
good,"It’s a good temporary job if you can afford a two week pay period , somewhat friendly staff, some days you will love it and some day you will hate the job."
good,"Managers are terrible and the dollar rules the way the train and teach their employees, always makes claims of hiring new employees but very untrue due to poor staffing, and when staffing is done of more employees are added to areas not necessarily in dire need of more employees. The managers are too rude and lazy to even consider helping even if you’re the only in your department due to even poorer scheduling."
good,This place demanded you get your work done in a certain time frame. Even when it wasnt humanly possible. The higher up managers rode our backs and made us feel like we weren't good enough. Many days I walked out feeling sad and defeated.
good,"It is an ok place to work. They give you minimum wage. I work between 20 and 28 hours per week, normally. Next week, I am cut back to 18. Management is friendly, but do not answer questions. They just tell you to go to the computer."
good,The jobs are taught by other members and management is rough. They don't really care for personal issues that prevent you from properly doing your job
good,"Being a cashier isnt as easy as it looks, but I love people. Walmart over worked me for being a part time employee. There always short handed. I like small stores it's more personal and you get to know your customers better and interact with them to make their shopping experience better"
good,Your friendships you make and your pay.  They do let you move up quickly which is a big plus.  Once you move up they require most of your time.  Great benefits!
good,"This company was not as satisfactory as I had hoped. I feel as though management was ran like a clique in high school but the pay compensated for any upset I had with the management. I was paid fairly well, received all of my promised bonus’ and had opportunities to move up within the company."
good,The company is ok to work for. You get quarterly bonuses and fair wages. My coworkers were great. I learned alot about money services and how to deal with some upset customers at times. I will miss my last  position at walmart the most the vision center was fun to work in with some really great people and the doctors are very professional and do a great job
good,Management can be difficult to work with but the customers make the job well worth it. Retail is not for everyone. If you don't mind working weekends and you like working with people this is a good position to apply for.
good,Nice place good pay but understaffed. Lots of responsibility. Not very nice to new hires at portland walmart. But over all i liked the job. Did my job good. And went home
good,"Maintain a safe and healthy entrance, greeting customers and giving direction when needed, Listening to problems or complains and get the correct staff tho handle it."
good,"In the last few years this place has gone down hill, taking away holiday pay and reducing PTO hrs by 40% on top of mandating OT and increased  penalty for missed/sick days.  Needless to say employee turnover is overwhelming. Interview/fixed hrs includes but not limited to building security and Quality assurance auditors get paid 80 cents less per hr than general labor ""no brainer"" jobs."
good,Enjoyed my employment with Walmart. The employees were great to work with. Maintaince was very challenging for me. Hard work .Injury prevented me from continuing to work for Walmart.
good,At Walmart was assigned to work the register and give great customer service. I was allowed to take two fifteen minutes breaks and thirty minutes for lunch. Work a eight hour shift you would sometimes be move to different register.
good,I enjoyed my job at walmart everyday it gave me a piece of mind to think I just love to work the environment is ok at most part of love seeing new faces everyday and meeting new people from around the neighborhood and different tourists
good,It was a pleasant environment to work at. I was treated fairly there. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and help them with what they need.
good,"dinâmica"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for when you first start out but it isn’t for everyone. Changes are made everyday to how things are done and can be sometimes hard to keep up with and stressful
good,Associates are not treated fairly.  favoritism ha been showing as I've seen multiple people in high positions that cant/wont do their job. Then the people who do their job get punished severally.
good,Walmart is a type of company that you can build your future on very strong and positive attitudes a lot of motivation very strict rules to follow it's a great company
good,It was a good experience. Learned a lot from my time being a Walmart employee. Met awesome people and made a great bond with coworkers and customers also.
good,"Hired for seasonal work as Bike Sales Associate. Responsible for assembly, safety and sales of bikes for all ages, sizes etc. Was the only bike rep at store level."
good,"It was good somedays it all depends on who you work with. I learned a lot of skills as well as in improving on other skills that I already had, like customer service."
good,Baking bag bread mark down all bread stock shelves clean cupboards bag pastries clean the bakery area includes dishes mopping floors washing the tables make sure everything clean and neat before Shift is over
good,Go to work i get in pets an always have to fix product on shelves to put more product on shelves do to someone else gramming stuff on shelves an moving product to correct spot so i can put correct product in the correct place
good,They treat their employees like dirt. They dont really work with you if something comes up in life as well as they dont work with students and their schedules.
good,I looked semi trailers ten hrs a day also built pallets ran lifts to love the products it was busy work so I could keep up it was a good job just got more money
good,one thing I like about working at Walmart was the diversity I worked with all kinds of nice people learned new things  and like i said everyone was super nice to me
good,It’s a job that’s all I can really say about this place the customers can be rude but some are nice and makes you feel like you going above and beyond for them was worth it
good,I really enjoyed interacting with the customers and getting to know them as they regularly came in over the last few years! The biggest challenge was keeping the checkout process flowing when we had limited cashiers.
good,"At Walmart, there was no stability in work procedures .  No accountability . My staff was very eager and cooperative . I like to teach and lead.  Very aggressive business ."
good,Overall a decent job. Constant cutbacks. All worker are simply just a number to corporate.  Your individual contributions are viewed the same as someone who works hard and efficiently as compared to someone who does the opposite.
good,"Overall the pay is fair, but the overall lifting and work/life balance is not the greatest as you are always extremely tired after work, as well as having a high risk of injury while working there. This is in large part because of the poor management. If you don't mind these things, you can definitely make good money as there is always overtime available and hours to make up missed days."
good,"Great place to work."
good,If you are in college they sometimes work with your work load but not always. If you need time to study and get up early they are not always willing to work around that.
good,Working at Walmart wasn’t bad at all! The management was always super friendly and accommodating. I always walked into work with a smile on my face and left with a smile on my face!!!!
good,Stocking product. The job was actually pretty easy for the most part. Management is pretty nice at Walmart and the hardest part of the job was bringing pallets to the back.
good,I was a cashier but couldn’t sell alcohol due to my age so whenever someone wanted to buy alcohol a very inconvenient and heavily tedious and annoying scene for me to run up to customer service in search of a manger and tell him to come to my register to override the system.. every time someone wanted alcohol which was every 5 minutes. My manager also did not have a personal cellphone!!
good,Only work at Walmart if you want to make a career out of it. The pay is acceptable. The work? It's not too strenuous but it's not a job for lazy people.
good,"It was an alright job to me, wasn't the best weather always so it would rain alot and we didn't get an opportunity to get ponchos or rain suits. But the people are friendly everyone is just trying to get the job done."
good,You have to be able to stay on your feet for long periods of time and only good thing is you get paid on breaks and the last bad thing is bad management some managers don’t know what they’re doing at all
good,"Working there was fun, stressful though. Few problems here and there but it was fun to do! Hard to learn at times because not a lot of training went through!"
good,Decent company but constantly taking away from employees. not easy to advance even if you give it your all. I also do not feel they honestly care about their employee's given you have to work EVERY SINGLE HOLIDAY and receive no type of compensation. Capitalism at its best.
good,"This job was fine for a while but they gave me less than 8 hours every shift i had. They barely teach you anything physically, you just go take some tests on a computer for training then they stick you in front of a cashier and say ""good luck."""
good,Unreasonable standards on production time.  The whole reason they can't keep good hard working people is because the goals are unreasonable and just push people way too hard.  I personally was able to hit 100% and above every day.  But the average person had a difficult time even hitting 80%.... Which just leads to a person either quitting or getting fired.  LOWER YOUR STANDARDS WALMART - WE ARE NOT MACHINES
good,Didn’t like how the managers talked to you and felt like you had to pick up they slack and how they wanted us to be done ringing somebody out less then 2/3 mins even if they had a Buggy full of stuff
good,I learned that pushing carts for a huge store is stressful and exhausting. Had a lot of fun with the kids that came through with all the excitement they had of getting a new bike. Managers were nice enough.
good,"It was a very competitive job working in the Walmart warehouse. There was a daily quota to be met, that was taken very seriously. Overall this was still a good place to work."
good,It wasn’t the worst job ever. It was a bit stressful at times due to customers being impatient. My supervisor clearly had favorite employees and would allow some requested time off to others but not all.
good,"Tuve una experiencia no muy grata trabajando en Walmart, puesto que trabajaba jornada completa cargando cajas y ordenarnos arduamente todo y pagaban muy poco para el trabajo que se realizaba."
good,Only good thing about working there was the fact I had friends working there. Overall I had a good time working there. I recommend this place to people looking for their first job
good,"friendly co-workers, busy work environment. Worked long hours and some times stressful, I've worked at Walmart for three years.  There was always   room for advancement at Walmart I transferred from a Walmart in Florida to Walmart Hermantown to relocate to Duluth, Minnesota."
good,"I like working and getting things on my own im a funny and cool person to be around , i have 2 kids. , and i like too cook. I went too school for culinary ."
good,Good environment to work in decent pay oppurtunity to move up in the company. Able to learn all the information you nees to know witin the first week of being hired during orientation.
good,I would not recommend Walmart for young teens. They will only offer up to 25 hours a week. The managers always take forever to help someone. They are always helpless to themselves. Always waiting on ap (higher management).
good,It was always a mess working there and they never had any idea on what they where doing and going to do they just throw me around till I had to learn everything on my own
good,Wal-Mart has different job opportunities.  Its fast paced but hands on. Managers helo all the time by rolling their sleeves up and helping out. You can learn different skills while having a job title while working there.
good,Entry level work if you are looking for a job and have a decent record they will probally take you. They have little to no exceptions hiring especially on overnight due to the hours.
good,"The job wasn't terrible, i personally didn't like the lack of communication between coworkers. Also, being understaffed put on a lot of pressure and made coming to work more dreadful."
good,It's really hard. I'm done with my training period and I can't make production and I've hurt my back and it's just so stressful. The only good thing about the job is the pay check but you have to kill yourself to get it.
good,"The jobs themselves are easy and the people that work there are great, and overall really easy to work with. Management is harder to deal with when they're changing every so often."
good,After working for the company off and on for years i just got burnt out of the same thing 5-6 days a week. Being a department manager i had no formal job training just had to learn by trial and error
good,I loved working for Walmart ..I learned so much in Walmart with seals and stocks and buds....The managers seem like they all was family members.The culture of the work place was mix people.. to me it was not hard at all for me ..I really enjoyed the place.
good,The particular store I worked at had a high level stress and disorganization. Management wasn't always there to assist with guidance and rarely helped when help was needed. Not saying Walmart is a bad company. The benefits are great but the stress and work load can be overwhelming.
good,You have to do all kinds of work and you don’t get paid for it like you should they have you doing all kinds of different job but your pay stay the same are they give you a small raise once a year
good,I was hard working and passionate when I worked there I had a great time serving my community at the customer service desk working at Walmart helped me practice my skills in customer service
good,Busy. Good opportunities to advance.  Worked there for 28 years. Started at Service desk then later worked in Cash office. Was then a Customer Service Manager and finally the Claims office.
good,"I give my all to this company but I supposed amazon was getting in their head so,employees was being drop from left and right.i was a loyal employee for this company."
good,I love working as a personal shopper. The one thing I enjoy the most is talking to customers when they come and pick up their groceries. The only thing that this department lack is communication and teamwork. I strive for that so it makes it a little hard to enjoy being around my co-workers.
good,"The bright side: The interview was fairly easy, I was hired right away and learned the work itself easily enough. It's frantic but simple, and everybody gets discounts and an hour for lunch. On the other hand, they tend to micro-manage everything and the pay/benefits are rather low."
good,The associates are stressed and get minimal hours if you are pert time. Associates looking for more hours and are being told there isn't more hours.They hire more associates than they need
good,Good pay good managers not enough hours you are always busy you get a break every 2 hours then 1hour lunch if you there more then 6 hours that day.....
good,I unloaded trucks in the evening. It was fast-paced yet rewarding. Fellow employees were encouraged and expected to help each other in job duties. Friendly environment
good,Honestly it’s been so long since I’ve worked here and I don’t remember much of it but I met a lot of great people I still consider good personal friends
good,"Wal-Mart was a good place to work, but it felt so task-driven that I know the customer service was severely lacking.  But, I guess if you are really trying to save money you will forgo some things."
good,"very fast paced work envirmonment but everyone was willing to help everyone, a typical day was handling cash and talking to different people and hearing different stories about their lives and making new and fun relationships with people you wouldnt normally talk to"
good,This job is very easy and also easy to catch onto. They forsure give you 40 hrs a week. But you are also responsible to not get overtime. You get paid pretty fairly.
good,"Good entry level job, fair pay, good corporate workplace. Attendance policy is extremely strict, to the point i found it very unreasonable, and one of my main reasons for quitting. Workplace culture was fine. Most management was fantastic."
good,"If you care about money only, wal-mart is for you. Wal-mart is all about live to work lifestyle. They pay very well and compensate well. Diversity is a big part."
good,bonne environnement beaucoup de contact humain difficile de satisfaire tout les genres de caracteres
good,I love meeting other people and I love a work environment I enjoy working with a group of others and being able to get the job done I’m a very nice person to get along with and don’t usually get upset very much
good,Some staff aren’t too bad to work with. There are some brown nosed staff but if you work with integrity and respectfully then you will get by. Some managements do have favorites and some are easygoing. Not a bad place to start your first job.
good,Everyone was easy to work with. Always something to do. Management always wants you to go faster and will never give a full raise because there is always room for improvement they say.
good,"Working in the cash office did give me a lot more experience in the accounting world. The hours were just horrible, you didn’t work with anyone other than yourself or maybe one other person. It was very secluded."
good,"buena empresa, humanos, dinamicos, cultura laboral buena"
good,I learned new ways to count and varify if money was fake. Working at walmart taught me great customer service. Being a cashier taught me how to maintain myself and to be efficient during a rush.
good,The days are usually busy. There is always something to do. you need a lot of teamwork to get everything accomplished so you have to be willing to help out wherever needed. Don't expect too much from them they are really only about the bottom line and what will make the company money.
good,The job isn’t what I expected based on the interview I had because the environment turned out fine but the management was too much of a helicopter feel for me. I like to be treated like an adult wherever I work versus a child but the pay is good.
good,"Maintained high standards of customer service during high-volume, fast-paced operations.  Processed payments including cash, checks, and debit/credit transactions quickly and accurately."
good,"Overall, the management was very unorganized and failed to work with you or listen to your needs. The location was a little too far from my home and inqqs experiencing vehicle trouble at the time."
good,walmart wasn't a good place to work.   i was there a long time. they are trying to make it better.  there's to many social groups.  i would still work at walmart just not that one.
good,"Buena experiencia, buen equipo de trabajo. Organizado."
good,"Working for Walmart was an good experience, gave me more experience on working with people and seeing and new environment and making others happy as I would want to be as I am shopping"
good,"I was very fast at my job"
good,This was with the neighborhood market and they were opening a new store that kept getting delayed. The location was inconsistent and sometimes to far for proper compensation
good,This Walmart was ok to work for  the supervisor was a great women but co workers where doing whatever they wanted and not listening. Most of them took breaks whenever. I would not go back unless they changed who is working there.
good,I didn’t really enjoy working for Walmart. It’s hard to move up and make a pay raise/it takes forever to get a raise. The schedule was flexible but that’s about the only good thing.
good,"Walmart has everyone working really hard.  Usually they are under staffed and makes it difficult for others, and they seem to expect to carry loads of others."
good,"i am happy to work in Walmart in Kindersley that time before i have my new manager, after i have new manager he try change the deal i make with the original manager when i am apply my job,  because  i have to go home to my country that time , to not make any problem so i am resign"
good,It was a good job and i miss workin ther and i am lookin for a good job to help with that aspect and i want to work hard like this again and the brotherhood we had was good
good,"You should be aware that working at walmart requires a lot of time management and patience, you must be able to communicate with customers and be respectful"
good,Most of the people who work there are ladies and their husbands have proper jobs to run the house. They work there to earn extra for their expenses. Not ideal for living.
good,"Working at Walmart is a great opportunity,  meet new people and friends too, the hardest thing is the garbage sometimes end of the day when it is almost time to go home because the work shift is almost about to end. And I dislike working for this position because I got sent to a different position that I don’t like but I have to duel with it anyway because I have no choice! And the enjoyable of theDay is making friends and lunch timejob is making friends and"
good,The company in and of itself has many benefits. Just as with any other company there are hurdles to overcome and different management personality styles.
good,"My full potential  and investment  is currently  Walmart.  When it was a great career, opportunities  fell short on downsizing.  Our store under our leadership  achieved  two top store inventory  ratings as well,  store of the year last year.  I learned  greatly  about leadership. I feel highly  disrespected  now as opposed  to the earlier  lack of respect.  Its time for a change  . I still have much to contribute! logistics,  development of hires , customer  service  fulfillment,  all training  for positioning in company. In charge of safety  and  training  of ple equipment  , and product maintenance,  and  use."
good,"A typical day consisted of making sure all customer needs are met. As well as ensure that all freight is ran, store is in clean and presentable order."
good,day starts in backroom to scan items. stock items on shelves. management very strict. hardest part was going into the freezer first thing in morning at 5:00.
good,It was ok as far as the customers. I had a problem with staff. they never had any registers open and caused my line to be long. This is not a place for someone with a bad back
good,Did learn how to be reliable and proficient in time management. Became confident in working with a team. Fast and confident in money management and being part of a family.
good,"Compensation and pay are great, but poor management & failing to properly train employees, causes significant issues, and the lowest on the ladder always takes the hit."
good,"The job was okay, although there was a lot of drama, the management was very slack, there were a lot of issues between managers and employees but the job itself was very okay."
good,Wages are not great and a lot of part time so not a lot of benefits. The environment and management are good to be around. Discounts for employees is good. Makes up for some of the lack of wages
good,I learned how to treat customers properly. I communicated with the customers. I learned how to speak with the co-workers. Greeted the customers in a busy setting.
good,"get up go to work and deal with grumpy people go home relax and wait to do the same thing the next day, day in and day out 365 days a year sorry minus the holidays"
good,"I expected to get this job and enjoy it because of how much I loved coming here but instead it was the complete opposite. I worked as a fresh food associate and had to run 3 sections alone because they didn't have a team for me to work with. I was trained by a regular team member that just showed me the basics and the manager for fresh food was on ""break"" but really quit without notice. I was accused of not being able to be found when I was on the floor stocking things. This job could be good but it's not organized enough and the inventory sucked. Customers was coming for weeks looking for one item that we never got back."
good,"Its a good job.  Very competitive. Fast paced.  Satisfaction driven employer.  Provides service, aupport and assistance as needed to out customers on a daily"
good,Working for walmart doesn't really give you a chance at a normal life..days you should be with family such as hollidays has been taken away from the employees..we are scheduled to work all hollidays even though we get paid time off or sick time..we cant use hour time how we want to..they changed that and it wouldn't be so bad if we were paid more money.
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. Management at some Walmart's need more training. Need better understanding of keeping shelves stocked. Heard many customers complain.
good,If you need a job you need a job. Walmart will work for that. I personally don’t like working around a ridiculous amount of people but as an employer I would say they’re decently fair they can’t seem to help but pay people less than they deserve I mean it’s Walmart
good,Excellent benefits . PTO hours hour good. You can put in for availability of hours you can work. But keep in mind of you restrict your hours to just days and no weekends you won't get fulltime hours. Wide age range and diversity of coworkers. So if your 18-80 they have a job for you.
good,it was ok for the most part they except way to much from one shift compare to the other shifts and it was always crazy and always stressful and never being able to do enough
good,"Walmart is what you make of it some people are fair some aren’t, I love my coworkers but all management isn’t fair in my opinion, some are really nice others aren’t"
good,"Started as a cashier , worked with customers in a timely fashion. I had a opportunity to work in the cash office . I was very interested in this aspect of the store . Then after the cash office I had the opportunity to work on the loss prevention team. I excelled at this position . I was one of the top recovery employees  in this team."
good,There was nothing hard about Walmart it’s easy. And sum of the management are not really good besides the fresh management. I leaned a lot of thing like working together
good,every day was basically the same.  lather rinse repeat.  only rarely would you get an out of the ordinary project.  ordering system seemed to have some flaws which created extra work for everyone.
good,walmart was a nice store what i learned there at the fitting room you have to be pay attention mostly be time of the time is when the first of the month fitting room dont look right you have to be a person that thinks before you do it
good,Working for Walmart was like being in high school way to much drama. Pretty sad to see how they treated there employees. You could of gone up a write up if you had to call in for anything.
good,It's a great place for young adults to work.  If you are trying to support your family it's a bit harder. It takes a lot longer to get any decent benefits.
good,Great company job security is great here as well. Co worker and manger is easy to get a ling with too. Pay can go up every 6 months that you work there too.
good,"Walmart has a diversity of cultures. Management could use some work."
good,"Great schedule. Ability to grow within the company. They offer a variety of shifts, whether you are seeking full time or part time employment. Great discounts and benefits."
good,"Taking care of customers,stocking,assist techs. I love working with people.I am a quick learner with a  very big sense of humor.Looking for an working place that treats there employees with respect and fairness."
good,Poor management and corporate is always changing the policies. Made to go from night shift to day shift by the store manager saying if i didn't volunteer to move to days that i would lose hours
good,"Walmart was a very nice job. It payed well, had some very nice management and employees. It was very easy to catch in to the workflow in my department and would recommend this job to a friend."
good,Their was alot that i think could be improved but it paid well. Management care to much about customers that they forget about their workers. It's important that you value customers but also value the people that are keeping the business running.
good,It’s a good job but managers don’t help also they don’t put Schedule up for the following week. Doing over time don’t show up on pay also they work you like a dog
good,"Fast-paced atmosphere, customer service your shift, supervisors were terrific to work for.  If you needed additional hours, the supervisors would try very hard to get them for you.  All employees were very nice."
good,"Great store to work at with may different positions available to work and many opportunities to grow and move up in the company. The only downside is that since stores vary some may have better management staff than others, which and determine weather the store will be a beneficial career place or not."
good,loved it at first then the fakeness turned everything around....overall the job is not bad you just have to make sure u have ur own back because management will lie on you
good,"There is too much favoritism at work. Too much of politics at work."
good,"Good job poor management . Decent pay. "
good,"I loved working at Walmart. But the customers that came there were rude, disrespectful, and jerks. I would not recommend any of my friends to work there."
good,"i worked there and it was okay. It was my first job so I was cool with it. The only bad part was that they lied to me and said it was a part time job, they never said I was only a temp. so I was let off as soon as they were able to pay me benefits."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is when you on your lunch break,because you can do anything you wanted to do and you can have your own space and be free"
good,I would say the store itself was very consistent and followed a very rigid guideline with their employees but that also is what made them so efficient everyone had their own job and performed their duties.
good,"I learned customer service skills, telephone skills, and organizing skills. A typical day was organizing the areas department. I enjoyed self paced, learning new skills."
good,"i was a vendor did not work for Walmart changed jobs applied for Walmart and never got hired i have to put in more info for this to move on, so i am just"
good,"My having quit, suddenly, was a result of my heightened impulsivity, due to my brain injury. I would go back if I could be reinstated at the same pay rate and with the Eighteen years I had already put in."
good,The main thing that forced me to find another job was the poor management and lack of hours. The only way to advance into any management position is to not be enrolled in any college classes
good,I would go in see who I had coming n set up for the day order clean run stuff to the floor make stuff if need meet with the store manger go over the day
good,My everyday job experience working at Walmart is working 5 am to 2 pm. I start off by breaking down the pallets from the truck and running the freight to the floor and putting overstock away in the coolers or freezers. I work on the fresh side of the store so I have to be careful handling ready to eat foods.
good,Work was nice. This company gave me the opportunity to grow and advance to the next level of management in my career path. I was proud to be a part or a great team!
good,"I worked 4th shift Saturday-Mon 4:30a-5p. Work loads are insane at times, but 4th shift is the busiest, highest paying shift. Typically worked about 14-16 hours a day. Great pay, managers/ supervisors were subpar, but they would help anytime you needed it."
good,The Managers are poor at communicating to the employees about the plans being changed. About what department they want done. No manager stick's with the plan that is set for Cap 2 to do when they have the Managers meeting. They will find little thing's to coach you over and it could be something stupid. The new belt that Walmart has takes longer unload. Thanthe old belt.
good,"I didn’t like how the managers were rude and disperse tfuck to employees and customers, I also didn’t like how you had to track down the managers to ask a question or ask for help with a customer"
good,"Thank you all, nice working with you guys......please dont forget to thank God..... keep it up...thank you..wish you all the best and goodbye...thank you"
good,"worked dressing room , faced pace alot of piled clothes to sort through"
good,Not too bad and not too good. It’s a place where you have to take for what it is. Every one is busy and stressed out and angry but the benefits are nice.
good,It was an easy job all I had to do was clean the bathroom 4 times a day and take out trashes. Clean the floors in Walmart also help out customers and some employees
good,"Walmart is a great job to start you off, but you shouldn't stay there unless you're going to advance in the company. There were some difficult employees at my location that often made the job difficult. However, I had loyal customers and I learned a lot working for Walmart."
good,Management is always changing and trying to contradict each other. Easy job and very customer oriented.  Hardest part is dealing with management. Most enjoyable is making the customer happy
good,"The pay is not bad nor the hours, good co-workers. Management could have been a lil bit better with some of them but it has been some years since I worked there so maybe things got even better."
good,"Working at Walmart, your feelings will vary by the following; your management, your immediate coworkers, and the average IQ of the shoppers. I'm sure you can imagine what you would deal with. If not, watch a couple seasons of Super Store."
good,Help customers with finding items stock shelves gather carts in the parking lot. Unload general merchandise trucks and frozen and dairy trucks and stack merchandise in the store rooms
good,"Overall great place to work for. The management really try to work with you and your schedule. The concerning part is the hours being cut back and productivity being low. Need a full time job, not part time."
good,"If you’re going to work retail, walmart is the place to be. It makes substantially more then any other of the top retailers  However its little to no home/life balance. Scheduled 10-12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week. Expectations are unrealistic and upper management does not care."
good,"When I began working at Walmart it was a very nice job, everyone did what they needed to do to get their job done. A change of management brought more work on those who did the job correctly and loosened up on those who chose not to work."
good,"It was a fast paced job, we started the shift by unloading the truck, then we stocked shelves and provided customer support for the rest of the shift. I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,"it was a somewhat fun and interesting experience working for this big company. some of the people there are nice and supportive, although it does get very bland."
good,Walk in clock in grab your court pull it out the freezer and uncover your bread spray it with water pop it in over 350 degrees and wait like 30 to25 min and pop beard. Then cool then. Bag it and tag it place for sale floor
good,trabajo bajo presión y carga de trabajo tensa con sentido de urgencia
good,Walmart is a great starting job and probably move up at but it also depends on the location you work at. Like management and potential bonuses will make or break your experience at Walmart
good,This is where I first worked in retail. The team I started out with were really cool and collected but it started to go down hill when we got new management.
good,Different people came in and out of the building. Some people would tell you their life story while they pass through. and some become your regular customer.
good,The co-workers are very helpful and friendly can be fast pace at times but that makes time go fast. They do have a high turn over. The carlisle store is clean.
good,When I was there it was hard to move up .. pay was substandard to the work you did.. I was there 7 yrs and new people were making as much as me hiring in.
good,"Not so bad .but expect a lot from one person ,expect management to wear many hats a do the job of 6 people with little to no help .but other then that great place to work"
good,I do not think that I should be putting anything in here. I do not wish to speak negatively about a company and have that looking bad on my part. It’s walmart and that is enough to say without saying too much.
good,Its an ok place to work. The management will confuse you from time to time. Customers will be customers ....some days they are level headed and some days ....well it gets interesting
good,i was in fresh  food  was alright  job  for the most  part  i did not  care for my  boss  every time there was a problem  the boss was no wear  to be found
good,"Walmart was a fun work environment, however the environment was stressful and draining. Many people would not work or just didn’t wanna be a work. So others would have to step up and do extra work."
good,"Company has made positive changes consistent with "
good,"Working for walmart requires you to be quick with your hands and feet. You must be able to perform excellent customer service, and be a quick, fast paced, hands on and visual learner."
good,"Not too bad . The work is fine , the people are easy to get a long with . However the management was not as you expect . Some turmoil in the workplace."
good,Working at Walmart was a decent job some of the people were amazing. You get to work in other areas of the store sometimes. You also form a bond with some of the workers.
good,"The managers were very understanding that I was a single parent, and that I was willing to work. If you wanted over time all you had to do is ask and they would have giving it to you"
good,Walmart has plenty of room to grow but you never if your position will be the next one eliminated.  Walmart almost always promotes from within.  Walmart also will give most people that apply a job and a chance
good,"A typical day would be I came in set up everything for my unload team, helped them unload our dry grocery, went to print out paper work for our high dollar merchandise, followed up with my unloading team and sales floor team, after the gm trailer was unloaded I’d compare our merchandise with what we where supposed to get if it was I’ve $50, then continued to follow up with my team the rest of the night."
good,"A typical day would be to work a certain department and scan through the inventory. Get the counts and make sure they were correct in our system. While scanning anything that beeped got pulled out, to place on the shelf meaning there was room on the shelf for that item. That's why the count accuracy is important. After the inventory to every department is counted for, we go stock the shelves. That's when we will work on the floor and help customers as well."
good,"j aime travailler avec le public et service client beaucoup opportuniter de monter a l échelon salarial et les employer tres amical , satisfaction est de voir que j ai accomplis dans une journée"
good,I worked at wal-mart for two years. They have a great mandatory pathways educational system in place to better inform associates on how to best serve the customer.
good,"My store was in the process of becoming a Super Walmart. The process caused confusion within the store and for the customers. But the overall work experience was a good one. It was very diverse, which I liked most"
good,"Good place as a starter work environment for young adults."
good,Over all this has been a good company to work for. Pay is above average.  However they expect you to do the work of 4 or more people.  They expect you to do more work with fewer people.
good,"if you need a place to work for a couple of moths Walmart is the place to go, but be prepared you see somethings while over there. not to mention they'll get mad at you for taking does off since you have to be a team player. but over all I would go back if I still lived in the same area. Oh and our benefits are a joke so dont rely on it"
good,"It's an okay first job.. pretty good pay if you're just starting out. Will work with your school schedule and very flexible. downfalls: management doesn't communicate with each other. Does not listen to front end employees, csm does not know how to talk to employees."
good,Great company. I was a restocker. Never a dull moment. Pay was okay for just starting out. Very busy and got a great workout. Management didn;t care as long as you could perform your function.
good,Walmart pays pretty sweet probably the only good thing about working there I would work there again it's kinda of hard to get a job here took me awhile just to get a remodel job
good,As i was there i was called on days off to work. i worked two another job besides Walmart first and they didn't care about scheduling around my other job.
good,Continuous education with policy changes. You need to keep track of your hours. Quality of life when walmart stays within hours you need to work. Employees are supportive of one another.
good,"Fast paced, fun coworkers, team work."
good,I worked at this place for a season. It is an easy job and being entry level people need to understand  that.Management at the store at the time I was there was not honest.
good,"Very, rude management takes them forever to respond when needing manager approval , employees leave for longer breaks and lunch management never around for help"
good,Constamment en  changement du personnels travaillant et disponible en tout temps. Plusieurs avantages sociaux.
good,Its agood place to work at for part time flexible hours and clean oranized . Pay is fair and hours are fair Recommend it for people who are looking to work flexible
good,"Working at Walmart was a little stressful well for what I was doing at least, pushing carts and the Desert sun and the Alaska winds. Then customers coming in constantly ."
good,Working with this company would be more beneficial to high school level or college students that are looking for extra money in the pocket. Not really a sustainable position for people searching for a life time job.
good,"hard work demanding place. Attendant and arriving on time is crucial at Walmart work place. Requires friendly, helpful environment.  New talks daily depending upon personal."
good,Always busy and never a dull moment. You'll make good friendships with the people you work with. Too much like high school at times though so try to avoid the drama.
good,"Walmart has very many things to learn from day to day. You will never leave work feeling unaccomplished. There is always something to do and some way to keep yourself occupied. A typical day at work in Asset Protection was to make laps of the store, surveying the customers and to make sure nothing ""fishy"" was happening. There were always weekly tasks to complete in order to keep our store safe. Our workplace was very laid back, which was a plus, and I was told that during my initial interview. The hardest part of my job was trying to learn the many tasks of an APA during a ""normal"" day. One issue I had during my short employment at Walmart was the confusing array of managers that were scattered throughout the store with varying titles like ""Coach"" and ""People Lead"" who had nothing better to do than sit in the office and gossip. I was released from Walmart without reason and was told ""It wasn't working out"" by an Assistant Manager who I had never seen before."
good,As an unloader the hours were OK but there was a lot of physical work to be done. The hours were from 4 PM to 1 AM. The management was good. The hardest part of the job was the amount of stress on your body as far as unloading and moving goods.
good,Walmart was my first job away from the family business. It wasn’t the type of job for me but it was nice to experience something new. I met lots of people and made lots of friends.
good,"Trabajo bajo presión, buen ambiente laboral falta de crecimiento"
good,"Empresa Boa para se trabalhar.tivemos algumas divergências, mas num modo geral, boa."
good,I basically came in as a underdog and had to catch on to everything by myself. They watched me basically do all the work. The positive was they started increasing the pay as my experience started building up.
good,"It's a good place to work, but times are always shortened for trips and rules and policies constantly changed. Managers choose favorites and only take care of them."
good,It was routine work.  Not overly challenging.  Pleasant coworkers for the most part.  Close to home.  Would have preferred more hours.  Would try working there again though.
good,Wal-Mart can be a hard place to work for. Management isnt the best. Working with walmart you have time frames that have to be met before the ending of your shift.
good,The company has its ups and downs. They do their best to provide great instruction and leadership with the employees.  The company used a rotating schedule at times
good,"Hours are flexible, pay is good. Easy chances at promoting at some locations. Many different positions, something for everyone. I have to have 150 characters on this in order to continue..."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for those who already have experienced working in a store setting as their background helped their training period becomes easy. Managers need more training in handling their associates as far as violating company policies, how to interview candidates for position applied, rather than just hiring someone for the sake of filling up the need for the position, thus the high turnover. Office setting is like working in the warehouse, the environment alone is stressful. Office small barely able to walk around, no window. Training at the academy was not related to my position, basically it was all about the Walmart store,"
good,"Great work environment and team members.  Lots of projects and future changes.  Very busy, but good work life balance,  Culture is a bit different but if you can be a team player you are good as gold."
good,"Productive and sometimes difficult to work in .space was an issue every department has issues, storage was a problem training was limited to watching videos and less hands-on experience .the support wasn't there when you needed it"
good,It was not a terrible experience. It was a fair job. It all depends what your mindset is going to work and how well you deal with various types of customers.
good,"Too many managers,changed rules without telling cashiers,its like a nut house Ienjoyed most the customers but if just1 calls to report you being rude you get wrote up, after 3 write ups you get fired"
good,"Rotina de trabalho muito cansativa."
good,"You learn a lot of things but sometimes a lot of hard work, confusing and busy schedules. It’s not a bad of a place to work . I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for there first job."
good,"Alot of positions to work in , good for people who works in a fast pace and willing to learn and easy job , sometimes you have long hours diffrent timing to come in but not consistant times , scheduling changes"
good,"Travel every week was grueling."
good,"Not to sure why Indeed needs at least 150 characters on why Walmart was a sub-par place to work for. Its Walmart, its good if you need a job in high school."
good,Good place to work as a part-timer but the management is somewhat unreliable except for the store manager. Management not very understanding about issues that come up or push the task to someone else.
good,"Always stayed busy, never a down time. Met some good people while working there. Worked the night shift when it was open 24 hours, but didn't really have a lot of customers during those hours."
good,Strong focus from the company for performance. If you don't know what you are doing you will burn out quickly especially if you do not have a management team behind you to support your decisions and actions.
good,"Good place to start, not long term "
good,Ok job just no holiday pay also anything you do in that job your going to get a right up for it but they pay very well more than most warehouse around
good,"Very fast -paced environment, everyday is challenging, and pushes you to be at your best. Customer service is a must, and associates need to be proactive to hep customers by stocking shelves, and providing the service"
good,I would arrive at work clock in check in with the manager. Go to the trucks and wait for them to get there. When they got there I started unloading. and stocked shelf's.
good,"Great job for a college student. The culture was cool. The staff and management was cool, I can’t say the same for the Store manager. But overall he wasn’t bad either. "
good,a typical day at walmart  was continuous retrieving carts i learned that their was favoritism.management ...some were ok and some were power controlled..my job became hard when i worked alone on a weekend
good,The most challenging part of this job is dealing with customers of various backgrounds and assisting them with professionalism.  The workplace culture is intense but I enjoy doing my job efficiently and diligently.
good,It's a good job to have to get your feet wet in the work force. The management is ok but at times can over bearing. Some co-workers are friendly but others may not show courtesy.
good,"It’s a good temporary place to work for   There are employees that have worked there for many years but they are stressed, overwork and been there so long that they feel it’s the only job they can ever have, stuck    I had to get out of there   Did not want to end up like that   Life is too precious"
good,"If you bail people out of bad situations you are appreciated but you will likely never promote becasue you make the ship look like it floats. "
good,A typical day at work consist of getting everyone together and letting them know what is going to take place that day in order for us to get the job done at a high level .
good,While working at walmart I experienced multiple department and all the shifts and enjoyed the overnight shift because of the way coworkers worked together and came together as a team to get the work done.
good,Walmart can be ok if you can find the right management and the right store to work for. The work its self is not hard at all. But what does make the job hard is Walmart could really do without the ignorance of some of its workers who are employed there.
good,"Working there wasn't bad, just management could've been a lil better. My coworkers could've been a lil more reliable and the way management handled scheduling and hiring could've been better."
good,Better if you have a degree in business management. Very clean and safe work environment. Friendly staff. No advancement opportunities unless you have a AA/BA degree.
good,"Walmart is perfect if you like the mundane and slow life style. Managers and Members of Management are tolerable as long as you do everything they say and appear working at all times. The pay was ok, but bonus where laughable. 22 cents isn't a raise."
good,"Wal-Mart was the most fast paced job I've ever encountered. With the general public being your primary focus it can be me taking and physically taxing on a daily basis."
good,My Assistant manager over our area is absolutely horrible. She has her pets who keep her informed of everything and  I mean everything only to  cover what they do or don't do.
good,"The part I enjoy the most is the people I work with. Management and corporate are okay. They don't like to listen to doctors notes, so employees will have to remind them and be careful. The job itself isn't too bad it's not too draining but is very fast-paced and can be stressful."
good,"You put up shoe freight and jewelry freight, wait on customers needing jewelry and change watch batteries.."
good,I did not want to give a review but it would not let me move on to the section of indeed without leaving one. Walmart is walmart. Not that hard. Show up to work.
good,"As a employer at Walmart they offer you good opportunities, you get to know everything around by being in a computer. As a cashier is nice to work but sometimes you get overwhelmed it depends of how busy it gets. you have to work weekends, evenings, but they are a dollar ahead from the minimum wage, management is unfair I got in trouble for no reason it was one of the manager mistake and all they blame me."
good,"Empresa com grande potencial, para crescimento porém necessita valorizar os colaboradores que contribuem e fazem parte desta evolução"
good,"I feel that the management culture in what pertains to coders and software developers is very poor, although I met some individuals that were quite good yet unable to perform properly due to what I perceived as office politics and lack of proper management training in the area of technical managers that handle software development projects. They seem to be completely disconnected with the actual reality of what is entailed in software development although they adopt methodologies such as Agile - again almost as if it was a parody of how Agile should be implemented. "
good,"workplace culture is fast-paced and stressful. Coworkers are the best part of the job. My manager was a good one, though the rest of them were a mess and could barely handle simple tasks."
good,"There are multiple good and bad things about Wal Mart.  The hours fluxuate too much and you don't have set schedule, the management is not employee oriented."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart but the management made it a difficult job due to the fact that they made the hard workers pick up the slack of other workers
good,It’s a good place to work just fast paced environment you have to follow all policies so that your work experience can go smoothly. Ask questions if your not sure about something don’t just use your own judgment.
good,For the first twelve years I worked at Walmart it still had the family based concept and encouraged moving up with in the company the last eight months I worked there I was moved around to five different shifts moral dropped and moving up into management from within was put to a stop at the location I work at
good,The customer can be headaches. A lot has changed since I worked at Walmart so I cant say how it would be now to work there. I know it's a lot of self checkouts which I dont like.
good,A typical working day at working at Walmart consisted of showing up for work at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to the start of a fixed schedule. I learned to attend to all customers promptly and to be at a stance of readiness when it came to having a customer demand and responding quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around a diverse body of people including the customers and employees. The hardest part was the fixed schedule and not having a flexible schedule so the job became redundant at certain times.
good,"It was ok, just didn’t like how stressful they made everything. Always have to move everything in a limited amount of time. Mangers from 3rd shift would try to boss us around when we were on 3rd shift."
good,"It's a typical day at Walmart. The CSM's are slow, and the customer's are hardly ever satisfied. A lot of training is self taught. Expect inconsistent scheduling."
good,"Long days and always on your feet. Give you a hard time when asking for time off. Management can be a mess and rude, depending on your department. Nice break room."
good,Good job just management is biased and hours are irregular. Limited time off and never people to cover your breaks/lunches. The quarterly bonuses are nice as well as the employee discount. Management is typically easy to get along with as long as you do what is asked of you.
good,Good safe enviroment and many opportunities to grow within the company. I would reccommend this company to anyone that has a willingness to learn and grow.
good,Managers and supervisors would make me fall behind in apparel because I would have a day off. Instead of them having another associate do it for me while I'm off they would leave it for me to deal with the next day. And just when I'd finally get caught up I would get another day off and the cycle continued.
good,Some of the hardest parts of the job were learning to dealing with yelling customers in the beginning. Management doesn't really listen to the employees very well. A typical day there isn't to bad once you learn the job and what you will be doing.
good,Lamentablemente usan a la gente usándola en diferentes puestos y tardan demasiado en ajustar los sueldos
good,It was a decent place to work. I worked there on multiple occasions. I worked full time and also worked for temporary holiday help. Friendly people and customers.
good,Although I liked working there some of their management employees are unfair and are very lazy and take sides based on who has more seniority!! The hourly staff is overworked and underpaid for it!
good,"I've worked here for almost 5 years, and there have been many good and bad things. Great coworkers, a real family vibe, but management doesn't have a lot of empathy for the workers and how much they are putting on their shoulders. Lots of job cuts in the last two years or so, adding more and more onto our plates"
good,"Wasn’t a bad job just tiring , standing whole shift , short breaks. The coworkers were pretty rude but managers were cool, recommended if you NEED a job ."
good,Walmart is great. It has its days and the people you work with will get under your skin. Recently it’s like Walmart is calling for less workers and more work.
good,"Very hard worker, reliable, dependable, 1st shift recommended , I have worked in warehouse fields, I also have worked for a call center in the past..."
good,Computer work helps with your job. Some nice people and rude people. Get stressed from customers because they are mad for some reason before coming to you
good,Provide customer service to all customers and associates. The hardest part was trying to show respect to customers who didn't care to give it in return.
good,Walmart has its good and bad days. It can be stressful and a lot of has to get done everyday. Every department is fully staffed as well. You will not be working alone.
good,Stocked merchandise at a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market. I left because the hours were increasingly becoming less and less. i would go weeks without any hours.
good,"Es un lugar caluroso donde el trabajo debe ser rápido, tiene un ambiente laboral bueno con tus compañeros y cuentas con transporte gratis"
good,it was very good to work under a well organized company with decent managements skills. I sure learned a lot from working there as a manager and I also improved leadership skills.
good,Depending on which Walmart you go to it's not that bad. Long as you have a manager that know what they're doing and how to treat their customers then you'll be fine. After working there for 3 months you get a discount card that takes a percent off your groceries.
good,It was a pretty good job just not the right fit for me most of the people at my particular location were a bit more towards the younger crowd or much older
good,It is a family like atmosphere the people are great to work with and work for. You take  care of your customers depending on what area you work in and what call in you might have that day. You always take care of the customer
good,"Es un ambiente en general bueno, con un poco de dificultades de comunicación con los superiores."
good,"It is a fine place to work , like all places they work with you for your family life.The options for advancement is available as long as you have a personal work relationship with your managers."
good,"Being a walmart cashier js ok you meet friendly and open people most of the time and the managers try their beat to work with you, but overall its ok."
good,"Challenging, changing, diverse culture."
good,Walmart no bad if it is first job for you. you will learn more about how work in back room and in the front. will learn how you can work under pressure and work  with teamwork.
good,"A typical night at work is long not a lot of workers for the amount of work that needs to be done. In addition to that the stuff that isn't done during the other shifts falls on third shift."
good,"When I first started working at Walmart, I loved it, the people, the atmosphere was wonderful and then came bs. Don't get me wrong, you'll receive your hours and everything but as far as management, it's not okay. The company has people that throw their position in your face. They are normally rude when you ask them for help or assistance. Most important they are messy. See me I know how to stay to myself to receive my coins but just heed the warning."
good,The company has a lot of clicks and ypu dont really advance unless your in the click . So you get by passed even if your a good worker.  Walmart is not employee friendly it seems.
good,"Walmart is a great place to start a career, you can learn a lot. Bounce around and build a foundation dation of knowledge to go far with this company."
good,"Tus compañeros de trabajo no son en lo más mínimo colaborativos contigo y mucho menos si eres nuevo."
good,"It was a good job, it helped pay some bills and like most jobs it has its ups and downs, there was good team stills with most of the workers, and some not so friendly people. But over all it wasn't a bad place to work."
good,Most days it was very fast-paced or slow depending on how the customers came in. The hardest part of the job was making sure everybody else around me was always working and moving at the past we supposed to.
good,It's Ok but now they have only 10 cash registers and the rest self checkouts and not many other positions available...................................
good,"During my time at Walmart, I was given pretty bad hours which made hard too have any sort of social life. When ever I would ask the management to change my hours, they would always say they would ""get back to me in a couple days"" however this never happened."
good,A typical day working at Walmart would deal with customers that are looking to exchange or return products. This may include dealing with issues such as proof of purchase. I learned that it is assuring to ask management for when there are situations like so. The job is enjoyable but can be stressful on busy days.
good,"I went into Walmart hopeful and excited. It wasn't long before I realized it wasn't what I thought it would be. I am a part time cart pusher. The work is hard and a lot of customers are ungrateful. Some days I work alone without help, even during rush hours."
good,Walmart is an OK place to work at but it is nothing to make a career out of. It was a great place sometime but there was  no order and or lack of respect for one another.
good,did what ever the manger wanted or asked of you. the hardest part of the job was hearing different things from different managers and determining which to do
good,I feel like walmart is a good place to work. Just hours get cut. And most people are ok but the other take advantage of there job. But overall the job is good.
good,"Flexible and will work with your schedule. Management will be diligent, but  they are willing to work with problems you may have. Depending on the area you work in, will determine the amount of work the company will expect from you."
good,"All in all in genuinely enjoyed my job at Walmart and would to peers recommend with a peer, but with a few warnings attached."
good,This job was not for me. It required a lot of time and effort. The moves for advancement took a long time. The managers weren't always compliant with your requests.
good,"Good pay and benefits. Worked as a fork lifter moving inventory, moving boxes etc. Hardest part about working is not having everybody be a team player."
good,Retail is repetitive and can be fast pace. It  can get very stressful while working in retail when managing associates to deliver a great customer experience.
good,"Nice place to work for someone that's jus looking for a pay check,and it depends which walmart you wanna work at some better then others jus like any other company"
good,I was a cashier only. Cashiers had to make sure their aisle was clean for the customers to enter. You also had to stand at the end of the aisle to let customers know you were open and not busy.
good,"My time spent with Walmart Distribution was not terribly long but it was certainly eventful. While they may accept applications directly, for the most part they seem to accept applicants through a staffing agency. I had joined on through Aerotek."
good,It is a good company if your a hardworker looking to move up it is very hard work and very physical if you happen to ever apply for the cap 2 team ...
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. Management was pleasant to work with as well.  They were accomadating to requested days off.  Usually good about getting your breaks to you on time.
good,When you have proper management behind you I'm sure it is a great place to work. Always lived my coworkers but the long hours and sometimes unfair treatment gets to you
good,Management team made it difficult. Employees were rarely ever felt like they were valuable to the final product. Employees always feel like they can replaced in a second.
good,They need better employees and better management also there store is not very well organized. Security is very poor. Need associates that have better knowledge of their surroundings.
good,"I've learned that you have to treat people the way you want to be treated, if you treat someone bad and not respectful their most likely not going to help you when you need it"
good,Good place to work especially part time when your'e going to school or have another job to work they have many different work schedules that can fit your needs
good,Good training.  Great benefits . Fair work place. Raise based on work. I enjoyed working there but the environment was at times stressful.  Got along well with coworkers.
good,"I learned to work under pressure,how to use inventory devices,read labels,use electric jack and walkie stacker. Walmart can be fun to work at but stressful on somedays."
good,"Working at walmart was one of my more decent jobs. The managment wasnt great but it was good work for a decent paycheck. They mostly only hired full-time for truck crew, overnighters, and auto. If I could reccommend and position to apply for, it would be auto. The hours are good, they get paid more than truck crew, and they arent many things auto is required to do."
good,"got promoted fairly easily it was very fun to work there "
good,I like to work for walmart because they have good hours and the manger they help you too Walmart let you go to school and work too thats why i love walmart and they will work with you and your family too
good,Empresa muito boa de trabalhar onde a empresa proporciona carreira e crescimento proficional.
good,I belive if someone calls in for an emergemcy and the person has to get approved and they say your approve but when you go work the next day and get fired it shouldnot be you fault I feel like they should have handled it diffrent
good,"Se hacen cosas que no vienen en un contrato."
good,Did not work there long do to injury but was fast paced. A lot of lifting is required. Good community of coworkers. Loved working with the public. Management could use so more training.
good,"Work day speeds vary. Easy job though. decent pay. usually only given a vest and nametag. customer interactions arr a must. managers are alright, could use more training. Work well with your schedule, and all things that would cause you too miss work"
good,Met a lot of people who i now call my friends. I learned a lot working at Walmart. I would recommend others to work there as well if they are looking for a great place to work.
good,"The experience of working at Walmart is very much dependent on who is in charge going up. Is your manager hard working, is he/she organized, is the person ethical. Of course weather you like doing your part in the job plays a factor. There's always something to keep you busy when you're on duty. It's just a lot can go wrong if the wrong people are put in charge of you."
good,"Fun place to work, Fast pace, Breaks are on time and always given, The hours are good and with the disconnect for employees, Open door is always handle professional"
good,"I made lots of friends working at Walmart. However, one thing I don't agree with was the fact that management would always beg you to stay late to help finish OTHER peoples tasks after THEY would leave, then they would have you cut your hours later on in the week."
good,Working in the Pharmacy was fast paced and stressful. Walmart may have procedures that other pharmaceuticals may not have and customers become upset and being that you are the one giving them their prescription you are the one they are taking their frustrations out on.
good,I think the management is bad here they wont help you at all even if they say they will. They all have favorites. Work time is limited and you cant meet overtime unless you want a write up.
good,"I dont want to. It used  be a goo"
good,"After 4 and a half years, I've seen pretty much all there is to see and have done all there is to do in my department. The pay is adequate and the work environment is fairly easygoing as far as customer service jobs go. Generally not the nightmare that people claim that it is."
good,"Walmart is fast paced working area "
good,"Welcomed customers, answered customer's questions, checked receipts as the customer left the store, give return labels, report suspicious activity. "
good,"I like it very much to work here just because I like Customer Service.  Despite that I liked to work in there, the workplace need some improvements related to cleaning, organization, and management."
good,"Muita oportunidade de aprendizado, cultura sólida  e robusta."
good,Everyday an individual is busy with costumers. When problems arise the company empower an individual to make decision on the best interest of the company.
good,I love working at Walmart although the management is poor sometimes. The pay isn’t really good. You get to meet and see new people everyday. Good hours.
good,"many jobs to choose from, some advancements, good pay, good associates, learn new things, some flexible hours, good benefits, paid vacations and sick time."
good,"My team of 5 people per day usually starts off with finishing live freight that was supposed to be finished by night shift, whose team consists of only 5-10 members. Frozen live freight is usually around 9-10 hours, and dairy is usually around 10-14+ hours. We are required to finish those freights before 9am, before our mandatory 1 hour lunchtime. At first it was nice, but now it feels boring and a waste of time as we are required not 8.5 hours but 9 hours at work. After lunch we then spend the rest of the day ""CAP""ing grocery overstock exceptions and topstocking. "
good,I enjoy the people I work with and I enjoy mostly working and helping the customers and making them smile. I receive a happy to help award in July for being a happy to help employee.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for and has many benefits although at my location I failed to get a promotion after requesting many times, management made workers feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, and also cut overtime yet ask you to stay behind and end up messing up your schedule. Also the location was severely understaffed"
good,"Walmart is ok, it all depends on what kind of work environment you enter. My specific store denied me career advancement and fair despite being a loyal employee for so long."
good,"Good  place to  work coworkers are nice and friendly, wasn’t getting enough hours a week to make ends meat but overall nice place to work clean and tidy"
good,Walmart job is an okay job I just want more hours and an outside job and more hands on learning. Better pay would be another bonus. Walmart is a great job if you like being inside and being around people all the time
good,"Nothing impressed me about the job/position, was always being rusted to finish stocking the department I was assigned to so I could go help the slower stockers in other departments. Not very organized from the shift before my shift."
good,You can’t pick unless you pass the PAT  The PAT consists of moving as many cartons in 9 minutes as possible. That part is easy. That’s what order filling is like  . Then right after that you need to do as many sit-ups as you can in one minute which is virtually impossible because you just lifted cartons that were 20-60 lbs for 9 minutes. The mat for sit-ups was so slippery too. Not worth it.
good,Just use common sense and you will be fine.  It helps if you had prior experience before working there.  I will say that mostly be a self starter.  Be conscious of your surroundings when at work.  I will not make judgements about the managers because they are all different.
good,It wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t great. There’s definitely a lot of chance for advancement as you can be promoted by working there for 6 months. The minimum pay also is nice as you know you’ll make at least $11
good,Night shift theres a lot more freight but less customers.  It very how you'll be treated depending upon store management. They take safety procedures seriously.
good,WalMart is Walmart.  You're not going to advance much and it's ok for a part-time gig.  I worked in shoes and did that.  It was ok as I was looking for something else at the time.
good,"The associates are the heart of the company.   They work hard, and want to do the best they can.   I would work there again, if I had the opportunity."
good,the job wasn't bad just they needed to listen more to the store workers and need to bump up the pay there to keep people around for a long time other then that nice job.
good,"My employment with Walmart was a temporary job and as such I was paid like a temp. The company understood my school and family came first, and such accommodated me when it was needed."
good,all stores are the same so it is the actual people you work with. turn over is huge so by the time you decide whether you are happy or not it changes quickly.  I had a new manager  every six months all were different with different expectations of what they wanted. so you don't get bored doing the same things because each has a different standard and way they want it done.   how long you have the same store manager is not fixed...
good,My time here was short. The store i worked for was unorganized and very understaffed. I was a sales associate but I felt like I was doing my department managers job more then not.
good,Walmart was a good place to work for a high school student . It was very fast paced and was no room for advancement basically. The pay was not enough to take care of my family
good,Found it tough to advance and your job experience was pretty much determined by the management team u had.Lunchs are an hour per 8 hour shift meaning you are there 9 hours and you akso recieve two fifteen minute breaks
good,"worked for Walmart for over 19 years. ive done overnight stocker, cashier, csm, cash office associate, layaway, and radio grill back in the day. In the beginning Walmart was great they cared about their employees. We had good bonuses holiday dinners."
good,la mayor parte de los días adquieres algo nuevo para aprender
good,"Their was really no room to excel there . Their is really nothing else to say about the work experience there , I summarized it as simple and accurate as I could."
good,was an ok place to work at mangers were not good at there jobs due to making workers feel good for helping out extra hours and doing more then what was expected
good,Working for walmart is nothing special. It pays the bills and your experience is defined by how you as the individual want to approach it. If you go it with a good attitude them you'll have a food experience and vice versa.
good,Face pace and demanding.  Flexible work schedule and schedule is created two weeks in advance. Lots of room to expansion within the company.  Cross job training.
good,They treat u bad there is no overtime if u end up getting any there's a chance u can get in trouble pretty much there is a stricked guide line u have to follow or u can get fired really easy
good,"The hours for this job were come and go. I was hired full time but was lucky to get 32 hours in a week. Normally working with fellow associates can be fun and there are many enjoyable parts to the day, however, management was a bit different. Going to managers with problems in the workplace or something that would need to be fixed would get you nowhere. The manager would brush you off or a day or two later write you up for the problem. Calling in sick even when it was necessary was a rarity to get approved and would normally result in a write up. During a winter storm I was unable to make it in to work as the vehicle being used couldn't move more than a few feet without sliding around on the ice. I called in to inform the manager that I was not able to safely make it in to work, there was a stern lecture about being an unreliable worker when I came back in, my hours were reduced afterwards, and I had received an ""absence point"" to track our attendance at the job for not being able to safely make it into work. Though this seemed to be singled out to a few select managers, this made working there far more stressful especially during the winter time because if you couldn't make it in to work you couldn't quite tell if you would have a job when you come back the next day you can."
good,Since I worked for Walmart for a long period of time. It was nice at that time cause that store had an awesome store manager and assembled a great management team.. They cared about the associate and their families. It was run like a family .. Now cooperate has changed the culture and now it just seems just like another ordinary job.
good,"Amazing place, great benefits. I enjoyed the ability to help others and train them. I am grateful for all the wonderful opportunities offered at Walmart."
good,It was a learning experience for myself. Good work environment Very glad I joined the team. Didn't expect for it to be fast paced but plan on using what I learned at my new job.
good,Very friendly and cooperative associates. Understanding of certain situations outside of work. If you have any issues with family they will try their best to help better your situation.
good,It's a decent place to work with plenty of chances to advance. Its a pretty rewarding job as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort there is also chances to relocate.
good,"Possui grande potencial, se aproveitar seus talentos intenos."
good,"Trained well"
good,"customer service manager, then I went to be a cashier.  work place was very stressful.  no room for improvement. loved working with the staff and some of the management"
good,"The older I'm getting just need out of retail and be able to enjoy the weekends,holidays and to work days. Bouncing around with day's off and opening some days and closing are getting old."
good,"Always changing fast paced, customer oriented business. Need to learn hand held systems. Most part of the day spent stocking and reviewing on hands. Constantly battling freight."
good,"I like helping people.And seeing The reg costumer. co-worker too. It was not to far to go to work. keeping busy all the time, I like that too. Working in the green house I love it."
good,The company has poor management and really no standards managers ask to much of you and expect tasks to be done right then and there tasks that should take up to an hour or so
good,I worked for Walmart for 5 months. It was ok. I had to do things differently then what I was trained to do. I was told one thing from one manager and then something else from a different one. My anxiety was through the roof always.
good,Extremely stressful and not a good place to be able to breathe very hard work as a team when everyone is out to get you they also do not help with time off
good,"I liked my job at walmart, there was always work to be done, but like everywhere else the management at the time was terrible. They refused to give raises."
good,"it was not so friendly of an enviroment, really fast paced the managers were nothing but rude to all employees and the work they expected us to do was just absurd"
good,"Its ok if you really need a job, or you looking for experience in marketing. There are some good people you can learn from. Time off is next to nothing unless you have an emergency. Forget holiday pay or time off."
good,"If you need to work somewhere, it's easy to find your place here. Nothing exciting, just simple work and simple tasks, plug into the machine and collect your paycheck."
good,"Walmart is a good job but when pay went up, the hours where cut. If you are paying bills alone, this is not a secure job. Good for a first time job or college kid."
good,I like the job but I am still young and cart pushing just isn’t something I want to do  the job is wonderful. It just isn’t for me though. They pay a nice check.
good,"The most enjoyable part about walmart was cashiering and making people feel welcomed. "
good,Management is afraid of staff when it thinks it can be sue for discrimination. Good work ethics wont take you anywhere. The most enyoyable part of the day is going home.
good,"i don't have much to say about them i was only there for 1 month, but they were ok some were nice others didn't talk much it was a learning experience"
good,"I would like to work with great management,  but they have to have leadership quaintys and learn how to speak to one of a other... better communication"
good,l appreciate having a job l still work here however l am currently looking for employment elsewhere. l have given 190 percent since l started over two years ago and moved up to Produce Manager. The biggest problem is Cooperate placing unrealistic demands on their employees. Specially when the turn over rate is high. So that leaves not enough employees to get the jobs done ...efficiently
good,Lots of issues ... looking for a better job.  Management can be very unfair and not consistent un holding people accountable.  Love some of the people I work with.
good,I loved working at Walmart at first and then we got new management in  and they just don't know how to talk to people and we ask for more equipment they say we have enough but when we get there we can't do our jobs without equipment but it's no were to be found. And most of the equipment that we do have don't work an some of the carts that we use to pick items are uncontrollable and a hazard to you and the customer
good,"Nice job, nice people. Anyone with a clean background can get hired. Great place to meet a lot of people........................................................"
good,A good place to work. provides flexible hours and a place for growth. I have to leave due to relocation. and was no longer able to work there. Left for personal reasons.
good,Greeted and assist customer. Operates cash register and verifies purchase price. Perform all essential job functions at an acceptable level with minimal supervision. I can tell when customers need service before them asking so I am very attentive when it comes to customer service.
good,"Working at Walmart is an experience that I am glad to have gotten but I am one of the unfortunate employees who has to go through a dramatic workplace change. I am an over night stocker who is being moved to day shift and its a very unfortunate situation and I wish it wasn't so. Walmart isn't a bad company to work for, but its just become to hectic and stressful when it really shouldn't be."
good,"fast place to work. "
good,"Learned people skills"
good,Walmart felt that people had no lives outside of work they worked you till they couldn’t anymore . Management was highly rude with attitudes and seemed to always have a problem when questions were asked.
good,"I really loved my job with Walmart, I started off as cashier moved to Customer Service after half a year then to my current position Cash Office associate within 3 yrs. Its a very face pace environment, enjoy my coworkers. I don't like the teaching style. It's kind of sink or swim practice, Overall a very fun experience don't recommend staying very long does not benefit you in the long run"
good,Overall decent place to work better than some worse than others remodel has a high chance of moving.up apch does not have much rook to move up.however and most of the retail based positions require about as much actual effort as ysing the bathroom
good,"Management needs a lot of improvements. NO work-life balance."
good,"A lot of people that I worked with had been with the store since it opened, and I didn't mind it too much for a long time.  But when they basically got the the point of encouraging theft I quit.  Working at the customer service desk, it was impossible for me to ignore blatant theft, and was difficult not being allowed to do anything about it"
good,Would love to become fulltime but they don’t offer it unless you’re a manager . Everyone hired into the company is hired parttime and stays parttime unless you’re promoted to management .
good,It’s a company. There’s disconnect between between sections but that’s about it. It’s a job the hours are semi random and inconsistent if you’re part time
good,"Another warehouse type job. Fun if you like to be constantly moving but can be very stressful. This particular Walmart I worked at didn't really have the greatest management, they just didn't seem to care."
good,"Some Walmarts are different than others. Good place to brownnose to advance if you're into that stuff. That's a place where work ethic doesn't matter, it all depends on how good of a friend you are."
good,"all stores too varied to effectively review. They all depend on store management team, associates you have working for you, customer support, etc. I have been in both extremes"
good,"fair place to work,"
good,"Conhecimento e oportunidade, alegre"
good,The good thing about working there is you get to meet people learn how to do your job work together as a team player and help each other out when needed communication is a plus
good,"Started out helping unload trucks of product, but ended up working as a custodian, helping with the general area cleanliness, as well as stripping and waxing the floors. I generally had no issues with the job."
good,"I worked at Walmart three years ago, I can only barely remember anything happening. It was mostly just your standard starter job with nowhere to go that paid better than everyone else."
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits. Definitely need to give more pay to keep more people employed. Attendance policy needs more work. But as a overall job it’s good."
good,"use of latest technology, challenging work environment as there is no planning done. Work comes as and when required. Clients are quite demanding during the days of heavy work. frequently organizes team lunches and get-togethers."
good,Working at walmart was alright. Management was not the best. Also over worked me and made me work a lot as a minor and had me down stacking pallets alone.
good,"I did enjoy working there, there were frustrations but it was fun none the less .  I would recommend if someone was to ask and needed a job to get back working."
good,"One of the managers is the best, the rest is ok to meh."
good,"A lot of heaving lifting. "
good,Friendly atmosphere. Good work culture. No firing. Managers attitude very friendly. Time to time training arrangements. Most of the job part time. Need to improve salary scale.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great workplace the employees are nice and very professional almost like my family away from home ."
good,"Coming into work was stressful. They never seemed to know where to put me. When it was time to send me to Customer Service, they did not want to train me. Would not work here."
good,I just believe you have to have a strong mind to work over 6 hours because you have to move really fast especially on busy days like Saturday & Sunday’s.
good,It's an okay company I just need more money. They go off of a point system. The staff are okay. Employee always gossiping about someone's business but that's anywhere you go
good,The way the member's of management would walk past you like you didnt exist...and speak to other members of management....or to their favorites....asap
good,Management was disrespectful unprofessional and had no regards to the needs of their employees when trying to get ahold of Walmart in the case of emergencies you had almost no luck. Terrible work place.
good,Es una empresa en ma cual se cuenta con facilidade
good,The first few years I felt encouraged to grow and learn. Slowly  things changed and the company seemed to move away from the focus of the associate. Jobs started to be eliminated and people became less supportive of the company. Morale dropped very low and associates felt unappreciated.  Loyalty  faded.
good,"I was a cashier for 1 year and enjoyed my time meeting new people. I really like to move around and get tasks done, but being a cashier limited that for me. This job was a temporary one for me anyways until I found a job best fit for what I studied for in school."
good,Pretty well what you would expect from a warehouse job. Isn't glamorous but it pays the bills. Hours are a bit unpredictable but not terribly so. Pays the bills
good,The hardest part of this job was dealing with doctor's offices that didnt contact you back within 72 hours for patient care. And customers who got mad at the pharmacy because their doctor didnt respond to a request
good,Try your best to be on time be open-minded be fixable with your time be able to live things for things 5 to 30 lb have good customer service interact with customers
good,"My location didn't have a lot of people and it showed. ""Here's the job that takes 5 people good luck doing it with 3"" multiple times I was left as the only person in the whole department and it was stressful. "
good,"It was a good job and good pay."
good,"Walmart as a company is good, just depends on your store how they wanna go about things. I honestly probably wouldn't want to go back, but would recommend it to anyone who really needed a job"
good,I did enjoy working at Walmart. It’s a good place if you just want to be a cashier or associate.  Some Customers are nice. It’s hard to get off on time.
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love this job. It's fun, you're doing something every second of the shift BUT why does management gotta have it with their employees? I understand that they must be stressed, and I totally understand their side of being a manager but they don't even try anymore. This is specifically at OGP management. As for the rest of this Walmart's management, I feel bad about them because OGP lacks employee's during the school year and they must come in and spend their time picking groceries for the day when they are supposed to be dealing with their own department. Imagine being trained to be a manager for a department but half of the time you're not even in it."
good,it was a good job I learned a lot of new things why working there getting to know people and helping others.i had other jobs working with people I love my jobs I love helpng an working with others.
good,"enjoyed working there but "
good,Have job stability there friendly associates will work really well with people's schedule attendance policy is sort of rough but overall it is a good place
good,"I was happy with my manager, I just didn't like when we got swamped you were on your own. Or if you really needed a manager you had to wait a very long time. But once they got to you, they helped you greatly."
good,"Little work/ life balance. Expected to come in early,  on days off. Also required to work every thanksgiving for a long shift and six day work weeks leading up to holidays. "
good,"Days are usually busy. Breaks are usually late. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers over issues that are out of your control, Everybody is not a team player and the hard workers never really get recognized."
good,"Working at Walmart was intense and you would have to keep up with everything going on around you, whether it was the customers or my coworkers that would need help. You needed to be quick on your feet and make choices on the spot. Sometimes needing to do multiple jobs if need be. I learned how to manage my time and get work done, without sacrificing quality. I learned how to do multiple jobs including stocking, cleaning, and organizing. I also learned how to move around heavy skids safely and quickly. My managers were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their job and about any other jobs that needed to be done at Walmart. The work place was caring and professional, also make you feel appreciated. The hardest part of my job was dealing with aggressive customers coming into Walmart every so often. The most enjoyable part was making people happy, by either finding what they were looking for or helping them carryout a purchase to their vehicle."
good,"Overloaded with work, when you get a Tech 12 or more stores and they have to maintain all rooftop units and have to maintain all the refrigeration and those same stores its way to much work. all you can do is keep putting band-aids on things."
good,In order to work for this company you really need thick skin... And be self motivated because there is opportunity to move up in career. Never bring personal drama to work it always affects how you treat the customers
good,I’m getting paid 11.50 as a door host and my checks still be 700 with 80 hrs. Overall you meet a lot of people and deal with different situations. I would recommend.
good,"Fast-paced and friendly place to work. Typical day at work would consist of  cashing out customers, assisting customers to locate items in the store, or assist customers with a carry out, stocking, setting mods, zoning, cleaning.The best part of the job for me is meeting new people."
good,"I think there could have been improvement in terms of creating more team spirit at Walmart.  Breaks weren't always scheduled, and I would have liked better communication between supervision and staff."
good,I Feel Like their unorganized at times & need more employees . My pay for Pushing Carts should be a bit higher . Working as a shopping cart attendant your required to do more than just push carts so this is why I Feel we should get paid more .
good,Easy job for someone who is new to the whole work environment. Easy to learn and they train. Fun fast paced job that is great for high school seniors.
good,"Although i might not recommend walmart to any of my friends, i do not regret my time there because it taught me work ethic and discipline. My shifts were very busy with always more work to be done."
good,Multi cultural work environment and good management is what I found at Walmart.  We enjoyed different nationalities and learned a lot about other cultures through working at Walmart
good,Not a bad job if you're first starting out and need work experience. Pay and benefits are competitive with other local companies. Great and knowledgeable people to work with.
good,Met wonderful people all worked well together. Fast pase and stressfull but managable. Managers did their best and even pitched in to help if needed. Compensated and praised for working well.
good,"Empresa nos trás diariamente muitos desafios exigindo de nós resiliência e senso de urgência... Possui uma cultura muito forte o que inviabiliza a implantação de novo hábitos, valores e melhorias."
good,"I wish they had a better structure for employees,because they have stuff all over the place and it makes it difficult for us to get the job done on a timely matter."
good,"Working at Walmart is generally uneventful. You may get a few unique things once in a while, but all in all i just transferred calls, made pages, and cleaned what they told me to clean."
good,Need to be quick on feet and be able to keep up with orders. Very strenuous work as you had to palatalize food and use fork lifts for 11 hour or more shifts.
good,Worked at 2 locations. The first and the second were so different. Was almost as though I worked for 2 different company's. The first in Slave Lake was great. Than the 2nd in Nanaimo was horrible. Night to day difference.
good,a typical day at work would be unloading the truck and stocking the shelves. what i learned was how to stock and how to unload the truck i also learned how to use a pallet jack and how to use a baler and how to make a bale. the workplace was pretty fine i liked the people i worked with and i think they where good people. the hardest part about the job was throwing the truck. and the most enjoyable part was clocking out and going home.
good,I worked at a neighborhood market walmart. It was alright not anything I'm used to though. If you like working in a grocery store you'd love it. I just never liked working in that type of field.
good,"My reason for the 2 star rating concerning advancement and promotion stems from my having passed the Management Skills Assessment Survey/test and scoring as competitive on it, yet also being passed over and overlooked by Management when it came to applying for and being offered an interview for such positions as Department Manager. The disappointments of this were becoming somewhat unbearable and monotonous. , after a while."
good,"Walmart is an okay company to work, if you're looking for a job just to pay bills. Management needs more training, but otherwise as a people they were okay."
good,"es bueno, pero la paga es poca, mucho trabajo, clientes y jefes prepotentes"
good,"Management usually doesn’t have a hard time  cooperating "
good,Very bad Customer Service and management. I had alot of different experiences and met a lot of different people from different denominantions. It was very diverse but just wasn''t my best work experience
good,"Good place to work, friendly environment. Would totally  recommend this place to work, you'll  learn a lot. You get to meet new people every day and making people feel comfortable while shopping is something  I enjoyed doing."
good,Check for punch errors daily. Always learning something new on the computer. Followed management directions. Taught workplace culture to new hires. The hardest part was not having the answer to associates questions. I loved going to work daily and helping my fellow associates get their work done.
good,Ok place to work for teenagers or someone who is trying to take care and support a family. Pay was ok until they cut hours. Hard to get insurance on part time and they keep you on part time so you want get the benefits
good,Its very busy not enough time and can't use sick time for your self and not enough advance ments in the work place. Not enough health benefits. Nice people to work with.
good,"It was ok for temporary work and income, but I think for a serious person like me who intends to support his family to the best of his abilities I could do better."
good,It’s a good company to work for they give you good career and education opportunities but could use work on their system for employees. Such as attendance and PTO and PPTO.
good,"Great hrs, payed vacation nice staff, great location , no stress ,easy work and good benefits never had a problem with anyone there they just want you to do your job"
good,"Good company / better hours needed"
good,"stressful to work on this company, supervisor asking to do everything, yelling and sometimes making you look stupid and dumb.poor management, no goals."
good,"It works if you just happen to find the right store for you. One with good management and tolerable coworkers so they hire and hold onto good employees. Unless you just have an immeasurable amount of patience, come to work with a great attitude everyday and don’t let negative things get to you. Otherwise it’s good for part time or temporary employment."
good,fun place to work as a cashier for part time but not if you're trying to get a full time position.  they cut hours a lot to try to force people to quit when they have too many staff members.
good,"While Walmart was not my first choice for employment, I was hired as a cashier and quickly advanced to training for the position of Customer Service Manager in the short time I was there. My work consisted of typical cashiering work, maintaining my work space and handling cash, card and check transactions in a friendly and efficient manner. While training for CSM, I managed lanes, took care of issues above cashier level and handled cash and change both at the CSM station. I also pulled cash from registers as part of end of shift activities, delivering cash to the cash office for upper management to handle for the store. I also worked at the customer service desk, handling customer complaints, returns, exchanges, payroll check cashing and wire transfers."
good,"If you need to pay the bills, go for it. This isnt the worst job ever, there are benefits and you do get trained for the most part. Cashiers is probably the most stressful department/role unless management,  so I dont advise that postion at all. Everywhere else is stocking basically and keeping customers happy. "
good,Stocking shelves is not fun. Its one of the hardest jobs Ive had and its impossible to keep up with. Other then that its disappointing to think that the richest department store company in the world (at the time) could undercut and betray its workers as often as this company.
good,"Walmart pays pretty good for the location I’m at. So I was excited about the extra money to help with bills. The more I worked there the more I loved the people I worked with. Besides management, that’s the only downfall to walmart."
good,Enjoyed interactions with customers and co workers. Good benefits and paid time off. Salaried management did not provide enough direction when dealing with hourly associates.  Training is very poor.
good,Excellent benefits and advancement opportunities. Large break room with kitchen. Frequent employee events and morale boosters including surprise cake and foods for associates in break room. There was an associate run team responsible for organizing such events on occasion. Management was mostly irregular if not unresponsive to many associate requests/complaints. Some department's policies were regularly broken by associates without disciplinary action taken. Freight unloading was mostly loudly profane especially with their music.
good,"I wouldn't recommend applying to Walmart unless you were incredibly desperate for money, though you won't be making a whole bunch of it. It is quite soul-sucking."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart and I learned a lot about the community as well as how to converse with strangers. My time was great and I'm sad it got cut short
good,It was ok to work there at times there was drama. It was hard work at times on your feet all the time it sucked working there with the people that didn't pull there weight
good,i actually enjoyed working there. i loved my coworkers. i had fun working there. it was the best job i ever had. if i wanted to i would work there again.
good,"When I first started it was very family oriented, you felt like they cared about their associates, and if you worked hard you were compensated well. They have down a huge turn around and continue to change so much that we have began loosing some of our compensation and long term employees are beginning to leave for lower paid jobs."
good,Great place work to however the ever changing line of management makes it hard to keep up with the expectations placed upon staff. Not a negative nor is it a positive experience
good,"Working in a fast pace environment as a cashier. I learned how to relate to customers inquires,using a cash register working with a team using safety skills how to approach issues making sure customers are happy.Management was fair just doing their job."
good,i liked the job. Downside was we were always down people so it put more pressure on us cashiers.  my managers were cool. it was only scary when i had to talk to them cause they dont come friendly. they should smile more
good,It’s ok  I liked it for the majority of the time I was there I just didn’t like how I worked cap2 the hardest position in the store and others positions paid more
good,Room for advancement started off on 2nd shift truck unloader was pretty good fast pace you have a group of people unloading the truck with you on a set of line rollers then you place items onto carts and pallets to later be taken out to the sales floor. Worked my way up to 1st shift IMS Associate did picks of backroom counts and audits.
good,Did what ever they needed me to do I got trained in a lot of different departments. Great experience management could of been a little more helpful on making sure people knew how to do their tasks
good,I loved working at Walmart it is very well maintained. Very friendly environment I enjoyed working with fellow co-workers. I loved my job stocking merchandise and conditioning the isles.
good,"At first, Walmart was a great company to work for. They seemed to care about their employees wholeheartedly, but down the road it seemed to change. All I heard was negative things about management and supervisors from my coworkers towards the end of my tenure there."
good,the graveyard shift feels like purgatory. The sleep routine is very hard to be productive in the day. you don't really talk to your coworkers the whole shift. you can listen to music but it just makes you tired more than it keeps you up.
good,"somedays work was slow and somedays they are busy. I learned how to manage my time.. management  was not bad, but needed managers that know what they were doing. be friendly to the customers. getting all the food in the hot case and the hen house on time. making new friends."
good,Ok company to work though. Pay wasn’t that great. Some managers weren’t that personable. Some very rude. Had okay supervisors. Some employees also very rude.
good,I never really planned on working here for more then a year but it ended up being a few because sometimes you just get used to a paycheck so much that you just put up with all the none sense that you have to.
good,"Overall for doing the work that I did it wasn't bad. You pretty much just unload a truck or two by hand then stock the product. Bad things are you unload them with manual pallet Jack's because your trainer doesn't want to train anyone else on the equipment. (Asked for almost 6 months) Then you have to follow certain policies that slow your productivity, all while management complains you arnt working fast enough. But other than all that it isint a bad job."
good,The company pay was awesome for someone who wants to enter the workforce but for someone who just needed money not worth the damage it does to my body
good,I have received high scores in getting my job done on time. My customer service scores have always been high. I have always gone out of my way to help train new employees
good,I just want somewhere closer to home.. I drive a almosf a hour just to work everyday and then back home. Plus im ready for a change hopefully out of retail
good,I loved working there learned alot and how to make a customer happy and learn hard work and where things should be stocked properly and always make sure you do your job right the first time and make sure to stock all the items assigned to u.
good,Very stressful coming from supervisor a lot of heavy lifting grouchy and bending.managers seems to be so busy that it was hard to get to talk to them the pay really sucks for what you are doing.
good,"Working for Walmart pays the bills... I feel as though Walmart is too big. Too many associates, too many customers, too much management. I'm currently a CSM and have been all over the store. I like it, but I feel as though everything changes way too much. We are expected to follow and enforce certain policies, but sometimes it's okay to break them... Management gets upset when you enforce them talking about ""why didnt you just take care of the customer?"" other times, they will say ""you weren't supposed to do that and you know that..."". It's like we can never really do anything right. Not everything is always disclosed properly to the customer in the sense of return policies. It's not on the back of the receipt, it's just on return mats at the service desk, and electronics. Who would even think to go and look there? Then on top of that a lot of Walmart.com items you can't return in store because of them being Marketplace items which gets us cussed out frequently. We also have the ability to ""write up"" or as Walmart calls it ""coach"" our associates to correct bad behavior, but then when we try to our manager just wants to pull them in the office and talk. We never can do anything anymore which is why our cashiers are pretty much able to walk all over us. That and I've seen at other Walmarts poorly trained associates. I went into one the other day and me and my boyfriend were buying stuff and my friend went to go look at something and the overnight cashier asked to see my receipt AT the self checkout register while we was still at it. I asked her the reason and she said ""thats the"
good,"you never get your breaks and your lunch breaks are always late, the CSM there are mean  and like to yell at you from the other side of the store. when you try to complain about it no one does nothing about it."
good,"Poor management is making me seek other job opportunities. I cannot get days off as requested because they have no coverage, so they deny my request to receive days off for family events. It was a good job opportunity but I need to extend my options."
good,When I first started working for Wal-Mart the company seemed to show an interest in thier employees. As time went by and policies changed they slowly went from a family friendly work place to a place where they didn't want to work with your schedule and management slowly stopped trying to help resolve issues in departments.
good,"Working at Walmart depends upon location and management, have a bad set of managers or just one can really kill working at walmart. I have transferred from a badly managed store to a bigger one where the management team was great and a major support team"
good,"be paired to work very hard for a little pay, make sure you are on time and don't call in less its absolutely necessary because there is 9 point system."
good,"You welcome and thank the customers for shopping, while you check them out. When not cashiering you are cleaning, stocking or zoning the registers. Managers will jump on the registers when needed and have time to listen to you when needed."
good,Working at walmart was a fun part of my life I did it for 15 years worked in different departments from grocery to automotive and really enjoyed the customer experience every day
good,"This place was such a gong show to work at. people were un organized and so many changes which non were for the best "
good,It just wasn’t for me. The changes they were making I didn’t agree with. The environment is fun when it isn’t too busy. I also liked getting to know the people of the community.
good,Learned how to be a great cashier. Overall experience positive. Good work experience atmosphere. Would have liked me to be able to have more hours. In all a good establishment.
good,"Not a pleasant place to work. MGMT is not able to back up employees. It is a very corporate ran business, of course which leaves little room for that personal touch."
good,Very good place to work. I enjoyed it very much. People are friendly you have a good time. Work is easy and enjoyable. Need more hours given though. Otherwise great.
good,"Management left uncheck to favoritism, which lead to issues amongst coworkers and department manager. Keep yourself moving and busy and it's honestly a very enjoyable work environment"
good,Just temporary hadn't gotten any benefits and not sure about vacations since I'm part time sometimes the managers dont schedule enough people and others they schedule too many plus they dont give you want you need to get your job done the employees I talk to states raises never come
good,"You are not trained to complete tasks correctly. Then you are put down for not knowing how to do the correct procedures. Managers do not communicate with each other and different shifts on what is going on."
good,Very fast paced on sundays. that pay is great so are the hours. the management wasn’t bad either. don’t really have any complaints about the job. Co workers are fun and good to work with.
good,I would make sure all clothes on shelfs amd racks where folded and kept neatly. I would stock and replace anything thing that needed to be replaced. And made sure everything was kept in the right spots.
good,decent work place with a mostly upbeat climate but get the job done and go home environment. hard to move up and made it difficult to do so. always putting things off and not making any time for improvement of others
good,"You always have something to do, they move you from palace to place and you get breaks depending on hours worked that day. You keep a smile on your face and so do they."
good,Other then there was never enough associates to cover all the areas assigned for each shifts. I loved it there. My department managers were very willing to help when asked.
good,"The job and everything associated with it can vary on a daily basis, but it remains consistent throughout most common retail environments. It is manual labor, in a fast paced customer service environment. "
good,"It's ok if your an hourly associate. If your salaried management, it's not worth it. No work life balance, no compassion or understanding. Over worked and underpaid."
good,"Current employee -1yr)-Long hrs, but short weeks-(unless MOT) Way too much Spanish in an American work place!  Occurrences are Given for ANY unscheduled Absence/ Low Production numbers/ Missing  Time clock punches/ Safety,,,A Long Walk to the 1 Smoking area -MOST Employees are Pleasant."
good,Tiene buen ambiente laboral trabajas solo tus 8 horas te paga en los días que son te dan oportunidad de crecimiento
good,I highly recommend you start here but don’t stay. Great work place when you have a strong team of ASMs and COs that know what they are doing. Horrible communication leads to unorganized days which most were. Great work relationships will be made.
good,"Depending on the day, some days were fun and some days were just the usual thing that we would normally do. When I was at Walmart i learned a lot while I was there like how to build endcaps, features, stackbases and a lot more. Management worked with my schedule when I needed a day off or a specific day that I needed off until further notice. The workplace culture was okay. The behaviors of some associates would bring people down in a bad mood. If you walk in to Wal-Mart all happy and an associate you talk to is in a negative mindset it just puts you in that kind of mindset and then you feel miserable the rest of your shift. The hardest part of the job was there was not really anything hard about it. It was self explanatory after you go through training and get the hang of your job description. The most enjoyable part of the job was to do firearm sales and do the freight."
good,They will train you and make sure you know what your doing. You will help other departments but need to pay attention to pages that require to go back to your station.
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working at War-Mart. T`he customers at my location were friendly and I loved my co workers. T`he environment was easy paced and welcoming. I would recommend to anyone.
good,I enjoy working with Walmart but am currently looking for a better job that suits me best. The Walmart scheduling isn’t working out with my school schedule.
good,"There are several layers to the team that develops learning solutions to business objectives, and that team struggled with seeing how each layer supported the next.  Timelines requested from the operations partners were often incredibly tight, but the team would join together to make sure they were met.  The team is comprised of a diverse set of backgrounds and skill sets, each person contributing in their own way to move the team forward."
good,very stressful. communication is not there. the proper actions arent taken. work load is way to much for the pay given. jobs being eliminated. short staffed everyday
good,"Process driven workday, lifting, carrying pulling merchandise to destinations."
good,"Even though company goals, culture and vision is positive I do not think  all people get the same treat and opportunities, it is difficult to management and team members to follow."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, I was given good hours and pay, but the work culture could be quite toxic and stressful at times. The biggest downfall for myself was the non-acceptance of doctors notes for days missed due to medical reasons."
good,"Speak English/Spanish work with people be a hard worker be responsible etc... customer always first, I like to work for this company I like to stock merchandise like to work on the floor I work for auto dept.,electronic , unloaders, cashier"
good,Good place to work. Physical work environment. Very hot in the summer but there is a freezer dept and dairy deli where the temps are cool. I worked there for twelve years and was able to transfer around a few times.
good,"Like any job, it has its pros and cons.  Coworkers and management can determine your ability to progress or move onto another career path.  Stay positive."
good,"Not enough employees to run registers. Also some rules are made by people who obviously haven't actually worked in a pharmacy setting; such as having to scan each immunization between administering them to the patient, if the patient bia getting multiple at one time, it is not accommodating to have to run back and forth."
good,"I would not recommend people to work at Walmart. They don't care about there employees or there families. They don't pay a lot, and they don't give you ful;l time hours."
good,I worked overnight. Sure there are come customers that come in at night but most of them will not bother you for anything. Working as a Stocker you are part of a team that is the whole store. you are responsible for your section and if you or someone else is done quicker than expected then that person goes to the next section to help out. Sometimes you get someone right away to start with. There is nothing wrong with socializing for a few minutes as long as you get your work done. I think that Walmart was a good place to work.
good,Simple tasks but wasn't really organized with lunch breaks and etc. Working and meeting new people was the best part of the job. Work culture was usually clean and well maintained
good,"Nice place to work at. Nice people to meet. Working there is not hard. I've learned a lot from working there, from management to everything you can learn about Walmart."
good,C'était mon deuxième emploi. Ça été une bonne expérience de travail que j'ai du quitter pour déménager à Québec.
good,Really enjoyed working there. Great supervisor and managers. Awesome co-workers only downfall was the point system they had. It made no sense and it was unfair to be given a certain amount of points that leads to your termination.
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Great people to work with. Definitely have to adapt to alot of change. Work well with multiple rotating managers. Always an opportunity to learn new jobs and skills. Great opportunity to strengthen customer service skills and meet alot of wonderful people. Including customers and fellow co workers.
good,"did not like working at wall mart due to the poor salary and lack of leadership in the store where i worked, additionally it was a dirty store with no upper management assistance with helping team members complete needed training's. Day to day it was a grind just coming to work because of the poor attitudes from management."
good,"The most enjoyable experience is how we focused on exceeding expectations and building customer loyalty.  I've learned extensive knowledge of sales, customer relations, inventory, and shipment processing."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, pleasant work environment to work. The department work together as a team in order to provide excellent Customer Service on a daily basis."
good,Working at Walmart was really a experience it had it's bad times and it did have it's good times as well but the job to me at least wasn't worth the almost 4 years I put in.
good,"We can pick our shift. Very busy store so get very tired. Management is okay there. Benefit is very less . No excuse if we got sick also, that sucks. They give you a point and get fired on 5 points. Being a cashier have to deal with very rude customers sometimes. I would recommend friends to work at Walmart."
good,"It is a company that I choose to move on with my career ,It is not a bad place to work butI can do better with my life.The retail world does not do good for me in the workforce.I have alway had a thing for security especially in the pass, when I should have payed attention to my career opportunities.If Continue to pray God will opened opportunities for me in the future."
good,It was okay. I liked the people i worked with and helping the customers.  It was cold in the freezer though which sometimes sucked after being in there for prolonged periods of time but you get used to after a while.
good,"Difficult to keep up with the department's daily duties, as they keep shuffling associates from your struggling department to one of many floundering departments. While communicating and working with the fellow associates is usually clear and perceptive of how our situations are, the contradicting directives from multiple members of management, who are the same level of management, frustrate the workers as we struggle to accomplish what needs to be done and serve our customers before the end of our shift."
good,"concrete floors and steel shelves a general dreary workplace, somewhat confusing computer learning programs at seemingly random intervals of employment."
good,"At first it wasn’t bad, but then it got stressful, management wasn’t always the greatest. I’d have to cover things by myself. I never had the assistance I needed to get my job done correctly"
good,Ok place to work loys of things to do no body is realy great or bad bout ok to me all ppl in management are pretty cool except for one she is not ok bout it
good,"Walmart has changed the past 5 years. You are now required to cross train in all departments. They under staff on purpose and require everyone to do multiple areas even if it’s not in your job description. "
good,Walmart was my first job. Cant complain. It was definitely interesting and saw some interesting things. Met some great people also. Made some good friends.
good,"Um like the summary says it's a good starting job, but with not being full time u don't get good benefits because your not full time and you can have good people to work with"
good,"Depending on what you do in the store you will have to deal with customers on a daily basis. It tends to be fast paced and busy especially during the holidays. Many people are expected to know how to run the register and know where everything is in the store. They have a strict  attendance policy, but also have quarterly bonuses."
good,"I've learned how to cooperate with others well and made a few friends.Our managers are respectful most of the time and give out detailed instructions. They give out free water bottles when you need one. The payment is average, $11 an hour is not bad."
good,"I only left because of scheduling conflicts. Otherwise, it was a fair job. They have intermittent breaks that are nice, every 2 hours that you work. My coworkers were nice as well."
good,This job is fast paced and you have to provide excellent customer service. Ensure we have instock for customers. Zone store and also restock displaced items. Provide leadership for employees. Always have a good attitude and know your business.
good,"Walmart offered incentives and benefits that a lot of companies don't have. However, as a salary member of management, they work you too much and the stress and work load becomes overwhelming."
good,"the job was demanding at times. the management was good. the hours were decent. coworkers were helpful. the uniforms were comfortable, but the hair policy was too strict."
good,It paid well. Some of the management was ok. The work day went by quickly. No coverage in some areas. Good 401k plan. Every employee had to learn about each department.
good,They make rate harder and harder to make and push it more and more on you and it just would be better getting positive feedback then negative especially when your lifting acword 100lb cases and there's no good way to hold it
good,"Just like any other mass reail job, if you can handle day to day customers, then you're fine. Job is easy. Management wasn't the greatest at the time."
good,Ok place to work if you want to deal with ugly customers and harassment.. and cheap pay.. but overall it's ok place to work and get some money not a lot just some
good,"It was fun at first and really exciting, and a great first job, but nothing to make a career out of. It can be very stressful, specially when staff/coworkers belittle you all the time. It may take a tole on your mental health."
good,Good experience. Good job but the hours were always changing made it hard to juggle childcare other apts etc and never gave full time just barely under to not have to pay benefits.
good,Working there was great overall but sometimes the managers attitude reflects how the day is gonna go. But as long as your there and doing your job it’s fine. Walmart is a great place to work at cause you do learn a lot from there
good,It was a fast and slow paced job. It might start off slow then get faster. It’s a good on feet staying productive job.It was a good job just a lot of moving around you have to be up to moving around.
good,Walmart was a great job but the hours differ... I leaned that customers can be very disrespectful towards employees but you have to overcome it.......
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience, I do however think they could be more organized when it comes to breaks and lunch times. Being a cashier is both fun and challenging at times."
good,Sometime can be stressful dealing with other people and their attitudes. You have to have a sound mind and dont be quick to judge. Just remember everyone is trying to get in and out so tjey can go home and relax. So just treat everyone like you want to be treated
good,"The company offers a lot of good benefits. As with any company, success depends on the strength of your management team. The job was easy and met a lot of good people."
good,Working in Electronics was a fun place to work. Some of the bosses could have played a better role than they did but I left because I was moving out of town.
good,C'était correct comme travail. Bonne flexibilité d'horaire
good,this job was a great job for me at the time with benefits and good people to work with. taught me a lot about things I use in everyday life. would definitely recommend the job to any young individual.
good,"A normal day at Walmart had me Unload trucks, sort products in the backroom, stock products on shelves, ensure aisles are neat and area is clean, engage vendors and drivers with a positive attitude, and greet customers and answer their questions."
good,"Walmart is a basic retail job. You clock in, you do your job, you clock out. The anti-union propaganda is a bit creepy, but the retail market is so competitive that Walmart already has to offer good working conditions and pay to keep its workforce, so it's not likely unionizing would get much more (this may not be true where Walmart is basically the only employer and workers have few other options). Unless you're dramatically unprofessional or rude to a customer, it's not likely you'll get fired, but by the same token if you're not really going out of your way to go the extra mile, it's almost impossible to get noticed and tapped for advancement."
good,"A great place for students and adults to work. They offer many benefits, flexible work schedule and vacation time.  The management team is always willing to help."
good,Ambiente bom de trabalho com funcionários muitos bons
good,"Snow days was the worst, my co- workers were amazing, main manager was bad, but the managers under him were the best. I learned to provide fishing licenses, different types of ammo for guns"
good,Shift begins at four am until work is completed around two pm. Handle all receiving documents received in from the receiving department.  Verify quantity received matches what was received in GLS System.
good,"Stressful inviornment, little training. I""m a night shift supervisor,trained 3 days. I learn my job as situations arise. I Cant get use to night shift"
good,"I come in clock in, get on the register and I greet the customers scan their groceries. Give small talk make them feel welcomed then I’ll take their cash or check and give them their receipt and change."
good,In My experience working at walmart was very fast paced weather your job title is cashier or CAP 2 or even management. Wal-Mart is a good job for boosting your customer sevice skills. Wal-Mart has great benifits such as paid time off 401k healthcare and many other benifits
good,"Work was fine, mandatory weekends work. Paid time off was good, dress code was sometimes confusing and the workers were fine to work with. The environment would sometimes be stressful but managable."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart, Middlefield. I'd suggest for anyone to work there. The pay is fair. The hours are good. I'd like to go back, if at all possible."
good,They don't care about their employee's. Your just another number to them. Work work work with no recognition. If you have a family emergency they expect you to still show up. Great benefits though...
good,It was good working there. I met a lot of people and made a lot of friends. The costumers was very nice and understanding. I wouldn't mind going back.
good,You will have to work hard to do this job. If you aren’t physically fit this is the wrong job. You will have to want to do this job everyday because most people quit
good,It depends on the manager if he or she is fair and is a good leader. Personality is also a factor as well as prejudice and not judging a person on their race and religious beliefs.
good,"Walmart was a decent company to work for but could definitely use improved employment wise. I loved the people I worked with but after awhile the job became too stressful because too much was being asked and put on CSM's and never felt like we were enough, plus there was major favoritism by certain managers."
good,"good place to work."
good,Nothing super fancy. Typical day was to come in get my tasks and get to work. They had a nice lounge for breaks. Enjoyed working overnight as it was less crowded.
good,"I liked the job for the first 3 yrs. Until they changed management,The management had y doing a different types on job,also too many manages telling you what to do,having you do project y never done before,and expect you to do it right ."
good,"Understaffed employers, bad management but good benefits, work experience, annually pay upgrades, great HR department, paid time off, really fair lunch times and breaks"
good,No flexible for anything outside Walmart your personal life comes second most off the part time hours are not enough to live off.as for job security they're definitely not going anywhere.good people and benefits.
good,"Walmart is a good place to learn some valuable life and career skills. Retail is an environment that forces you to be fast paced, good with people, and patient with training and growing others."
good,"Enjoyed my co workers. Worked with some great people. Had some good and some bad managers. Loved my customers. Had some rude customers, but for the most part they were all really nice"
good,"Fast Pace, Friendly Co-Workers, management can be either good or bad depending where you are like usual, Sleep during the day, got tasks to complete at certain times, sometimes unreliable time schedule."
good,"A lot of people just show up for a paycheck. If management sees you doing a good job, you are often rewarded by being told to do other peoples work. Saw many people passed over for a promotion because they were 'too hard to replace where they were currently at. Decent benefits."
good,Family-oriented company even with the huge size . Lots of changes coming up. Good new innovation opportunities may be available in this retail market.
good,"I had worked at Walmart previously and turned down a management position, came back this time to earn an ASM position, which I did in approximately 1 year."
good,"It’s a better job than my last job but not much better, people are appreciative of what you do for them and they aren’t flexible. If you try to talk to them, they don’t take immediate action to solve the issue."
good,Once I was done with training my co-workers made me feel welcome and like I belonged there. They never made me feel like I couldn't as questions or ask them for help if I needed it.
good," Maintain a steady flow of material through production lines by unloading freight and discharge conveyors."
good,"My typical work day was tough one to muster through after the first 2 months being there. I learned that some people can be trusted and some cant be trusted. The management there was pretty good, except for a few who had favorites in the store. The culture there was pretty good as far I can tell. The hardest part of the job was not really the job itself, but the people I worked with were unfair and untrustworthy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the odd jobs the managers had me do ( Example: Balloon popping)."
good,With this position i learned how to be a true fast and friendly cashier with the fast pace area. With waiting on guest and cleaning being a main goal for walmart
good,Very fast paced busy job. I was given sufficient breaks and the managers were very friendly. PTO was great for if you or your children get sick. After working there a year I broke my leg on the job and Walmart paid for everything!
good,They kept dropping our pay and it got to the point where it wasnt worth it i went from working full time hours to part time hours so i left the job cause i needed more money
good,be ready to be adaptable to a day to day business. you never do the same thing every day. you will need to learn to go with the flow of season and what is going on that business day.
good,I enjoyed working along side real characters but in the end the management is not at a level I could work for. Great job to get retail skill in but longevity depends on what store you work for.
good,"Not a bad place for a job and co-workers are nice managers are  hot headed."
good,"I didn't like some of the people that were there longer than me because they acted entitled and they were rude. I did the like people that were not being rude such as the people who got hired with me and some of the people that were there longer than all of us. I liked the break room, and how sometimes things were provided free for the co-workers, so that was nice. I just rather have a workplace that is peaceful, than having to be bossed around by people that were there longer than me in a rude way. That was just my experience there. The pay was good though."
good,I was able to support my family at Walmart for several years there was ups and downs while I was there but not an unpleasant place to work its definitely a good starter job
good,"not a good place to work, employees are underpaid and not appreciated. Management need to take more sensitivity class along with gaining better communicational skills. an individual should not be promoted to a managerial role unless they have the desired skill set."
good,Una experiencia poco agradable...9 horas incluida la de comida...presión laboral para ejercer el trabajo...monótono y repetitivo... manipulación del personal de gerencia para obligar te a quedarte horas extras...presión y discriminación en caso de no acceder a los horarios...te prometen un puesto y de entrada te colocan en otro...y luego no te cambian...
good,only complaint is thE non organization between management inside The store
good,its a good place to start out to build up your work experience. however there are many areas that are filled with nothing but issue. production jobs were easy for a decent worker. retail positions just took time.
good,company is in the middle of restructuring and changes are happening on almost a daily basis. culture of company is not loyal to the model set out by sam walton when he founded walmart
good,Walmart was not a bad company to work for but they were very old school there. I did more work than most of the people there and I did not get paid what I think I should have got paid. A typical day of work could have me going around to several areas. I hardly ever stayed in one area. I learned a lot about electronics and made several new friends. One thing I can say about Walmart was everyone treated you like family and everyone worked as a team to reach a common goal.
good,You always have something to do there are many different managers so there is always someone to help all equipment that is needed is there . there is always room to move up
good,Hard environment to work in especially if you are focus on getting your assignment done.  Others will slack off which could lead to you having your assignment incomplete at the end of the day.
good,busy sometimes chaotic place to work. very flexible work schedule worked around my school schedule. had great discount benefits. the hardest part working at Walmart was some of the unfriendly customers
good,"I work at store 1531 and the support managers do not help at all. Instead, they put more pressure on associates and break rules. I work the overnight shift and all they do is put pressure on each and every associate, except for their favorites."
good,Working to fill shelves and helping customers. Ringing out people at the registers. Making sure shelves are stocked and clean and ready for the morning shoppers
good,Was a decent job but not treated very well. Wasn’t really trained the right way and whenever I had a question or needed help with something the coworkers would have an additude
good,you better be prepared to do a lot of walking because when you work at Walmart you are nonstop all over the store but its a good job if you work hard you can advance in the company
good,"The ACC in the location I worked at was always seemingly understaffed, and mismanaged. Most of the time our scheduled times would be all kinds of off-set, so people were always stretching to make time for their breaks, or had to wait for another crew member to show up so they could go. Management struggled to order the supplies we needed to do our job right more than half the time. "
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work, and they believe in promoting from within so there is a good chance you can move up in the company. Attitude determines altitude"
good,"Managing Sales"
good,"don't do it to yourself, they do not care about their employees, they are very ungrateful and the pay is nowhere near what it should be for all the things they have you do."
good,"At first it was wonderful. Things change so quickly. Policy change frequent, job descriptions ect. People fired very quickly no matter who or what position. Lots of drama."
good,"Management needs to work on being the right kind of management, help the associates. Check on them. Change the attendance rules a bit because no one can control what goes on in their life or their safety and health of their children"
good,"Overnight stock, working at a quick pace and as a team to get shelves ready for customers. Made new friends, and proper breaks and pay. Had to leave due to pregnancy, wish I could go back."
good,The place is full of diversity and opportunities. Work is never ending but if you do it right you will succeed and be offered a promotion pretty fast. Management however can be pretty harsh and customers are mean most of the times.
good,"I walked into the job ready to go and move up in the company, when you are a Supervisor you definitely have a lot more responsibility placed on your shoulders."
good,Walmart was okay for me at first but then when time moved on I saw how they really treated there employees while I was working hard they still had something too say because they were just bossy and didn’t know what they were doing
good,"During my time with Walmart i found that many of the departments where under maned or just didn't have anyone working in them. when a request for more team members was made the management threatened to cut hours. As a choice i do not recommend working for Walmart unless either you have limited options, or enjoy the high stress environment."
good,I learned how to handle and prep food. That included slicing and frying the food. Making sandwiches  and salads and frying chicken.the most fun part of the job was interacting with the customers
good,Great place to work. Fast pace at times. Slow at other times. Friendly service. Always able to answer your questions and etc. Offered bonuses after so long. Great discounts. Worked around School schedule and etc.
good,It was fine not to hard not to easy things could get rushed at times. The customers could be a pain at times and for the most part you're coworkers were descent.
good,it was oktheir are something that should be change about the way that you clock in all holidays should be giving off thebreaks should bealittle longer for lunch
good,"Walmart employees are not cared for at all. The only thing that really keeps workers around is an easy job making $11 an hour. Without that, it would be hard to keep workers."
good,"Ils se vantent d`être la meilleure compagnie avec les meilleures conditions de travail, alors qu`ils n`ont aucune estime pour leurs employés quels qu'ils soient."
good,Enjoyed working at this place of employment- it was challenging at times and gave me the opportunity to work in various positions during my years of employment.
good,It's very fast paced you have to make a 100% production everyday or it's a write up. The points is very strict does not matter what is going on in your life you need to be at work  .  There is a few mangers that are great to work for and some well you know the type..
good,Lot of changes have taken place at walmart.   Changes in policies.  Differential taken away.   Job position taken away.   It is not the same company that Sam Walton created.  No job security basically your just a number.  They are no longer the family oriented.   Just a sad fact.
good,"Ok place to work right after HighSchool. Very easy to move up in the ranks. Customers there are jerks from time to time, but the work place is ok. Overall I would give Walmart a 7/10"
good,Not Organized. The works didn’t know how to handle there job titles . I can’t deal with it . Just not my type of job. I think they need better workers.
good,Walmart is a fast paced company that is always updating. Any job has its ups and downs. But with my 17 years with the company I have many advancements in my life inside and outside of the company.
good,Smile Enjoy and be friendly! Good place to work but be prepared to be on your feet and be on your toes! Please be sure to follow all policy's and procures they are important. Give them a try!
good,"I started working for Walmart In 2006  I help build the inside of Walmart . From there I went to Sales associate ,to fitting room associate, to cashier to  department manager .l love my job From there I was promoted to assistant manager. For the first year everything was fine . Walmart decided they wanted to change the assistant manager back to Regular workers.keeping the  title ?!!!"
good,"management is terrible, they pour the work load on associates with no return. terrible communication skills and high stress levels. no one seems to care about the employees that actually do the work and cater to those that don't."
good,"•	Manual Labor- Throw cases on a conveyor belt to be transferred to correct location."
good,"As an hourly, the company is okay to work for - it's mainly about management, depending on the manager working for walmart can be fun or a nightmare. As a salaried employee, things get much harder and expectations become unrealistic and the work environment becomes much more stressful."
good,"Wasnt given many opportunities and worked hard with no compensation or any guarantee of permanent position, getting juggled around other positions and belittle"
good,"Going paying job I liked working there just didn’t give me enough hours why I left, but other then that the job pretty straight forward and very easy to do"
good,"I personally liked Walmart when I got there, but when it came to me wanting to promote they were unwilling to help me succeed. I put a lot of time and hard work for a promotion and they gave it to an underachiever that doesn’t do so good. But if it doesn’t bother you that they aren’t one hundred percent fair and you’re only looking for base pay by all means go for it"
good,"Just about every job is physical in nature, standing, lifting, bending.  And you are required to work as fast and efficiently as you can.  Their online training is very good and their salary and benefits are also very good."
good,"My experience there was good it tonight me new things, I felt comfortable working with them, it wasn't a hard job for me, the managers were great and made sure I was content"
good,"Worked around my schedule. Pay was too low for what was required. If they want skilled workers and mature people, pay needs to be comparable to other warehouse and stocking companies."
good,I didn’t really like working at Walmart. There were too many people that showed up late and cause me to get off late of go on break late. I did however like the fact that I got a break every 2 hrs
good,I really enjoyed working for Walmart I was the one uploading the truck and bringing the product to the floor. It was a really nice work out as well and kept me in shape
good,Walmart offers great benefits but they have to many changes at the moment that is affecting morale of associates. Quick passed environment previous experience most be a most otherwise you will struggle at the beginning
good,I really enjoyed working here. The empolyee are great people as well. I love how everyone makes everyone feel welcomed. The manage was okay it could of been better but overall they are okay.
good,"12hr shift minimum, frowned upon to work less then 60hrs a week. Training/onboarding through the Academy is very good and detailed. HR is very hands off, but should spend more time inside stores. Not enough focus on customer service as everyone’s too busy tasking."
good,"Fast pace, everyday is racing the clock. Associates are encouraged to build strong relationships which makes departure the hardest. Enjoyed my time there."
good,I like my job at Walmart i like the environment and the people i worked with are great really great i did a small amont of train got a good feel for the place and i never had any trouble with anyone and i wouldn't mind working at Walmart if it was available to me
good,I though I was getting full time but I e lately only been scheduled 3 days or 1 day a week...you have to be working there longer that 90 days to get discount...other than that its okay not to wont be giving what promised for interview
good,Working for Walmart helped enhanced my skills and sharpened my customer service and communication skills.  at my age at the time It was a life lesson experience.
good,Walmart is only for people trying to get their life together. It forces you to learn what your responsibilities and priorities are because it’s not the type of job you can call into or show up late to on a daily basis without any consequence. You’ve got to be motivated to work there; otherwise you won’t last.
good,"It was good, served it's purpose while I was in school. Now I need a job the brings me closer to a job that I can use my college degree with. I want to have a job that I can be financially and makes me happy."
good,"I am constantly having to move around to ensure high customer satisfaction and to do a good job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the co-workers you may have, but that is the same with every job."
good,My typical day at walmart was unloading GM and grocery trucks at the start of the day. This would usually take a couple of hours. The second half of the day would be stocking the merchandise on the sales floor. Shifts would go by pretty quickly.
good,"1.) Ok place to work. "
good,"I wouldn’t recommend people to be a cashier because I had a bad experience my first day because Walmart is so packed and we were short handed staff, but we all did the best we could."
good,"Working overnight  was very  stressful.  You have to finish at a certain time to go to  the  next   department and then help  someone else. Walmart is a good  place, you move up."
good,It was great pay at the time. I don't know what they pay now. I worked over night but it was still busy I had to help in different departments due to it being the holiday season
good,I've been working for Walmart for almost 6 years and honestly I like it. However there is no room to move up or improve and thats exactly what im trying to do.
good,hard work. need to know alot. ok job but it isnt right for everyone. monotonous. work as many dept. as you can to get to know the system and the personnel.
good,"Nothing too difficult, I just found a full time job instead. The hours are the only complaint i had working there since it was difficult to get a full time position."
good,Its an ok company to work for they have benafits 401k and discounts but management is not the best everybody thinks they r a manager plus some costomers r not the best but iys a job
good,"I only worked at Walmart for only a couple of months, and the negatives outweighed the positives. I also rarely saw my boss, so when I needed his help I could never find him."
good,Your experience will only be as good as your store and your leadership team. If you are in a well run store that has good department managers and support managers it can be cool but when you have a tenured staff that is burnt out It can be very rough
good,All depends who your manager is. Encouragement is at all time low. You don’t get enough time to interact with the customer there are always lots of other stuff to do that takes you away from actual customer service and taking the time to build relationships with your customers.
good,Was an ok place. They change the schedule to work way too frequently without what I thought to believe an adequate amount of time to figure out if I could work or not.
good,"Was a good company. Past few years have have changed not for the better. No job security. If your looking for a temporary, part time job this is the company for you."
good,"My experience with Walmart was one of the worst job experiences I have had. I greatly appreciate the opportunity Walmart gave me, Walmart taught me to better my social and work at a good pace. But Walmart did not treat there employees fair."
good,Good fun job job low pay but still has its fun moments good job to learn and grow the customers are very mean sometimes so have to be tolerent of others
good,"The people were fun to work with, it is fast paced depending on wjete you are placed. Between cart attendant and deli associate i was pretty busy. To be honest i perefered cart attendant just because i was outside more."
good,"It was a very fast paced job I feel as though the Pay ($11per hour) isn’t good enough for being a cashier being as though we work the most & deal with all types of costumers ( rude, eager and slow ) in crazy periods of time.( rush and slow pace )"
good,"hours were ok, people there were fun and great to work with. management was all over the place though, never knew who to report to. overall experience and everything was ok."
good,"good place to work of you keep to yourself and just do your job"
good,Overall experience was okay. I've learned how to do work on my own. Not much of a team work environment. Appreciation was rarely shown. Good pay when holidays came around.
good,"It mainly just depends on what department you work in there on how you get treated. They’re a lot of favoritism in certain areas and it shows. Being a cashier is the worst because you get the brunt end of the stick when it comes to customers. The scheduling sucks, a lot of nights when it’s busy and there should be more than one person there isn’t anyone scheduled except one cashier and a csm."
good,"I made a lot of friends with the people i worked with and the customers."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with , love working with the customers, management was less then helpful, only left position because of another employment opportunity"
good,Good paying job.10 hr shifts Tuesday thru Friday.12 hr shift Saturday thru Monday.benefits not so great.opportunity to grow with the company amd you could also transferred to different dc and stores.
good,"Walmart has taught me alot and I was blessed to have gotten the job 8 years ago, but it's time for something new with better pay to make an honest living with my husband."
good,I started working with Wal-Mart in Pembroke Pines. I worked as a cashier and helped other departments with stocking. I transferred to Douglas store and worked as an Overnight Cashier/Stocker until I was terminated.
good,Overall it was a good experience. My only complaint was short staff so few registers open at night with long lines and upset customers. Breaks were late during busy days and hours and some of the front end supervisors were rude.
good,"Routine oriented workplace, fun people to be around, not a ""job security"" type of company. Computer based learning environment, able to learn at your own pace, assistance is available if needed."
good,They just through you into a position and don't follow up with the proper training for the position.  They watch you fail in the position before trying to discipline you for not being able to work the way they want.  Most of the managers don't have any kind of compassion toward the associates. The ones that do have compassion deal with them most
good,"Very straight-forward company where things can shift between being hectic and fast to being somewhat reasonably calm and kept together. The people you work with would likely determine your overall experience in any given company you work for, especially a retail juggernaut like Walmart."
good,"Great job, great pay. Work is individually paced for a production driven company. Not too hard of job to make production but is not a job to take lightly."
good,"People you work with can be OK.! I like the fact you can help anyone, in other Department's. A lot of people take long breaks or lunches..I worked from 6am until 2 or so, Very busy getting things ready for opening at 8. Time goes fast. If you need help forget it.. People hide, or stand around talking while some of us work our butts off..."
good,Walmart is a very big employer. For the size of the company they really should take big steps towards manager employee relations. Other than Walmart is a very nice place to work for a people person.
good,Not a terrible place to work if you only want part time work. That said as a full time job it can be very stressful and you will constantly have to be overlooked for promotion if you don’t become friends with management. But it also depends on what stores you go to because every store runs differently
good,Not the best place to work if want to feel appreciated. I was not impressed by any means whether it be support or leadership. Not the most friendly place to work.
good,It was okay I really enjoyed it. I worked  with alot of people daily. I also carried out other people's jobs just incase they didnt get a chance to finish up.
good,Sometimes they got on my nerves but i never stop going to work they are very respected people a great Environment to work in the job easy it’s not hard
good,Never would follow policy correct. Got in trouble for asking to many questions. Wasn't the best place to work for. Went from cashier to customer service.
good,Walmart is flexible in schedule if you are still in college. Walmart for me is been a good experience. But it is time for me to grow a little more beyond Walmart now.
good,"Most days working at Walmart will start with a general walk through of your department to see what needs to be taken care of; whether it's freight from the night before or house keeping for the day that's been started. Throughout the day there'll be customers that need help with a myriad of problems and honestly, you'll only be able to help with about half of them. A lot of the time you will be expected to take care of your specific department and the 2 or 3 departments neighboring yours, depending on the location you work at and depending on the managers. It will teach you about prioritizing certain tasks over others, and it will teach you a lot about general social interaction if you happen to struggle. Management at the particular Walmart I worked at was, to be honest, pretty abrasive. The manager I worked under was more focused on delegating than helping and were quick to put you down in front of customers. Higher management did try to foster a feeling of belonging to a team, but most of us knew it was just a job that we more or less ended up at. The hardest part of the job was, at least in my case, dealing with the management rather than the customers. The most enjoyable part was actually getting to feel like a customer appreciated your help and that you did something to make their life a little more convenient."
good,Walmart is a big corporation and being part of that is very exciting but not so much the part where you get constantly disrespected by rude customers. It is definitely a place that takes a lot of self-control and patience.
good,Wal Mart would be a better place to work without so many ineffective work policies. It does offer decent pay for those with only a high school education. It also provides you with plenty of customer service experiences.
good,Management is Ok at times but show favouritism toward other employees. Benefit packages offered but hard to get because the cutting of hours monthly within the company as a whole.
good,They give you  2 20 min breaks in 12hr shifts so you running for breaks they don't care about you as a person they just want there job done fast as possible you have to pick at least 90 picks every hour which is sometimes impossible but it's a job
good,I can handle any job handed to me. When they gave me a task I handled it no matter what it was. It wasn’t easy but with a little team work we all pulled it off.
good,"Assistant Manager responsibilities include hiring and training sales associates, monitoring inventory and ordering merchandise based on demand. You will also research competitive products and analyze consumer behavior to ensure our store meets and exceeds client expectations."
good,Poor management will run off even the best employees. At this particular store the failing managers are trying to do twice as much with half as many people and questions when they aren't getting results
good,Every fast paced as well as slow paced depending on the day on how much you would have to unload from within the truck to unload and take out to the floor.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart for the most part. Didnt like working overnight though the night dragged and you would have the craziest people come in but overall i enjoyed it.
good,"Typical day was cashiering, putting back returns to their depts., helping to stock, and zone depts. when people were absent. I would also help open, and close registers thru the shift. Cleaning up the store front end with registers, belts, counters, and trash."
good,"I been with the company for many years and over all it has been an ok experience. My role was to manage inventory, Speak effectively and clearly to other associates/venders, understand and execute proper cleaning methods set forth by strict regulations and guide lines all while ensuring our customers we served with a fast, happy to help environment."
good,When I started the company standards worked in favor of the hard working associates. Over the past 4 years the company has gone into a different mindset creating a stressful work environment.
good,"You get what you apply for. Management has days where they don’t want to do their job, and they act like it’s a problem to come help or do anything for that matter. If you are a fast learner, jump in the water!"
good,Wal-Mart is a solid company with many job opportunities - micro-managing is stressful but comes with all jobs. I liked working for them more than I thought I would have. Store manager is key to your success and longevity.
good,Was a good job  just no hour's to work lookiy for fulltime work good benefits and good pay  and good benefits to have a looking for for future  advancement
good,It's very difficult to balance your life with such varied work hours and a schedule that can change at a moment's notice online where you are not notified verbally but have to check your posted schedule each day.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, the company was comforting and customers were awesome, but it's time for new changes in my life my daughter is getting older and I would like something more advanced in my life."
good,Decent job that's fast paced and has opportunities to learn more for that field of work. There are advancement opportunities as well as management positions if that is the route you wish to go.
good,Literally anyone can advance their career with Walmart. That being said it doesn’t set up the employees around them with the best role models to look up to. Management does NOT care about their employee complaints/concerns or questions. There is no communication between associates or management. Constant change in directions from multiple managers daily.
good,No longer work here.  It was work.  I need a job.  I enjoyed having a job.  I did my job.  I knew working at Walmart would not be a career for me.  I learned a lot.
good,"Need better management and better policies people get sick and have medical problems and need to be excused I got let go for a medical condition I"
good,"nice coworkers, i got along with everyone there. The supervisors were patient but strict and very informative. The customers were always nice as well and patient with me. After all i was learning the store and honestly tried my best to get my objectives done in their timed completion."
good,"Providing standard requirements of workplace law walmart is a decent job, depending on the state laws available to you.Ultimately the company is a run of the mill retail environment to work in."
good,in a typical day i would prep up to 30 stores per day for current years inventory. reaching out to the stores with no assistance to provide information to reconcile disputes for invoices
good,I used to stock the merchandise on the shelves. I had to make sure that there was enough inventory in the back room. Assist customers with their queries.
good,"I’ve worked in customer service for years and this is one of worst places to work. The benefits are alright, and the raise is ridiculous. If you have to work here, then do so. They put me as part time so I don’t get the full benefits, even though I worked full time hours"
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for the most part. I liked the people I worked with and helping customers. The medical insurance and benefits, such as employee stock buying, were good."
good,"Change and poor leadership decisions inhibit great employees from really buying in. I worked for the company for over 5 years , made it to assistant manager and the harder I worked, the more everyone else added to my workload."
good,I was an Cashier at Walmart loved but management treat us employees so badly they cared about their self. Other then that everything else was great all the other cashier treated me with respect.
good,I had good hours and then two moths later they cut my hours in half. When I first started I had 30 plus hours and now I am lucky to get 20 hours a week.
good,"In the summer, it's very hot. In the winter, it's very cold. I was allowed to cross-train into other jobs. There is a high production rate that you have to make in order to keep your job. The work schedule allowed me to have four days off a week."
good,"Training could be improved on,closing staff should be trained and more cooking attention &staff is a must more manageable hands on training communication is very important when peak hours approach abd during"
good,"Worked for this company for 7 years. It wasn't bad for me because I stock n loaded the dairy section over night. Did not have to deal with to much of anything or anyone. I was hired for part-time but did full time hours, downside to that is not receiving any benefits. I'm not to much of a complainer. Just glad I had a job."
good,Walmart was my first retail position. It was a good company to work for but the corporation has minor setbacks that need to be fixed. The management team lacked structure.
good,"Average place to work.pay needs to be a little higher to be competitive.You do get an hour lunch every shift.And you do get a discount card and get 10% off purchases,other than food."
good,Walmart can be a stressful job to work at but hey it's a job to support me and my family and they pay pretty well too. As Wal-Mart says customers come first. Thiers many departments u can work in and if u don't like the department ur working in u can go to a different one. Wal-Mart good like that.
good,Big turnover rate. Hours get cut often. Need better options to be able to move up and stay longer. Need better pay dealing several tasks at customer service.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a good learning experience, getting to meet and help everyday shoppers, putting the customers first and valuing there options."
good,The job was very easy starter job. I made meny friends there. The best thing about Walmart is the people who come in each And every day. My job is just to make the difference.
good,"Poor management that doesn’t care about associates, takes all the credit when work is done properly. Strict vacation policies, understaffed, hostile work environment"
good,I do not always believe they value their employees in the way they should. They need to learn ways in which to retain their employees instead of running them off.
good,"Basic tasks and compensation. It wasn't a demanding job. If you come to work and do the job assigned, there are no problems. I enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,"During my time working at Walmart there were never enough supervisors during heavy money center periods. Sometimes there were long lines for cashing checks especially on Fridays and tax season. I typically filled in for Customer Service for returns and also when lines got long at check out. Fridays were always busiest because of people calling in sick or not showing up. I also saw a lot of preference given to ""favorites""."
good,Customer service/cashier it had its pros and cons for me it was never the customers it was always the management too many tell you what to do that it was no direction of what’s going on  you were getting pulled left and right
good,"This job helped me get through school. I wanted a place where I could work part time during the evenings and this fit that role. My coworkers were very friendly, but most of the day is dealing with the general public."
good,"It's Walmart. Blah, blah, blah. Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy. A diddily, doddily, do, wouldn't you? Merry Christmas and happy new year to all the people who inhabit this earth! Remember to be zero carbon polluter so we don't kill our planet!"
good,It was ok but sometimes stressful. It is always busy and there is a never-ending line and most of the customers are really rude but the good part is everything is really cheap.
good,At first working there was gonna be a blast but after the third month it was starting to switch my mind about working there. The management was alright but they would tell you one thing then say another
good,"Overall good job when transitioning."
good,It could have been hectic at times with poor management but also ran smoothly depending on who was on our team at that time. I was hired for seasonal help and it could have been ran a little better
good,"Walmart truly believes in the advancement and betterment of its employees. By offering higher positions to those already under their employment, giving very affordable college courses, and employee discounts Walmart shows their altruistic mission through these options."
good,"Fast paced work environment, however love interaction with people and the opportunity to work in different departments when short handed and helping my fellow employees."
good,"I worked in the auto garage at a supercenter in Florida. A typical workday for us was fairly busy and you needed to stay focused on tasks."
good,"Nice company to work for. Ability to move up and do well if you are a motivated employee. Must be able to multi task and help customers. Must be on time,"
good,"If overtime is what you seek, look elsewhere. The corporate culture at Walmart seeks to prevent overtime at all costs. On the occasion that I did stay late to help a supervisor, it would be suggested by a manager that I take a long lunch to get back that time. I was lucky that my supervisor looked out for me to ensure I received that overtime pay."
good,Great job if all you want is a check. Management is very fair and respectful. Team work is instilled into the employees so that everything can be run smoothly.
good,jobs are very compartmentalized and you are mostly doing tasks as long as you are not a cashier. managers can be a downer sometimes especially ones that are not directly over you.
good,"Workdays are usually busy, especially around holidays and the first of the month, but besides that wasn't too horrible stress-wise. Management was good on most days, but on others didn't always seem to have their priorities straight."
good,I loved working at Walmart I loved working with customers and seeing all different kinds of new people and making Shopping easier For shoppers Everyone is pretty much friendly and nice organized
good,I liked moving around it was always busy kept me occupied always something to do I enjoyed unloading a lot and the overnight stocking the people there are great
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't anything more than it was. You push carts for all day and sweat underneath the burning sun, i wouldn't really recommend anyone work here unless you have to."
good,"As a customer experience associate, I dabbled in many jobs in the store.  I didn't feel that any of these positions kept me engaged and made me want to keep working."
good,great experience workin for Walmart if they would just pay more and have more possibilities of advancement or job transfers to different department or job title.
good,I have been working for this company for almost 3 years . They are flexible with schedules as long as you have input the correct time you are available to work.
good,Good job very good place to had fun would love to go back and go up the ranck love.the.people their.the.manager.employees and.customers and like the.pay.
good,"You must  stand for your whole shift...you are pointed for being late whether it  is 10 minutes or 1 hour and if you miss a day, 4 points and you are out. They do not take doctors excuses."
good,"I enjoyed doing my best. I would go the extra mile to make our customers happy. If I made 1 persons day a little better, it made me feel I did my best."
good,I love the atmosphere but the managers tend to have there certain favorites and new managers come in with huge egos trying to show off but the customers were cool the job was cool and u fo get some extra benefits when your at a safe store but for a job it was a good job
good,"My days off were through the week"
good,"bon employeur ,un des premiers a prendre le cote jeunesse ,tres proche des associes,"
good,"Management was horrible and there were only a couple decent managers, most had a superiority complex. I loved my job and coworkers, but the managers were incompetent and rude."
good,Weekend shift is only 33 every week 66 every two weeks  it’s hard to get over time because you have to give other people a chance to get some shipping will kill your body and mainly your back
good,"Son una mafia tal cual  nunca subes de puesto todos los jefes tienen desde la apertura con su puesto de jefes y nunca los cambian de tienda solo de departamento uno como asociado jamas subes de puesto"
good,It was a good job. I was only there for about 8 months. I don't think a lot of people know how hard you have to work when you have a Manager constantly over your shoulder.
good,"Stock goals are high and needs to be reevaluated"
good,"It really comes down to the store you work at, though several tasks and responsibilities are the same across the different stores, some stores are better run than others."
good,Nice first job to work. Worked as a cashier for about 3 months and it was a good experience. The hours that were available were pretty decent for my schedule
good,I love the people who work here. its never a dull day and your work days go by pretty face. walmart is a great place to work and id recommend it to anyone.
good,"I been working at walmart for almost 5 years.  I been doing stocking for frozen or dry goods.. If the manager gave me some assignments, without hesitation and I will do it as fast as I can."
good,"Great opportunity to gain experience. But very hard work. I've never felt like I needed a gym membership while working here. The job is so fast paced, it's already a work out. As long as you're moving, they're happy. Until they want you in more than one place at the same time."
good,When I worked here it was fun. The people were great and management were decent. The customers weren’t the best sometimes but it was good most of the time.
good,"The only flaw I had with Walmart is the management, I had my schedule messed up because every Walmart employee has to take a graduation exam one month after they start and if you fail it three times you're fired. So my manager didn't schedule me until I took the exam, passed on my first try and didn't schedule me. I repeatedly asked her to put me down and to give me a weekend off three weeks in advance for college. She refused to do either. I had to turn in my two weeks for if I missed this weekend I would have spent thousands of dollars for nothing. Also in the three month probation period of new hires, no show means fired. I enjoyed everything else about the company however."
good,Great company to work for. Learned essential day to day tasks. Working with the public helped me grow as an individual! Walmart was great for giving back to their community.
good,Overall a good place to work very fast paced.. Management could be a little bit better and understanding.They should be able to take doctors notes if you are out.
good,Hard work fast paced work environment. You Work 12 hour shifts with one 30 min break then a 15 minute break if we wasn't busy. The management is poor. The employees were great people.
good,Working at Walmart is not to hard once you learn what to do. The task you perform are not hard and they do provide some training for the more involved tasks. It only gets stressful when you try to work too hard and not at your own pace.
good,We have to take care of the customers and make sure they are being catered to. I have learnt so much about how to tackle with difficult situations and realised that you being yourself is your biggest strength.
good,"the management was okay, never really saw any around. Fellow coworkers were nice. Hardest part of the day was unloading the merchandise trucks in the heat, since there were no air conditions."
good,"Walmarts are not all bad but it is a to many chiefs and only a few indians. The chance you will like it is very good, my problem was the truth was not being told."
good,learned customers services and that the cutomers are always right it is a graet place to meet new people and also learn all things value walmart is a awsome start in life
good,I learn to memorize more fast and be more faster and sloving problems and helping the customers keeping clean the area always been king to the customers
good,"retail is a good beginger job, jus have to reword everything so that it nakes yiu look better, like working in the backroom is basialcllyl losgestics."
good,"Decent work for someone first looking for an actual job. Though if you work at the Simi valley one on cochran and have someone named paul working there at the same time as you, expect to be the only one doing things because he will disappear for over and hour when not on break or lunch, come back, then do it again. And never gets in trouble. But if you sit down because of your back hurting you'll get in trouble"
good,It's good for someone to learn how to deal with people and build a career with a company that has wide locations lots and the availability to purchase stock.
good,"Overall Walmart has treated me with respect I truly can say it is very work friendly safe and fair pay! Safety is our number one goal!"
good,"I worked at Walmart for 4 years I loved my co workers but the management team was in and out horrible, The hardest part of the day was dealing with rude people who tried to get what they wanted."
good,Very high paced environment with constant replenishment needs for the sales floor. Can lead to some stressful situations and feeling like you can’t complete tasks on time.
good,I honestly did not like this job the managers were horrible and the schedule is not flexible at all and it was just horrible I would not recommend this job to anyone else
good,"Love the job. Fast paced, always busy. To many changes. Always restructuring unsure of your position on a daily basis. Moved up quickly only to walk on eggshells everyday."
good,Some staff were good to work with. Made a few friendships. Some management were better than others. I felt it was kind of like being in highschool again. Staff had their favorites.
good,not having any body help you with a large task to do because they thank that one person can do the task of five or more people to do expect you to be able to do it
good,Everybody thinks it’s a good job to work here  just wait until you go in there and you see it all. That’s what gets everyone lol..it’s just a lot of stress and all. You’ll see for yourself
good,My job at Wal-Mart was good. The hours were good they offer good benefits you get to earn pto after 6 months they give you also earn protective pto in case you have to take  time off if you're sick or a family member is sick.
good,"Sometimes the stores are decent so the employees are treated ok, but most are treated like dirt as company policy makes it so if a customer yells at you you have to take it in the face with a smile. Not the best place to work at if you don't have a hang of dealing with people or have anxiety issues."
good,Management needs to communicate more with floor staff. They do not pay compliments for work done on a daily basis. Some employees are never given a chance to attend meetings regularly. I worked in Lynhaven Supercenter and  the staff there feels like family. Human Resources personnel's job at Swansboro was just taken. She had to go to another Store. Lori cared about us.
good,It’s a decent place to work if your looking for a easy job everyone is equal in the stores and the pay is decent not the best but not the worst the managers could be better
good,Other than store management flipping every year or so the job wasn't an overall waste of time. There was room for growth in the company and about as good a chance someone could probably get being its neighborhood Wal-Mart.
good,Need better csm and they might keep employees and the store was never on the same page and the store was never cleaned right I did the best I could with what I had to work with
good,Walmart was a good learning experience. As a cashier and customer service associate I enjoyed meeting customers and helping them. The company provided computer based training and had Front End managers and supervisors. The most difficult part of the job for me was standing on hard floors for the whole shift.
good,This is a great job for teenagers. It depends on the day it could be a fast pasted job or slowed pasted it’s a good company just not really good at scheduling.
good,To stressful to work in retail especially in Walmart some pharmacists they don’t know about insurances how has to be submitted to the exact insurance they all depend on the Technician
good,It’s an ok company to work for if you need a job fast. Management has no concept of how long it takes to complete tasks in a timely manor. They hire anyone and everyone. Those who never show for work get no disciplinary actions where as the ones who work extremely hard get threatened to be fired on a regular basis
good,Walmart is a good place to work. Its normally high paced. Not bad pay or management. It can be stressful sometimes but you can always work through it.
good,"Management used me and lead me on with various positions, having me perform tasks without the increased pay. Making me slowly hate my job. They changed policies and were very inconsistent frequently."
good,The Walmart warehouse that I worked for was just a place where you came in did your one job for the whole day and left. There was nothing special about it and was not group orientated at all. You’d have to hit hourly numbers and insure quality work. Most jobs consistent of moving boxes onto a pallet or opening boxes and checking if there was the right amount of items. I just didn’t see it has the right fit for me.
good,"The culture depends on the store.  If they go by the process from the top down there it can be great. However, get one that doesn't want to then it can be a struggle."
good,I usually close the deli which consists of a lot of cleaning and helping customers. If it is busy we could be there late and Walmart dose not like overtime.
good,"It was a fun environment to work in, great discounts, friendly coworkers and flexible hours. They also pay good but it does get really hectic sometimes."
good,"It was an easy going time while i was employed by walmart, i was busy but it never felt like it, the jobs are rational and the pay was okay, needless to say it's not a bad job."
good,"if i have any complaints it is the fact that my hours were all over the place, and that i was not a full time associate. I wanted to work more hours or to have a set schedule but it was not stable."
good,Different associates have different experiences. Can be a positive working environment at times. Frequent corporate changes and varying leadership principles can make it challenging.
good,"Pharmacy work was interesting, days went fast, and I loved my customers.  The pharmacist was not easy to work for and all mistakes were not her fault, they fell on you."
good,The first job I had for 2 years and loved it. The environment was warm and inviting. I enjoyed my time here. Co-workers and managers were always helpful and understanding.
good,The employees always had something going on with each other. The work was heavy and supervisors didn't off to get you help when there was so much to be stocked and also assisting customers when needed.
good,Very fast paced and physically demanding job but it is not a mentally challenging job. I enjoy working on Cap 2 because it seens like the time flies because you have so much freight each day.
good,I tried and tried for years to advance in this job someone was always putting my performance down no matter how hard I worked they would make stuff up about me that wasn’t true I talked to management several times about the treatment and nothing was done about it the same person is still there doing the same stuff to other employees.
good,It is good working there if the higher ups know what they are doing amd everyone communicates better. I like working there but to many people telling you to do to many things at once
good,I do not recommend walmart as a career choice in the automotive industry. I do recommend to use this as a stepping to show tou have experience in the field of automotive.
good,"at first it was the best Job ever! untill they put me as Dept manager told the manger if this dosent work you puting back as maintenance he said yes,WRONG! the put me in the back as instock.ever since i havent been back as maintenance i havent been okay about it.Had no chose to stay nothing in a small town."
good,It’s a fair and decent job. The pay is good but the management could be much better. Communication is awful among salaries to hourly. It’s a stressful job at times.
good,Es una empresa estable pro no te dan chance a progresar
good,Helping all Walmart Associates understand their Health and Wellness Benefits. We assisted associates with open enrollment of benefits and also with qualified family status changes and data entry and customer service
good,"I learned a lot there. moved up from cashier to service desk quickly, but then I felt stuck with no where to move up. people I worked with was great. It did have some big down falls."
good,Working at Walmart was a very good experience for me it showed me alot more about how to interact with the customer than any other job that I've worked at has. A working day for me was always so much to look forward to at Walmart.
good,I stayed at Walmart because my boss was amazing. The pay was good bit the work life balance was terrible. Retail is very selfish. This year will be the first time I will have Thanksgiving with my family in many years. I barely got time off and the hours were so inconsistent.
good,"Walmart is definitely a job adventure.you will meet all walks of life,as well as there is room for career growth.walmart is what you make of it,pretty much"
good,Left bc of poor management in the defiance store. Hear it's gotten a lot worse. They have no problem scheduling you to work two weeks in a row.  Manager bullied me and was rude and store manager did nothing but talk to her when she's done it to previous empoyees. She needed fired.
good,I didn't get enough support from my fellow associates for a really big part of the company. The future is ecommerce here and everyone was too worried about the customer in the store instead of the customers that already paid for items and picked a time to come and get them.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work depending on the manager you working under. Yes they have their picks of favorite employees. If they like you, you got the best schedule, all the hours you wanted. Any days off you wanted."
good,"I was there for a number of years, and i liked my job, it paid alright, not quite enough, but it was decent work for sure, i appreciated it and i miss it sometimes"
good,"Working this job was very easy. As long as you come to work, do your job, and follow all of the rules things will run smoothly for you. I recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Irs a good job for most, but not a career for all. You can advance quickly with hard work and keeping your hours flexible. Beung able to work as a team is essential and i have had an ok experience with Walmart."
good,"Greet guest."
good,A lot of favoritism at the store I worked for not flexible with the schedule for people in school would work you from 11 or 12 pm and wanted me back at 6 or 7 am the next day it was hard
good,"Be prepared to not know what your doing the first couple weeks. When you First get hired you start realizing how unprofessional it really is. It can be fun some days if your cool with managers but other create drama, spread rumors and act like they know everything. Some try too hard and act like this is a high end store and others are laid back and realize that the store is a mess."
good,"I found this company okay to work for. I am however, upset by and disappointed with the management and way they handle their employees. The other employees are fantastic to work with, but the management is sloppy, uncoordinated, and not understanding of personal issues that happen to come up."
good,"Extremely fast paced environment, and job expectations are a bit unrealistic, at best. Hardest part of job is getting everything you want to get accomplished, finished. Most enjoyable part of job is being busy ALL of the time! The time passes by so quickly."
good,Its okay working at walmart for starters. Good for teenagers and young adults to work as a stocked. A lot of lifting heavy boxes. But they do not pay enough for what you do as Cap 2/stocker
good,Shifts could get very busy but the management and other team workers do help a lot. Not a bad 1st job or long career choice with this job. Hope I helped.
good,empresa buena para trabajar es recomendable al 100%
good,Fast pace environment.Expected to meet your numbers daily even if there is not enough work.you get 2 15 minute breaks if you work the week days.Overall experience tho was a 3 out of 5
good,You’re hours throughout the year are so inconsistent that it’s annoying. I’ve gotten as low as 20 hrs a week before. Their “point system” makes me feel like I’m still in elementary school. And they are way to strict about everything.
good,"Fast paced environment, hard work, repetitive motion, problem solving kind of job. Customer's are sometimes crazy. The store manager wasn't very cooperative."
good,"Employees work their butts off!!! Go home exhausted everyday. Very fast paced. Hard working , lifting, unloading freight in a timely manner and be safety minded."
good,"Pays above minimum wage, paid time off, works with your personal schedule. Not too bad depending on management, or if you actually like customer service."
good,Great place to work at is your real people person you're learning lie and you'll probably be a lot of different colorful characters but it's kind of stressful at the same time cuz they get that could get busy real fast and you could be stuck out there by yourself
good,it was a fun workplace. i had good friends and very respectable co workers but the deli was quite understaffed and they needed more workers because usually only one person would be working the deli at a time
good,Allows for easy advancement and training through an academy program that gives associate a way to interact with a store while training and learning in a group environment.
good,"I worked in three departments starting with HBC and Cosmetics, Pharmacy and then to Vision Center. I learned all about retail in those 5yrs. I was even loan out to work in other departments when needed."
good,Walmart culture has gone down the drain. It went from a caring employee to you are just a number. Management quality has gone down with all leadership.
good,"It is an easy fast pace job that can be good for someone fresh out of high school. The pay isnt bad, the benefits are pretty good, and the hours are good depending on what store and ehat position you work at."
good,"a typical day at walmart, was never on the floor cause i was always in the back unloading the product for the floor. we never do OT cause it was not allowed"
good,i have nothing bad to say about Walmart great company fun place to work but again like i said its Walmart so you cant expect a lot. i knew people that worked there for over 20 years and other that didn't like it and quit within a week of being there.
good,I loved workin at Walmart the people there make u feel like family to them there is always help if needed I think it was my best decision until my personal injury!(NOT WORK RELATED)
good,Being a deli associate was hard work but as long as it was not understaffed it was not bad. Walmart offers many benefits like a 401k which is good to get into if you plan on being a long term associate
good,Working for Wal-Mart was an awesome experience for me. I was able to learn something about myself. Wal-Mart is an excellent way on public speaking skills.
good,"I always had something to do, I kept busy whenever I was on the job. I learned how to use a cash register and scale out fresh produce. I may need help to refresh my memory in that area again. Overall I enjoyed working for walmart"
good,Overall working at Walmart was pretty good. We got paid $11 an hour. My complaints are the managers. They made the new hires do their jobs and expected them to stay overtime to get it done. If you didn’t stay overtime then they would frown upon it even though you do great at doing your assigned job. They made slick remarks but said them in a “nice” voice to hide how offensive it was. I ended up quitting after 6 months because I was having pregnancy problems and my doctor suggested that I got a sit down job. They don’t have sit down jobs so I asked for maternity leave but declined it because I didn’t work $40+ hours. I was confused on how they expected a 8month pregnant woman to work 40+ hours a week. I ended up having to quit because I couldn’t walk regularly because of my hips. I moved back
good,"managers didn't really listen there was favoritism. supervisers let the position get to their heads, weren't really helpful especially to new people.."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The co-workers were friendly, the management were nice and helpful. I feel that Walmart's pay is very good.  I think they have very good benefits."
good,Not a bad place to work just very faced paced. Customers are rude sometimes. The employees are very helpful and friendly. Management is okay. Easy to learn responsibilities and good job skills.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for, benefits everything, but not supportive, not really holding down on there words they will inform us, tell us about our bonus, an cut our hours."
good,"walmart is a good job, great people,great service, you do alot while working there but it all comes natural if you are a cashier  the best thing i can tell you is memorize the codes for furits and veggies"
good,"I enjoy working with the public, and a lot of my co-workers, I didn't get along with a lot of the management team. The store was always busy, and you could get some really nasty customers."
good,busy warehouse repeditive actions strict amount of time to complete each trip assigned times are hard to reach unless you are running most of the time.
good,The employees makes it a nice place to work but the management staff was sometimes difficult.Would recommend it as a last resort. Walmart has changed so much since 2004.
good,Great benefits and team chemistry.  High turnover rate for new hires. Managers recognize employees for outstanding work.  Team building events throughout the year.
good,"Had 2 15 minute breaks, with a lunch depending on hours worked that day"
good,"Decent job, only bad thing about it was how some management treated you with disrespect. Other than that I made good friends there, but instead of trying to move me into a different position that I might have been good at, they just went ahead and fired me."
good,was a good place to work if they paid fairly.  I worked overnight stocking/ Inventory management. I was there a while and was passed up on promotions and raises
good,"Decent place to work but when management changed, the environment change for the worse. Good pay, great co-workers but work most holidays. Can't take days off around major holidays."
good,"Overall Walmart offers a geat opportunity for advancement and job sercurity, benefits are good as well. I dont believe that there is proper work/home life balance once you advance with the company."
good,I learned many skills at Walmart. From changing oil and tires to using a walkie stacker device to move pallets of freight. My coworkers were very friendly and Management provided much room for advancement.
good,I mean you can wear whatever you want and they allow you to show your tattoos so that's awesome. They work with your availability and are pretty chill.
good,"I love what I do  it's  too much stress and not enough help for what we as managers has to do every day. We  have tasks we have to do everyday. Price changes pulling freight merchandising,  customer  service,"
good,"I am overweight and was struggling to stand for my whole shift but was not allowed to sit unless I had a doctors note which at the time I didn't have a primary care physician. They have a strict schedule so if an emergency comes up you may not be able to get off the hook. If you have an appointment, they can choose whether or not to accept the doctors note."
good,It was really 50/50 there. I had a great closing crew and I love helping catch thieves. I have no fear.lol but bad management again. I don't understand cause it could be fun there a lot.
good,Great company loved it but I was pulling to much weight trying to move up in the company kept getting over looked stayed for a year was never made full-time
good,More communation in the store and treat employees better when asked to do stuff more staffed and better schedling.  And more meetings with the staff..
good,Walmart is a great company to work for its all about the management you uave some that care and some that can care less..If you have great management team you have great associates
good,"Working there can be very competitive but its not the worse job. there wasn't enough people to work with and it could be rough. but I learn how to use a pallot jack, cap bins, use the bail, clear out the bail, and stock. it can be friendly sometime but it can be a competition but it could be fun too. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you talk to the employees. they have different personality and it help you to kindly talk to the customers with even better manners."
good,Great job but working outside is a killer but if your inside working as a cashier or stocker or unloader in the back its a great place to work i love my job just not the heat
good,"Its okay. It walmart.. What you are expecting is exactly what it is people come and go, do what they want. There are some good managers there but its really unorganized at times."
good,Fast paced work place. good entry level job. low pay for what they what you do. they do thing i would not approve of in the work place. some of the thing you herd about wal mart are true.
good,Not a bad job I just think I was in the wrong Walmart. It was very packed all the time associates were horrible. Attitudes were on 100 all the time and customers were even worse sadly
good,This is a great company to work for if you are retirement from something else but not for me. I need to make a little more money to take care of my house. Now I would love to tell others people that Walmart is a great place to work.
good,"Walmart would be a decent place to work if their evaluations meant something. While constantly getting 'exceeds expectations' on all categories in my evaluations, I never once got a raise. All of the raises I received were because of the company raising it's minimum pay. Their constant policy changes make working there for an extended period of time awful."
good,It's a good place to start up your job search good place to get a good career if you focus on me and decide that's the thing you want great summer job
good,I would give this job a good temporary job while in school or part-time not a good long term job.  I would recommend a friend to work there i think my local wal-mart was less organized and up to date compared to other Wal_marts in the nation
good,The job is okay. But you must have patience because it only takes one customer to come through and ruin your whole day! I wouldn’t recommend working here for the rest of your life.
good,Walmart was a great customer service job it help build your character. It also put you in a al lot of situations that you had to react on by yourself. It will also help you become quick on your toes.
good,I always thought working at Walmart was going to be a very relaxed work environment. But it is not. It is so stressful and they do not pay you enough. I was a department manager making 12.50 and the new hires were getting paid 11. I was doing double work for almost the same pay as them
good,I am not comfortable about giving a lot of details about another work place. All questions can be  answered through HR. Sorry Walmart was good.........
good,"I loved what i did there for some time but it got old and to the point where i was literally breaking my back. i started to experience back pain towards the end which is one of the reasons why i quit. The associates are generally very friendly but the majority of the management did not do their jobs and expected way too much out of everyone and weren't helping us get what we needed. For example, the conveyor belt had been broken in a few places which made it much more difficult for me to do my job, and they didn't place a work order right away. Atleast a month had gone without anything being done, and as far as i'm aware nothing has yet to be done about it. Their lack of care/respect for associates is a big issue."
good,"My time at Walmart started out as a cashier for a month which I learned to function a new model of cash register that my previous job didn't have. After that I moved into a gas station associated where I learned how to function pumps and clean up gas spills. After about 4 months I went into being a customer service manager where I learned to do audits, money orders, money grams, and bill pay. Over all my experiencewas great but the only problem was the flexability after the changes and the changes in my life I felt like I could give the time I needed for my family and work here."
good,"I have had a good experience a"
good,"Really strict on points and don’t pay enough but they give you food a lot. They’re nice and a lot of nice people work there, and you can move up easily."
good,Waxed and buffed floors clean restrooms scrub floor clean spills help stock if needed we would lay 7 coats of wax in a 8hr time frame help customers help unload truck if needed to pull pallets stock freight if need help
good,My experience at Walmart was temporary. They were flexible about your schedule as well as breaks and lunches. I was a minor working there so they were very strict on how many hours we could work. It was a good job where you communicate and see a lot of faces everyday.
good,I truly enjoyed working with and getting to know my pharmacy family. They allowed me to be myself and even worked with me on the schedule when i decided to sign up to be a full time student.
good,"Maintained up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments, returns and exchanges. Prevented store losses using awareness, attention to detail and integrity. Created new processes and systems for increasing customer service satisfaction. Worked as a team member performing cashier duties, product assistance, and cleaning. Set up assemblies or reviewed all work followed sales orders and customer requirements. Stocking, unloading merchandise. Assist customers with questions and concerns which they needed on merchandise. Count register at closing. Maintaining safe and clean work areas. Pricing merchandise, assemble furniture, business promoting and brainstorming"
good,"A good place to start if your a student or elderly looking to supplement their income. Moving up in the company can be a little difficult, you realy need to stay focused and jump at anything that comes along."
good,Walmart distribution is a great place to work if you want to work at 3:12 shift lots of free time to live your life after you've earned your pay. They started me at $19.80 an hour!
good,They don't care about their employees. one day you work for them and if you get injured they will quickly replace you like your nothing. if your desperate and really need a job I still don't recommend working here. For the amount of work you do the pay is horrible.
good,"The pay is good, however you work for it. Treat staff decent enough, but most of the time people will refuse too help you in favor of making sure they look good"
good,"I loved my job in the Pharmacy at Walmart."
good,Walmart is a job for hard working people that don’t have kids and need short term disability.The machine picks the hours for you And that’s not good I used to do double.I didn’t have time for my kidscause I worked so much
good,"Stocking and unloading, all in a days work."
good,the corporate off needs to allow the managers to do there jobs . and stop trying to leave scheduling to a computer  they've even left the firing of it;s Employes to the computer.   5 points attendance policy.
good,A great place to work and advance in your specific department. Can become stressful at times due to staffing conflict. It can be difficult to get time off.
good,"Some of the managers really care about the employees while some are just there to be there. I connected with a lot of the managers but didn't get along with some as well. Overall, I recommend working there to get some experience and you can definitely make a living by raising up in the company."
good,Great work. But not for older people who can’t continuously lift 50+ pounds repeatedly for 8 hours. It needs to be more half and half. Half picking and half packing.
good,Ok job for the pay management could be better always under staff ok place to work. Management sometimes plays favorites with some people and treats them better.
good,That Wal-Mart I worked for dont care what you know it's who you know. And it sucked for those who worked hard and got nothing in return and those new ones who had some one hire up in home office gets a higher position not cool
good,"As a cashier position register cash, scanning grocery items and others merchandise , put grocery items in the bags and also help customers the items where stock"
good,It was a good job just didn’t pay enough. For one person income to live off of when having a child as well. Had to go somewhere that paid more to support my self as well as my son.
good,I dislike working at Walmart. They hire more people than hours they have. They pick and choose who they like from day one. They have cliques and if you aren’t in it it’s difficukt to work there
good,"Looking forward to to work with some more jobs.Open to anything and I'm a fast learner."
good,"For me, while the company itself is not bad to work for, it really comes down to how each store is managed. The store I work at has some severe organization issues, as well as a lack of communication and incentive."
good,"This job is very demanding, as a cashier as you are always pushed to sell their MC , and or collect donations. I have made some great friends there , staff & customers . It is hard o. Your body after a while and . The Bonuses and benefits are great ."
good,"I worked as a cashier as a seasonal employee. I enjoyed working at Walmart, but I was unable to use the skills I had from a previous job. I was disappointed. They did not tell me I was being let go. They just stopped putting me on the schedule."
good,"Lo que más destaco es la buena relación con los compañeros, lo que menos me gustó son los jefes que en algunos casos no están bien capacitados. Otro punto en contra es que debes realizar varias labores al mismo tiempo, reponer, contestar radio, hacer devoluciones, etc. Además no es seguro quedar, hacen contrato a 3 meses, después 3 meses mas y sin aviso te despiden, avisan un día antes que termine el contrato con una carta que llega al domicilio (si es que, a veces te enteras allá)."
good,It was pleasant to work at Walmart.  Best part of my job was the ability to meat new people and help out when they needed me to translate to Spanish speaking customers
good,"could use improvement, more morale boost, hours were fine but they dint  work my schedule out , machine build schedule mess up others employ schedule, no agreement in schedule"
good,Hot days in summer make working very hard but pay is good. Management is  sometimes fair and employees are always  busy in a very fast paced huge warehouse.
good,"They work with your schedule for those of us that were still in school, and that was the major issue I had with other places.  On the other hand, the biggest issue with working there was the people.  Managers that would contradict each other, workers who were lazy and actively try to avoid work or even make it harder on others."
good,Great place to get job experience good starting point to get your life going very nice people to be around you feel very welcomed very easy going and relaxed.
good,"I was excited to work there at first, but less so as time went on! I enjoyed working with the customers, but if I needed help such as a price check, or have a question, it took the CSM's quite awhile to get to me, mostly on the night shifts!"
good,Stocking can be fun and boring just get through it by help people find what they need and take them to that item. When stocking face the item as you go.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was if I could help someone and make their day by finding what they were looking for. I would go above and beyond to help.
good,"Your typical day will be face paced and competitive, you'll meet a lot of different people, one's that work there and one's that come in, a lot of problem solving skills."
good,it's a good slack job not to hard not to easy. only problem was the workers sucked.
good,I really enjoyed working with all of the other walmart employees but my time there was cut short due to a car accident I was involved in leaving me in able to reach my job for several days. This was really disappointing because I work very hard for them and was let go due to unforeseen circumstances during a road trip.
good,It's a good job I'd definitely apply at Walmart ! I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to get paid and be at job for a long period some people have been there for years and enjoy still working there
good,"If it wasn't for the associates the company would not be fun. Typical day at walmart is never the same. Always something new to learn, Hardest part of the job was not having enough employees on busy day's."
good,Good place to work. If you are reliable you have job security. Work schedule is flexible if needed. Advancement opportunities are plentiful. Pay is with in expected range for your area.
good,Walmart is a good company with great  benefits. Walmart has great opportunities for management positions. Walmart values diversity & abides by their non discrimination policy. Walmart offers many different positions to best fit the desire of the individual.
good,"I had been in several different positions within Wal-Mart, and have enjoyed several of them. The positions kept me busy and working hard, but it was incredibly difficult to do your job when there is no one to back you up or promote a positive work environment. Management was the biggest I had at each of my store they do not communicate and tend not to work together. It became extremely flustering as an employee."
good,"working as a cashier allowed me to interact with different people and ethnicities, I like to talk to people and I like helping them find what there looking for."
good,"great,  I worked for 7 years and only made 11.80 per hour.  I could not afford healthcare or 401k.   Sometimes promotion opportunities were given to younger employees.  Supervisor took a long time to respond to me and customers at times and I did not always have adequate materials needed to perform job tasks.   The positive aspects of my job were meeting people from all races and status in life.  I speak some Spanish and used it daily at work."
good,Integrity issues with this company. We were advised we were cleaning up AP and then we would be shifted over to HR. Well instead they just cut our job and sent it over to India and laid off 600 ppl in the Charlotte office. No option of moving to HR at all
good,This is a good company to work for. They do treat you fairly most of the time. They have good benefits and discounts. Most of the people are easy to get along with.
good,"Many people quit the day I quit. Do to poor management. There were actually some good things about Walmart, but I would not recommend working there if there are other options."
good,Productive and help develop my self confidence. I found a family and good friendship with my coworker. I met customers that treat me well and like a friend also.
good,"I only worked at Walmart for a few months and I didn’t mind working there, I did my best as a stocker/sales associate. The flexible hours and training were good so far and the staffing was good."
good,"The Job was great, work was relative for the season, but HR was making the schedule and was giving me 4 hour shifts to fill out my hours(for reference i lived 30 mins. away so the drive was not worth the 4 hours) and when i asked her not to give me 4 hour shifts she brushed me off."
good,"I've worked for the same store for almost four years under various management, largely in the same role. Expectations are at times unrealistic. Management can also be rude. Pay is fine for the most part though the cap 2 does a large portion of the work in the store for the lowest pay. Turnover rate for the cap2 team is above 100% company wide. It's a fine place to work at for a while but I'm not sure how viable a career is."
good,"it was fine working there, they accommodated family responsibilities, were able to change the shifts i needed changed and the people i worked with were friendly"
good,they kept moving me around to different departments despite hiring me for a specific one and the training was minimal.                  .                 .
good,I learned a lot at this company when it comes to how managers treat their employees. I was shocked at some of the things I witnessed and went through there. If managers like you then you get all the good shifts and if they don't then you are cut out of a lot of hours. The hardest part of the job was witnessing all of the favoritism and BS there. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the cool people I met there and meeting some interesting customers along the way. Management there is a joke. The rules are not the same for everyone.
good,"nobody likes to do their jobs so they all hide in the bathrooms. no one can be bothered to report broken forklifts, which can cause MAJOR accidents due to issues such as malfunctioning emergency stop button."
good,Overall its not stressful okay to work but they start you out with good hours and cut them and move them around all the time nothing is set I've been here over 6 months and they bring in outsiders to make managers not promote within
good,It's a very fast pace job and they are always super busy. The customers get upset fast because they are not staff to take care of the customers needs.
good,I don't like the fact that people there don't pay you for your job but how they know you very unbalanced company wouldn't work there ever again is that says anything
good,"It was a good learning experience- learned finances, retail, customer service. Walmart was a good stepping stone towards the business world. My attendance as a former Walmart cashier taught me respect for property and selflessly serving any customer and to exceed in customer satisfaction."
good,I work for the Walmart on Aramingo the over night managers have bad attitudes think they better than everybody and some csms as well cashiers put up with the most dealing with rude costumers  but we get overlooked
good,"Walmart is a very laid back job, they really don’t ask for to much. Some managers aren’t the nicest but we have to deal with it. Walmart isn’t somewhere i want to be anymore because of how much they pay a hour."
good,"Typical mundane job,  decent wage ok benefits after awhile. Nothing special,  the crew works well and does their best to manage never really encountered managers other than my immediate."
good,"Working at Walmart is great for employers who are attending school, because they are very flexible with working hours. The best part of the job is meeting new people everyday. Sometimes you meet great people and sometimes you meet people that are not so nice. You will definitely learn patients if you don't have it already."
good,el sueldo es bajo comparado con otros del mismo giro
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work, but it’s stressful. The company is trying really hard to compete with all of the online businesses, which is fine, but it puts a lot of pressure on salaried members of management to perform."
good,I gained knowledge of stocking and blocking throughout a store. I also gained further knowledge of customer service and how to direct customers to what they needed in a timely manner.
good,it is a fast paced environment with good benefits and pay and are fair with hours to its employees with sick and personnel time off when it is needed to be taken at a moments notice
good,as long as you did your job with a sense of urgency and didnt play around you would be fine. they teach you everything you need to know about the process and forklifts
good,Walmart was ok just couldnt do overtime and they like to cut hours. I have 3 kids need all the hours i could get so had to find something new. But othe than that wasnt a bad place gave time off if needed. Helped when needed and was good support. Had alot of fun out there.
good,Since leaving WalMart 3 years ago I have maybe walked into the store 7 times. After working for this company I have zero interest in supporting this company by being a patron. You are required to work long hours with very little help or direction from managers.
good,It was a fun job some times but after so long you just don’t like the people that work there anymore but I just don’t like the Managers they can be very
good,"I worked in the Online Grocery Department as entry level associate. There are maybe a handful of worthwhile associates and maybe two or so decent managers. The company does not hold bad employees accountable and it pushes away good employees. Managers generally have no idea what their doing and it creates a generally negative work environment. Even if you do have a good manager in a department, the rest of the departments do NOT have good managers and will create problems for the rest of the store to deal with. It’s okay pay, and if you’re a good employee there is opportunity for advancement. I wouldn’t recommend unless desperate."
good,My crew and I constantly had to assist other departments and take our time from our assignments. But the pay was good just that the price to live was too high for the price we got paid. A mandatory pay raise was given in the stead of the bi yearly/yearly raise. In short no one got a raise they deserved.
good,"Walk in, clock in, work, clock out, every day. Management is okay when it comes to in the store, other than that it’s not too good. Would recommend to high schoolers."
good,It was a very overworked place but I was having a reaction to cleaning chemicals and they were not moving me because they were understaffed. The people were great but the job sucked. And the attendance policy is unrealistic.
good,I would recommend to those first starting in the workforce for it would be a good stepping stone. It would be a good place to get comfortable with working average hours for a part time and full time workplace.
good,"I liked being a department manager but for long term the job was not feasible due to the fact that at the time I wore hearing aids and sometimes struggled with hearing things correctly, which is something the manager over me constantly berrated me for so I left before I could be demoted or fired."
good,It is a great place to start out but I don't know how some of my fellow coworkers have been able to work there for over ten years. If you are able to make friends there and keep yourself coming in on time you should be able to make the daily job an enjoyable experience
good,"the most enjoyable part about my job is getting to know my associatesand teaching and training whenever I can."
good,There are plenty of different  areas to work in which all require different skill sets. You can make a career out of it if it is something that interests you. I was getting burned out and when the opportunity arrived I took my severance and went elsewhere. I had many different job codes before leaving the company.
good,The new management at this Walmart  is not good for the company as a whole.  Many people with whom I have talked to are displeased with how they treat those who have been there many years.
good,Management tends to look down on regular associates. Doesn't delegate well. Not willing to work with scheduling conflicts. If you cannot meet the standard that management wants you will be disappointed.
good,Walmart tire center was an oil and time place to come get an oil change while u shop for household things i chaned oil and tires batteries they people was always friendly
good,My time here was never absolutely terrible but it was never great either.Having the ability to do basically ever job in the building after 7yrs I was constantly over looked.They promote friends and girlfriends/boyfriends/whom they are cheating on their spouse with..Shady In that particular regard. Seen so many explicit pics sent from managers.WhoreMart
good,"Job Description"
good,"Managers were the problem. Pay was good and benefits we're good but the management didn't really listen to opinions or suggestions. The mgmnt are not responsible and don't work with you on issues (funeral, sick kids, etc.)"
good,The pay is great but you'll have to work to death for it. The work environment is dirty and really hot in the summer and freezing in the winter. Management only cares about production.
good,"Long hours, decent salary.  Opportunities for job advancement. Never a dull moment, always busy.  Lots of moving around.  On ladders, stocking and bending.  Dealing with customers can be challenging."
good,It was an okay job and I learned how to deal with customers better and to be much more careful with my shipping and handling when doing overnight stocking.
good,"I learned that you can't trust people there, lots of drama & it's like a den of snakes. Mid Level Management does not know how to deal with employees, coaching is not give, threatening of termination is their first objective."
good,They do illegal things: changing the sick time policy and robbing millions of employees out of 192 hours of sick time that we don't have access to. We can only use those hours on family members (that are not even employed by Walmart). And that is after you have used all your vacation time. Bonus are minimized to almost nothing
good,"Walmart Management Jobs. Walmart managers help operate a multi-million-dollar business. Every day brings a new opportunity to learn and grow while leading a team of dedicated associates. With the skills and knowledge you gain, you’ll have the opportunity to take your career to the next level. And the next level. And the next."
good,"They're making some changes from corporate's end. Thus, if one prefers to have a set routine for when they're working, it's a good idea, but you might have to make an occasional adjustment. The management there is kind and understanding, can be firm at times when necessary."
good,Pay was pretty good for the line of work I had to (Customer Host) but the downfall for Walmart is that there are too many managers with differing options.
good,its a stable job  you can move up if you so desire iv been their for a long time and have aqruier many things but its time to move on. and find a something tat challenges me more
good,A typical day starts with a kickoff meeting to describe or delegate work assignments. From then on you are on your own until later in the shift a supervisor will determine what you have to do to complete your assignment.
good,"The amount of work you do doesnt add back up to the pay you recieve. They are always understaffed and you never get off on time especially when your relief comes in, thats even if they come on time ."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Not much that interests me as far positions and advancement."
good,"I started off in a lower position in the company such as a frozen dairy associate, but I moved up in the company to higher level positions. The higher level positions included tasks such as a cashier, and then ultimately becoming a pharmacy technician in the company. I gained essential skills while working in the company such as professional communication skills, friendliness, and critical thinking skills on the job."
good,"Was a job to pay the bill, decent pay, management is entitled,  employees arent all treated the same,  favoritism,  drama, like being in high school all over again. To much stress."
good,"Great opportunities to start a career in retail, but limited opportunities to move up into salaried management.  Additionally, this company offers good training for entry level jobs."
good,"My Walmart location may not reflect the company as a whole, but it was quite difficult working there as a department manager.  They have a specific set of steps they expect you to get through every single workday, but oftentimes you get pulled off your tasks to help other areas of the store.  There’s very little room for understanding in this regard."
good,I was a minor when I worked here and we got no hours. At a point in time they took all of our hours away and we had to ask for hours. Other then that it was a nice place to work
good,The job is easy but the enviorment is out of control some people are nice and make you feel wanted while the other employees are not this is definitely not a job i would recommend to anyone.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but sometimes can be really stressful because management makes it that way. You don't really have a support system here.
good,As years went by management did not appreciate the associates. New store manager where trained at my store every 1 year. Most of them were very nice and wanted you to learn more about the company. Other store managers would treat you like dirt. I spent alot of time training people and helping offices at  new locations.
good,Good place and safe for me and I have done it all I feel myself good and happy I learned more about sales associate and my manager was friendly and hospitable he was kind
good,"Okay so Walmart is a great place to work as a teenager. The starting pay at my location as a Fresh Cap Associate is about $12.90/hour and that pay can change depending on the store & whether you work in the morning or afternoons. Walmart is never consistent on hours unless you have worked there for a long time. They won't give you full time, only part time for a very very long time. Don't expect benefits besides a 10% discount card after 90 days of working there. Management was alright at my store, the HR Personnel Staff was great and welcoming, however the ASM's weren't nice or caring at all. Be prepared to work very fast during rush times and expect not to be appreciated at all for doing so. Overall, this is not a job you should expect to be your main job, it's a great side job or a job for a high schooler or a teen."
good,Walmart co workers work very hard they deserve a raise. I honestly don't feel they treat the co workers right at all. For all the stress the co workers go through
good,"A typical day for me at work is clocking in, getting my devices to work with, sending and email of sales and osca scores, capping and purging bins, stocking, zoning and dusting my areas and helping others. The hardest part for me at work is letting customers down. They sometimes come in after looking something up on the Walmart app and a lot of times we don't even carry the item in the store but the app will say we do."
good,I was afforded a great experience with Walmart during my last years as a Assistant. I was able to travel and be apart of building Neighborhood markets from ground up. It granted me excess to vast knowledge and careers building skills.
good,"Great work environment,easy to move up in the company.ok pay,meet new people,401k,insurance,many great oppurtunities outside of the company,great mangers"
good,"I was looking for the opportunity to be able to move up within the business and found that the program that the company had in place had been seemingly abandoned. I periodically asked about the ""Path to Leadership"" program and was given the same excuse by supervisors and human resources. After 3 years, I stopped asking. "
good,"I was a cashier. The job wasn't bad, Some people are just rude/stupid/mean and some are just a perv. They should have two cashiers to work at night..."
good,A lot of changing how you do things and how things get done. You need to be collaborative with your team. Multiple managers over you that you have to listen to
good,I loved my job until policies and management changed over time. I dedicated all my time to my job. I wanted to move up but life challenges kept happening and they wouldn’t let me.
good,"It’s a quick pace, fast learning job that you jump right into. They’re flexible with hours and days that you need off. They give you paid vacation time depending on how many hours that you worked."
good,All the material to make or break the model of managers. this is a place that has a culture of growth. a place for people to thrive if you are able to adapt to the culture.
good,crecimiento laboral y estabilidad laboral caja de ahorro y bonos
good,I never intended to stay long but the fast paced environment and opportunities for advancement made promoting quick and something to work towards. It's a good stepping stone and learning experience.
good,I like what I did helping customer with their needs. Aslo having conversations with the customer while checking them out. Talking with the customer about thirty experience in the store.
good,Working at walmart is overall an enjoyable experience and I feel like anyone who applies and gets the job are going to be excited for the future they will be able to make while working there.
good,"It was an okay job, but too many different people to boss you around. One higher up will ask you to do something, then another higher up asks you to do something different. They didn’t communicate with each other much to let the other bosses know what we were supposed to be doing."
good,"The managers are rude and when u go with them to a problem they will make sure it gets out and everyone knows who went and told."
good,I was on at Walmart as a part time worker doing store resets and was offered a full time job that paid better. I liked the work but wanted a full time job.
good,Absolutely great customer interactions everyday with providing excellent customer service while maintaining speed during scanning was always a fun challenge!
good,Working at Walmart is kind of  like going to high school. A lot of drama between coworkers. Managers pick sides. But they do help out with  schooling  so if you don’t have your high school you can get that and they do have other great opportunities.
good,Working for this company is great and can be stressful at times due to changing management in the past. I've learned how to be self reliant and complete task with minimum oversite.
good,"This place flat out had a relative to one of the managers come in and ""be an unsatisfied customer"" just so they could give my a strike against me. That is not okay in my book. Like just grow up and tell me what I need to do to become the worker you'd like me to be. Or, if you don't like me and don't want me there just make it obvious and maybe I'll just leave or move departments anyway. Good grief."
good,Great place of employment friendly workers everyone is always willing to help if you don't know what to do the managers are caring and understanding and helpful
good,Assistant managers are usually pretty understand and helpful but when it gets busy it’s chaotic. You’re thrown in different directions and the same time without any clear instruction. Very understaffed usually
good,Walmart is becoming worst and worst as time goes on. Management doesn't care about their associates like they use to. They have real poor communication  between each other and they can't make up there mind what they want you to do. They lie and say they don't say something when they did the day before. You don't get paid enough for doing a 4 person job. I would never recommend some to work gere
good,"Lots of changes happening right now.  Unsure of yhe direction the company is going, but it seems to be going to fewer chiefs and lots of indians.  Good first job for someone."
good,I was a really good cashier but i have good people skills and great customer service. I love meeting new people and striking up conversations. I really need a job.
good,Walmart taught me alot about people serive fast friendly service time managment proper food handling and food holding times the degree of foods and how to be on time
good,Cashiers less breaks unless you smoked. Unloaders got long hours not enough pay. And ince on nightshift there was no way could go anywhere else. Promotional wise.
good,I love walmart it is a very relaxed & fun place to work. The managers stay on task & you know where to begin everytime you clock in. The meetings are short & helpful. They work together as a team & are always there to help.
good,Walmart deli was experience that helped me move and test my work ethic and patients. it was costumers that made the job a tad bit hard and somewhat the scheduling but overall it helped in a positive way
good,"Decent store to work in, on the smaller side for a Walmart but currently undergoing renovations. The most difficult thing is the customers, you end up explaining the same thing repeatedly all day."
good,Could use improvement in certain areas. Needs to take time to care for employees and not the dollar amount. A multi million dollar company could do more for employees and their families
good,It was a fast paced and hard job to do but it was worth it and made the day go by quicker.The upper management wasnt anything to write home about but direct supervisor was amazing.
good,A typical day or night at work was coming in breaking down pallets of merch had to learn the store to know where items go to get them stocked before it was time to open the store.
good,Fun place to work in. Very fast paced and upbeat. Must be very active for the positions I have held.any different positions to advance in thought your carer.
good,"Unloaded multiple trailers a day. Stocked shelves and helped customers. Management plays favorites and its the only way to get ahead. Physically draining, but the people you work with make the job worth it for the most part"
good,My jobs consisted of sweeping the floor of the whole store and then from there I cleaned all the bathrooms. After break I swept and mopped break room and cleaned out all microwaves on a nightly basis. Sadly my manager  showed favoritism to some of the male workers ans many of the young female workers. Very  unprofessional behavior. I worked with several other employee's and we all got along well. The bathrooms were a challenge since they were used on a constant basis.I enjoyed interacting with customers and  co-workers.
good,Walmart has taught me a lot of valuable skills such as communicating with customers and how to deal with their inquiries. Being skillful and having a good relationship with the customers and co-workers are key to being successful in a company.
good,"Clock in and clock out time are confusing from the way my manager and the policy stated. So it would appear I counted late or too early if I didn't clock in right at the right time. Group would come together before work to discuss duties. From time to time there would be a bit of confusion. Work instructions are easy though. Coworkers do their work, though tend to sound rude. Mostly some in management. "
good,Manegers gets where trash their employees great I didn’t really like they changed the point system and there call off system if u didn’t have a code the count it as a no call no show good pay
good,"Really good first job experience. Learned many skills from inventorying to customer service skills. Learned to solve problems fast and work around challenges. Supervisors taught me a lot, though management could use work"
good,"It was an amazing learning experience and helped me really get my foot out of the door, I just found out that that type of job and environment was not for me."
good,I worked at a small store for 2 years and when it closed I transferred to a supercenter. My coworkers at my previous store were super friendly and we were all treated like family. At the supercenter I felt nobody cared about you as an individual and you were just a number to them. I hate supercenters and I liked working for Walmart before I had to transfer to one. The employees there were rude and did not show me how anything was done there.
good,Poor management schedule wasn't rite they didn't care about nethin u had goin on I luv the hrs though Dey let me go in October n I was tge October associate of the month
good,Very unpleasant place to work at. Really rude management. Management may talk about you and even tell ouer co-workers about confidential information! Would not recommend working here!
good,I liked my job at Walmart because I helped customers a lot.I also liked to cook and cut meat for customers as well. The main problem with Walmart to me was the managers unprofessionalism.
good,"I really enjoy my job, being responsible for the first impression of the store and keeping the department stocked as well as helping  customers.  Unfortunately, the immediate supervisor does not enforce procedures or hold employees accountable for mistakes or misconduct.  I  would stay if the Supervisor would do his job."
good,"This is not a horrible place to work. Like most places it depends on management. The benefits are awesome and the pay is not the worst. It was simply not enough for me. At this stage in life. The new store manager however did not care for the workers. "
good,"Depending on what you pick as your primary job, though you may be crosstrained for other things in the store itself, you may have a relatively easy time in this store particularly. You need to get to know your coworkers though."
good,"Not flexible enough, they expect you to work 24/7 , the company is too strict on attendance and pay should be higher . They also harass you about the dress code"
good,In all honesty it has gotten worse to work here with more jobs being cut and doing more work in areas while no pay raises for the effort! Its a joke to work here now a days!
good,I got was fairly simple for the most part I can't complain about the employer's or employees I could say I requested more time on the clock but other than that I have no complaints the service is wonderful the employment is very worth it
good,It was an ok job and got the bills paid. Short staffed and had to work other departments. Unloading truck by myself was always hard but I lost a lot of weight
good,Great pay and will give you all the hours you want and need just not very family oriented of a job to work.so if you have kids may not be a very great place to work. Do to the fa t they dont understand family emergencies.
good,I really liked working for Walmart I was outside 90% of the time. All my coworkers were fun and energetic. The only down side was the hours were not good.
good,They had me working all over the store for 10cent a year I was cleaning I was pushing in carts I went from stocking to pushing in carts I was even called to unload the truck everyday
good,buen programa de capacitacion mala calidad de vida
good,Pretty sparse for a multi-billion dollar company not enough hours to fully live off of in my opinion. Highly recommend to have with a second job since there is little progress to be made.
good,Walmart was an ok job they were very strict on the attendance it didn't matter if you have kids or nothing. The pay was good as well as the hour's. Other than that it was a good job it paid the bills.
good,"Started out as a meat cutter, then on to a stocker.after 4years went into security for 4years loved that job. Then to produce then back to the meat department. Then to lawn and garden manager."
good,it was a very generic and boring cashier job. it was not a bad place to work if you like a routine but the monotony of the shifts was draining and i had the same conversation with people every few minutes
good,"i actually loved working there at first, then after 11-12 months is as if they expected us workers to do twice the work with the same pay. co workers never picked up their pace, since i was younger within my department they swore i could handle more work with little to no notice"
good,"It's fine for a first job, but expect managers to play favorites. Management changes every few years so be prepared for changes. they will use time off against you I was given unexcused time off when i had wisdom teeth remove."
good,"Stocking shelves, breaking down boxes and preparing items to be stocked. Checking out customers. Assisted in other departments as needed. Cleaning area and making sure items are in stock."
good,I like to work for a company who recognizes their employees for a job well done. And who works together as a team. I also like to work for a company who is family oriented. And Walmart isn’t a company who has any of these traits.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work at with fast paced work inviroments and competitive people. If you want to stay busy all the time every day of the week this is the place for you .
good,I thought it was good working their they just don’t like working around student athletes but they have to work on that and days off it’s hard to get days off
good,El salario es muy bajo y no alcanza para vivir bien
good,The job was okaye I worked part time hours than jumped to full time I lost my baby sitter for my son so I had to go back down to part time hours which really sucked because my pay change too
good,High volume of customers demanding good customer service. Long work hours and extric policies to follow. High customer traffic place. ................
good,"Walmart is a busy workplace. There is always people shopping, and there will be a lot of coworkers. There is always a chance to be in a different department in the store as there is always a job that needs to be done and a customer that needs help."
good,Management was professional and fair. Cashier during Christmas season was interesting. Most customers are either indifferent or very nice. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a diverse group of customers.
good,A typical day at Walmart depending on if it’s busy or not is pretty cool . Interacting with the customers and having good fun laughing conversations be the best . Some of the management team take they job serious and are there to help all associates and customers no many what.
good,It was a decent job they would give you racks of products to stack in one area for about 2 hours if you didnt get done they would tell you to go faster
good,This is a good place to start off as a first job. You can promote within the company easily if you put in the work. If you enjoy interacting with customers then this is the place for you.
good,Accounts payable position. Processing different types of invoices. A lot of fun events. Great bonuses. Very good job of management presenting data  and owning their business.
good,I will never work for a WalMart store again.  The way they handled closing our store was not thinking and caring for the associates.  Good associates were not given comparable jobs in other stores.
good,"At the beginning of my employment, there were 3 full time customer service managers, 6 full time cashiers, 2 security guards, an assistant manager, and a co-manager. Each employee was scheduled so that there would be enough coverage. "
good,"i was a cashier and would check customers out, bag items, maintain a clean work environment, kept shelves stocked. worked hard and different shifts every week"
good,"You have to do more than one job and you are forced to do "
good,"Its overall relaxed. You do your job and go home basically. It's not rocket science. They managers were pretty great, they only give recognition to employees who don't do the job well & I had a problem with that."
good,"Super disorganized, too many mangers telling you different things. Zero communication making it hard to know what you're supposed to do. Very frustrating. You'll get burnt out FAST"
good,Walmart is declining drastically is the way they treat their employees.  And all of the negative changes going on with in the corporation.  Very sad time
good,I love working at Walmart. I like the insurance. I meet new people and they was a joy to with with. The other managers was good to work with. Making sure the employees did the jobs Making sure the store was in good shape to be turned over to the next managers that morning.
good,"I worked many departments, gained many skills while working with Walmart, I ran the bakery and deli was responsible for price changes, modular rests, also learned cake decorating"
good,I once got off the road of driving trucks and got a job at Walmart at first it was ok then management changed and then everyone started complaining about the same thing bad management
good,"A typical day at Walmart starts off get your equipment which usually runs out cause there's not enough, management depends either they'll back you up or throw you under the bus depend on the person but they're all trying to cut corners, work place culture "" people of Walmart"" that says it all but really most people are great and easy going, the hardest part of the job the lack of equipment and other employees pawning customers on you to help them, the most enjoyable part of the job meet new people and making friends, conclusion could make this a career ,benefits, pay, 401k, and stock options. Good for someone with no skills but I want for more"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the team I'm a part of.  Some of the management are decent but there are a couple that aren't so great. Right now there isn't a strict dress code but there has been in the past.
good,Didn’t really get taught everything because of that I always got in trouble by my boss so if you wanna work there ok you be you just don’t work as a stocker
good,"I have a good review on Walmart. I really needed change though. I want to advance my hard working skills and to challenge myself in different areas. "
good,I come in to work and check to see what has come in. i make sure i'm  that i have all the tools  i need to start my day. I learn that everyone has issues. When a customer approach you and have to listen to what they say and see how you can help them. Hardest part of a job is that you can't please everyone.
good,"Unloading merchandise trucks containing up to 500 units of goods a day which the organization would sell "
good,"It was an ok job. I didn’t mind the stocking and the back room work. There were always customers that needed help and at times it would get tedious. Unless you are going to be a manager, or is not a career job."
good,The hours really suck when we could get eight hours in a whole week the next you get 23 it was up and down with hours! Not a lot of full-time positions!
good,"The survey I filled out was based on the Walmart in Kingston Ontario. I have no clue about how things are run in the United States. "
good,"The other associates really make the company. Managers come and go, and many of them come in trying to change everything,  but the associates are where you can either have a great experience, or terrible one."
good,"This is not a job that you should expect a lot out of. The management at my store is very lazy and always stressing the employees out. If you have a complaint about anything, nothing will be done."
good,"One of the best jobs I have ever had in retail. I loved my walnart family. Then the big wigs stepped in an ruined the company. Many many employees ""managers"" left after that. Its sad."
good,The pay rate isn't great. The people you work with tend to be good at their jobs. Some managers are good but a few speak to grown adults as if their children wich u may have to address politely by asking to speak to them in private. The actual jobs are easy.
good,"I genuinely liked working at Walmart’s meat dpt. It was subsequently bad management that pushed me out, but chill place to work. just needed them to work with me on the schedule, and with more hours"
good,Not the same as it was back when i first worked there. Managers now have little regard for their employees. Benefits are poor and the overall environment is lacking.
good,"Working for Walmart is much better than working fast food. The pay is better also. Management varies from store to store, my management team is very nice and helpful. You definitely need to be people friendly since they revolve around customer service."
good,"it was an okay place to work, need help with management.  didnt get paid correctly for the work they gave me. only thing i really enjoy was being able to get carts."
good,"Walmart is a slow paced environment to work for with no room for advancement. They offer small benefits package, work long hours and have a very low wage of salary for their employees."
good,"Very helpful, look forward to finding a great place to work. With great pay and consistant hours. Helpful when looking for a job. Very reliable and easy to use."
good,Loved working for this fast pace company. Would of never left if i wasnt having personal issues. Pays well and is well worth it. Look into this as a job.
good,"Very fast pace, at times intense. The work loads at times are not acceptable. They rely too much on technology and less on the skills of a trained employee"
good,Fun place to work at. Just need to b more people working there need to have way more cashiers. They need to keep things stocked. Or try to at least...
good,I loved the people I worked with. Overnight was fun. I would recommend an overnight position to anyone considering a job with Walmart. The people make the difference
good,"The co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the management. Some of the management is good, but they expect too much from too few people. Other than that, the job is enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with your fellow employees. If you have any questions, you are free to ask as it is better to ask than to do it wrong."
good,good place to work and can be fun but also stressful and alot of people in the high places didnt really know what they was doing so to say so the workers had to pick of the slack of not only the mangers but other coworkers
good,"Walmart  is a job for patience.  Like any job, just perform your task and remember employment is hard to find.  If your working to elevate in title you have those options at Walmart."
good,I made food sometimes when they did have someone to come in.i was also a stocker in the backroom. I unload truck when they came in. I also pack the backroom after the truck was done.
good,A typical day at work was stressful. There were never enough cashiers to take care of the customers. If I needed a manager I would have to almost beg for them to come to the front.
good,"It was always the same routine, no brain practice."
good,It’s a fast paced work place & friendly people just not really good with work scheduling. My biggest thing was work shortage & I really needed the hours.
good,I quit because I was told that k had to pull fabric from the top racks over my head even though I was 6 months pregnant a ne was very high risk and I had notes from a doctor
good,"Walmart is a large fast-paced place. Management needs to improve and workers needs to be trained better when hired into any position. It is a good place to work for and the pay is good, but the training needs to be improved."
good,This job was more of a temporary position until i was able to find something else. I was there while I just newly had a baby and they were willing to work with my schedule. The pay was not great at all.
good,"I think that other employees shouldn't get punished for other employees mistakes. And those who have been there for a while, even if you are part-time they see you putting in the work,you should be able to get the hours to bring home a decent living wage, and some benefits and the whole myshare bonus not half of it, people who work the hardest should get rewarded better than we do."
good,"If you're not big on change, working at Walmart is a good option. You do the same tasks every day, at the same time. I learned that I am not a big fan of large corporations, because not every employees needs are tended to."
good,"Assisted stores with all maintenance, fuel supply, refrigeration, eoc, and Scheduling. Busy environment, always opportunity to grow within the building. Issue is with promoting out is near impossible."
good,"The walmart I worked at was not organized, the management was terrible, wouldn't let ypu use PTO, showed a lot of favoritism. Forcing next shifts to complete the previous shift's work."
good,"I did more work than I should have done in stocking do to other co-workers not showing up for work I was getting the job done stocking boys and girls, the women and mans, and the shoe department and no came to help me I had to wrap pallets and pull them back that is when help came because the store had to open it was tuff but I completed the job even though I knew I should have had more help"
good,Walmart is always cutting payroll and expecting the same amount of work to get done with fewer employees. Patient wait times increase and associates are spread very thin. Associates are leaving for other jobs and not being replaced. No one is ever working on the floor so customers get mad and come complain to the pharmacy. Witness possible theft but manager or Loss Prevention never respond to calls. Constantly down sizing.
good,"Stocking Freight, adjusting merchandise counts, adjusting product on shelf availability for customers, learned a lot about inventory management, great place to work."
good,pretty decent work place with ok pay. get some health benefits but not great. pay attention to people. management could be a little better. some favortism.
good,"Okay to work at. Customers come to you for everything. When you cannot answer the question, takes a long time for management to come to your department and help."
good,It's a job it you show up everyday on time and do what you are asked then you will make it theough.if you dont like to work then dont even bother applying.
good,"Walmart has many types of people working for them.  Some that I had worked with have been employed with the company for nearly 20 years.  It's very adverse.  If someone wants to switch departments, it is very easy to do so.  I started as overnight maintenance, and transferred to stocking and as a back up cashier.  It literally happened over night.  There is room to grow and to transfer to other locations as well.  I would consider working for Walmart again in the future."
good,"Well I was unloading trucks in reciving area and also on shiping area in the summer time 12 hours per day 3 days a week,2 trucks per day ,friendly team"
good,"I love my job but we are all burned out. Not only does our manager not get involved like he used to, but corporate keeps adding more responsibilities to our role and then wants to know why we aren't on process. Policies and the way things run constantly change, so it seems like there's never any stability. Change is good, but change once or twice a month causes confusion, leading to failure to satisfy the customers (or employees)! Nobody listens to what you think so everyone feels like nobody cares and the result is that eventually, the associates don't care anymore either."
good,"Good people to work with, fast pace, great place to get to know new people, a one hour lunch, good training, if you need help just ask and they will help"
good,"Walmart is a laid place back place to work, But they switch managers to much, You can never get use to one manager they switch way to much it makes things hard on employees"
good,"If this is going to be your first job it is going to be exciting, i wouldn't work there unless its your second job. The pay isn't comparable to the tasks asked of you."
good,"the management did not really work with me or the other associates, they tended to play favorites a lot. the fellow workers were alright and the tried to make the best of it."
good,"Snickers My Job at Walmart involved •	Stocked refrigerated, frozen, and grocery products as assigned"
good,"Very fast paced, sometimes there were slow moments."
good,"After working for Walmart for about 14 years on and off I love my job. However, opportunities for advancement are few and I am ready to take my skills elsewhere."
good,Let's just say that working for wal-mart was a highly demanding and fast paced job.Non-stop action and a great crew to work with. All in all a fast-paced job.
good,Walmart is a business where your relative experience can shape the majority of your work life. You can make it a career and enjoy life or sit by the side and sink.
good,"Working at Walmart is not hard but dealing with the stereotype of Walmart is the issue, maintaining any sense of the store can help you in future areas"
good,"My work as a Bakery Sales Associate was very monotonous bagging bread and occasionally helping with clean-up, stocking, and customer service. Employee morale in the bakery/deli area was very low and made the position undesirable."
good,no type of work life balance. no flexibility in your work schedule. have to come to work even when its  a state of emergency. no holidays off. only one day off consider a holiday and that's Christmas
good,"difficult work hours always work on weekends management is very poor and rude and they don't care about others, not a fair place to work wouldn't recommend any one to be employed there."
good,"A lot of growth within the company, very flexible but not good salary. "
good,"The hardest part of my job is the time frame given to get the job completed in a day, continuously understaffed. Very little back up from management on daily decisions. They always over ride what plans are made. Too many people allowed to make decisions, and no consequences or accountability."
good,you wear many hats very busy store work life balance is not available. Fast paced and never enough time to complete tasks.  Fast paced and have to move quickly.
good,"I worked at Walmart in many different locations and i really enjoyed it.  I remember my managers keep asking me to stay because i was working hard and i had never been absent.  I learnt many things because i worked in many department such as toys, cashiering and stocking."
good,"Good place to work, management dont really value employees that need to be valued, but good work environment with the associates. The associates value there work but the associates aren't valued. We all take pride in putting in 150%"
good,When I work there it was a good place to work only problem was I was only making 7.25 an hour. I like my co-workers but I never really got 40 hours a week it was about 33 to 37 hours a week other than that the workout in the Sphero is very nice.
good,"Great pay, benefits, and chance for advancement.  Working at Walmart Distribution was very challenging and very rewarding.  The culture at Walmart was the type to take care of there people."
good,At walmart they will hire you for one position and you will end up working somewhere else. Shortage of associates is a common thin at walmart and there will never enough people to runthe store.
good,"With inconsistent tasks and changing management, Walmart is a very hectic place to work if you are looking for consistency and efficiency. Long hours and limited break time make the day drag even when you have work to do. The high turnover rates exist at this company for a reason."
good,Had very good benefits we could take smoke breaks every 2 hours.we would get an hour lunch everyday.They would give free food to take home sometimes. It was an ok place.
good,"great place to have multiple career experiences within the same company"
good,"If you give 100% every day you work you will quickly move up the ladder. However, there is a limit to your growth. Once you are close to the top, claws come out and your work environment becomes a dog eat dog atmosphere and if you are not prepared you will be eaten alive. The top is super competitive and positions are given to “favorites “ unfortunately."
good,The job was easy honestly the only hard part was throwing the trash the employees were great and I can honestly say I had an great experience the time I was there
good,"Worked at Wal-Mart for ten years. Promised the world when hired. As each milestone was reached, policies ""changed"" (for the worse). Workload increased because of cut personnel, expected to ""step it up"" to compensate... Meanwhile yearly raises diminished, froze (""Just for THIS year...""), and once they actually CUT my pay because of a clerical error they made when they hired me years prior... Managers are rotated out regularly so you can't pin the poor practices on anyone in particular, most likely by design."
good,I actually enjoyed working my time at Walmart there was always something going on. I just wish I could stayed longer and not gotten the flu but Walmart wasn’t having none of it.
good,"I made it almost 2years I worked hard, I was paid well, but it’s very hot, and very tiring work. Easy to get hurt. I wouldn’t recommend unless a hard worker who needs money"
good,"If you want a job to where you really dont need to think, and you dont like working with customers. Overnight stocker is the job for you."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is alright. Since I do not work on the more busier days, they have a tendency to cut my hours short and when I ask for more hours they typically do not give them to me. Plus, the management is disorganized."
good,"Wal-Mart keeps you busy and on your toes all the time, unfortunately some of the managers are power hungry and like to make work harder than than need be. But it is Wal-Mart so you see new things and crazy thing every day."
good,"At one point I loved working at Walmart GBS and didnt want to go home but once the company moved to its permanent home in Charlotte, moral went down. Very disorganized and noone in management wanted to take responsibility for things they verbally told associates to do that cost some associates their jobs."
good,I work overnight so the atmosphere of customers is very relaxed compared to day shift. We are always understaffed with so much stocking to do.  Management has favorites which will determine if who gets promoted.
good,"While I have worked at Walmart for going on 3 years, I feel it is time for me to leave due to the inconsistency of the hours I was given to work. For a single person just starting out, working at Walmart would be a good thing for them. To support your family however, in order to make ends meet, one would need to be on the Management Team which is nearly impossible."
good,The backroom associates were treated poorly compared to the front. They expected more when there was not enough time to get things done. The people up front were able to do whatever they wanted with no trouble. There were more rules for the back.
good,The work load was managable until someone called in or did not show up. The work load then had to be performed by those who were there. It takes a toll on the body.
good,"I helped customers when needed "
good,"Very fast paced job, hours go by quick. on your feet the whole day except for breaks. friendly management and great pay seeing that this was my first school as a high school student."
good,T he company is a good company but some of the store are not the best to work at the staff is not good people and some manger don't know how to treat there staff.
good,I didn’t like the morning shift working there because it was slow they did give us 1hours lunches and I really didn’t like the hours I did have to be at work sometimes
good,Walmart is a fun fast pace environment that’s is always changing can be managed better but depends on the store in the end. But would recommend the place to any who are looking .
good,"Walmart likes for you to work for more than what you earn. The pay per hour doesn’t match with the amount of work you do. For full time, you’re working 8 hrs a day just to make barely 700 every two weeks."
good,"A great place to work for seasonal or temporary, not enough hours to make a living. Friendly atmosphere, helping customers are two of the most enjoyable parts of this job."
good,It wasnt too bad working nightshift they start you a $1 more cause your over nights but its still not enough its very very hard to get raises there even if your working really hard
good,"The Wall-Mart where I currently work, Is under staffed. on some days when business was slow. Customer Service would Manageable but other days and on Holidays. Customer Service becomes a hindrance because of because of being under staffed."
good,"It is so very busy. While standing in line watching customers yell about the lines, I only can feel what that cashier is feeling. I never would go back to working the register at Walmart. Feet kill you, customers yelling and nothing is ever good enough! If I ever go back it be for another section of walmart and not the front."
good,Very fast paced environment. Very easy to elevate in position. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. And they were very understanding when situations arose.
good,if you are a cashier wear ear plugs. there are a lot of screaming kids and youll need them to hehar any cuustomers talking to you. altogether easy job. lots of standing but you get to meet some interesting people.
good,Workplace was good and not hard to manage but they offer very little days that could be missed for any reasons at all and if you were more than 5 minutes late to the entire shift then the entire day would be counted as missed.
good,"typical retail experience with some exceptions"
good,"Assuring the customer's about companies quality,  Explaining the technical description of the product the customers relations and handling responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of putting out stock, ordering supplies, assisting customers, inventory control, cash drawer, training, and completing notes that were directed from upper management."
good,"I honestly enjoyed working at Walmart, I met new friends, a new girl I thought was cute, etc. The things I hated was management. My manager was nice but mean. He wouldn't let me get my graduation off so, I put my 2 weeks in the next day He was really kind though."
good,"Dentro de la empresa se promueve el buen ambiente laboral, mediante estímulos a los buenos trabajadores y actividades extra-programáticas que disminuyes el estrés de los trabajadores."
good,"First, working at Walmart, was great.  Later i learned that the reason i was hired was to be changed from my initial position.  It wasn't an advancement. They hired my as a stocker, then placed on maintenance"
good,"Poco salario, se requieren estudios avanzados para lograr asensos. Mucha presión laboral, horarios rolados todos los días, mucha exigencia en horario de entrada y salida, 1 minuto de retardo al día te genera 15 minutos a la quincena y te llaman la atención."
good,"The job overall was ok, standard stocking, cleaning, and customer service. The biggest problem is that the 1-10 work schedule can be isolating, and that there was no accountability. People could get away with whatever."
good,"Management for this company is an absolute joke. You'd think it would be a rumor that they only advance people to get rid of them, but it's absolutely true from what I've seen over my years of working for this company. I've seen people who scream an belittle employees get advanced to department manager because they have ""leadership skills"" and I've worked under store managers who walk over and ignore employees mid conversation. "
good,"Has been a learning experience. Enjoyed the position, the other employees and fellow management staff."
good,"Work hours can conflict with family life considering the strict scheduling and little room for change.However, Benefits can prove to be very useful if you keep yourself rooted in for a year or so"
good,Overall my experience working at this establishment was very pleasing I learned a lot of good workplace skills from an early onset and was able to acquire skills that will enable me to elevate in any company.
good,Great place to work with a fun environment. Every day is challenging and enjoyable. A perfect place to start your career. Nothing more can be said. Have a great day.
good,It was a great place when I first started working there. When my disability was diagnosed I felt like the reduction in pay and hours was trying to force me out the door. When I did get to the point with my disability that I needed a reduction in hours the company said no to working with me. That is why I left.
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart, I love my customers and making a positive difference in their shopping experience, I love working as a team and tackling projects together"
good,everynight is a battle between management and the associates suffer and its unfortunate. there is always a hostile work environment which is hard to accomplish your work because you have to pick one of the managers side just to keep your job
good,Been with Walmart for 12 years. I like my job but has room for improvement. Some manigment need to work on people skills. It's a paycheck. Have not been interviewed for any promotions I put in for
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart everyone was very nice and welcoming I felt like I got right in with the other employees it was a good first job I would go back
good,"The company is very accommodating with other occupations in the Shoe department. Walmart is busy, and there are not too many chances to chit chat, which I like. I enjoy working with people where whether I was a cashier or shoe department associate."
good,it's a stressful job filled with a lot of horrible costumer experiences and sometimes even management and coworker experiences. The costumers are the worse part of the job.
good,"It was a job that got me by, and I was on my feet a lot. Quit due to personal reasons, no fault of the company. It was a job, and that is pretty much all I can say about it"
good,"For  me this job doesn't work out. However it is a great job to have. There is advancement to move up. The people are great. Not all stores are the same, but overall a good place to work"
good,I was great working here nice people nice start before orientation. After I started the job everything started becoming a struggle for me. Turned out the carts were heavy and i was basically the only one doing cart runs or gathering the grocery carts.
good,"it would have been ok if management wasn't bad.For example they made me work other departments and still wanted me to get all my bikes built,which was impossible"
good,"Its a fine job hard work long hours, some stores are better then others, its all dependent on your store manager. enjoy to work there peers are nice to work with"
good,"It's a job that helps you to pay your bills, I liked my job as a stocker, however I didn't like having to do the other dept.(mainly collecting baskets) job, when I was hired as a stocker, I didn't think it was right, especially when I was a part timer with no benefit, don't get me wrong I don't mind helping others out sometime.... but not every time its RAINING or COLD, just wrong."
good,Great team of co-workers bad management. unset hours. work load too much for the hours they give you and the pay they give you. huge turn over of employees
good,"I pointed out as a fairly new higher from Walmart.  I was in the hospital with the flu.  Because I have Wisdom teeth pulled and received 2 points the month before, recieving two more points while in the hospital cost me my job."
good,"It's a overall easy job once you get used to it. It can be fast paced on the weekends. I learned to be patient with people and I learned to really enjoy helping. The hardest part of the job was the difficult customers, but that's normal. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. I loved making friends."
good,"I learned a lot of new skills while working here. I enjoyed it slightly, but had times where I didn't like it and didn't want to come to work. But overall good experience"
good,just like any other retail place it has its ups and downs. Movement in the company can be hard depending on how you play your cards rights. The long hours is the only thing that I dont agree with.
good,"Cops and management lacked the proper communication in terms of effectively speaking to employees.....................,......................................"
good,"Walmart was a wonderful company to start and earn my experience. But as life progressed i find that the salary Walmart pays is not enough to pay for the cost of living in my area. While they offered many benefits, they were not free of charge and would get discounted from my paycheck earning less. The work environment while being fun and educational, it began turning stressful due to lack of personal and decreased in hour, plus the cancellation of overtime really hurt our chances to earn more. In conclusion, Walmart is better than no job and is a good starting job, but to remain there as a regular associate is no way of living."
good,"I have been working at Walmart for two years now and most of the time I do not mind it. I need the money and it is a job. Management makes me feel underappreciated and we only get a 2% raise every year. I hate working in other departments. I am a garden center associate but every week they schedule one of my days in the toy department. Walmart also has a tendency to cut back your hours. "
good,A typical day at walmart was getting product out to the floor and doing it as fast as you can for boss to be pleased. I learned that the fast you are is the more positive the boss thinks of you. The bosses didn't always give clear directions on what your tasks were even though that was part of their job.
good,Enjoyed working with the other employees.  Most of the time they were helpful. Sometimes the place would get VERY busy and stressful but we got through it with a smile and positive attitude.
good,Would not work around my school hours. I was supost to be working part time but often was told come in over 40 hours a week.  got 30 min lunch and 1 break
good,"Working at any other Walmart besides this one would probably be best. But If you do work here be ready for quick moving, loud/smack talking, multiples of babies crying of a type of day cause it may get to you. But unless you’re here to stay here forever, just come here to get some money then find something better."
good,Come in then clock in and find the CSM so I would know what register I would be located on. Check ID's on all beer & tobacco products at all times. Dealing with angry customer's (ID) or just people whom have issues. The enjoyable part is you do get a slight discount on Walmart items.
good,"It was a few years ago, but my experience wasn't terrible per say. I'd say towards the end of my pregnancy, it started to get a little more hectic given the time of year it happened, I did not think I was fired justly, but I did not want to burn that bridge, just in case the opportunity to work there again arose."
good,It was great to be apart of the walmart cap 2 team. I appreciate the experience and opportunity to try something different and learn new skills in different departments.
good,Decent enough to get by but hard not to want to strive for more. Challenging to work for customers but management is decent enough to work with you and the hr is great
good,Walmart was a pretty good company to work for until I started school. I was hard to get a availability change which conflicted with bout my work and school schedule and eventually pointed me out in their system. I think the company should work a little closer to their HR department and be supportive of individuals who want to advance and succeed within the company.
good,"Working at Walmart was good in the beginning, then we got new management and they were very rude and inconsiderate. Didn’t care about their workers at all."
good,"Some good people to work with. Fast paced environment, definitely need to be able to keep your head up when dealing with customers. They also provided some decent training. Hours were a little tricky and sometimes unpredictable."
good,It has been many years since I have worked at there but you do feel like a number by most of the management. The work is what you expect it to be but I hope they have found ways to improve their employee relationships.
good,"I took pallets of items from the loading dock to the main floor and unloaded the items of the pallets and stocked them on shelves."
good,Poor management and the coworkers had drama with each other. It was decent pay. The managers didn't really help with training in baking department. Give it a 3 our of 5
good,"I was a Department Manager, sales assoc., cashier, backroom inventory, unload-er, restock groceries and General merchandise and last but least translated. I enjoyed it."
good,"Pese a ser una gran empresa a nivel mundial, necesita valorar un poco más a sus colaboradores."
good,It started off as a good place to work! but as time went on and things changed it became difficult to adjust to.The new terms and condition of the workplace made it more stressful and tense.
good,"poor store leadership, not really interested in filling out this review, working at Walmart is a tempory situation for me, I plan on finding something else as my position is being eliminated"
good,I have learned a lot throughout my career at Wal-mart. I'm still learning new things in which I look forward to doing throughout the course of my time employed with Walmart
good,Walmart is a great company (with good benefits). The downfall of the job is dealing with the public and long hours. I still enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"the clientele isn't the best. However, the discounts helped when you are buying large expensive items. You can easily learn how to work in departments."
good,If needed there always seems to be an available job for you. If there is not a job there that you want then you can start a job there and wait for an opening where you'd like to work.
good,"Great work place, I would definitely go back if i wasn't in school. I loved management, as they love me also. The only hard part about this job is standing long hours."
good,My job responsibilities were not strongly suitable for my skill set and work experience. It was fast paced at times but slow at times as well depending on the work needed. Not a career I was interested in.
good,Work at Walmart can be very fast paced.  Currently at the store I worked in they are remodeling and moving EVERYTHING around and there are many customers who give up.
good,I did not enjoy my time working at walmart. The workplace reminded me of high school in a sense. Scheduling was terrible and often times was working alone in the deli. Not a good experience.
good,"just don't  its an awful place to work, management  makes you feel like garbage and the amount they pay is not live able, and they cut hours and write you up for almost anything"
good,Enjoy working at walmart its fast paced the people are friendly the customers seem to enjoy shopping with us management and the csm are helpful when you need anything
good,As long as you have a good manager working with you the work won’t seem like it’s to much. The Sumter region has some shady management inside and they like to get over on people sometimes.
good,Set up racks.unloaded how many ever trucks. Sort the items and stock he shelves. Compacted the cardboard. Had training on the keyboard for register and many more jobs.
good,Typical day included standing by the door welcoming people as they walked in or thanking them for shopping with Walmart. Hardest part was standing all day.
good,I enjoyed working here throughout high school. They give students good hours to work with their schedules. The management is friendly. The job is easy.
good,It pays well. Some of the managers are great to work with. It's an okay work environment. Some nights it's great some nights are harsh it depends the night.
good,"It was my first job in a team, as well as fast-paced, and very stressful due to lack of management. "
good,"Enjoyed providing excellent customer service and assisting fellow associates.Overall, for me, ended up being a steady paycheck with okay benefits. In my experience, must be very flexible in work schedule in order to get hours in, as well as to advance. Advanced through and held various job titles over course of 14+ years at one location.  Transferred to new location and worked at that location for another 3+ years."
good,"Your supervisor could tell you to stock one aisle, then the department manager would tell you to do something else, then the sotre manager tells you something else. Then when you listen to one and not the others, you get yelled at by the others due to not following directions which leads to a coaching (3 strikes your out)."
good,Working at Walmart reassures much of the stigma that is heard about this employer. There is tough hours and tough management. One of the only positives is that at the beginning of the month there is cake to celebrate up and coming birthdays.
good,"I honestly expected a little more from Walmart and I didn't want to believe the things people said about working for them but trust and believe, it is the truth."
good,"walmart was a great company , they offer a lot of good benefits , breaking down the stock her was also fun , really chill overnight stocking great management , great co workers"
good,"Its Walmart. The work is most definitely monotonous, but the pay has apparently risen since my departure. It seems like they have relaxed on its policy in order to keep with the times."
good,"knowing what I had to do from start to finish, team work but the most thing i did not like was working overnight going in on Monday and leaving on Tuesday"
good,"Overall I believe Walmart is an alright company, but they do have a lot of downfalls and also turnovers because the way they decide to run things. Everyone is not always on the same page, and they also have favorites in the stores. They aren't always fair as far with their workers, they don't switch people around and allow them to learn other areas. Management aren't always on the same team, if you want to see your workers working together and getting alone, then they have to do the same thing and show us that and not just tell us. I've learned to not let people take advantage of you, know your worth and what you stand for, and don't go broadcasting your strengths because some people love to take advantage of it. You can be a good worker and work harder than others but somehow they will still find something to complain about and not appreciate you or your work. Management there don't know how to say thank you or even reward you."
good,"While some people like this company for a career, I feel it was not right for me.  I don't like being micro-managed and can not thrive in that type of environment.  I actually enjoyed the ability to create displays and help customers though."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was a great experience. The environment made me feel welcomed and comfortable to work at. Not only did i feel comfortable it was fun and productive.
good,walmart always offered extra  shifts. walmart pay is adequate for work being asked. walmarts work atmosphere is laid back at times but can be fast paced ii really enjoyed my team
good,During the time working there it was pretty nice. The only thing that I didn't like is that I was trained to work in a specific dept and I kept getting called to back up cashier and then get coached for not keeping up my department as far as stocking and not being available for customer assistance
good,"my main issue with wal-mart is they are quick to fire. you are only allowed to miss two days i the probation period. if you are working outside in the weather there is an increased chance of getting ill, especially in the winter time."
good,"Fast pace and always busy with customers. I was always guaranteed my forty hours a week of work. I got to meet people from different cultures. To me the hardest part of being a cashier was the constant changes with the wick check transactions that the customers had no awareness of, witch caused my line to pause so that a Manager can explain and make adjustments of the transaction at hand before proceeding."
good,Walmart is a real stressful job the manager they have don’t know how to manage time or people some of the manager talk to the employees any type of way
good,"Very fast pace, work from zoning to stocking. Good customer service was hard to give on the weekends due to task that needed to be completed. The store manager is the best I have work for. The management team overall I say are also the lead by example type. They work very hard and expect the same from you."
good,"The Higher up management care little for the actual workers, and only for their bottom line.  They make constant change when they don't see the results they want, however these changes often make life much harder for the employees, and the management. this causes unneeded stress for everyone everything rolls down hill. There is constant anger, and yelling in the back rooms from upset management because they just got yelled at by their management because the thing they didn't get told about wasn't done yet, and somehow that is the employee at the bottoms fault.  This happened so many times it was hard to keep track.  Most days all you had to do was keep your head down and just do your job while ignoring the constant anger floating around in the air.  it got more and more difficult to do though as time wore on."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to find you're first starting job but I do not recommend making it your career or long-term job. Management was the hardest part of the job. They never communicated to each other and to the associates clearly. They over work the associates and expect jobs to get done when in reality, they need a bigger staff to get all the jobs done."
good,Working for Walmart was okay for a paycheck it was kind of stressful and people treated you kind of with disrespect and their point system for when family issues show up they still give you points.
good,"Fast paced. Hard work. Varying hours  "
good,Overrall associates are friendly and open with good teamwork skills. Stockers must be fast and adequate at putting up freight with small to no errors.
good,"This is definitely a job that requires team work, and not a bad place to make new friends. As long as you do your job there is nothing to worry about."
good,It's a fast-paced work environment. Certain management are down-to-earth others are hard to work with.. but once you do your job and you get into your job everything is fine
good,"My time at Walmart was beneficial and enlightening in that the experience exposed me to work duties and customer interactions that I had never encountered before. I learned how to work independently to fulfill job expectations, as well as how to collaborate with my coworkers on tasks requiring the help of others. "
good,I guess it depends on who you know and what not to get what you need done I feel like that it's getting worse there than anything else. I have learned that you can work hard  and have fun
good,They were ok to work for the main store manager I had to go over his head because he wouldn’t follow my doctors orders but I did get thank you slit for stopping people from stealing over $500 worth of stuff
good,"I like my job and it was very informational when i became promoted. However, dealing with the management team I had, most of them acted like they did not care about you at all as an employee and only cared about what you can do and how much you can do to accommodate them."
good,"It was stressful at times with some customers that had issues with not cashing checks, or with some products. The management at the time was not very well operated."
good,Very nice bosses but co workers not so much all of them wasn’t nice and not a team player it was a clean place pay wasn’t that great couldn’t raise my family on that job being a single parent of 4 children
good,"As a cashier, and sometimes filling in as a CSM, I would ring customers ut in an efficient way and getting to know them through this quick process, so they leave with a smile on thier face."
good,Retail pharmacy is given more responsibility but no the resources it needs to accomplish their goals with unrealistic expectations being the normal way of business
good,worked at walmart for 5 years in multiple departments but was never promoted only received a raise when it was a store wide raise. the best manager in the store was in the auto dept i worked in. hours are great unless we are budgeting. overall if you want a company to move up in go somewhere else.
good,Walmart was not all that great. But that was back when you got paid basically a little more than minimum wage. You were really over worked and underpaid.
good,Walmart actually wasn’t that bad and I know many people that would love to have that job but the position that I got stuck in personally wasn’t for me and there were several management and supervisor problems.
good,Check receipts handle customer complaints let management know of any problems at the front  hardest part of the job is not being able to move around a lot I was mainly at the doors
good,I was treated fairly well however I saw some of my  associate friend s treated in my  Opinion was unfair I thought the bottom dollar was for more important then working to resolve work issues
good,"It's been a few years since I worked there so things may have changed since then. At the time I was there, the team was extremely understaffed. Too much work for too little money resulted in a lot of turnover."
good,I was a Department Manager of four departments and was only making $13 after 6 years. The lines are always long due to not having cashiers and so management is pulled away to cover the lines. The family atmosphere is a positive as you can always fine someone who is willing to make you laugh or smile.
good,I enjoyed this job but it was long standing on the feet.  I was a part of the management team.  It can sometimes be difficult to be in a mid-management position.  As a CSM was required to support those under me and do what were asked of them over me.  It can feel as if pulled in multiple directions.  I was a policy person but learned based off of different experiences it was okay to not always stick to policy which was my issue.  It was a pleasure to work with the people and see new things daily and I was hungry for knowledge so learned other jobs as well. I did not like hours changed often and at times ended up doing other jobs just to get hours needed to make ends meet.
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay and benefits were reasonable. I will probably re apply to this company .  I would recommend this company to someone looking for a decent job.
good,I recently was a student in college and my store was incredibly flexible in giving me the time I needed for school and other activities. The managers that I have had have almost always listened or tried their best to fix problems where they can.
good,"In walmart you live a lot of stress the customers the supervisors are heavy and you have to fight with them because sometimes they do not give you rest, apart they are two of 15 minutes and  1 hour of lunch, if you do not have open availability to any schedule in the day and night you do not get full time and enough hours"
good,I would recommend this workplace at your own risk. I loved working with my coworkers but the job can be overwhelming due to lack of management. Their moto is treating everyone like family but they don't really go by it.
good,it was a good work experience for me....to meet new people in a new environment.....I enjoyed coming to work....it was a productive and fun workplace.
good,It was fun working here but its true what everyone says management has its favorites and will put them to advance rather than someone who has experience in the job.
good,The Mgrs honestly need some training In Leadership and being professional. They do not handle situtations well and do not take employees seriously. I liked the vacation time.
good,My experience was not a good one for the most part the management is poor ..the reason i left my job is because my girlfriend was having my son and they wouldn't let me off for the birth..
good,I works as a unloader. loved my job and coworkers. we were able to get overtime and  I was lead on my shift. I was able to stay consistence and I wanted to get a better career opportunity.
good,"Walmart is a retail job, and it shows. The schedule is likely to change at the drop of a hat, coustomers are likely to confront you for little reason, it's quite slow paced with bursts of work, over all it's an okay place to work but not something worth a career."
good,While working at walmart i will say management was hit or miss. typical day was either relaxed and get the job done or stressful. it wasnt consistent. i do not have plans to return to this position because of harassment that took place when addressed was overlooked and pardoned. but when i was apart of a different altercation i was let go. i did not leave on good terms but can return at this time. i have no plans to return unless a higher position or part time cashier
good,Walmart pays well they expect a great deal out of their Associates they have the same corporate mentality is any other Corporation but they are extremely clean and insist on keeping everyone updated with classes and assessments
good,"Walmart provided me with dissatisfaction early on in my employment. It was a company in which provided hours that were inconsistent, which then provided inconsistent pay checks. Living without consistancy made paying bills a hassle, and can even damper payment reputation."
good,"Walmart was accommodating with your schedule, they would work with you with the scheduling.They give people a chance when other employers would not. Management was alright nothing to brag on"
good,Must be able to meet there goals of packages per hr. These numbers are almost always set wat to high for an average person to meet. They always are looking for a reason to fire associates that are making top rate on the co pay scale to replace with new hires at lower pay rate.
good,I enjoyed chatting with customers as I checked them out.  Managers were good about getting to me when I needed them.  The worst part of the job was not being able to have my sick days excused with doctors notes.
good,was a good place to work but the managers was not as much understanding as it should be. your scheculed is not what they say it could be and the customers were rude.
good,"Flexible hours, good co-workers.  Walmart gave me the opportunity to switch jobs within the company without losing my seniority.  Walmart liked to hire from within"
good,If you get a good manager in your department you can do well for yourself and the company. If you don't you will be told that you can be replaced at any time.
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work if you really need to find work. Some of the other employees were less than pleasant, but customers tend to be friendly, unless you work at the registers."
good,Most co workers are friendly and the hours are pretty flexible as long as you have open availability. I wanted to move up and was told there was no openings for management when they're were two open management positions. I suspect they didn't want me to move up because they want me to stay as a Tire Technician. Management can be pretty bad as in they are bad with communication and are hard to find. You are also told to not have unapproved overtime or you will be written up so just something I thought I should add.
good,Walmart is making a lot of changes right now and the future is very unstable .There are lots of hard working employees that work there. Some time changes is good but not all at once.
good,management expects you to complete work for two or more within a 32 hour work week. they are cutting back full time employment only part time available.
good,some managers will have you do multiple peoples jobs and get mad that your section wasn't finished.  the hours were decent and some of the staff were friendly
good,A lot of chatting with customers. Unload and loading in the back for an hour to 2 hrs. A little bit of heavy stuffs. A lot of nice people and friendly friends.
good,Work at a decent fast pace to stock shelves. Decent co workers that help with the team building of CAP 2 team and flexible hours and shifts. Decemt pay for a starting job.
good,good money the workers are the only one that made the job enjoyable other than that its ok place to work they do offer paid lunch sometimes and free breakfast
good,"It’s a good first job for starters, but the position I was , I could only be part time, and I need to be full time in order to be financially good. All the workers and managers are extremely nice there and it was a good experience."
good,"Lack of communication with each other . make sure everywhere clean . make sure you speak to your customers make them feel home. Making sandwich, pinwheels, wraps and salads. Make sure the areas cleaning . we slide cheeses and meats for the customers."
good,I started at Walmart as an overnight stocker. Upon starting I was switched to a more intense job of gathering all of the cardboard breaking it down and compressing it into bales. I was not compensated for this job switch.
good,"Employees at their designated location, sometimes there would be an employee who would attemept to question other employee's job description. I learned to know my job description and not interfere with any other employees job. Management at WalMart needs to improve, as they need to know to need and observe their employees more. The hardest part of the job are other employees involvng themselves in other employees job and not minding their own work. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and obtaining experiences."
good,Management needs to work on communication.  Some managers were disrespectful. And others micromanaging. Some employees had favoritism others other we're lazy.
good,i worked nights cleaning floors and bring in groosery carts as long as idid my job and did not stand around eveybody left me alone the way i like it after being on atruck
good,"A lot of fighting, stealing taking place. The management doesn’t care whether or not you have something planned those days they try to schedule you. They schedule you on days against your availability."
good,Walmart is a great store and work place.  I learned how to zone and assemble some furniture.  I went beyond expectations to help customers to to the right aisle to find what they need.  This experience leveraged my knowledge about products and encouraged me to learn more and more about the whole store products
good,"Typical day is fast pace. There is always work and you never run out. From stocker, to cashier, to meet and greeting customers. Never a dull moment to work."
good,I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with.  I appreciated the Family leave of absence as I am my mothers primary care giver.  I disliked working every holiday.
good,The job required standing on hard floors for extended periods of time. Caliber of customers varied greatly from very pleasant to obnoxious. There didn't appear to be a clear path to move up in the company.
good,It can be a stressful place to work and there is a lot of pressure to perform at a very high level. At times there is a lack of support. The overall Company offers great benefits and has a strong culture. There is a strong sense of job security.
good,"Layed back day, good pay for entry level. The people there are nice and easy to get along with. People are fairly friendly and are willing to help ach you."
good,"I was a jack of all trades i was doing everything from putting patio sets together, assembled bikes, tv stands, stocked the freezer unloaded trucks you name it i can do it"
good,Company good place to work if like greeting assisting people with service. Work environment very busy and pleasant. Place where you could grow with the company.
good,Every task was time sensitive which was not mentioned in training. My first day I was just stuck on the floor without any direction. I was very disappointed. Other employees simply ignored me. Needless to say I didn't shop there for a while.
good,It was easy being a cashier if you could handle the screaming kids or cranky customers. Every store I worked at had a different type of atmosphere. It's been awhile since I worked there so things may have changed since then.
good,My work experience is the best training when it comes to managing time and keeping up with multiple priorities. My work experience teaches employees about challenges of working with others. They learn to actively listen to others ideas and to compromise when those ideas conflict their own interests. For me an employees with the right training and skills will be more effective and add value to the organization.
good,muchas preferencias en walmart pilares no hay oportunidad de crecimiento tarda bastante les tienes que agradar
good,"Wal-Mart is an okay place to work."
good,Check progress of shop invoices.  Check requirements for completion of existing and future invoices. Check inventory levels and order if needed. Assist in shop as needed to maintain flow of customers
good,It wasn't the best place to work.  All you had to do was make sure all sections assigned to you were cleaned and in order.  The management at the time was alright.
good,Go to work and do your job. It is a ok. Every job you go to has its problems. It all falls go to mind your business and do your job. You should be okay.
good,"Not good work life balance , swing shift so you won’t be in a steady schedule good thing is a deluxe comes out 3 weeks at a time, can often trade with a coworker"
good,"Fast paced some days, manager could be a jerk.  Enjoyed meeting new people.  Tasks varied from pushing carts to cleaning to checking so it was a change of pace which was nice."
good,Great first time job. Always room for growth within the company. Pay can be great as long as you work hard and show you are willing to advance within the company.
good,This job is decent. You are expected to work and meet all expectations. You may do tasks that may be out of your job description but the pay is decent.
good,"the manager was very poor at his job,he would try to get me to deal with work problems when it was his job to deal with it when it also had to do with other workers and drama"
good,"Good environment, some good people, a lot of hard days when people is missing you working twice hard. they do the best for them, if you're just a cashier you don't have word, you can say just Yes or then you can go and do a worse task."
good,its a very fun place to work. greeting customers. get to know all kind of people. multi task and a very busy store. time goes fast witch I liked that.
good,It’s a good company to work for but I just don’t like how they changed up there attendants policy. I been on medical leave and it’s a hassle to get put back on the schedule.
good,Had certain workers neglect work responsiblities to gossip or stay on the phone leaving another worker to help handle something that isn't their responsibility. Management did nothing about it and never listened to opinipns of employees.
good,Always had fun at work with my co-workers. Always had something to do to stay busy. Department was always full staffed. Management was always flexible with the employees.
good,Worked in receiving years ago.  Fast-paced logistics operation.  The best part about it was the scheduled breaks and lunch.  The management was very motivated to achieve goals.
good,"The best part of this position was having security and there was always something to do. On the other hand, our department was understaffed and the amount of work became overwhelming."
good,"Long hours, sufficient pay, physically demanding, face paced working conditions, family atmosphere, demanding management, wide array of customers, varied job duties"
good,"Being a cashier for Walmart is as awful as any customer service job, but that isn't entirely the company's fault. The only thing that American companies could do better would be to allow their employees to sit down not just when they're medically required to."
good,"Walmart was my first job and it allowed me to understand how things operate. I helped load/unload the trucks, which was the most physical part of the job. Ultimately, the work load expected was a lot so I ended up leaving shortly after. Although I did have some great coworkers and managers."
good,"Not the worst place to work, but like everywhere else, incompetent management can ruin your experience. as of late, walmart has become more relaxed with it's policies"
good,"if you don't mind working in retail, then I would recommend it. But as far as working there personally, it's not the place to be. The customers you deal with aren't worth the pay and the workload wasn't the headache. I recommend as a summer job for a college student but beyond that, you're better off looking somewhere else."
good,"The typical day include stocking, cleaning, and assisting customers with finding items at a rapid pace to continue an effective rate of work. Management styles are different among management. The hardest part of the job is keeping pace on an assignment."
good,"have had good and bad days with Wal-Mart as anyone has at any job. I have worked for 3 different Wal Mart stores and they all are different in many ways, yet the same in other ways."
good,They are somewhat flexible with the schedules. Great potential. Great opportunities. Good benefits. Great time off with vacation and short term disability and long-term disability.
good,I have worked for Walmart for a long time. I have a physical disability but I love to work and I am smart. I feel that Walmart tolerates those of us with disabilities and does not try to help us advance. I have been trying to transfer for months and they have not done anything to try and help me at all.
good,I met new people out there. My co-wokers are very friendly at walmart. I really liked my job but I had to moved on to something bigger and better than Walmart.
good,"Very nice and easy job, and is great to work around your school. Could use some work on the management. Often had getting in touch with management. A lot of favoritism."
good,"Stays busy, always changing things round 1 min after another. management changes Non-Stop always promoting people. Just wish they work better with peoples availability"
good,Cutting peoples jobs out completely and placing more responsibility on already overworked associates.  It has become more about the company rather than the customers and associates.
good,I had my days working here couldn't  see myself here for long the pay was okay but not enough they did give great hours and I got over time almost eve
good,"Walmart is a great company to work but it has it's draw back for it's partime employees. Most importantly, they do not offer many full time positions outside of being a manager. Although if you work 35-40 hours for about 3 months they are supposed to make you full time but I can't vouche for this as I worked up to 8 months as getting 40 hours and they didn't want to make me full time. Antoher thing is the rate at which you earn raises. In my 6 plus years of being there I'm sure I've actually only accumulated about $1.20 in raises not including the bump up to their minimum wage from 10 to 11."
good,It was a good job it just didn't pay enough for me and my bills you could advance in Walmart but it just wasn't very paying enough the benefits were good  the raises wasn't as progressive as other jobs I've had  I wasn't getting paid enough for the amount of work i did and it did have there certain picks for better jobs opportunities inside the store some mangers had there favoritism in certain betterment inside the company and that wasn't fair compared to work i did and what I think I deserved but i stuck it through until I found something better
good,Walmart is an okay place to work for someone who needs a job for a few years. I would not recommend this company for a career unless you are a college graduate in the management trainee program.
good,"Management was always willing to help me with my schedule due to college. However, the work is repetitive, although it is not particularly challenging in regards to my position."
good,"Overall, working at Walmart was a decent experience. It wasn't the sort of thing for me as I work best as part of a team, but my role (cashier) didn't really seem to be designed as that sort of thing."
good,"When I first started off it was okay, but then a new store manager came and changed everything. After that everything went downhill. My supervisor was okay, but she left because it got stressful."
good,"It was a great experience but I wouldn't want to work any any Walmart again.They are very messy and unprofessional,I feel like it's a lot if things that they shouldn't share but of course they don't care and management let people do whatever."
good,"Working at Walmart wasn’t bad it was really easy the work was simple but it could be frustrating at times, the people were okay they weren’t the best to work with"
good,walmart was an okay job. sometimes it could be very stressful. sometimes it was very laid back. you meet great people and you  meet bad. walmart just gets the bills paid
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart and meeting new people. I enjoy helping my co-worker and supporting them when they need me. I go out my way, so I can be a great worker."
good,I wouldnt recommend this job because its not worthy of the customers being rude and do whatever they want to you. Its really tough working here. Its the not environment for me
good,"In my experience at Walmart, it is one of the few companies that allow an employee to come in as an entry level employee and advance to store manager."
good,the pay was to low to say with any longer had to start looking for a new job after the frist week just to pay bills on time but it was a good place to work just needed more pay at the time
good,"Moved up in less than 2 years. Started out as a temp and moved up to management in 17 months.  Some managers are better than others. If there's a lazy employee they get away with everything so if you're a good worker, you get their work to do too! Oh yeah! Hour lunch, 2 15 min breaks."
good,This was my first job fresh out of the military while i was going to college and i worked on the summer remodeling crew (yet i was still considered a sales associate).  It was a fairly decent job that honestly didn't pay bad for the job itself. The only problem i really had with it was i worked third shift and employees are required to clock out for an hour lunch break during the day making your overall time spent there 9 hours and frankly i didn't want to take a lunch at 3 in the morning and while i understand why they did this so there were shift overlaps and there would never be a point where there would be no one in the store it was a little annoying.
good,"My shift was from 2pm to 11pm. The freight truck arrives at 2 everyday and we unload everything off onto pallets. After that is done, we go out and stock everything on the shelves."
good,it was alright.  Good second job to work at.  Great management experience although.  I learned how to manage different teams and meet deadlines for all kinds of tasks.
good,Different jobs are for different people but if you really want to work at walmart then go for it. You will be asked to move at a very fast pace under certain circumstances.
good,"The hours are okay, but not much room to advance. Trying to work for a management position, but constantly passed over for someone with less management skill and little customer ethics. Main staff and lower management is good, but upper management shows little care about how they run things and play politics with who they want promoted. If you want to have a career with Walmart, it's up to you, but Walmart is not the best company to pursue it."
good,Its a good first job for anyone that is still in school since they offer part time work and have flexible hours. there is not a lot of room for advancement there though.
good,"You can do raises, get moved to a different position with higher pay, work your way up to management, easy people to work with, fun,  new experiences."
good,Easy pull out pellets break it down stock face product. Once completed out product back on pellet and put it away in back. Lunch one hour and was out by morning.
good,"Management seemed very lazy and pretty much clueless about how to do anything in the areas that they were responsible for.  Co workers could be lazy and not motivated, and management very uncaring"
good,It was an ok place to work I wored several positions  Learned cashier stuff produce.  Management was fun   Heavy produce for female guys were lazy  fun people to work with
good,"The most enjoyable part of my position is dealing with customers and their children."
good,Everything about Walmart to me is ok. We receive all three breaks management team to me are nice and helpful. Working overnight is non stressful the pace of  the customers are steady and I like that
good,I loved my job when I worked in Columbus. The managers appreciated you and didn't just treat you like a you didn't matter. When I transferred to a different store the managers didn't appreciate you and treated you like scum and they were better than everyone.
good,"The work is steady, always something to do. The coworkers are friendly and helpful. Management knows how to get employees amped for todays tasks and duties."
good,Walmart is an ok job. Hours are decent and very flexible. Great team and great management.  Very organized. Walmart provides plenty of great benefits.
good,Walmart taught me a lot of things like using power equipment to dealing with customer. There is no shortage of learning experiences to be had from a lot of people.
good,Working at this cmpany was my first experience. They trained you well and allowed room for small mistakes and were good at helping you through. During my time there i saw multiple mangers and each time the ways of walmart would change with each one. Its was decent starter job also.
good,I had a bad manager they where very rude and didn’t understand anything I got very little training and had no support what so ever I was pregnant and fired because I had got sick
good,I got the job at Walmart because it was close and they were hiring. Now while it is not the best place to work I would not recommend it if you have other options. My opinion might be biased because of the management and location that I worked at.
good,"Walmart was only a temporary job was i was in undergraduate school (college) and looking to advance my career and ministry as a Minister of the Gospel. Since then I have relocated from Nashville, TN to Atlanta, GA and now have a Master of Divinity degree from Morehouse School of Religion - ITC as of May 12th, 2019."
good,"A typical day at work for Walmart consists of managing long term goals versus the short term goals that pop up on the fly.  The management team is at times unhelpful in finding solutions to all problems that arise.  The hardest part of the job is working constantly with people, in a large retail environment not everyone is going to be friendly."
good,My manager that was over me was the worst one there.No one liked them and they thought they could treat everyone like badly and when we had an issue or anything they would always put us off on someone else or act like she didn't have time for you nor cared. Wouldn't even look you in the eye while they talked to you.
good,Managers can be pretty bad and most of them have unreal expectations when it comes to working. overall good company has its ups and downs but this is definitely more of a temporary job for the summer and not a full time
good,"Working at Walmart is exactly as you would expect. Pay is fair, dozens of various supervisors to report to and nearly a hundred co-workers per store. Strict Corporate Protocols."
good,Working at walmart was quite stressful. The management there instead of assisting you looked down on you for needing help. I will not work for them again and will not recommend anyone I know to work there.
good,It was a good place but we were short staff a lot of the times and we had to call other people to come help us. I kept my area cleaned. I would pick up trash around my register
good,wal-mart was one of the best jobs i've had. they offer competitive pay great bennies. if you are not happy with your job you can transfer to a new position in store.
good,"A typical work day was fairly easy you were told what to put out on the floor and when to get it all done. While doing your job you had to stay alert to any customer needing help or any accidents that might occur. I learned how to work just about every department in the store and was always called on by other departments when they needed extra help. Management was normally ok some of them would go out of their way to help you either at work or would listen to you if you had a personal issue and needed someone to talk to. However, sometimes management would pick favorites and that made it hard to move up in areas of the store. If you were their best worker and you wanted to move somewhere else, you had a 50% chance on whether or not they let you go. The workplace was ok but a lot of times it was like being in high school dealing with drama. The best thing to do was to limit who you talked to and what was said there. Keep personal issues to yourself and away from the workplace. The hardest part of the job for me was every department would call on me at least 5 times a day every 10-15 minutes to help them while I would try to do my other jobs. This lead to more overtime for me and less time with my family. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was I did make a handful of really good friends that I could count on, and most of the time the pay was good."
good,"The work environment is what you expect from working at Walmart. Overtime work is available but discouraged. Manager friendliness can be hit or miss. Overall, nothing particularly good or bad."
good,"The people i worked with were generally friendly. The staff was on the low side of full, could've used more workers. They expected certin tasks to be finished by the end of the night that were almost impossible doing by yourself when given the correct amount of break time."
good,a typical day at work was very productive and although busy very well organized. what i learn while working has been how to work in a tram environment and as well as time management skills. management was always very attentive to the needs and concerns of each and every employee. the workplace culture was a team that work well and supported each other in all daily tasks. hardest part of the job was to always want to help and so as much as could with in the 8-10 hour shifts. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and accomplishing personal and professional goals while growing with the company.
good,Fast friendly work environment. constant motion. management is not on one accord or very helpful. working overnight make it hard to communicate with personnel when they only work day hours
good,"Well, one of the main reason i get up every morning is because i need my job but the people i work with directly are some of the best people ive meet in a while. I've learned alot about my job since ive been there. the information ive learned helps with training new associates.The best thing about my job is the amount of teamwork we have, we have some of the best DM and supervisors probably within the entire company."
good,"was a nice place to work but your hours were never the same."
good,the job was ok it never was a boring night at walmart there was all ways somethinng new happing there and the hours where good you show up and work you got paid and if you dident you dident get paid its that simple there
good,"Honestly, this job is probably a buffer to a better job later if you aren't totally committed. Overall, the entire staff is like one big family, which is to say that while it can clannish and even drama filled, everyone is working towards common goals and trying not to get in anyone's way."
good,Cool place  but all these new rules take away from the workers to benefit the managers .. could be paid more.. need more ot.. need to change the PTO system
good,It was fun at first but I got burnt out by year 2. I left at year 5 because nothing seemed like it was getting better. I wouldn't recommend this long term. Short term it's pretty good.
good,interesting place to work but the benefits were decent overall not bad customers were always happy coming in and out of the store it have a wide range of opportunities for all people.
good,It was an okay experience working at the Walmart. Becareful if you pick a position you want to do can be switched anytime by a manager. I was doing stocking and then suddenly they put me in cashier without training me.
good,Everything was good except management. they talk down to you and treat you like your a child. I enjoyed stocking the freezers overnight alot. The discount on purchases was cool too.
good,This job was quite the experience. Even though it was temporary it helped me make money and earn skills I would carry with me onto my job at the Hilton.
good,I have worked here for 2 years. WalMart has always helped me when I am struggling. They are always willing to work with my school schedule. I always felt my work was always appreciated. I had made many friends here. The environment was always relaxed but we did our work diligently.
good,Job seemed ok in beginning  buy as time went on management began to micromanage. Flow associates should get more pay that everyone else with the amount of work completed daily.
good,"Some times the CSM'S would not give breaks or lunch on time and there were a few cashiers including myself with blood sugar problems and I actually got yelled at by one of the CSM's for turning my light off and rerouting customers to another line because I felt like I was going to faint. cuz my blood sugar got THAT LOW that particular day. then you got some nice customers and mean ones, I started each of my shifts with a neutral attitude and I usually ended neutral or aggravated."
good,"Not a career. Flexible hours. Poor work environment. Great pharmacy system in place to protect PHI, alert interactions or cautions, very efficient system."
good,Walmart gets very busy tends to be under staffed but over all an ok place to work pay is good discount is good management is good some custamer concerns but again ocer all an ok place
good,Walmart is an average under paid working environment. Walmart is very micromanaged and strict.  There is no margin for error as a cashier .  I have no further comments on my past experience at Walmart .
good,The job was good for experience with customer service and also learning to stock and make price changes. They also had good coworkers that were willing to complete tasks.
good,"I used to love working, "
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. The CSMs were nice but any other manager besides the store manager were always really rude to everyone. I would have come back to work here as I liked my co-workers, but overall a lot of the managers treated you like you had no life outside of Wal-Mart."
good,"I'm full time with 2 days off in a row each week, but I start work at a different time  each day.  I only see my 12yr old son maybe 3 times a week.  I do customer service returns so a lot of heavy lifting and frustrating interaction with customers all day.  I'm physically drained and ache all over at the end of each shift.  I don't think I'm being paid enough for what I go through and would jump at the chance for a sit down job.  My co-workers are awesome and they make my job bearable.  The management is lazy at best except for maybe 2 who really try. but they rotate managers every 6 months so the good ones always leave.  They do cut backs and sometimes entire departments are done away with leaving the employees scrambling for another position."
good,Walmart was a good place to start off at if you are getting a job right out of high school. I mean the only time it had gotten a little stressful was during the holidays but that's it.
good,"It's ok"
good,"When it comes to Walmart, some would say good things or bad things, depends on the person. In my experience I had a little of both with managers and associates. There were a few managers who were not so helpful or flat out lazy, which made the experience not so good. But there are a lot of managers who have no problem ""getting there hands dirty"" when it came to rearranging merchandise and or shelves, helped out unloading trucks, etc."
good,It's like any other job that has its ups and downs. Personally I would just keep my head down do your job the best you can and then go home. You get your share of rude customers and great customers same with coworkers.
good,"It was a good place to work, management was alright. It was definitely time for a change though. Sporting goods paid alright the customers were okay all in all."
good,"Fun work place."
good,the work place was okay the people i worked with made the days go by faster. the managing was all over the place. it was nearly impossible to find anyone.
good,"The typical day at work would include making sure the food was stocked, slice meat, cook the chickens and ribs for the hot bar, or bake the bread for the day"
good,"We punch in, get a shopping cart and start shopping for customers. Everything is divided into different categories, produce, ambient, meats, general, frozen, and chilled. Poor management though if well managed it would be an amazing place."
good,I worked at Walmart for over 5 years. In those 5 years i never got a raise for work hard. The only time i would get a raise is because the company was being pressured into giving us a yearly raise.
good,Hard working long hours boring sonetimes its alot to process at one time but you will catch on quick pay is good and the customers are so very nice and respectful
good,Walmart have great benefits. And discounts and appreciate their employees. The face paced environment was awesome but taking the groceries back or working in the baby department was not easy
good,"i only worked for a short time it was seasonal work it was for Christmas time , people we're friendly , i enjoyed working there . I would recommend it"
good,Work every part of Wal-Mart very tiring long hours low pay I would say the good thing about working is getting to meet new people and Wal-Mart does have everything you need.
good,"Tolerable and easy-going on most days when not micro managed by managers and supervisors. Every day consisted of unloading truck(s), stocking shelves, and providing customer service while helping out other employees."
good,"Out of the ten years I have worked at walmart for, I have learned how to treat people more nicely and respectfully. I met great co-workers who support and I am truely grateful for that."
good,I learned alot from walmart like electric pallet jacks and cardboard bailers how to call the ATF for fire arm sales and how to deal with stressful situations. But the management was not the best when i worked there. We never got bonuses when they was supposed to be gotten for everyone but management got theirs. Things like that is the reason i left.
good,Didn’t ever get credit for the work that was put in. I didn’t really like management I felt like they were disrespectful and were under qualified for the job.
good,"Laid back, easy work. Got moved a lot, but  it wasn't  terrible,  the managers are understanding and decent help to employees. Overall good environment"
good,"Good place to work, depending on your position it can get stagnant at times. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who is looking for learning something new every day."
good,"Its was an easy repetitive job, unloading trucks. After sorting the merchandise and putting it out on the shelves we would work bins in the back which is a relaxing part of the job."
good,Cool employees to work with job gets done  on time and orderly fashion everyday from the truck on a roller separated on pallets to the floor later stock on shevles
good,"Working at Walmart just became a ""going through the motions"" kind of job, the self-check out position was a bit dangerous because of how threatening some of the customers can become, the pay wasn't nearly enough for the hassle you go through every day"
good,"I Zoned my Department; keeping the department clean and organized	"
good,I liked the fast paced environment. I enjoyed helping others. I did not enjoy the hours and days I was working. They had a flexible schedule and I would like to have a set schedule.
good,Managment needs better communications to learn to show their employees how to work hard and as a team. They could benefit if they treated employees with respect.
good,"Es buena hay crecimiento , la gente puede tener otros puestos"
good,"I worked as a cashier, and it was tough on me having to stand long hours 2 1/2 to 3 hours before I got a break, had to bag cart full of groceries which sometimes puts pain on your back. Asking for Walmart reward master card was difficult, I did the asking just was not good enough for the manager I am not a Master Card sales person."
good,"Working at Walmart is a challenge. They are often changing policies. During my employment I have worked some great associates. As a Salary Manager you do receive a good vacation pay, based on years of service."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but is very stressful. You have your days when some customers can say what they want to you and not treat you like a human being.
good,It was just a place to meet and have conversations with the customers for my day was busy and non-stop I did learn a lot about how to be a more effective worker and be better at customer service. It was not always easy but I manage to be good at my job before I became ill. Management was different but I learn to respect and gain knowledge from them.Sometimes solving problems for others help you to solve issues with yourself. I wouldn't trade the experience and help I received along the way.
good,"Uma empresa razoável para se trabalhar, trabalho muito exaustivo e também pouca segurança."
good,Working at Walmart has its privileges I would like a ring recommend Walmart  just starting out back in 2003 I was a a run for Walmart dinner was on loader AKA 2018 v i was an overnight stocker
good,"Just feel underappreciated, and like I'm not getting paid properly for my work. The people are ok, and the job is pretty easy, depending on the position, could be very routine"
good,I have nothing to say about it . I would rather move on to talking about helping me find work . Because despite my experience at Walmart I don't have anything further to say about it.
good,Typical day at Wal-Mart pharmacy. Customer service.  Interaction with insurance companies and doctor's office's. Computer work.  Answering questions. Running registers.
good,"The managers are very judgemental and clearly hold grudges. I had to quit because I was about to go into a semester taking 7 courses so I had no time to balance school and work. I tried to come back, talked personally to the manager (who I know) and haven't heard anything back. "
good,I can give positive or negative things about working for Walmart. It was a good atmosphere to work. Sometimes you get some Rowdy customers. Management was respectful and Always by the book.
good,"If you were full time and you worked in the right department, great. If you weren't full-time, good luck getting hours. Also enjoy being put into a department that you aren't trained for. My first day, I went to do CBL's(Computer Based Learning) and was told that because the maintenance staff called out, I would have to be on maintenance... by myself... with no training. They fully believe in the sink or swim scenario and aren't afraid to throw you in the water to see which one you choose. Now the sales associates, most of them are great. You get a few that don't work unless someone important is around but for the most part, everyone busts tail. You will make friends that you can share struggles with. But on the management level, hmm... they are there just make sure it ""looks"" good. The products are sometimes put in the wrong place on purpose, which can lead to the customer getting the wrong pricing, and can also lead to inventory believing we don't have an item, but we do!"
good,"Typical corporate culture, alot of politics, plenty of room for growth and advancement. I would not go back to work for Walmart if at all possible. There is no work-life balance."
good,I am very much a people person. My favorite part of my job was pleasing the customers.The people I worked with we're great. It was very easy to get along with them.
good,"j'ai bien aimée mon expérience chez walmart, la raison pourquoi je ne veut pas y retourné est seulement le salaire qui est trop petit pour avoir seulement un seul emploie."
good,"I worked in the freezer section. Very cold but you are provided with gloves, coat, insulated bibs, etc. Everyone there was very pleasant to work with. It is very fast paced and overall will really take a toll on you if you arent fit."
good,I worked as a online grocery associate . It was a face paced job that requires a lot of walking and customer service. The experience was a pretty good experience overall
good,"Day starts in mid afternoon. You come in and unload the General merchandise truck on average takes roughly 2hrs. Sort merchandise by department on to pallets or on to carts.(consumables). Take those carts over to the grocery dock area and combine the product that comes in the grocery mix pallets. Then assigned an aisle and proceed to put out. Management for my particular store is decent in my opinion. But Walmart doesn't test for drugs during employment hiring and some hires show this lack of testing. "
good,Its walmart people. you have heard the horror stories and i only worked there seasonal in 2014. so I bet a lot of things have changed since then. I had an ok time working there. I couldnt talk one day because my tongue was swollen and they accused me of sticking my tongue out at people to show them.
good,A lot is expected.  More and more labor cuts.  Injuries are ignored.  I feel like I am just a number.  Gossip is a large problem and is not frowned upon.  High turnover rate (as retail is).
good,"Working at an entry level position, in collaboration with my fellow associates, we"
good,It was a good place to work for I just had to relocate. And most of the time the management was pretty good and the fellow works was good too. Just had to relocate
good,"Walmart was a good paying job. The staff, the employees seem to be a good unit. The cashiers are very hardworking, probably the most difficult department."
good,Good place to work. Walmart needs a better way to climb up in the company.  Their best quality as a company is their paid time off policies. Walmart works with your schedule.
good,The environment was fast-paced and competitive. I felt the working hours were a bit much but I needed the income. I would not work at Walmart again if I needed to.
good,"Wal-mart pays a person really good but, it is a unhealthy stressful environment to work in. It would drag you along if you let it. Also, the system and how things are ran are unfair. no sick time, none acceptable doctor's notes, and the work goes at a unreasonable pace that puts you in a lose lose situation which would make you average a write-up a week."
good,The overall management was very poor. They showed favoritism to lots of employees and when it was rime to actually handle important business it never got done.
good,"There's always a need for change in our system, and management not only doesn't do it, but doesn't seem to be bothered by their upset workers and customers. You get scheduled from time to time outside your availability or maximum/minimum required hours. Management will USE YOU to cover or help in areas that are above your pay grade. Not to mention that part is illegal. It's poor management, no bonuses, and getting treated poorly by some managers and most customers that really makes it not worth your time applying."
good,wasnt to bad of a job I guess you could say. the only thing that sucked was the managers would never get at the lazy people for not working but would push people who did work hard to their limit. They really took advantage of the people who worked hard and they didnt care.
good,"I actually love working for Walmart. Unfortunately, due to flex scheduling and no work life balance  I am currently looking for something more stable."
good,Walmart was a great place to work however I wish there were more hours and benefits. Management Could be more friendly and promote more employees. The attendance policy is very strict.
good,its a good job with great pay! i just wanted something on days so i can be home with my kids at night.. it pays really well.. just tired of working nights
good,Walmart is a well mannored place and maintained well. The place has great people to help you all around the store. They dont have great management. But the place is a great working place
good,didnt mind working at walmart at all. I like people and like working. I enjoyed meeting new people and doing my job well. Did not have a chance to do much else. I was also working part time as a housekeeper.
good,"was able to switch jobs and work in a totally different area when the area I started out working at was not a good fit for myself, bosses were supportive of family obligations"
good,I love walamrt and enjoy working there but unfortunately there was times where I didn’t care for it but recently I heard they improve in pay raised management and customer service.
good,This is a fine place to work. The time that you are not at work but in the store is your own time and should be treated as such. But I enjoy talking to people.
good,"A typical clock in at 9pm followed by about 10 to 20 minutes of running on the cash register. I would do reshop, collecting misplaced items throughout the store followed by categorizing reshop items by department. Myself and other cashiers would take turns running the register and putting reshop items back/ filling out claims until everything was done. "
good,"If you don't mind seeing depressed and lifeless people on a daily basis, and working minimum wage, go for it."
good,"The Walmart Distribution Center is a great place to work if you need money; you can make up to 22/h plus incentives. The work is hard, but doable. The managers are horrible, and not doable. There’s a grey area between doing the best you can do and doing what’s expected of you that you constantly have to fall into or you won’t like the consequences. For example, the managers will get on you for only doing what’s expected of you but will not applaude you or recognize when you do the best you can do. I have been working there for 2 years constantly outperformering my coworkers and giving my all every night just to have the people in the grey area get picked for the easiest jobs such as wrapping, chase work, cleaning, and training. It’s a very frustrating environment in which one who always goes above and beyond will not feel at home. If you want a regular job where laziness and avergeness are applauded, by all means go for it. But if you’re one of those people who want to show the world what you can do, and what kind of person you are and how hard you can work for goals, go to another corporation."
good,"You were expected to work over three other departments, and good luck getting help from your coworkers. The department would hire high school students that had no interest in labor and customer service."
good,"Good job, easy money, show up and get payed. Management was horrible though. Had 6 different managers and different supervisors. Scheduling system was messed up and often times there was incorret staffing."
good,If you are looking for a job to barely be able to pay your bills this is not for you.  I normally do Information Technology work  so this is not really what I'm looking for for an extended period of time to just make ends meet
good,I worked there for almost a year one problem I had was their attendance policy and then some managment had favorites and treated others differently in a bad way.
good,"Atendimento ao cliente,registrando suas compras e fazendo cobrança das mercadorias."
good,"If youre looking for a nice paying job with no experience, its a good place to go to. If you have a lot of experience though, you wont get paid for your experience."
good,"I had a few friends there, the hours were OK, and it was a steady pace, I liked working there sometimes, and there is some good people that worked there"
good,empresa muito boa de trabalhar aprendi muito  .....
good,You get the same pay formost entry level positions however the manager to employee treatment is very very position based but all in all there is opportunity to move up with in the company however it all depends on who is that locations store manager
good,Dealing with customers specially the angry ones was never an easy job but working in this years ago doing the same thing every day make me own it and enjoyed it.
good,es una buena empresa pero podria ser mejor en base al apoyo con los colaboradores
good,"El ambiente laboral es muy bueno tiene apoyo de tus pares y de tu jefatura, tiene una excelente estructura laboral a la hora de seguir procedimientos pero como toda empresa demasiado grande y se desordena muy rápido en la estructura laboral, es decir toda petición muy a lo amigo."
good,"I've been working at Walmart for almost 3 months now and it's not terrible. The salary is poor, management is satisfactory, but most people are kind and very friendly. I usually work closing shifts (3pm-11pm) which generally consists of stocking milk, eggs and whatever else needs to be stocked on the shelves. It is a simple job but it does get quite tedious at times. This job is good if you want to make a little extra money on the side, but I wouldn't recommend this position for full-time because it will definitely get boring. Overall, working in dairy/frozen is an easy job, however, it can be physically taxing on busier days."
good,"They set goals that are simply unattainable. They do a time study on a store that sells less goods and expect every store to be able to stock all the freight in that same time, regardless of how much there is."
good,very fast pace job the worst thing was trying to get your schedule changed when you needed it. most of the managers are not to understanding and the pay is very low
good,"I was let go due to ""insufficient revenue to keep you hired."" This was not a temp job offer. I worked on the GM side fo the store for 6 months. This time period was through the pre-winter holiday season through Jan and Feb (lowest revenue-generating months for retail) I was let go at the end of Feb with only one week's notice. Upon applying for Unemployment Walmart lied to MN UI about my reason for termination and I was put into a financially stressful time until I could appeal the decision over 2 months later."
good,"I got bad hours too often to hold the job, due to bad time management I had to work harder than normal to compensate for my absent co-workers. Overall I would not want to work there unless my hours were consistent."
good,12 hour shifts on the weekend shift and 10 hour shifts during the week. When work load is high they offer overtime. If no one picks up extra hours they will mandate hours.
good,"The Walmart in Redding was a good place to work at for those looking for a starting position, but that changed when the attendance policy changed. I could understand lowering it by 1 or 2 days but 4!? Thats ridiculous!"
good,I enjoyed working at wal-mart  i learned a lot about food and how to check dates and how to restock the shelves. Everyday was different and we had different task. which keep the job interesting.
good,"Overall working for walmart wasn't too bad, the work life balance wasn't for me being a single mother of 3 with one with special needs trying to balance work, school and home"
good,Hard to find a location with good management. Most are abusive I worked in five different locations and some managers were good but some others were terrible. They expect too much for what they pay.you can't use seik pay unless you use your vacation
good,"Stressful environment, lack of communication, poor staffing, unrealistic expectations all culminate in a stressful place to work regardless of how well you perform your job."
good,"my first manager was excellent she did really well when it came to doing her job sadly i dident get to know her much as she moved on to bigger and better things my second manager was"
good,"I just started working at this Walmart, so I honestly do not know why I am being asked to review this job. I was contacted withing the same week I applied so getting a job should be easy enough."
good,The environment and people were relaxed and fun to work with.  The hours and scheduling was often tough.  Work until 11pm and be back at 7am the next day.  Very tiring.
good,Good place to work good benifets but just wasnt my field of choice. Good management coworkers were nice good hours was on my own most of the time with is nice
good,"Its a great job if you enjoy always moving or doing something. Regular shifts for pickers were 5am-2pm and 6am-3pm. I was 6am-3pm, a full 8 hour shift with 1 hour lunch, working 40 hours a week, but the company still considered me part time. Anyone that isn’t a salaried member of management is considered part time. Online grocery itself is great but is naturally super stressful, even more so when you have customers demanding attention in person. I left because I was expected to handle in person customers while also maintaining my performance of 100 items per hour while picking. Its a totally feasible performance goal, but only if you dont have to constantly deal with customers. I also really disliked the direction walmart management is heading in. They’re planning to get rid of most, if not all, department managers and severely cutting down on assistant managers, leaving us beginner employees to do their job as well as our own while managing to still pay us essentially minimum wage. I did make 50¢ over minimum wage doing online grocery ($11.50 after the minimum increase at the beginning of 2019), but it still wasn’t nearly enough to try to move out on my own. Bottom line, walmart is a great first job and starting point, but dont be afraid to branch out after you’ve got 6 months experience. You can DEFINITELY do better once you can show you have some retail experience. Also just an FYI, its almost impossible to get a job at Target after working for Walmart. I’ve tried twice, my boyfriend that works at Walmart currently has tried 3 times, and many of my former coworkers had tried"
good,"Walmart is okay to have as a filler part time position, its very hard to make it a career and advance, the morality of employees is very questionable."
good,Clock in go to a register work for 2 hours take a break then work another 2 then take a lunch and repeat. Customers are very friendly as well are the coworkers.
good,"Can be a great place for the young and eager. Normally get a full 40 hours, but when they have the cases required for the day, they send you home. No warning, no pay unless you cover yourself with your PTO time. But you have to have the hours in your PTO to cover yourself for scheduled vacations. "
good,Learned alot nice coworkers moved areas nice managers . I would have like if they were more family oriented. I enjoyed it while I was there beside them not being to understanding.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, aunque mal sueldo en comparación al trabajo. -"
good,"Walmart is low pay and management don't help you when you need emergency leave. "
good,"Culture has shifted from what Sam Walton created. The days of feeling like part of a family and desire to make Walmart a career are over. They have moved towards a forced bell curve ranking system when calibrating their associates. So even if you are ""knocking it out of the park"", if someone else is doing it a little better, you could end up getting a ""Development Needed"" eval, which means no pay increase and no bonus."
good,"Certain jobs are incredibly easy while others not so much. Depending on the job, some things you have to deal with are excessive heat, constant pressure from management, and a sore body at the end of the day."
good,"The work place can be more organized and the managers need to be on the same page across the board. Also, the company need to be on process since they have a process."
good,"alot of hours with very little salary, the companies didn't like to hire associates, we where always understaffed but they expected us to get things done like a full crew would"
good,Management would pull you from one location to another and then complain when your work did not get done. If you attempted to explain what happened management would get upset and tell you if you don't like it to quit.
good,Taking phone calls every 3 minutes and hour. Two 15 minute  breaks paid and one hour lunch unpaid. Very busy on the phone. Meeting phone time production goals. The most enjoyable is having cook outs. A typical day at the call center is logging onto the computer to clock in. Setting phones and computers up to get ready to take massive amount of phone calls per day. The average phone calls are 8 minutes long to an hour based on the need of call. Start times very from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M and split shifts. Monday to Sunday.
good,Good place to interact and help the customers. I learned about how diversified are the needs of different people and how gratifying is to hear how grateful they were once you helped them.
good,The management could be better at communicating  with the other people in the company. I wish there was better benefits for everyone not just some. There are not enough hours to help struggling families.
good,hated working for ths place over worked and under paid to many chifes not enuff cot enuff indiana management sucks call making compalints does nothing
good,"It was a decent place to work and offered room for advancement. Can be unpredictable and chaotic w constantly shifting policies, equipment and characters."
good,Working at Walmart was a place you had to focus on your work and stay out the way of drama. It was a good place to work I enjoyed it my year in a half.
good,"Like any other jobs, pros and cons. Walmart was my first real job as full time. I went into Walmart with a desire to reach the top levels an employee can reach. I came to realize very quick that their inventory system was not what I liked. So it became stressful day by day. As kid with big dreams and high hopes to make something out of my day time just kept shrinking. Make this short it was good cause I was enjoying the overtime but most of the time I was forced to do the overtime to finish up tasks. All in all I'm grateful I went through that experience. Taught me a lot."
good,Walmart is a good company with good benefits good people and good vacation time .. very very strict on missing work most people don’t last very long ..
good,"They paid well at walmart.  I worked with a great team, I just didn't like the hours as I got older.  A lot of weekends and holidays worked here at walmart."
good,"A typical day at work-busy,fast paced,and alot of customers"
good,They have the basis for good work ethic and great strides in retail. The associate pool is to knowledgeable in retail to accomplish the results walmart would like. They want people on time limits as factories and presses do. In my opinion it's a great method but the associates are majority of people who dont take the job serious enough. This results in overload on good workers until they leave while bad associates stay for years
good,Good. Hours to late for me wasn’t my desired job. Wanted a different job in a different industry. Wanted to go into the cannibas industry   Not stocking shelves
good,"Walmart used to be a great company to work for. They are drastically changing the business. They have become less associate focused, which was something Sam Walton very strongly believed in and preached. Creating that work/life balance is becoming more difficult. The work load/expectations have increased without any extra help. It has become much harder to maintain company standards. Walmart is starting to adopt policies, like day stocking, which have failed miserably for every other retailer that has tried it."
good,"there are a lot of aspects about Walmart that are wonderful mainly my co workers my health insurance valued customers who have become friends however,there are a lot of drawbacks first and foremost is low pay"
good,"I started as a temp. and was kept on to work in dairy and frozen, but I also helped on register, stocking, customer service, unloading and loading trucks, and in any other department where help was needed."
good,"I only worked there temporarily, so I didn't really learn a lot, but I didn't really enjoy ,y time there other than the friends I made there. I also didn't like how the manager would change my shifts randomly either."
good,I have nothing to say but it was a job it kept me afloat for a lil while i just was not  happy and need a change not what i was looking for with a career
good,"I worked with the remodeling crew so we working on rebuilding and stocking shelves, creating new registers and loading/unloading stock.  My typical day was working the late shift, usually  11pm-7am.  Salary was competitive to other retail stores.  Management was structured to cross train employees and customer service oriented."
good,Well organized and nice employees. Could use a bit of work throughout distribution of hours but with time that will come. idk why i have to do this but its ok.
good,"Wal-Mart can be a great career opportunity for some people. However, if you have strong work ethics, you will become frustrated at the many co-workers who are lazy and steal time. Management seems to allow many associates neglect their responsibilities but expect those of us who are hard working and follow rules to pick up the slack--taking advantage of those with strong work ethics."
good,Job does not pay enough. You do a lot of work but for not enough pay. The job will stress you out if you let the job do that. Not any career advancement in this company
good,"Enjoying to work with customers, flexible hours, steady place, very diverse, management workable, how to deal with customers when in a bad mood, and team work."
good,"Working in an industrial sized kitchen, cooking and cleaning requires team work. It was very common to be under staffed which lead to on the job injuries. The employee on shift would have to do the job of 2 or be behind in inventory. Grossly understaffed.Unable to provide the high expectations I had for customer service."
good,"Walmart needs to step up the game on the payscale front. The managers ( with the exception of 1 or 2) really have no clue what they are doing. Please look for some place else, before Walmart"
good,"You will always find yourself having a mix of good managers and bad managers, immediate could be good, higher up could be terrible. Each day is the same thing over and over again, but always different somehow because nothing ever goes according to plan, Expect to work every holiday if your a department manager or above. Weekend work almost always if your just an associate."
good,It's a good job to pay the bills if you're a student looking for work or for a summer job. The co-workers are fun to work with (mainly because they're in the same range of age) and the managers are okay.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work with some possibilities of moving up within the company. You work long hours as a manager and deal with rude customers on the daily. However, it does give you the opportunity to be a merchant and learn how to run a business."
good,"Can be fairly mind-numbing and there really is no advancement unless you want it, and they are not very thorough with training. I got half an hour of on cash training then had to learn on the job."
good,"Worked as a cashier, focusing on customer service, accepting credit, debit card and cash payments. Kept my area of work clean and tidy. Worked independently."
good,Wal-Mart was a good company to work for. I think it's a perfect job for people fresh out of High School and still in School. I enjoyed my experience with the company.
good,"It was a good company but very unfair when it came to job advancement.  Advancement was not based on best qualified, but who management wanted in the position"
good,"Depends on where you work within the company. Being a store floor associate can be long and tedious hours. If you land a good manager that understands your needs, the place is a good starting place to work. Every person should work retail at least once in their lives. Backroom associates deal with a constantly cluttered back room and have unreasonble expectations from supervisors and management. Pay is not that good and raises are underwhelming."
good,I enjoyed a lot of my job. The people were great and the work was enjoyable. The thing that didnt work for me was my work life ballance. I spent every holiday away from my family.
good,I loved working with the people I met at Walmart. Still have friendships from there today. Learned many skills there and its easy to grow and move up on the ladder.
good,"The job is fast paced, competitive you have to produce numbers to keep your job, The job is strict they have a no fault policy regardless of what your situation is."
good,"The walmart I worked at, was slow. They didnt get everything done that they needed, Unloading the truck was not done on time, theyre unorganized, Its just a mess."
good,Work would go great some days and others not so great. Management did a horrible job with creating a schedule and expected a little too much from one person rather than the entire work team and did not handle those who were not meeting their work capabilities well.
good,Night shift wasn't that bad. You just have to deal with the people that come out late at night. My shift was from 10pm-7am. Management is very rude and not understanding.
good,"Your day depends solely on the customers day, if they have having a bad day they will make you have a bad day as well. Other the that Walmart is a great starting job."
good,"Lack of help. Employees are stressed out due to not having enough help."
good,I like the fact that i can go get the equipment i need and just start my day. It is repetition so it is easy to remember what needs done. just wish i could have a steady shift.
good,Walmart is also a good place to work. Everyone are cooperative. All the associates are nice and take care of the customers. The management are also very much helpful and friendly. That makes me easy to perform my job.
good,When I worked at Walmart they had poor customer service and management sucked big time. I went out for emergency surgery and they didn't believe I was sick. My mom had to bring proof that I was in the hospital to them in order for me to keep my job.
good,Overall i have some ups and downs at this place would i reccomend it to anyone yes ive learned a lot over the years .You have manager that will guide you in the right direction
good,Nothing bad to say here. It is what you make it. The customers can be pushy at times but some of them are pretty nice most of the time. Overall its a pretty chill job.
good,The management at Walmart was okay. Some of the people I worked with was nice and helpful. I enjoyed helping people find what they were looking for. The customer service there was okay.
good,"I liked all the people I worked with but I was not a fan of my boss, but I did all I was asked to do I am hard worker even though I did not like my boss."
good,"When I worked there it was years ago.  The pay wasn't good and there was always so much work to do. It's always busy at Walmart and there are never enough employees, so you tend to be overworked and underpaid"
good,"Typical Day: Merchandising, Stocking, Customer Care. "
good,a typical day at wal mart would be noted on the job description. i think the only way to apply for  walmart would be through online site when you get on the site they would tell you the description of  you job
good,Typical retail. Had fun stocking and hearing stories from an older co worker. Learned a lot from him and enjoyed his company. Had many vendors to learn from and interact with.
good,The atmosphere was trying at times but kept you pushing better to succeed. The work schedule was off due to shipments but was fine for anyone who didn't want to work too late or too early.
good,Walmart was quick to promote within the company. After being a cashier for three months I was told I would be trained to be in customer service with a pay raise.
good,Walmart was the best place to work while going to school. You decide what hours you will be available to them and they build your schedule around that.
good,"They are always saying save money to live better but they cut costs at corporate level the most. People are friendly! Management is too busy to give you time. The lunch buffet owned by another company is pricey, they dont follow the every day low costs."
good,Great starting job. The pay was good for the job your doing. A lot  of gossip. Managers tend to have favoritism. Would not recommend to keep as long term.
good,customer service is main key. must always answer the phone when it rings. cash handling. hr department was the best and always took into consideration of your concerns
good,"Working at walmart is fun and also fasted passed. Where always keeping customers happy. First we find the products the customer needs,  Were always keeping the store in stock."
good,Good place to start working and has a lot of opportunities to move up. Only real reason I left the company was due to family emergency that had come up.
good,"Anyone who needs a part time gig, this is probably for you. They would work around my schedule if needed. I'm not sure of things have changed but we were not allowed to get more than 39 hours a week. They would send you home before you got that many hours. Even though we had enough staff they would hire 3rd party associates to ensure we didn't get part time hours."
good,"As a cashier at Walmart you see all kinds of customers from the regulars to the conversation strikers. It's never dull at Walmart, something usually always has to happen which kept the job interesting. The hardest part of the job is when it's overly busy and you run out of bags and money and the customers have to wait a while and give you a hard time about it. The enjoyable part is of course the people that work there that help you get through the day."
good,"Walmart first strikes you as someplace professional.. you watch the hours of brain-melting training videos, undergo several speeches about what they expect from you, but what you really come to find when you get your first day on the floor is that..."
good,"This company actually helped me grow a lot and working in different departments, on the floor and behind the scenes, you learn a lot. Yes walmart is known for its crazy customers but from a working stand point,aside from cashiering, i learned a lot from my former bosses."
good,"Manager was not properly trained for the position she was in, pay was low for the hour to pay ratio they had this app that was cool to use and you could get a loan from your check with this app"
good,"A very fast paced job that keeps me on my toes.  I enjoy customer service and helping people. The hardest part of the day is when there's not enough workers to run shift sometimes. This puts a strain on everyone that's there. However, we get the job done!"
good,"i really didnt mind working there"
good,on this job i have a good experience of good customer service i learned how to talk greet and handle customer services aND A good knowledge about electronics
good,"it's walmart. its a decent place to work, flexible hours usually and the people you work with usually end up being many a time the day goes great or bad."
good,I have not worked at Walmart in over 8 yrs. i cant really even remember working there. i worked with walmart part time stocking in for the pharmacy dept.
good,Walmart is a great place to work but the pay is too low. The women don't get paid as much as the men for the same position. The benefits could be better.
good,"bad.poor is the working way inside the store,the associates leaving  the jobs and Walmart do not hiring nobody hoping the other associate do it the job,"
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart but it was somethings that I just didn't agree with as far as some management members and how they talk to us and the lack of help when you needed help with something g
good,"Not every store is the same, its about the people you work with and how they run it. Depending on who you're working with it can be a good day or bad day. You just have to roll with the punches."
good,"Typical work day was merchandizing. Helping customers, and it good place to advance quickly if you are a good worker. I started out as a cashier and a stocker which was my first retail job and quickly moved into management position in six months."
good,Love working in the customer service industry. It's rewarding and fast paced but you also get to know the people who continuously come in and create a personal bond which is nice and can help you get through your day.
good,My revilew of walmart is if i was able to go back I would the location is near to my house an the employees are quite delightful i find myself going back an talking to my friends
good,I would greet my customers as they came in my line with respect and  resolve any issues that they have.  It could be a price that is needed or they are\ not able to find an item.. If it the item that can not be found I will take them directly to it. I enjoy working with the employees and customers.  I am very concerned about giving them the best experience possible.  I have many customers that need my help and I do value all of them. I watch when I have many customers in line so that I can tell management to open more lanes so the customer will not have to wait in line long. My attendance is very important so they I will be able to ring up customers so they can leave and go about their way.  I stride to keep them have because I am the last person they remember.  I want it to be a pleasant experience.
good,"you must be goal oriented and self motivated.  must be able to work without supervision.  you must also be reliable and have a good, strong work ethic."
good,Overall great job for first time workers. The fellow workers are somewhat friendly but usually don't like to be bothered. The good thing is it's Wal Mart so if you forgot lunch you can buy a snack.
good,"If you work hard you can advance because they hire alot of people with no initiative, now thats not so much walmarts fault due to the high turnover rate but the pay is inadequate to the cost of living and it can get monotonous, so hence the high turnover rate."
good,This place is busy and you always have something to do. But is also short staffed and you have to learn a little bit of everything while working here.
good,"Daily operation of an assigned area of the store, managing the assistant managers in the store. Teach and developing assistant managers to meet and exceed company expectations."
good,"Management team is bad at leading the team"
good,Great salary and benefits package. Good place to work for people who want to work. Many opportunities for advancement for anyone who is ambitious and driven.
good,It is mainly just a place to work. There are rarely any advancements made. Most the time everyone places favorites and the people they hire don't do their job correctly. Managers also seem to like to abuse their power most of the time.
good,At times can be a good place to work for and times can be extremely stressful especially during holidays or times of new policies and procedures being introduced.
good,"A standard retail job"
good,clocking in then looking to see where they have but you working. then try to do the work as fast as you can before a manager comes and checks on you in some way
good,"Retail honestly is an easy job. The difficulties that pop up are : lack of communication, unnecessary stress, stupid rules, schedule conflicts, and people that take their Walmart job way more seriously than they should. Did electronics three years and that was probably the best department. Switched to online grocery and it was horrid."
good,"i believe the company is capable of so much more and the coworkers are awesome in their determination. management can be better with understanding and planning,but i have no complaints."
good,It was very interesting working here. I was an Amazing worker at this company. The job wasn’t hard at all. I made sure I showed up on time. It just that I had to relocate & find something else.
good,It’s a job. The people who worked there made the job Interesting and fast we all worked together as a whole and pushed each other the complete our task at hand.
good,"The company so worried about pinching pennies that it is letting dollars slip right though its fingers. Pay is good, however hours have been cut. Full time associates are struggling to get 33-35 hours when they were hired on to get 40 hours. The company is more worried about spending money on unnecessary fixtures than keeping the place fully staffed. Customers are noticing the lack of staffing to keep up with demand and are going elsewhere"
good,"I have no real opinion of this company, other then its a job that pays your bills, most store are ok to Work at others are more difficult because of in store drama."
good,"While working at Walmart I found the employees were very friendly and helpful. The tasks that were assigned to me were simple and fast paced. the hardest part of my job would have to be the timelimits i had on my picking list, and the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the conversation with customers because I always enjoy improving my people skills."
good,Its an ok place to work. The pay wasn't great but they have gone up on pay recently. You can't work over 40 hrs so plenty of free time. Its Ok overall
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart it was always busy, and very fast paced. There was never not nothing to do, so work went by pretty quickly. The management and Associates all seem to get along pretty well so that may work even more fun to come to."
good,"Walmart has decent hours and pay, but the hours can come and go. Employers tend to be reliable as so are the employees. Training comes practically monthly through the use of online teaching."
good,"Walmart doesn’t wages weren’t enough for a family, so eventually I transferred to sams club and it was also closer to my home so the commute was better"
good,I enjoyed working in the Cash/Accounting office at WalMart.  I worked alone which I liked b/c it made me and me alone responsible for balancing the moies that was collected and disbursed under my watch.
good,"Our main responsibility was loading and unloading shipments, weather it was forklifting or manual laboring along with packing and unpacking with a team of six people to a trailer per trailer"
good,"Working at Walmart is like learning something new every day, the work environment is fast paced and very productive. Moving up in the company is fair and likely that you will move positions."
good,you get to meet new people everyday you work and find some friend along with that to and have some fun along the way to and you get days off  and hoping it can work out
good,"It was a nice place to work. There was a lot of standing around, and near the end of the season, we had to rearrange the shelf and things like that. If it was busy at the front end, they would take you from your department and send you up there without proper training."
good,Management does not provide the proper tools in order to be successful every day. They notice hard work. And like to promote within though. But supervisors are not given the proper staff nor tools to properly do the job.
good,"I mostly don't approve of them as a business, and I don't like being a cog in their machine.  The pay was only slightly competitive for the level of work."
good,"Starting your career, Walmart can be a good stepping stone to getting your foot into the door to other careers. They also promote within that helps to"
good,"Bon emploi étudiant ,mais sans plus. Salaire minimum."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, but the pay is too low for all the things you have to deal with on an daily basis."
good,most manager are understanding if something came up with my children health. it was very fast. its a very friendly place to work at. i learn that customer can make your day.
good,I left because my girlfriend went into labor in they wasn’t tryna to let me leave so I walked out on the manger and said you won’t be seeing me here no more
good,"this place is a good place to work to start out a job, or for moms who need extra income. Being a cashier is easy and makes the day go by faster and is a breeze to do."
good,Being a cashier for Wal-mart was fun. The day went by faster. The Walmart Employee discount was very handy. The breaks were nice. It is always busy. The customer service is friendly.
good,A good job to have during school. Friendly co workers. Can be stressful if you have anxiety like myself. Flexible schedules when I worked there. Were really understanding.
good,"Typical work day was organized and I would learn a lot when working in the mornings with the manager. The work environment was friendly, and it was easy to approach the higher managers and ask for help."
good,Was terminated for using too many sick days because of the flu. Would definitely not go back. It’s a great job if you don’t have any unexpected issues.
good,Working for the best Logistic company in the world has taught me how to keep accurate inventory and learn how to manage associates. The respect for individuals were always on the forefront of our training.
good,I had a great department manager who taught me all about the jewelry department and shoes. I enjoyed helping the customers everyday.   I also enjoyed helping any manager who needed my help in other departments.
good,"During my shifts at Walmart, we are constantly helping costumers & making sure that the store is tidy. All of the associates help to make sure that everything is taken care of."
good,a typical day at work was the same as every other day. we did the same thing every day. I learned how to change oil and repair tires on civilian cars. friendly work enviroment .
good,Wal-Mart is a very transient workplace. I liked automotive more than inside the store. My store was pretty ghetto and things locked up everywhere. Messed up my time adjustments... I'd go back for temp work.
good,Management was a disgrace. They had their favorites picked and had no problem with fellow employees not carrying their own weight when it came to work.
good,beaucoup de pression ... gros roulement des employés
good,love the discounts and customer interaction but you are constantly on your feet and late hours are awful.  Only good thing about working for Walmart was close to my home.
good,i have tried to reapply to walmart on several occations since my last employment with them and many things have changed. while it is important to serve your customers in the best manner possible ive noticed that since 15 years ago the rate of start pay is almost identical and that specialized positions are now combined to basically suit walmarts scheduleing needs. basically i'm saying they have limited or no value on their associates. it is further from being what walmart was intended to be than ever and has no aspiration to do otherwise.
good,"I really enjoyed my job position. I do miss it regularly. I enjoyed working in many different areas of this store, being multi utilized. I was a 3rd shift stocker and inventory manager. We worked on a JIT operation. I also overlooked the lunch meat department as well."
good,This isn't a very good place to work. Yes the coworkers were good but management sucked. I wouldn't really advise anyone to work here unless they had absolutely no alternative.
good,"basically your average minimum wage job, nothing special. managers sometimes push for work even if you're not scheduled. and hours drop drastically after the holiday season.."
good,"A typical day at worlk involves mingling with a lot of customers and executing daily tasks while at it. "
good,I enjoyed my time working for this company when I first started. After a few months the management was poor. I rarely had more than anyone but myself working which was a challenge in the deli as there should be at least two or more people back there. Management does not care about your personal life whatsoever. I left this position because I told management several times that I needed my hours cut since I am a student in college full time and they didn't care about it at all. Other than that I would recommend it if only its temporary.
good,Walmart's environment is always busy. you have to be ready to give it your all in the tasks you do. keep a good attitude and a positive outlook and you can make the work day go by fast and with fun.
good,"Customer Service"
good,it was an excellent place to learn the ins and outs of retail but is only a place comparable to a stepping stone when it comes to wanting more from a career.
good,"I worked at one in Taylor, AZ and the place was very small - almost too small for the amount of customers they had. Management was nice, but the scheduling was HORRIBLE. They wanted you to have OPEN schedule so they didnt have to hire people to fill in what no one wanted to work"
good,7.5 hours on my feet & expected to get to any part of the retail area quickly. People I worked with were pleasant to work with. management was not supportive of employee needs.Friendly coworkers and assistance from other departments.Balancing customer relations with trying to unfriendly customers. Meeting new people and interacting with customers.
good,I only worked here for a year or so.  Not bad. Good employee benefits.  Typical high pressure retail pharmacy.  It’s ok if you just getting started into pharmacy
good,The time passes fairly quick and can get stressful during rush hours. Management is irresponsible at times because of that and has to be reminded constantly about errors or issues they must solve for associates
good,"Wal-Mart can be a fun place to work, the employees are fun and relaxed. Every day is different between the customers and the different funtions of the job."
good,"Walmart is a great place to start out at and has tons of transfer and advancement available, however as it stands the company feels likes its heading in a direction where working there and having a family at home are at odds with one another as the focus is being pushed to second shift (2-11)"
good,"I would stock shelves and run cash register, the management was good, steady pace all the time I really enjoyed what I did there was no part that was hard the most enjoyable time was waiting on people"
good,I enjoyed working there very much. It's very fast paced and you meet many different kinds of people. You learn to work as a team member. The hardest part of  working there is is being able to control your temper.
good,"Fast pace, good benefits, broad product coverage and profitable.  Staff well recognized via compensation for strong store performance.  Scheduling not ideal."
good,"Our shift would start at 10 P.M, first thing we would all do is have a meeting telling us our assigned areas for the night. after the meeting was over we went to our designated areas and stocked and zoned our departments. At 5 A.M we were to have finished our freight and started cleaning up and pulling overstock to the backroom. At 6 A.M we have to head to grocery to start zoning there for the last hour before the store opens up."
good,It was overall all a decent job to have. The job kept me busy all day and moving from department to department to help was a plus. Learning new things everyday.
good,Working at Walmart there is some good days and some bad day just like any work place but for Walmart they dont appreciate there employee. They dont stand buy there employees
good,It was a great place to work.Everyone was friendly. Management made a good place to be. I learned how to manage money getting paid every two week. They worked with my school schedule.
good,"I gave it my all there , management wasnt fair there they would schedule me a twelve hour shift and i would leave after eight hours i would get a ding torwards being abesent you get so many they can fire you. Or they. Keep you late. Ect ect and they say they would fix them dings but they dont and then management calls you in for review your dings and get any more your done well that was the case. Then the fight you for unemployment its not fair its about numbers cut backs not thinking of family . wal mart protays to be there for the family its not look there making it hard for people with disabilities to save a buck .when in return there are thousands of people that they do this too you can be replaced ."
good,Management was fair. Some of the supervisors were great. It was a fast pace place to work for.  I did not care for the lack of people wanting to help customers. Fun part of job was seeing all the kids and helping customers and the least favorite part of job was when I tried to transfer to a store in Texas it got messed up and I did not get a job there.
good,"You must have an open schedule if you like to be able to get hours, that also means you will have to work different times all the time. The managers are nice!"
good,It was fun working at Walmart I enjoyed the people I enjoyed working there. Everyone worked together. And they tried to put you were you would work the best.
good,Easy job easy money  not easy growing in the company work too hard for no good benefits benefits take long to claim poor management good starting job .
good,"Interacting with customers on a daily basis. Helping them shop and find they're everyday needs is your duty. Scanning, stocking, and providing customer service is your duty."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart would flow smoothly were it not for doing the work of four people on your own. Management is generally understanding of how short staffed it gets, but sometimes they still set rather unrealistic expectations. The hardest part of the job is time management when trying to complete a multitude of tasks while not having the staffing to allow you to. The mots enjoyable part of the job are the repeat customers."
good,"the work environment in this company is to complicate and extresfull,the pay is not according with the work you need to be done in the areas they assignee to you"
good,Really enjoyed.my.job as Deli associate. Poor managment with in the department. Has such a high turner due to lack of training with in each department. Not having the proper items that is used on a.daily basis to run and keep deli clean.
good,im not sure why I had to even do this apparently I couldn't skip this step it was a decent gig I guess im really just trying to get this sentence or run to 150
good,greatest part of working here was all the great people i worked with and my management team was great. Wish i would have been paid more and i would have stayed back then.
good,It’s ok working there. The people are nice and it’s fair. But I just wish that they treated the employees with respect they are really poor at that. They discriminate against pregnant and people with disabilities
good,"it is a very good store to work at . they will always help you if needed, never let you down and you always get your hours when needed. the managers are always nice and help worthjy"
good,"Regardless of education, experience and knowledge none of this a factor with your position at  Walmart. If you are a ""friend"" with a manager is very important."
good,I enjoyed my overall time at walmart just like any job it has its downfalls I went pretty high in the company and the higher in management you are the more stress is carries with it
good,I loved working there at Walmart . My supervisor was just extremely disrespectful but I’d brush it off and get my job done. I had to move out of the city and I was hoping I could transfer but I had only been at Walmart for 5 months .. to transfer You’d have to be there for 6 months.. now i have to wait 6 whole months to work for them again..
good,"Walmart is great but everything your learn is on your own, management will not train you. At least most of them there is a S.O.P. but your responsible to read and execute."
good,The pay was great. Loved the hours and discount. The management was one of the biggest issues about this job. When i fell and broke a bone in my hand the.management came with mento a readycare to see a doctor. The female manager demanded to come in private examing room which i felt it was a violation of my right to privacy.
good,The company as a whole is a good company. I learned so much working for them. I was able to get promoted quickly with this company.. There were some changes that needed to be done when i worked there and i think they have done those changes since i have left
good,"A typical day at work was bringing out skids from the back room, taking them to the correct area and unloading them. I would organize and zone the areas to make sure they were up to standards. I stocked the shelves in a variety of different areas based on where they needed me. The hardest part of this job was that it was overnights."
good,"i didnt really enjoy this job.  Management never seemed like they knew what was really happening, and people didnt seem happy about their working lives."
good,Ambiente laboral atractivo ..compañeros respetados .horas de trabajo.muy bueno.salario.benefico. .
good,"Fast pace high-stress job that takes up a lot of your personal time. Benefits are good could be better. Management depends on where you work, some sucks some don't. Pay is decent. Overall it's an okay stepping stone job."
good,"It's an ok place, you get your breaks on time you work your schedule time, the discount is only 10% where is should be more. The management team seems to be good and works for the employees"
good,Walmart is a nice and friendly work place.also they treat you fair like every other person that works there.you get good benifits and discounts i really liked walmart.
good,"Kept the department organized and clean. Helped costumers in finding the "
good,"Definitely easy money if can tolerate the typical retail store annoyances. As any other retail store, customers are the boss, but definitely make some days hard. Management and supervisors sometimes don't make it easy either."
good,The day goes by quick but if you aren't a brown nose you're most likely not going to move up as fast as you'd like. Management will do anything in their power to get rid of anyone for the slightest reason. Just do your job and don't talk to anyone.
good,It was a good job with a lot of wonderful co-workers. The management wasn’t bad but a few of them were terrible. It was hectic sometimes but calm at other points but wasn’t bad.
good,The company should promote employees that have the experience and educational background to support the management positions instead of hiring friends.
good,"Walmart pays good but the pay should've been better for unloaders, Managers are pretty good with giving directions, Work culture was very positive with great teamwork."
good,"The turnover rate at Walmart is extremely high, so that in itself should tell you something. But, I have known people who have worked there for years, even 1 who has been there most of his life, but never wanted to be promoted. Co-workers were good people, had car meets in the parking lot even. The management, like most places was poor, 1 Assistant manager even got fired for being on his phone most of the work night."
good,"Good way to get experience as a supervisor, working with customers, stocking, and learning how to work with people day to day. I very much enjoyed working on the front end as a supervisor."
good,Fun working environment. Work with diverse group of people. Challenging on a daily basis.This particular store is one of the busiest in the State so you will be kept busy
good,Walmart is definitely customer oriented.  I have learned and enjoyed learning about other departments besides cashiering.  Management scheduled a morning meeting everyday.
good,The typical day was alot of bull never had enough cashiers some of the csms took way to long to bring change and do pick ups and this was before they went to a supercenter
good,Toda empresa debe de enfocarse al factor recurso humano y combinarlo con el objetivo de la misma.
good,The fact that it's required to actually write a review for every past employer is ridiculous.  Let alone the fact that it must be more than one sentence.
good,"As busy as you want it to be."
good,"bonne implication dans le travail du personnel ainsi qu'au superviseur"
good,"It was a very stressful job. If you didn't catch on right a way, you got chewed out by your supervisor. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers"
good,It was a great place to work for I just needed better  Benefits and more hours had great people to work for  Management was  Excellent and cared about are opinion and worked as a team  Management cared about there  Employee and listen to ideal and  Suggestions
good,"As a fulfillment associate I was responsible for unloading freight from the trucks and stocking shelves primarily. "
good,Received and stocked produce and various inventory through out the store. Also priced products when stocking. Helped customers locate products. Talking with customers was the enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Nice place to work, however working conditions were not the best.  The area was not kept clean and organized.  The schedules were never consistent.  One day you would work until 11pm and be scheduled for the next morning at 7 am."
good,"Productive learning experience gained while working at Walmart. Also, learned more diverse techniques.  Learned to use different bakery equipment and tools."
good,"Good work experience, good hours, work pace was difficult at times,"
good,"In my experience at Walmart,  I was exposed to management for the first time and running my own crew overnight.  It was an experience I will never forget as it taught me how I want to manage as opposed to conforming to an organization's management style. So, I praise Walmart for teaching me that at least. I am now finishing my Masters at GCU in organizational management and will be conducting my PhD studies as well at GCU focusing on high performance careers."
good,I had an early shift which I loved cause when I get there it was easy to do my job cause the store was empty. So stocking the shelves was always easy to do.
good,kind of had a bad experience the last time I worked for Walmart. one of my co-workers had a very bad attitude so it made my work environment hostile but other then that it was ok
good,"I would recommend Walmart as a place to advance quickly. There are many areas in which you can grow with the company, as far a management roles are concerned."
good,I didnt work there long.  It was very face paced. I wasn't a fan of the environment.  Lunches were an hour long. Discount card was great. Coworkers were friendly for the most part.
good,this job was okay nothing great nothing bad either. just enough to make ends meet. all of my coworkers were older but nice. didnt seem like much  room for growth.
good,"A typical day at work, if making sure all return items are put back on shelf,making sure store area and clean and safe. Greeting and assisting customer with questions or locations of items."
good,Anyone who wants to work pay was decent and work was easy for anyone to do. I recommend a lot of younger people to work here because you can learn a lot and earn at a young age
good,Great prices good customers and cashiers people ready to come to work to serve and smile I’m going to make Walmart my priorities I love service and good people people deserve to be treated fairly and that’s what I bring to my place if firing
good,Depending on your position is what makes or breaks this job. Case lot order filler is pretty tough. I wanted a new position but had to wait a lengthy time. The pay and benefits are decent.
good,It was a good place to work. I was able to advance into a management position. The benefits where descent and the pay was good. My job was abolished after 20 years of service.
good,When you come in its usually a few minutes before the Manager tells you where to go to stock that night. I learned the job is simple depending on whom the manager is that night.The management is terrible besides one specific person. the workplace sucks based off the fact that they let the older people have the easy work and throw the rest on the younger more energetic people which i guess isnt all bad just wish work was fairly distributed. the hardest part is when there is more than one truck then the work can get stressful and more time consuming. the most enjoyable part for me personally was the customer interactions sometimes and certain co workers i had similair interest with.
good,"In time with the raises you make a descent pay. The people could be rude but never anything violent. I didn't care for management and supervisors they can write you up for anything,"
good,"Found this job quick, needed the money. The only openings they had were Graveyard/overnight in which we pulled pallets of merchandise to our area and stock our areas."
good,Over all it’s an ok company although needs many improvement. And needs to appreciate it’s associates much better and the pay should be better. Very fun job at times.
good,"it's a very fun place to work, i've never had as much fun as i did when working at walmart. the staff and management teams wer incredibly entertaining and there was never a dull moment."
good,"worked overnight it was productive, fast paced worked serveral departments throughout store as well as gaining more knowledge and experience in department roles."
good,"Very fast paced place, your only allowed 3 call in 4 call in your fired, so the company has a high turn over rate, and there moto is your replaceavle.."
good,Full time positions were rare but over all a good company to work for. Advancements are all about who you know. Raises were consistent and peers enjoyable
good,eh it was fine not great not bad most of the employees hated it tho why does this have to be a 150 character minimum im just filling up space now eeee
good,Working at Walmart is labor intensive.  There is something interesting occurring almost every day and no two days will be the same routine.  My customer service skills were outstanding.
good,i like working for the store and i like the people i work with. however the new rules cut how much pto we can get and how much we get base on how many years you have been there. they try to balance it out with how much you get on your bonuses  that is based on sales. the problem it our store is badly under staffed so sales are bad and we get next to nothing for bonuses. they have been focusing so much on bottom line that it feels like the spirit of what it was is gone and replaced with deadlines that must be met.
good,Great pay great benefits also discount bonuses was good just is a very stressful place to work management was not careing had to do my work plus others work. No over time at all.would have to take 2 hour lunches instead of leaving early
good,"There is not much to say about Walmart, either one has worked there and ""knows"" or one has not. They are very concerned about in house promotion (so you ""don't need an education"" to succeed), which helps Walmart culture remain as it is."
good,"I was at Walmart for 3 years. Started off as a truck unloader, Ended as a supervisor. A majority of the time my job was pretty easy kind of laid-back at times normally my co-workers made it fun. Even as a supervisor the same co-workers made it enjoyable it bearable to make it through today. Management was the only problem at times either overworking us expected us to do the work it would take a bigger group to do or ready to throw us under the bus because they got in trouble. Overall I would recommend Walmart for employment. Just stay away from the one I worked at until management gets sorted out."
good,"My position was seasonal so I didn't have such an inside look on the job, but the little time that I was there I was a fairly good job to have until you get something better"
good,"Everything was ok , besides the no sick days i don't recommend anyone to work there with kids because no sick days unacceptable. But other than that. The pay was good, and the hours"
good,"Its an ok company to work for, the benefits aren't that great, they could be better.  Loved interacting with the customers on a daily basis, management is there for them, not the employees."
good,there is a lot of opportunity at walmart. There is favoritism and really nothing done about it. My experience so far was a alright one. like any jobs you'll find yourself hating it if you don't get along with management
good,Fair wages. It is hard in some dapartments to get a full 40hrs a week. They are known to cut hours drastically depending on what department you work in. Management could do better with how the communicatecsnd treat the associates.
good,Nada a reclamar exceto a falta de comprometimento com os funcionarios
good,"Didn't pay well, but was an interesting place to work.  Got along well with most people, did have a manger that was very difficult to work with but for the most part managers were good to work with."
good,Working for Walmart is a great thing i would just like to do something different something that makes me another happy i love working i have  been working for a very long time for my age I'm happy to help people and love learning different things.
good,"Walmart are a nice place to work and my co-workers and supervisors are very friendly."
good,"Empresa ótima para aprender, da oportunidade em varios setores da área logistica e administrativa."
good,"A typical day at work was usually a stressful one. Walmart is always busy but sometimes I would get to see smiling faces that brightened my day. At Walmart, I learned that retail is not a job I am interested in."
good,"They have good discounts, but the store I worked just was not big on being team players with people that they did not care for.  You have to wait 90 day for you to be able to benefit from their discounts."
good,"good people on 3rd shift. good boss on 3rd. clean place. management not so good. most of the time was fun place to work. no pay raise, even if you had a good review."
good,"The job is fast paced and long periods of standing, if you like to be busy this is a great place to work. Benefits are great and provided right away. Team Work!"
good,There is a lot of opportunity at walmart. There is favoritism and unfortunately there isnt much that can be done about it. My experience so far has been a mostly positive one.
good,"Personally, for me, it wasnt that bad. On an average day, i just went into work, did my thing, and left. Barely any drama, well, i just stayed out of it. And that was pretty it."
good,always busy rude customers but enjoyed my coworkers. Management was sometimes lacking when it came to sticking up for the employees. Please make sure you have a thick skin before working here
good,"As a cashier I was taking monies and assisting customers with their purchases. I restocked shelves, and end caps. Customers were generally polite. Advancement was hard with no availability at times"
good,"This is a terrible Company to work for They do not care about your health and wellness and also do not care about family."
good,constantly making salads and sandwiches. Strict management and coworkers liked to gossip. never had a set schedule of days on and days off. long hours through the night. high product demand even and no understanding of employee being new and learning.
good,The company hires all types of people. There's quite the blend of races and genders. Floor personnel helped each other and supported a team concept. Employees are expected to learn all of the areas and what is necessary for each.
good,Very stressful at times. Team work isnt always a shared interest amount coworkers. Expect to work every holiday. Pay isnt great for what you deal with sometimes.
good,"Walmart is a decent job. They are just like any other money hungry company. No off day, no being late, no disrespecting their disrespectful customers, but it gets the bills paid."
good,"Customer service is key to this place, you have to be able to keep it professional. The company offers a lot of good benefits for their employees, health care, 401k, paid vacation, and sick leave."
good,"Constant work, helpful training and resources, room for advancement, helpful managers, great coworkers, can always transfer to different department if not happy"
good,"First available managers were the backbone of the company assistant managers and above aren't very helpful or anywhere to be found unless they have to be. Flexibility with school and other commitments, pay isn't terrible. Benefits available to part & full time employees."
good,"The job is fun & fast. Day goes by fast. If you want it a slower work evenings, unless it's the 1st of the month of holiday season then your also busy."
good,Walmart is a place where you have to fight to get hours. management isn't always there to help you. Its like pulling teeth to talk to management or even getting hours.
good,"i enjoyed my customers and coworkers. management was ok, but seemed to have their hands tied on alot of things like scheduling, overtime and payrates. didnt have a steady schedule."
good,Decent place to work only leaving because of restructuring in the company. Was treated well. Most of the time it issues with family arised they were understanding.
good,"You go everywhere in the USA . Drive in all  kinds of weather."
good,"I had two phone interviews and was offered the job, it was a very casual interview process but I have heard other interview were not as laxe. The team wad great."
good,started at 4 am enjoyed working together with coworkers. Learned to use MC40 and TC70 Hand held computers. The culture is diverse which I enjoyed getting to know different people.
good,"Under different management. Bad management when I was there. The area I worked was great. The ones I worked with were great, knowledgeable. Great customer service people."
good,Stocked shelves and helped customers locate products. Became a backup cashier in times of extreme business during store hours. Moved pallets of merchandise to and from stock room to the sales floor.
good,The managers are horrible. They try to act concerned about your problems but they don't care and they never have a resolution for anything that you bring up
good,Worked in warehouse and also stocked shelves and products in the grocery department. It was very physical and fast-paced. No room for advancement but the hours were steady.
good,"I requested to work in electronics on my application but they decided to move me to the remodel position, it was by far one of the more stressful jobs when dealing with three to four managers requesting things to be done in a short amount of time especially when I was the only one they assigned to the task."
good,"know the position you are applying for and be ready to work"
good,"I was a fast cashier and everyone would always bash on my work ethic because I was considered a ""try hard"". I am a woman of color working in an environment of predominately white area and I would always get racist comments from the employees which was hard to bear."
good,"Typical days were busy, but fulfilling. I learned so much at this job and still use what I learned there to this day. Management was wonderful at helping me learn what I needed for this job and providing continuous support for my needs after I completed my training."
good,Met some good people here. Typical day at work was unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Hardest part might have been keeping up with the demand of how much product to put out in set time limits determined by your supervisor ahead of time.
good,Its ok its a job and I left because of the pay other then that its a good job due to the fact they have a raise now make more money now so that's good to no
good,"By fun I mean, a lot of the younger people would just hide from management so they did not get caught doing something they should not have been doing."
good,Walmart always kept me busy which I liked. My supervisor And I did a lot of department rests for seasonal. I learned a lot from my supervisor she was fun to work with.
good,"Walmart is a decent starter job, just not somewhere that I would like to stay forever. I am still very young and have so much potential in me. It is pretty laid back as long as you just do your job."
good,"The job description was vague, it didn't tell the full response abilities, and I was often left alone due to the fact no one else was full time. The managers were lacking in checking up on me and they failed to see that one man is not enough to keep up with a population of 7,000; especially on holidays where everyone takes time off to go shopping. 9 out of 10 shoppers often take there anger out on me, and because few to no people brushing up on driving laws, I've almost lost my life to careless drivers not watching out for pedestrians. Then got no compensation for my poor experience at this work place."
good,Overall the job I had at Walmart as a cart attendant was stressful. Most of the time there would only be one other person working on busy days like Saturday and Sunday.
good,"I generally liked working for this company, but the department managers tend to completely disappear and expect their associates to do their job, which when your not properly trained can be difficult. A recommendation would be instead of a week of computer training include more hands on."
good,Pay is ok for job title . Never enough help. Management always says customer first but aren’t helpful and prompt when you need them. It is easy to move around in store and advance
good,"overwork, under-staff. non working management. bad moral from management team, no recognition, no tools to do the job. Can not depend on upper management. Always negative and no positive feedback what has been accomplished."
good,working at walmart was a good experience for me as i was able to work in a stable work environment where i was trained and promoted within the store. I also learned how to physically interact with customers and solve issues.
good,"Walmart is a company that does not care about your personal life. They will work you to the bone up until they fire you, even have you train your replacement. Only gave me three days of bereavement for my mother's passing and pointed me for every day after. This all soon led me to be fired but I am on the rehire list."
good,The work wasn't hard and the scheduling wasn't bad. It was pretty far from my home so the commute to work wasn't fun. The hardest part of the job was working with the managers.
good,"Some of the people I worked with will be lifelong friends. We had fun and worked hard. Cutting hours and the management picking favorites for advancement, were problems."
good,You can move anywhere in the company if you really want it and push yourself. I've been with Walmart for 12yrs. I've enjoyed my time with Walmart. Looking for a career change.
good,it was ok i was fixing shelves it was not much fun but it had to be done i learned that its hard to put up shelves and i learned what it like to really work as a team
good,"Walmart has great managers who are fun to work with, but they don't listen to your availability. I am a full time student and I have had to tell them multiple times not to schedule me so much."
good,"meet and greet customers assist with finding products and items, cashier and gardening help, helped out in other departments when necessary. enjoyed talking with customers"
good,Wal-Mart is an okay job to have. Wish they paid more but the environment was not bad at all. They have a super friendly management staff. They include a small discount on items for working here. Well at least they use to
good,at times can be a great place to work and management can really be helpful at times my most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and making things easier for them
good,"working for walmart is ok, the customers are rude. but other than that the work was not hard and the scheduling is good. good job to work job. no hard at all"
good,Management could be improved.  Enjoyed most of the people I worked with. It is generally a good place to work for pharmacists.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers/patients.
good,open store start coffee print day before reports print fuel level reports and order fuel if necessary check in-stock inventory and order if necessary. make safe drops and bank deposits.  stock and zone. comply with TABC and EPA policies and procedures. close store.
good,"Walmart is a fast- paced place, that can be enjoyable to work at. Compensation, however is not commensurate to the amount of work required at Walmart."
good,"Worked there for a few years,  then was coming back to work after being out on medical leave for a few months and the management was rude and mean towards me so I chose to leave the company.  They aren't willing to work with you and God forbid you have to be hospitalized for anything cause they act like you're lying when you have proof. The management team also have their favorites and give you the worst hours possible if you aren't one of them.  They expect alot for nothing."
good,The managers didn't care about the employees. They only cared about the customers because they knew that the employees were easily replaceable so the treated the employees badly.
good,It’s a job if you’re trying to get by and don’t mind being talked down by customers. It can be very rewarding at times. There’s multiple managers so you feel as if you are being micromanaged by nearly everyone.
good,"I only worked at this place for 3 months, I didn't much care for it while I worked there. Was a decent first job though, taught me how to show up for work."
good,It’s a good pleace to work. Especially if your just outta school. The only problem I had was I was unable to use the bathroom when needed and the breaks that were mandatory were never given. At this particular store where your at will effect your experience.
good,it was boring and long. I pushed carts everyday. I learned that sometimes you have to do jobs you don't like to do just to build character. The manager at the time was good.
good,hard and would not work for a company who is not set to better the business then try to make people just work but people need job and they are willing to help
good,"The job is what you make it. I was offered promotion within a month, at the age of 18. The hiring process is lax, especially for part-time workers. Thus lazy people are hired, so to stand out and reach beyond is easy."
good,"Show up on time and do your job perfectly, and you'll have little to no trouble working for Walmart. They do schedules a while in advance, so plan your days off accordingly and put in your requests early. They aren't guaranteed, but not impossible to get approved."
good,"Scheduled ""flexible""  times weren't so flexible when I was going to school in New Mexico. Management was very hard to talk to or were scheduled different times then what was actually needed. We weren't allowed to speak to management unless on the clock."
good,Walmart was a great place to work at! By far the best place I have worked. The people were all really friendly! The management is very understanding but they will follow every rule which is good and needed to run a good company.
good,It was an OK place to work.  Very Demanding and nice ppl to work with.  Not all managers are the same and some are very hard to work with.  The thing I enjoyed the most was being able to talk with customers on a daily basis.
good,"usually started as a cashier on the cigarette lane, would switch to self check out, check out customers at a register, be pretty busy all day. do some returns"
good,"A empresa tem uma otima cultura do Sam Walton, mas o trabalho em comércio no geral é complexo..."
good,"as a starting job it's not the worst thing to begin with to get your work experience started. After a while, it becomes apparent why some workers either try to move up or seek employment elsewhere."
good,Really like working at Walmart staff was great and if I could work there again I would basically one of the best jobs I have ever worked at no complaints or issues
good,It is a good place to work. Face paced always something to do and get into. Management has changed they said for the better. Hours are rough sometimes. But a ok place to work.
good,"various tasks to do"
good,"Managers didn't care if we had items in stock or not, they wanted us to do more than we could. Department manager constantly failed to order items required for us to do our jobs on time. We were constantly out of things we needed."
good,it was a great company i got great  discounts. i got to  meet alot of great people.  i wish i could have stayed there to excel in the company.  i would go back if possible
good,I did not learn anything. I did not the work place. I did not like the management style. I did not like the culture.. I did not like the compensation.
good,This job taught me how to manage coworkers efficiently and professionally. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the job done without sufficient workers being scheduled.
good,Walmart has been a very good entry level job. It has challenged me in many aspects and has helped me develop and sharpen many of my skills. This was a good stepping stone in my career.
good,"Depends on the area or location of your Walmart, the neighborhood walmarts are friendlier than others. My Walmart in wimaumau was really great, friendly. Same with in Lafayette Indiana, great workers and friendly customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be going in and scanning my bins, putting away, shop backs, top stock, section work, and price changes. I learned that if you want to advance you need to work hard. I enjoy working with some of the employees. The hardest part of the job is when management pulls you away from your duties to help stock groceries every day."
good,"The job can be fun or it can be stressful. The job is what you make it. I worked the grave yard shift and was only making $8.90 and hour. When it came time to clock out for the day, if a job was not complete other employees would clock out leaving myself and another employee to pick up their slack which resulted in overtime."
good,"It's been years since I last worked there, so I don't know how accurate a review from me might be nowadays. For one thing, I hear that most (if not all) of the management I had is now gone and replaced. So things might possibly be different. Ah well. In any case, it was okay. Something to make ends meet, you know?"
good,learned alot meet some good people everyday gave it 100% helping customers some coworkers were great. management was ok at times not the best or worst
good,"Walmart seems to be a organized placed, but it’s not. I constantly have problems with my schedule, and it’s hard to get a manager around to fix it without having more problems."
good,"Accountability Overkill "
good,"Enjoyed working with the people in my department, was opportunities for advancement, but the management style  lacked. "
good,"Very busy Pharmacy"
good,"Management and associates are goal achievers."
good,It is a company making sure the customer is first. Employees should be made to feel more important. You were asked to do to much with not enough employees.
good,"Wal Mart is a stable job in a way that it is not going any where any time soon. But, it is not stable thanks to all of the changes it goes through on a monthly basis and the company is always looking for ways to save money which includes laying members of management off. You are also forced to have a good social relationship with upper management if you want to move up rather than just being a good worker."
good,i worked there for 8 years. i can say the first 5 years i worked there i loved the job.there was  change in management and everything changed. the good employees all seemed to have left because the new management was very rough and disrespectful. i made a lot of friends out of coworkers and customers
good,What I've learned make everyday a great day because if I do that I know I am going to keep a smile on my face and get my job done as maintenance worker for Walmart.
good,Enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. Got the opportunity to learn new and different things that i didnt know before. Enjoyed the people i worked with; they was all different in their own way. I didn't have any problens with management except i felt like they could have been better leaders.
good,"fast paced, the job fast going more with less, job always on the going, ways learning other things on the, no mentoring program, always learning on your own manager never willing to help"
good,I liked my job but when my son fell ill i had to be with him. While on FMLA i was fired just before i was due to come back. Taking needed time off was difficult.
good,They skipped there employees out on there hours when it came to there 15 min breaks and overtime and lunch breaks it was a very stressful work place and environment
good,"I greeted the customers and rang them through with their purchases as the came to my till.  When not busy, I would straighten out the clothes in ladies wear."
good,This store was not a great store to work in. we had management issues. they pay was not great. you had to manage your department and others if they did not have a manager.
good,it's okay if you don't live on your own. 13 dollars an hour is an okay amount of pay for people between the ages of 18-19 living with their parents or maybe a friend.
good,"Great place to work but not so much Overnight, which is what I did. The management was terrible but if I had the opportunity I would work for the Super center and not the Market."
good,"Typical large box store with not enough associates to give good customer experience. above minimum pay and benefits, stressful environment, with good management would be good place to work"
good,"Clock in"
good,"It was a fast to slow paced j9b depending on what and when stuff would be coming in ro restock inventory, supervisor wasnt extreamly nice but was slightly tolerable but temp postion ended and had to find new work."
good,"Walmart provides a safe, clean, secure environment for their employees to work. Safety is a number one priority for Walmart so accidents are taken very seriously and there are several policies in place to help keep workers and customers safe."
good,You always have to be moving and standing up for 8 to 10 hours depend your shift. I learn that no matter what if the costumers wrong they still right about everything no matter what. The hard part about this job is that you always have to deal with people with bad atittud and if you try to help them they still rude with you and you have to hold the pressure because that's your job.
good,"Wal-Mart is a place of opportunities to learn more about customer service. Be it produce, lawn and garden, electronics; you are going to find something that you can glean on that can help in areas outside of work. The work is constant and ever-flowing however and stockers are timed on what they can put out. Overtime is not acceptable which can be a problem since much of the work thrives on OT to help bring in more revenue..."
good,"Walmart honestly all depends on the group of people managing it but the one I was at in Charlotte was great. "
good,Would be the perfect place to work if the pay was better. There are some advancement opportunities and relocation can be an option if that is what you want.
good,"Working at Walmart has taught me a whole new career as a maintenance associate. I love walking out the doors after shift, knowing my store looks good for the start of the day. Management is great there with just a few hiccups at times. I always try to give 110% no matter what."
good,I do not agree with the system in place to hold empoyees accountable. It is a never ending what you do wrong and you are always wrong system. To many variables after you do your job that can lead to another person making a mistake a mistake that you will take the fall for with no way to prove your case.
good,go in get assignment and keep moving straighten up stocking and meet new people every day. i like the fact that you are not being stood over and costantly being supervised every step you take.
good,"a typical day is always something difference , I learned that you cant please everyone, it was a fair culture, I hated the fact that people would lie and steal , as any job punching out to go home."
good,"Buen ambiente pero sueldo bajo.pocos incentivos."
good,I have learned that with hard work and dedication there is room for advancement.You have to be able to adapt to change and be able to work with the public. The people who work there are fantastic. Management is fairly supportive.
good,walmart was a good job but the job i was doing was only temporary but the job we were doing was a little different then what regular workers were doing.
good,Walmart is a ok company needs improvement on a lot of its issues. the people are great and the guest are worth taking care of. I really enjoyed working for the pharmacy.
good,Its been too long since I have worked for this company to give a realistic review and I was only hired on for a temporary position. I do feel that they offer a competitive wage and benefits compared to other companies
good,changing car and truck tires and oil changes check batterys checking tire pressures make sure car or truck was done right make sure old oil was put in proper cantaners
good,I started out as a cashier and wanted to go to customer service but they asked me to be a customer service manager and I had to be in charge of the whole front area. Management does not listen when u call them to help out up front and the lines are way too long. Customers would argue with you if they had to wait in line but not your fault and you can't check out cause you gotta get all the calls for the cashier's.
good,Trabajar 45 hrs semanales y que paguen nenos del sueldo minimo lo encuentro bastante abusivo busco algun trabajo que sea de 30 hrs o que tenga 2 dias libres aunque paguen menos
good,Low pay and impersonal managers makes the job more stressful than it should be. Not something I would recommend for a career. It was just temporary for going to school.
good,"Its a place that as long as you do your job, you can keep it. The benefits is straight, it has its pros and cons. All in all, dont set a career path there, it can be cut in a instant."
good,I loved the work and the co workers I had. I learned team work and Im a easy person to get along with. I love the hard labor and making sure my job is done right.
good,Had issues with managers because my manager left and we hopped from three different managers and I had medical issues going on and I ended up fired due to my medical situation my points weren’t removed because the newest manager at the time didn’t know anything about it bad communication in general. Job was not bad though.
good,"Mi entorno laboral era con personas dispuestas a tener  un crecimiento de trabajo, mi relación  con mi jefa directa fue agradable pues me compartió conocimientos y consejos para que mi entorno laboral no fuera pesado."
good,Decent place to work but it takes forever to go anywhere it feels like. Lots of upper management positions are available for the people who are dedicated.
good,"A typical day at Walmart required being ready to tend to customer needs while maintaining a clean and functioning environment.  I got along with all my fellow associates and they got along with me!  I would speak with my department manager, after briefly greeting everyone i meet on my way to her, to gather information on what tasks should be dealt with, starting with the most critical one first.  "
good,Walmart is a faced pace busy environment.  Most of the mgmt is not friendly to their employees mostly due to the amount of stress they are under.  Walmart is always understaffed which causes a enormous amount of stress as customers get frustrated which is understandable.
good,working at walmart is a good experience. you solidify your time management skills and eventually become better at working under stress. Walmart has friendly managers and staff.
good,Walmart is a good starter job.it teaches you a lot about how to stock and work on your time management.it helps your people skills tremendously because you are constantly talking to customers
good,"Buen amb iente laborar,sin crecimiento pero cumple con las prestaciones de ley"
good,"I worked over night, doing stocking. Sometimes I had plenty of time to get my work done, sometimes not. Crew I worked with for the most part were very reliable and easy to work with."
good,Managers did not listen to employees. Did not work with employees to help employees to improve their working skills and abilities. Were not willing to give employees more hours.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for depending on your store and the location. Every store is different .  I give it a 3 out of 5 on places to work.
good,"Arrive on TIme"
good,Walmart was a great company to work at it was sad to see all my co-workers go but I had to find something closer to home I miss all my co-workers dearly.
good,"Good leadership team in Bentonville, Arkansas. The culture is taken very seriously. Had the opportunity to travel and visit different stores and talk to the management team and the associates."
good,"Working for Walmart was fun and not overly stressful, especially working for the Overnight Maintenance crew. If I could change one thing about my experience there, it would be the lack of pay raises. In the three years that I worked there, I only received one pay raise, and that was an automatic raise for completing my six-month training course."
good,"I feel that the Department Manager position is one of the most difficult positions in the store. DM's do not get the credit nor pay they deserve. Also you see a lot of Assistant managers that are unable to complete tasks asked of DM's. I feel in order to become an assistant you should have to be a DM, or at least have knowledge of the position."
good,you have to do it all by yourself! no help too much stress! people call in all the time ! nobody extra to call for help if people on vacation or sick! crowed and mean and not patient customers!
good,"The store itself is bleak and drab, rude customers, and annoying leadership made the experience not the best i would say. They did make sure you had your day offs and sick days."
good,"The people who hired me were kind and respectful. I became enthusiastic about working in the bakery department. Upon hire I was required to do some ""training"". About 3 days of watching videos and answering questionnaires. This part left me feeling a little impersonal. I would have liked more management interaction."
good,"The training was very weak and made working difficult because of lack of knowledge. Working with the Optician was good but training was very sporadic which extended the learning curve,"
good,It was ok but could have been better. The managers need to listen to their workers and care more. I just feel like there are a lot of problems that can be fixed but not many people want to fix them.
good,Its has its ups and down I enjoyed working with my fellow associates but the new management could  use some retraining. They should obvious favoritism and they wouldnt listen to suggestions
good,"good compensation and benefits"
good,Walmart is going down hill. You won’t get many hours unless you go by when they tell you they need you. If you have a life outside of Walmart forget about it. You can only work part time mostly then they will make you sign a contract of sorts of promising you little to no hours but if they have more to give then they will. They don’t give many days off then if you happen to call off they have points and if you go over in a certain time period you’ll get fired. I hated it there.
good,Good decent job every day do the same old thing same time you take lunch at the same time get off at the same time you have to deal with annoying customers and over pushy overzealous managers who don't know the difference between a good boss and a good leader
good,Early starting work day. Work load dictates hours worked per day.  Not too much room for advancement.  Work was rated on how fast the work was done. Long hours in warehouse where temperatures may go from one extreme to another
good,its a great first job and they are very flexible with your schedule especially if you are a student. quick and fast paced very easy job to do if you are a cashier
good,i need full time job and enough hours to pay bills and costs of day to day living. i am able to perform task needed in my job but just need more hours at least 40 hours a week.
good,"Working at walmart, you can definitely get by, depending on your position your paid well enough to live off the check just wouldn't be the most comfortable living as one can expect. How a typical day goes depends on your department and position. While I'm sure it depends on what store you work with, at my store I find myself wondering how we manage to hold things together sometimes. From basic maintenance on tools and equipment to paying attention to the associates, there are plenty of things that'll make you turn your head and arch a brow, but you can find that at almost any retail chain and other jobs in general. Unless you're really struggling, it's good enough to help pay the bills and even live somewhat decent if your wise with spending. It's possible to move up and advance, but that often times takes you transfering to other stores and being placed in an area where your work can be recognized, lest you want to bring it to the attention of management."
good,I used to unload truck on the second shift and it was fun as my first warehouse unloading truck. and I used to restock also when they need help  I learned alot
good,"It's was a fast pace environment, friendly at times, and  management was irresponsible and didn't show leadership at that time."
good,Always low on staff so need you are always called to cover various departments including cash. Management keeps changing and thus come up with different rules all the time.
good,"I started out as a cashier, transferred to layaway and then became a customer service representative within all these positions I got to learn tons of different things."
good,it was an alright job sorta fun made a lot of friends and you meet a lot of people the work was fairly easy i just thought the management was sorta corrupted
good,If you want to just make money and ok with not being their first priority then it's a good place to be. Not much room for growth if you're starting your career
good,"It was okay, had to deal with a lot of rude people and some manager were good while other managers were extremely poor at doing their job. Some managers were great with customers and associates while other managers were just rude and you would want to throat punch them so they would be quiet."
good,"Good place to work for when fresh out of high school or for part time. co workers are very nice but management changes too frequently."
good,"Making customers happy, while catching shop lifers. It was difficult."
good,Walmart is a place i would recommend someone who does not have to worry about bills to work at. There has been too many occasions where my hours would be cut short because the store is not making sales.
good,Walmart is a place just to earn some money on the side. I have learned to respect others and work in a demanding area. I handle item returns and determine if the item is returnable.
good,great managers and work life balance they would work with my time off needs at the time i was a young father so there was times that i needed off that didnt really make sense for the work flow but jthey always tried to make sure that my home life needs was met
good,My typical day at work is like the same as everyday doing the same thing every single day..I learn to not work there if you have bill to pay cause they won't give you enough hours. The manager have favoritism they only help only people the like
good,"Constantly busy, i learned the value of  good work ethic. Management is alright, needs improvement. The culture at Walmart was friendly. Hardest part of the job was when they would make me go outside and push carts."
good,"About half the time they promote incompetent people for supervisor roles, some management members don't know how to run their position, but again the overnight crew is always dependable and picks up the slack that gets left behind from day and evening shift on top of some of our own work. But sadly our store is getting rid of overnights soon."
good,Walmart has too many managers. There are not enough associates but the managers want more and supplies are lacking while equipment is in need of repair.
good,"caring for customers.You stand on your feet all day, checking customers out. Then you take a quick break and continue to do so for  the rest of your shift."
good,"I really liked the environment, it was kept clean and the employees were great to work with. The break rooms were very big with TVs and relaxing! I also liked how there was positive statements and posters everywhere you looked."
good,"My typical day at work would start at 6 am. I learned how to stock, how to use a register. How to manage cleaning and loading money on the tolls. The workplace is serene. The hardest part and less enjoyable part is the rudeness on the customers. "
good,"My time with this company had its ups and downs. When I first got hired it was all about customers and employees enjoyed coming to work. Now the company is about is sales and numbers. The ""Family"" atmosphere is no longer there."
good,"Management doesn't know how to communicate with there associates...  And it was that way for Walmart and Sam's Club to,....  They just don't know how to talk to people that work for they at all"
good,"This is a great place to get your foot in the door and learn how eCommerce works. At first, there’s plenty of opportunity for advancement. After the first 120 days however your capabilities will be maxed. You’re also responsible for your own training which I love. The issue with training is they do not properly train their employees. They would rather you get your certificate from Udemy than pay for the actual certification."
good,"Although I cannot say I had necessarily a bad experience working at Walmart, I will say that it was exhausting dealing with that many people on a day to day basis. In my sole opinion, I'd rather not be forced to be sociable with customers throughout a work shift, therefore, I feel as if I applied to the wrong area. However, do note that Walmart has a plethora of areas to apply to if a single location seems to not appeal to one's own interests."
good,"There was always something to do at this company, whether stocking, restocking, unloading a truck, putting inventory in, or just cleaning isles.  Never a dull moment."
good,Hard labor with low pay. Stressful customers and management isn't too caring at times. Extreme pressure when trying to move up in the company. Sometimes there was favoritism.
good,"working at walmart, was one of the hardest jobs I have ever done. I worked very long hours , sometimes double shifts. When I would request for a sick day , it was rarely accepted,"
good,There all o did was restock da shelves with items and cleaned the meat coolers as needed one of da best job I ever had it was great and the team was wonderful
good,"Most of the day is spent standing, greeting and thanking customers while always being observant of suspicious activity; Also, signing receipts to make sure merchandise is paid for is part of the job."
good,"Shipping receiving, pallet jack experience, stack pallets with new merchandise from trucks and take pallets to correct departments, forklift experience, organize warehouse with all new merchandize, customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Pflugerville Store, but several little incident occurred that somewhat changed my outlook of the environment,"
good,The work environment falls victim to the corporate side of things but everyones intentions are true when comes to manager positions. when the stress is down most people are outgoing.
good,I only technically worked there for a few months as I was pregnant with my son and had physical problems but they made it to where I was still employed and I could go back when ever I wanted to they didn't terminate my job until a month after my son was born
good,"it was really a nice place to work"
good,Good people just wasn’t the job for me. I wasn’t into stocking items in the self to much as all the other people. Plus I was working in the garden center it was a slow place I’m more into the fast paste type of job where time goes by faster.
good,"I enjoy working for Walmart, its a great place to learn and grow. There's plenty of ways to move up and finding new ways to improve on great customer relationship skills."
good,"This job started out pretty enjoyable, but after the coming and going of members of management and 4 store managers it got to be just a place you go to work. The best parts of my workday are meeting my friends who are either customers or the few who are coworkers but not my job. It could be better, but that would be too much to ask for."
good,Walmart is the same since I worked for them back in 2001. The customer service motto is far gone. No one helps anyone at all. Self check out is the new thing.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is interesting. Management  is extremely interchangeable. The pay is terrible, however the benefits are decent. There is often unethical behavior"
good,"You have to work at a very high production and you only get two twenty minute breaks when you work a twelve hour shift.  There are many departments that may work for you, but you need to find the best one for you."
good,"This job was hard. It took all of my 8 hours to restock the aisle I was assigned. We were given breaks which  were mandatory, but sometimes it was hard to squeeze them in. I did not have much down time."
good,When you have poor managers and co workers it makes it difficult to work good. You have to deal with good and bad customers but it's an over all good job.
good,"many years ago I worked there before obtaining a professional job. it was part time work, low pay, but decent working environment and they worked with my school schedule at the time."
good,"it was nice working with this company. was able to meet a lot and different people. customers are very nice and some aren't"
good,A typical day at work is working hard and getting the shelves stocked and what ive learned is if you don’t work hard and finish your work then the next day will be even harder.
good,"I worked for the company for 14 years ,they called me in when I was on vacation and told me my job was being elliminating in April,it would have been nice  if they would have given us another job and go to keep our same pay."
good,I did have fun sometimes but like 85 percent it was so stressful . you will meet great people there and some not so great people lol.most if not all workers do drugs there
good,"Amongst all retail, Wal-Mart is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to paying it's associates. Starting pay is a dollar or more less than it's leading competitors. Management is laid back but, they get snarky. The department managers and csms basically get away with what they please at the moment and not many people are motivated to work."
good,Ever wanted to work at a place that was like your High School but a little worse and get paid for it? Well Welcome to Walmart. Most of the time you are left alone unless people decide to discuss it in the break room later. You only hear from managers if something is wrong beyond that you are left alone. Scheduling is completely random and heaven forbid you get overtime.
good,I believe there's issues in the policy about emergency call offs. Things happen in life u can't control and the fear of loosing your job shouldn't be a issue. I also feel that you come in and do your job the best you can. You shouldn't feel that your job is always in jeopardy..  You should be aloud to change areas and times you want to work do to circumstances at home.  Well trained employee in all areas is a available asset to any company. So I feel you should have that opportunity giving to you in all fields and hrs of the day.
good,Good pay lack of full training and team work. Very busy and fast paced. Customers could be treated better and attended to. System very user friendly and easy.
good,Una empresa no muy mala para trabajar pero en estos momento no tiene hora para los empleados ...
good,"Se trabalha muito, não tem plano de carreira, você entra e vai ficar eternamente no mesmo cargo."
good,Great environment to work but sometimes seems like rules are not being Followed the same for all people the same. Great people to work with. Some people don’t have a sense of team work and are lazy.
good,"I am a dependable hard worker.  I enjoy helping the customers. "
good,It is a great place to work. The people are fantastic in my area. My days are never the same since I work in a grocery DC. It just depends on how people eat.
good,You have to watch yourself at all times. I've seen people get fired for circumstances that were unavoidable. Beware of new managers who let their role affect the way they handle certain situations.
good,It was pretty good working there. I started there immediately after high school just to save money up. You can definitely work your way up. Many mangers I knew started from the bottom and worked their way up. Opportunities are always opening up. Depending on which department you work in there are there ups and downs. Walmart was pretty fun and chill.
good,Don’t take a leave. They will find a way to fire you. Otherwise HR is great. My mother passed away. They sent flowers and checked on me frequently. Great people.
good,"Ok,place to work,The Modular team is responsible for rearranging product displays (including shelves and the like) of most items in the store according to direction from the Home Office. Secondary responsibilities include cleaning, figuring shelf capacities, effecting price changes, registering all items to have a known home shelf location in the store, and taking extra product to the back room."
good,"Good management, decent co workers and an overall good environment. Employee discount could be better but the reward programs are great! Pleasing the customer is probably the most difficult part."
good,"Every day you may have a different task. You learn that sometimes customers have bad days as well and you need to take care of their need without judgment. One downfall of management is telling someone else what is needed of you. Sometimes these are rude and have no people skills. They need to learn that a job gets done faster and with ease when a person is asked to do it with a kind voice instead of rudely obnoxious voice. We most generally work together as a team with diverse culture and races as being family ordinated. The hardest part of the job would be when a customer talks to you and complains like it is your fault, maybe even cursing at you. It is enjoyable to see the same customers who come by to see you and talk to you like family. they know you treat them well and come back for your help."
good,Yearly restructures since 2015 have caused undue havoc and stress to the employees while barely effecting corporate management.  Unions actively discouraged.
good,Im always smiling so the people like coming into walmart to see my smily face. I felt like i could ask management for anything. They were depenable about getting me help.
good,"very good place to work for life and work balance"
good,the job had its good nights and bad ones. some managers were cool and others were ok. I got along with pretty much all the workers. if I had to go back to work there I believe I could.
good,"It was a good part time job for me to take for a few months. However, the work space became less accommodating for my work hours even when I had to balance it with my school life. The work itself is rather fun and not too bad to work at and the management is great. But the work hours never changed for me and it gave me a hard school life until I ultimately quit."
good,"Everyone is going to work retail at some point, and there is no where better to experience retail than at Walmart."
good,The job was totally based on production.  The managers at Walmart was very aggressive towards getting work done.  They also treat some employees better than others.
good,It is an alright job. Hours are semi flexible. Point system sucks. Maternity leave is nice. Management is very poor and doesn't really care about employees.
good,the work varies from day to day and is usually fast paced. working around so many different personalities was the most exhilarating part of the job but it was also the demanding because you never know whats going to happen. i learned that managing a steady pace can be difficult but also rewarding because you learn what sort of system works for you
good,All in all its an ok job. It just get fustartting when everbody doesnt pull there weight. Other than that its a good job to work. The enjoyable part of the job is satifing the customers
good,"I like the company, my typical day is a very busy day in the personnel office. I have learned that change is good. The workplace culture is people from all over and very friendly. The hardest part of my job is fixing alot of errors. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people."
good,Not sure why but cashiers are always needed at this place badly! Wasn't too bad of a job cause you get the chance to meet new people every day!!!!!!!!
good,work and hours was great everyone would work together no lazy people you come do you're work and go home management wasn't perfect but it was alright .
good,"It’s like any retail job. Work horrible hours that are inconsistent, end up doing other people’s work and favoritism. If you like meeting people in your life this is the place to be"
good,"Walmart has its pros and cons. I enjoy the company of my associates, feel like management could help out their associates a little more, but besides that its an okay place to work at"
good,"I was there originally for a good while. We used to get good raises on the yearly reviews now we don't. Ever since 2016, to give everyone the higher starting pay, you don't get the good vacation time, etc unless you are full time. And the yearly raise is a set percentage that everyone gets whether or not it is really deserved. We have had many managers over the years, and many people come and go throughout the job. It is what you make of it. Currently, even if one could get full time status here you would need another job for extra money especially if you have a family or are helping to take care of family. If it's just for spare money, it's ok."
good,Wal-Mart was my first job when I was 16. I wish I know a whole lot more about the work place and what needed to be done. I probabl;y would of stayed there longer.
good,It isn't anything special you deal with rude co-workers and management you deal with rude customers that try to use different price tags a lot. you don't get much help if you are a cart pusher.
good,at Walmart there always a completion always work need to be done it always drama going inside Walmart because of the customers and they always doing wonderful things for there coworkers
good,"The job itself wasn't bad. Management just made it difficult to do the job correctly. Great benefits, pay wasn't anything special but it got the bills paid."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, e a importância do trabalho em equipe."
good,"The entry was fun just as the leave the other workers had a good sense but some others didn't , so we had to keep on searching for our next great adventure other than staying in the same mountain if you know what I mean."
good,The only thing that bothers me is the inconsistent hours. One day you will work 8 hours the next you may work 4 hours at completely different times. There should be more consistency in scheduling.
good,"I developed a good rapport with my regular customers. We had fun when they came in, helped them to the best of our abilities. Tried to encourage them to leabe with a smile."
good,"every time you entered the work place, you already know what you had to do. no one really told you what to do, unless the supervisor had a specific task he wanted to assign you too. Other than that it was a simple day."
good,"To obtain a position as a Graphic Designer with a company that will allow professional growth in my career and benefit from my experience, skills and creativity in Visual Communications."
good,"Walmart is an unorganized business, as far as the staff they are always shortstaffed. Walmart  does well with sales and the customers make you keep coming to work everyday."
good,Walmart is a good place of employment. Do your job. Do not get involved with Co - workers. It's busy and stressful at times. It will help to pay.*****
good,"it was nice getting experience in logistics and distribution."
good,I was lucky enough to be offered a role in the accounting office.  I enjoyed the job and learned skills which I hope will help me find suitable office employment further afield.
good,It's ok temporarily but I don't think it is something I will recommend to try and climb up the ladder. It's ok for customer service and team leader experience but overall I think it would personally take too long to climb the ladder
good,"The work was quick paced and the management was not very well at my location, although the managers at other locations were okay. I feel that walmart is an okay place to work but just not the kind of long term work for me personally"
good,non-stop customers. Some very friendly yet others with really bad attitudes. Some managers have favorites and shouldn't show it. They really should appreciate employees who are really there to work.
good,"cashier / service desk "
good,"Cool co workers and management (to a certain point). Minimum wage. Really stressful during the holidays. You get first picks for black Friday, other than that, you will never want to go to another Walmart again."
good,I was a college student when I started working. The job was ok but the traveling was killing me I practically lived out of my car. It's a good temporary job I wouldn't make a career out of it personally.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo ,personal agradable,trabajo estable"
good,"stock overnight shelfs "
good,"Apparel Department usually very busy and well kept. Fitting are organized and kept in order. Store is usually very slow during the first 3 days of the week. Once the weekend comes around, it gets busy."
good,A typical day of work consist of  maintaining sales and keeping the prices in the system the same the hardest part of the job would be making sure all products are listed right on the sign and in the system
good,I started out working as an associate and worked my way to manager in a short time.  The hours were okay and the people were nice.  This was just not the type of position that I went to school for.  Retail was not my thing.
good,I worked for only a short time at Walmarts and did not like the department that I worked in not organized. To many customer complaints about their service.
good,"As part of the Floor Maintenance (3rd Shift) Crew, we had to work at a moderately steady pace, but once one gets into the rhythm of things and finds their work-flow, the job becomes easy and the time flies. The principles behind Walmart (basic work-ethic principles) are useful and life-long lessons. Most employees were nice and had a positive attitude. We were understaffed initially and some of our equipment was faulty but once were had sufficient help, the job became even easier. Pay is nice for anyone looking for a job; I would not make a career out of Walmart though. It is but another rung in the ladder of success for me."
good,"Long hours, low pay, mean customers high cost for low rate insurance. Make you wait a year to qualify for benefits and very expense. Work load not realistic with a few people doing all the work while the managers sit in office and watch everyone else work"
good,not very fun you sit there ask cutomers for recipts bad pay mean cutomers but goo co workers ok manager no benfits except ur 10% discount I would rather had been on cash
good,"If you enjoy retail, Walmart has great opportunities to advance. If you are a customer service minded person, it is simply a job with great benefits. It is a very fast paced environment with a rush-rush and pressure atmosphere. Management appears to listen but you can tell they are focusing on too many other things to actually focus on the needs of the employee. It is hard if you are a middle age person because management if VERY young and you may feel demeaned."
good,It's an ok first job honestly. People could be rude acting like they're you're God or something. I'd recommend it as a first job but not a long term job.
good,Things worked well but not well enough that they couldn't have been improved upon. No one seemed interested in ideas for improvement from lower level management.
good,"Good employer, good place to work at."
good,Walmart is a good place to work especially for someone who is looking to learn about working with every type of customer a workplace would possibly come in contact with
good,Down stack grocery freight with 3-5 people with over 30 hours an usually get done by 9pm an move on to different departments like automotive or sporting goods. I learned to work together as a team an get more done then management expected.
good,Working for Walmart is fast pace coworkers are friendly and will to lead a hand mangers are willing to take the time to help you and to answer any question that you have
good,All the hard work was done by Temp workers. Lumping trailers by hand and palletizing or hand loading trailer going out to stores. Wage were barely above minimum wage at the time. Haven't work there in Ten years so might have changed. Only hired on employees were of the Owner of the warehouse. Which they did not hire from the labor workers.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, but found that the constant changing of policies made it unnecessarily stressful.  Also would have preferred a more fixed schedule so that planning can be made for outside work hours.  I was not able to commit to other weekly or monthly demands because my schedule changed often (until near the end of  my time with the company when I worked mostly regular hours)"
good,"Walmart was a cool place to work as long as you could show up on time and get your work done. Since I worked in a certain department, the manager was a good guy who only expected me to get a list of stuff done at night so he did not have to do it in the morning."
good,"It's not a bad place to work. However, it could offer a little more options for your schedule other than being bounced all around each day. Also, the pay could be a little better for the amount of work you do and what you deal with as far as working with the public."
good,"Walmart Pharmacy for pharmacy technicians should be seen as a stepping stone for young adult's career. I have worked with several different pharmacists, some who will give you opportunities to expand your career, but some will just make you work as a typical pharmacy technician. As with all jobs, you can expand on your role to make it helpful in your career. I advise anyone to keep on studying since this is not a career for a life."
good,"Fast paced company environment and the equipment sometimes didnt work properly.  The management would work the hard workers into the ground.  The more you do, the more they expect."
good,"as a temporary Walmart worker i learned a lot with being there. I learned how use a forklift, and stocking. And also how to balance job with everyday life."
good,"The pay is generally above average to normal sales associate jobs and for overnights the hours were fine until cuts arrived. However the store is extremely understaffed and continues to become worse as hour cuts happen. Having to do the job of 2 or 3 associates is incredibly stressful and at times feels like you are drowning. "
good,A typical day at work involved clocking in. Then checking in with customer service to see where they needed me to work. I learned that most employees do not like working the long hours and most of them have a second job to support their family. The management was alright despite being treated as replaceable workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with other employees and making customers days by making small talk with familiar customers.
good,Overall Walmart is a fun and exciting place to work. I been working there since 2003 and had nothing but fun and exciting experiences. I wish I was still working with Walmart.
good,I work as a cashier and am usually working one on one with a customer. sometimes i will be on self checkout which is my favorite place to be. they also like to put me on the door as a greeter sometimes. the job can be inconsistent as to where i am placed but i am trained in all of the areas. the hardest part of the job is being on my feet for nine hours at a time. the most enjoyable part is talking to customers especially those with little kids. i love meeting new people and i love giving out stickers to the babies.
good,"I personally loved working for Walmart. It's slow paced they work with you. I learned to work with very diverse people, between customers and employees. I love how Walmart allows their employees to be themselves and create a fun atmosphere for everyone!"
good,I love working with the employee and helping customers the hours are not great but to some its good i love to work and learning new things i just want more hours
good,"we worked together  pretty well "
good,Bom de trabalhar. Bouas oportunidades de crescimento!
good,"I did the same thing over, and over every night, I pull items from the back room to the sales floor to be stocked, and very morning we worked the same items back in to the racks in the back room.  the counts need to be fixed."
good,Didn't have a chance to advance in my department lots of policy and procedures changes every year associates call out I followed policy and warranties salary would over ride what we are supposed to do just to keep customer happy
good,"I do not really have anything to say about my days working at Walmart Inc. They would not work with my school schedule, and because of that I had to leave."
good,Overall this is a good place to start a career but it depend on you and how far you willing to grow with this company..some managers are great depending on what department you're in
good,Really fun. Have to stay on top of your breaks or you won’t get a break. You’ll have more than one role. Promotions is easy if you stay focused. Customers remember you.
good,"After 10 years at Walmart I have had several positions.   I would have liked more opportunity for training and advancement.  Salary has not kept pace with the cost of living, and hours are unpredictable.  Overall it was a good place to work but I want more opportunity that I can get at Walmart"
good,"with 14 years as customer service looking to make a carrier change , better income and less stress environment ,, looking for a growing company to best utilize my skills where I can advance and retire from ,"
good,"Great place to work for someone in college or high school looking for a part time job, hard to grow with the company, not much in the way of promotions."
good,"Its fine nothing that is exceptional, the bosses aren't that great, I want a paycheck and they give it to me. They have a huge turnover of workers. Bad point system."
good,Customer service experience  I am a great worker love helping people customer service is my job stocking and unloading top stock as well my shift is 10-7
good,"An typical day at Walmart was just coming in running frozen and diary carts. Receiving Stock orders and helping many customers. There I learned how to operate Forklift, stock and scan products."
good,My experience with Walmart is like a never ending book. You see happy people and rude people all in one day. And at the end of the day I just try my best to keep a smile on people’s faces.
good,Bad leader good working condition  safe place to work learn slot about retail how price is set how things are set on the self and working a team gets things done
good,"a lot of people did enjoy working here, heard someone say the wanted to leave/quit everyday, stressed, managers were often slow, and neglected workers."
good,Laid back place to work with flexible schedules and opportunities to advance. Always racing to keep ahead of the competition. Stock options are nice and a lot of opportunity to earn paid time off.
good,"This company is good to work for if you like fast pace and customer interaction. You need to be able to give your 100% to be able to get through the day since your motto is ""customer is always right""."
good,when i worked at walmart i guess it was the store that i worked at. the people there were ok they all acted like they were better than everyone else.i was always getting in trouble for stuff that i didnt do.
good,"Was my first job, and one of my best. Although the customers werent always amazing, the coworkers and most management were very nice and worth it. just wish we did not have to push the mastercard so much."
good,"Responsible for accuracy of cash and credit card transactions. Greeted customers with a smile. maintained a clean work area, Stack and bag groceries to provide exceptional customer service.The job was a very good job I enjoyed it very much it wasnt a hard job I enjoyed all the customers."
good,When i worked at Walmart is pretty nice because i grew up down the hill from the Store it was like a home extension. I was responsible for getting Carts and loading heavy products for customers. There was opportunity and advancement but i wasnt a valued employee
good,It was an alright company just I felt like it was a family oriented place son in one department mom in the other but that wasn't a big deal I did my job and I loved night stocking
good,"not really sure what else to say, other than it's Walmart. Walmart could care less about it's employees but that is nothing new.  Immediate time off was needed and Walmart denied its staff exactly that. It's a job, there are no happy employees there."
good,"Walmart is definitely what you make it. Most of the associates stick together like a family and they fight like siblings as well. Walmart is a good foot in the door company, I don't see it being a life long career."
good,walmart was good to me. I started off as a cashier and had the opportunity to move up in the company. I received the education and training that I needed to move up.
good,ok company to work for work place culture respect for the indivuled   make sure u show up for work on time  they dont stand for profanity over time is offerd when the  company approves it
good,"Walmart is a stable environment to work part-time while you are earning your degree.  1 hour lunches, 15 minute breaks, good friend.  Bosses are OK.  Regular paycheck with benefits after 1 year. 401K match. Health and dental care."
good,First job while going to school was very difficult but learned from it. This job has paved the way for me for future jobs down the road and i am grateful for it.
good,"Walmart is a job where you will stay busy the entire time you are working, yet you dont every really feel rushed overly much.  Pay is above average. It is a very tech focused job.  You usually keep a very set schedule for the times that you will work.  Overall a nice job, though the hours can be a bit lacking at times."
good,"walmart was a good company at first until poor managment ruined the company. the company was very unorganized too, they always had mistakes with the schedule and other important things."
good,Walmart is a good job for a young person but not for a older person. Once you get to top pay there’s no more raises . Walmart distribution center is design for every employee to make the same.
good,"Learning the stuff is not a problem. You just need to pay attention and remember. The environment isn't a bad place either, you just have to work through it."
good,I worked there since the store opened and for the most part I enjoyed my job. Most of the other associates were supportive and tried to make the work day easier for everyone.
good,Be on time. Always do your work and stay in your designated area. After 6 months you will qualify to move to another area of your choice if you are chosen for it.
good,Working at walmart is a bittersweet experience. I met a lot of unforgetable people (associates and customers). My only real complaint was my position only had part time and I couldn't change my availability. I also received bare minimum training in operating the main printers and almost no training at all on how to use our systems.
good,It's a steady job with great job security. The management can ruin working there. Life and work balance was hard due to inconsistent scheduling. The work was easy.
good,The management sometimes doesn't listen or were under staffed because who was in charge of scheduling. The customers made my day more enjoyable and I loved it when they talked about their days and about their kids. It made work more enjoyable.
good,"The hardest part of the job is occasional faulty equipment and the mechanical routine of a cashier. It is possible to enjoy the customers and people, and I have learned a lot about patience and respect."
good,"Played many roles at Wal-Mart for a low paying hourly amount. Most managers weren't training staff based on working demands. Great paid time off, call off docking is horrible"
good,it was just a regular job stocking shelves at Walmart in the frozen food aisle pay was fair people were good management was fair nothing great but nothing terrible either
good,"Cleaning shelves, stocking shelves with fresh produce. Great way to get experience in customer service. Making sure all dates and times are correct. Mangment is alittle harsh."
good,"The mangers are poor at this Walmart and can be so much better. They don't work around your everyday life. They don't listen AT ALL. The overnight mangers only hire people to fit their personal needs, Example I was taken off of day shift to do the support manger job when she is not there. And she is off every weekend. I would highly recommend Walmart, JUST NOT TRUSSVILLE !"
good,Walmart is a good quality job to work for. It has benifits such as health and dental and discounts 401K. management don’t have good customer service .
good,A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers and helping them with point of sale transactions.  I also helped customers find items they were looking for.  I learned to have a deeper appreciation for customers and got better cash handling experience.  I made friends with the other cashiers.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customers that did not have enough money to purchase items.
good,"la empres siempre te da capacitaciones, y crecimiento laboral "
good,its walmart what can i say its nice itll hold you off they treat you good (the employees at least cant talk for the customers) but its a good job nice benifits and pay
good,"I worked for Walmart 8 years ago. I'm sure the culture is different now.  But, I was an external hire. Part of my hiring was to bring in new ideas to the company. However, when I was in stores. My ideas were never heard and upper management were still following practices from the early 90's"
good,"Working at Wal-Mat is stressful, because you can have one good day and three bad ounces. Most of the customer are very nice and try to make your day a bit better if you look like you are having a bad day."
good,Manager asked about working with a certain person and wanting me in a different position time slot.  He changed my area and hours.  Great hours. Store manager was very nice.
good,"As department manager I was in charge of keeping shelves stocked, inventory orders, bookkeeping, reporting to corporate office and hiring and firing of six employees. The hardest part of the job was inventory control and the most enjoyable was working with people."
good,the job at Walmart is stressful.  customers are rude and hateful.  didn't get paid for all that you have to put up with.  was cold in winter and hot in the summer
good,Nice place to work lots of different opportunities with all the different departments.  Easy to cross train and work for several different departments
good,I personally didnt like it the days where long with little help exspectations where so high for someone who just started it was disappointing how quick there where to write the new guy up
good,It is a good place to work if you dont mind doing the same thing every day and also good for job security. Slow months take a toll after the holidays.
good,I love the environment I love the job but me being or getting older there’s just starting things differently that I cannot deal with. The manager needs to work on her attitude as one then maybe it would be ran better
good,I liked my job at the store. I learned many useful things for my future.  Would go to work for this company again. The only reason I left this job was that I had a new baby that needed me to be at home.
good,Its very competitive working stocking the shelves at same time as customers are shopping as ur putting it onto the shelves.good pay and benefits and career opportunities.
good,"Walmart had great benefits, but the management wasn't good at all. A lot of the managers were disrespectful. They pushed elderly workers too hard; to the point where one of my elderly co workers almost had a heart attack."
good,Is an ok job.  Fast paced and busy at times.  . Its also a fun place to work.  The customers are nice and friendly.  At times it can be very demanding.
good,"it was an okay place walmart does not pay over time."
good,"Greeting customers old and new. I learned how to deal with the public well. Mangement is good. Workplace is ok environmentally and safety wise. The hardest part of job was working on Self Check Out because you have eight regesters going at one time. The most enjoyable part of it was meeting new people."
good,"The walmart store I worked for was very hard place to work in. Not to shade the whole company, but there are lot of problems in the store itself that needs to be fixed badly"
good,I was caught basically in the middle of a war between some of the managers. I was being told to do one thing by one manager then 5 minutes later another manager would tell me something else is more important. Then the first manager would come back and get mad their task isn't done. And this happened with 6 different managers.
good,Walmart is a good company and with good benefits but I felt lost .it was like an every man for himself type of thing at the beginning.got easier after training though.
good,the job is not stressful. you will be standing consistently throughout your work day. management was very accomadating with the days that were needed off to help with a family members dr. appts.
good,"A typical day is walking in and start to fill the missing or low items on the wall and clean my area also help costumer service. I also help other departments with their work too. Management was somewhat helpful, not very professional at their job. The workplace culture is friendly-ish, and relaxed. The hardest part of the job was going between departments and working and not doing what I needed to get done."
good,a oob this is only a test do not a job only a test no typical day will do  what you learned management work place the best place in the world  the top of the line
good,"Pretty standard day and consistent work schedule from unloading trucks and pulling pallets on to the sales floor to all the way to stocking."
good,typical day as a claims associate is dealing with emails that contains multiple recalls and information. Then processing all the returns from the previous day from customers. This can easily be the hardest part of the job depending on the time of year but can also be the easiest.
good,Es una empresa recomendable para personas sin ambición
good,I started out loving my experience with Walmart. It was a fun and nice place to work friendly managers. But by 2018 it took a cut throat like turn with different managers. I would go back because pay was good and benefits are great.
good,"Working at Walmart was mostly slow paced, but Sunday's it gets very busy. And also holidays get busy too. I was a cart associate here. It had its pros and cons."
good,"terrible managment, unhappy associates."
good,"enjoyed my co-workers enjoyed the customers"
good,no matter what you do or complain about they dont fix the problem even if you are trying to avoid the problem no one help until ts to late  in the switch your role alot
good,Walmart was a good company to work for. It was a lot of work at times but everybody was really friendly. It was a great job while I was trying to obtain my CDL license.
good,Its been a long time since I worked there. It was a nice place to start. They had breaks and followed them. They were good with working with you schedule. Time off for being sick is an issue.
good,Was a well organised store that I believed was understanding and dedicated their hard work to serving and helping customers get what they needed also help save money.
good,"I worked as a Pharmacy Technician at Walmart Pharmacy for about a year. I enjoyed the overall structure and schedule. Connexus, TasCo, McKesson, and other computer systems were very easy to use and learn. Training was also a plus - Walmart offered their employees a lot of resources. Benefits weren't so good, and management could be improved. In conclusion I enjoyed working there and I would recommend."
good,"Hit or Miss. You can have a great experience with Walmart with good Management and Co workers. However the same applies negatively. If there's bad management and no good co workers, your experience isn't that great."
good,This was my first job so pay at the time was reasonable. Don't receive much of a raise and when you do it's not enough to really notice a difference. Overall was underpaid for the job duties.
good,"Walmart just wasn’t the place for me, but if you enjoy retail or customer service it’s the place for you. There are a ton of opportunities for advancement if you look for them."
good,This was where I started. I just didn't know what I was getting into. Retail is just not for everyone. I like people so it was a good fit for me. I stayed with it.
good,"I liked working there but there was little room for advancements. I had a set schedule and that was what I worked, no over time. I wore many different hats at that store."
good,Company went through many changes over the years but doesn't seem for the best.  They seem to have lacked the care for the customers etc and the quality of service they provided in recent years.
good,"At the portrait studio, I got to meet so many new people. It also helped me gain my work experience in Photography which is one of my favourite hobbies."
good,"Before walmart was 24 hours - long stressful stocking. It became a waiting game. In order to do your job, you needed to wait for another person to do theirs, so constantly waiting."
good,Usually this job required great communication skills in order to help customers. Tgus job also required to be always open minded to suggestions and to always be on time.
good,"It's working for a large company, they have company policies and procedures. Things change frequently and the knowledge of closing stores and more things needing less employees"
good,"My position was a cart pusher and I hated it. Whether it rained, was cold or hot outside, we had to push carts inside. Walmart's policy  is you must stay at the current position for 6 months before you can be transferred to a different one. After 6 months they refused to transfer me and I started to look elsewhere."
good,"My experience at Walmart was good for what it was, but unfortunately I wasn't giving chances to move up, and I tried to advance frequently. It was also hard to get 40 hours a week sometimes, and no chances for overtime"
good,They are bunch of slave drivers. They work you to death and they don't care about you. I work my butt off over 90 days and do not get a pay raise. Managers didn't really care about you
good,This was an interesting place to work at. I enjoyed the experience and the team work environment. I suggest you work there at this location. It was a great second job.
good,If it fits your way of life it is convenient....I would suggest more better trained management. Better Training all the way around. Lower expectations thrown on one person
good,It wasn't bad. The pay was OK for starting the hours weren't great and as far as being open to outside collaboration they were non receptive. Overall it was a good starter job it just wasn't for me
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart , not enough hours given , I learnt many things there but was not happy with new management.I enjoyed the interaction with the public ."
good,"Not a bad place to work, the pay is fair, the management is pretty okay, and the Walmart associates are very helpful and friendly, the store layout was easy to learn and keeping the store stocked was fun."
good,Management is not always the greatest. Some stores change management every few months so it's difficult to get on the same page. Very difficult to get promoted unless you know the right people.
good,"The work is incredibly easy and employees are not rushed to do their job.  The warehouse is clean. However, the chances of moving up in the warehouse are very limited and is more political than  anything else; depends on who you know."
good,It’s a good company to work for but the management team sucks I would have stayed if they didn’t have a bad management team they really need to change that about them
good,Mes collègue de travail était des anges il me supportai quand j'en avais besoin et même pendant une période difficile. Ils était les meilleurs. Ma CCM était très compréhensive avec moi.
good,I enjoy working there. Everyone is friendly and helpful but I want more outside of retail. The hours are decent and they usually have an option for people to work for overtime every week due to the long list of call offs. I also like the point system they set up.
good,overall for being the biggest retailer in the united states they don't pay their employee's well and treat then badly. I was treated badly by lots of upper management and their raises were only at the most 40 cents per hour
good,Walmart can be a messy workplace at times but the money is worth it It’s a very busy work place and can get the Best of you sometimes And it can be very fast paced
good,"Walmart’s pay is good, and how they gave hours. But the management was not good. I went months working there and never spoke to one manager because they simply didn’t care about their employees enough to introduce themselves or even say hi. My employees were nice, csms were nice, just not management."
good,I would not mind working there if they would give out more hours. Basically you get there you are assigned what to do for the day. You run the cart out to the floor and stock the shelves. It is not too hard and it is a good place to work just not enough hours are given.
good,"Job was good for what it was.  I think the pay was decent.  I really liked my co workers and most of the customers were nice.  The job, however, can be very tedious and draining."
good,not the best place to work. fast paced. must be highly motivated and a self starter. ability to communicate and knowing who to communicater with is most important
good,Te permiten estudiar mientras trabajás de forma que puedes hacer carrera en la empresa
good,Decent company to work for starting out of highschool. Complete your task and you'll be fine. Laid back and low stress. Always look for opportunity to advance and you'll get far in life.
good,Working at Walmart was my first full time job and it was different. Such a huge company with so many bosses giving different orders took time to adjust to. Hardest part was deciding which boss orders was the correct one to follow. I learned how competitive the work world is and how important it is to give your all.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart it was first corporate employment. Ive learn a lot but also had to learn on my own. Management was ok but unprofessional.
good,"Depending on ur section working there isn’t so bad , employees are kinda decent, pay is 2 weeks which isn’t bad if u don’t have bills like me, breaks were nice 1 hr two 15 mins"
good,It's ok just need more hours!!! The people are greet fun to work well some of them other than that more hours should be added.........................
good,Worked there pregnant with my daughter and it was not as stressful as I thought it would be. Very relaxed environment and very laid back. Everyone there was like a regular at a slow paced restaurant.
good,"My job in the TLE department of Walmart was easy, but only when we actually had oil, weights to balance the tires. The shop wasn't always fully stocked on the main items we needed complete the tasks at hand."
good,"The job is okay, if you working part time its hard to get hours sometimes so it's not consistent.The job is only worth staying if you're going to work full time or trying to move up in the company."
good,Es una empresa que tiene muchos beneficios pero aveces no te deja tener un equilibrio sano entre tu vida laboral y personal afectando principalmente la salud OJO en algunas ocaciones todo depende de el personal que opera en cada sucursal en general podría decir que es aceptable
good,It was a good job just some of the employees were kind of rude to the customers and to other employees. Also the pay was kind of bad. It was a good job over all thouqh.
good,"The positive attitude is what kept me going. It's the negative, bitter people who bring the mood down and cause the turnover rate of potential new hires. Happy environment=Higher productivity."
good,"If you need to work while going to college, this is a great place to work while working on creating a better future for yourself and your family. Was a full time manager"
good,"It was a matter of time until my position was gone. They started out sourcing my duties to a company so they can pay them less. They are replacing the front offices with computers, cashiers with self checks and hiring other companies to do our jobs for less money do they could save on man hours."
good,"Wal-mart is a great company to work for, with fast easy advancement. Friendly staff, clean environment. With plenty of other things to do it never gets boring."
good,It was a job when I needed it when it was very hard to find a job I am thankful for that but at the time I was hired the pay was minimum wage very hard work alot of lifting.
good,"I worked three days a week, 11 hour shifts. I worked there for 10 years. I held an office position and delt with over the road truck drivers. The pay was excellent and so were the benefits."
good,"I started out as a cashier, part time.  I wanted to work my way up to a service desk associate.  I didn't hesitate to let our front end manager know that.  The front end manager came to me and asked me if I was interested and f course I jumped at the chance.   Having worked there for over 2 yrs. I have found out some things that have been a little discerning for me in regard to management and other departments.  My job is not hard and the most enjoyable part of my job is working a great bunch of women who are fun to work with."
good,This company is not family oriented as they advertise to be (not for employees). If you like to be a very supportive parent the hours you work will not allow for it at times. Management can be rude at times and will overwork the same employees.
good,I meet a lot of great people and learn a lot everyday I love my experience as being a cashier with Walmart . I could see my self being there for the rest of my life but I just choose not to.
good,The work was good for the amount of money it helped me learn too communicate with people and deal with different kinds of situations but I was really set of getting i to a warehouse
good,Walmart is a decent enough place to work if you're only looking for a job. They really don't do much to make employees desire to stay with the company long term.
good,"Depending on if the store is having a busy day or not, the store would run smoothly. Management was fairly pleasant and were flexible with hours, considering I was a high school student at the time."
good,the break room was very nice the remodeled it for us. that was nice but there attitudes are terrible and they don't work well with employees. They schedule people on days their availability says they are. sometimes they can be very unorganized.
good,Walmart is a face paced environment.  They are very competitive with prices and depending on the manager they are very reasonable. Over all they are a great company to work for.
good,Be prepared for anything. They usually put u where they need u. As maintenance I stayed busy working overnight scrubbing and buffing floors. Flexibility required for the position here.
good,"For a seasonal job it is as expected, fast paced, aggravated customers, and short tempered employees. However, Walmart is very strict on making sure employees take their breaks and lunches!"
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of work. I learned the use of certain power tools and acquired some mechanical skills which helped me advance my overall knowledge in the automobile business.
good,The typical day was doing whatever my manager asked me. I learned about Walmart's products. Management was OK. Workplace culture was good. The hardest part of job was that it was boring sometimes. The most enjoyable part was working in the garden center.
good,it was fast paced and decent people to work with. but the management wasn't the best and could've had better pay for the things to deal with on the day to day job.
good,"For such a large company, the bonds between the workers are irreplaceable. Most of the management team is fair, and you are guaranteed to get your forty hours."
good,"I am grateful for what I learned working at Walmart, but I will not be a return employee. "
good,Walmart has drastically changed over the past few years. I have felt for some time now that the company is getting further away for what's right for the associates.  As a manager the work life balance is no longer a focus.  As wages are reduced through the stores the hours that are put on salaried managers increases.  Far too often I've lost vacation days due to company needs and often have to work on scheduled days off.  During a work week it's often a struggle to get a full day off much less two and most shifts are twelve hour shifts.  I appreciate the training received by past management that have developed me into the manager I am today but feel that it is time for me to part ways with this company.
good,"Es una gran empresa, solo que su crecimiento de trabajo es mínimo o selectivo."
good,Everyday was a challenge but i believe i did very well after being there for only 3 months and then becoming a manager. Nothing was never too hard but of course everyday wasnt easy.
good,More development of staff is needed. The accountabilty aspect of hourly employees drove an environment of fear. Store manager focused on managing dollars and not leading staff in an inspirational way.
good,"it was a great department to work in, not much business but your always busy doing something if its not stocking you're changing prices, or making keys or maybe even mixing paint."
good,it was a very fun place to wor i really enjoyed the poole i worked with and i like all of my managers. the only really problem is that they would never hire enough people so we would have to sometimes stay way over then what we were supposed to but other than that it was a good job.
good,"Very fast pace work space, sometimes stressful and demanding, Dealing with cash sales and customer service. Busy during holidays. Supervisory duties through being a cashier."
good,"place was very active... great employees, had a very fun time while there..  was able to get alot of exercise in... because of all that fast pace walking around n unloading product.."
good,In all walmart was did not pay me enough money to take care of my son so i had to move on in life in find something new to be able to take care of my son and pay my bills at the same time
good,"A fast pace day is a typical day at Walmart.  I learned how to provide great customer service, communicate effectively, and independence.  I also learned about Wal-Mart products also."
good,"The Walmart culture that the actual company likes to push is awful. However, if you are blessed with good managers and coworkers in your little corner of your store, the work day can go fairly quickly because there’s a lot to do, and the pay is absolutely not bad at all. In my experience it was fairly easy to make sure people like you by simply trying a little bit and I genuinely liked a couple of my coworkers and most of the managers I worked closely with. The work was hard asf but once I got the hang of the rhythm I did not much mind it."
good,Walmart is an okay job to work at. I loved working with the people at Walmart but the manager was awful at what she done. Not all Walmart’s are like my Walmart. It’s very fast and stressful at time but it also paid great money.
good,Walmart is an okay place to start.... especially if you have family members there that are high up... other wise it's hard to get hours and extremely hard to move up.
good,"it has been about 13 years since I have worked there, and a lot seems to have changed when I worked there, I worked in the photo lab developing film. I had a flexible schedule and great team mates."
good,"To be an online personal shopper you’d have to get up at 4 am and start shopping. When you arrive you will get your scanner from your destinated area and start It up, when you pull up the personal shopper app you’ll select what category you want. When you are done with what category you picked you will put It away in it your destinated area."
good,Walmart was a long hour stressful job. Fun at time but always busy and difficult. Most times we did more than one person job in 1 shift. And jobs would be left undone the next day.
good,Busy seasons you are working fulltime hours and when it is slow you are lucky to make 7 hours every 2 weeks unless you have seniority. Pay sucks but benefits are good. No paid sick days but you get paid to take vacation days. There is a lot of back and forth between associates and managers and its a lot of doing and redoing the same thing over and over. Everyone acts like your boss and you have no idea who to listen to. Best to learn what you can and do your own thing.
good,It was a good place to work and was easy and enjoyable. I was fast placed some days and slow paced other. You did more than one job and they kept you busy with different tasks.
good,I worked in the deil it was fun i liked the people i worked with but never got to spend time with my children and some of the  management was rude and unpolite
good,"If your lucky enough maybe you'll get into the neighborhoods which are very different from super centers.  all in all it was pretty easy, but i worked in the neighborhoods."
good,I worked on the sales floor.  It was an okay place to work.  Co workers were friendly and helpful.  I always stayed busy.  Working at Walmart had it's busy times which was nice.  I like to stay busy.
good,"I never worked for Walmart, but indeed thinks I did.  Therefore, I am just filling in this review to get to a character count so I can hit submit."
good,This company is a good company to work for. I don't remember much from my employment as this was a few years ago. But would work for them again if I got the chance.
good,"Too many employees, very impersonal, all about efficiency not quality, don't care about the employees, hostile work environment at times, not room for growth"
good,great for high school students who want to make some money after school since the starting pay is $10.... dont expect to go black friday shopping on black friday because they make every one work or you are fired
good,The most enjoyable part about working at walmart was being able to work for my paycheck. Losing weight is simple with all the walking around you do in the 12 hr shifts.
good,"Processed the customers orders, and received the funds necessary to complete the transaction. Returns as required.  Required to straighten the areas around the cash resister.  Clean as need"
good,On your feet all day. An hour break for lunch for working an eight hour shift is very nice. But a 15 minute break for a 5 1/2 hour shift makes the day potentially tiresome and painful.
good,Walmart is a good job I will that fair place to be overall no complaints really other than the pay sometimes I will work here again with no problems always have openings available
good,"I think most of us know how Walmart is protreyed. Wages are not the best, benefits are medicore so on so forth. On the flip side there is definatly not much expected of the average employee."
good,"I enjoyed work there.   I had fair shift, changing with other worker. I liked it. enough time to rest, break in between and care from the supervisor. They appreciated me."
good,"Great place to work and meet people.  The work is fairly manageable, however, difficult to maintain a balance between work and your outside life. TL's are very understanding and expect you to do your best."
good,"I recommend this position for those who like the idea of supporting your team mates because as a customer host you will likely work indirectly with most people on the front end with a emphasis in my experience on security, customer survive and self check out employees."
good,"Working at Walmart the typical day is very stressful, and fast paced. There is hardly ever  a time where it is slow, if you are not on the register you are stocking the shelves. You don't have a set job they move you around to other areas where help is needed."
good,productive and a fast working pace.  Isn't a job I was used to doing.  All though I did enjoy the people and most of the customers.  I was quite tired at the end of my shift.  I did learn a lot about another company procedures and that was interesting.
good,"It's just a job. If you are a student, it's good. Not much advancement opportunities as the potential candidates for new positions seem to be already pre-selected."
good,It has been a while since I have worked for Walmart but I would normally come in during the night shift and mind my own business and ensure cleanliness of the whole store.
good,Good to place to work for to poor management in my area. Store needs to be evaluated from management down to sanitation. To much buddy buddies in the store instead of doing what you should be doing.
good,"Very fast paced, demanding environment under stressful situations, yet got pleasure out of assisting customers and training associates. Very team building enviroment"
good,"Working at a new startup store was hard work but fun.  That makes it difficult to give an overall rating. The two week training at an existing store was not fun.  Management was very disorganized and the store was a mess.  There was very little training; new team members seemed to be expected to learn by mistake.  Thankfully, it was not that way when I got to my new store."
good,oportunidade de nova função e conhecimento no mercado de trabalho.
good,Many positions available at walmart. Everything depends on location. You can have a great manager that truly cares about you or you could get someone who sees you as just another body. Some stores are like a family but others just let you figure it out for yourself. Most of the time you are not appreciated or valued. Customers treat you like dirt and management rarely takes your side. Great job while you go to school because hours work around your schedule.
good,"Overall this job is something decent, but there are not very many reasons to apply or work here. The health benefits are pretty much the only benefit. The pay is no where near reasonable. The management is not professional."
good,I feel it was wrong for them to release me due to my daughter being sick and I had to take a leave of absence . I feel they should allow you to take of if you or kids are sick . I am a single father of two kids .its very hard to find employment that fits my school schedule as well as my kids .
good,"It was a demanding job which I enjoyed for the most part.  I worked with much pride in my work, appreciation was not shown from most management.  This job was a big part of my life."
good,"It was okay when I first started 11 years ago but as time went on the company started changing and I was changing with it, but they where also cutting positions so I decided to go to school to learn something I loved very much in the Medical Field."
good,"My day would consist of keeping the Deli clean and orderly. Waiting on and helping customers at the counter, and preparing food. I learned to multitask in high stress situations. Management was always fair and understanding. Although the store could be stressful at times, our team would always persevere and make sure the customers had a pleasant shopping experience."
good,"was a good company to work for, just was looking for something different, was trying to balance a full time job and full time school, no time for sleep"
good,Working at Walmart was very stressful. Management always wanted different things and never agreed on the policies. My co workers were awesome and we worked together
good,Very intense fast paced environment. Good company to work for. Many decisions to make on a daily basis.  Several meetings and paperwork is extreme to match the abundance of processes and systems.
good,"Buena organización, pero inestabilidad laboral (fue antes de ser absorbido por Walmart)."
good,Within this company I have obtained many skills that help me in day to day life. The diverse environment has helped me communicate with different people and it has enhance my social skills. Further more as a walmart employee I was abled to not only get trained in my job specifications but also widen my skills as I learn to do things in other departments and help my fellow coworkers. Responsibility and quick learning are the traits that I gathered within this job witch will help me grow and gain a better job.
good,"HIGHLIGHTS"
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart! You must stay on top of things at all times ! It can be easy to fall behind. The benefits are ok but the salary could be a lot better.
good,as every where there is pros and cons. we are after all only human. Overall if you are selected to be a favorite then you will have opportunities to advance.
good,"There are times that are very stressful due to your position can change in a minute or other duties are added on that you were not expecting to do, with no warning"
good,"It's was a great job in my area designed, I work in a bakery area and they give me to learning more about that area roll and what the customer service."
good,"At Walmart, I learned how to do several tasks which contributed to the my skill set. The store has an endless category of jobs that you can gain much needed experience from."
good,"I worked early mornings to the afternoon, the first few hours was very slow. after the first break it starts to pick up, the customers start to really shop."
good,"Buen trato a trabajadores, organizacion, comunicacion gerente empleado,buena atencion al cliente, aprendi a trabajar con rapidez, me gusto ek trabajo en general"
good,It is a entry level job where you scan peoples groceries and other items. Then handle the money. It involves a lot of talking to customers and being friendly.
good,"working as a cashier really brings you close to people you never knew , the cashier work as a team and help each other when needed , we are always looking out for one another"
good,"It is a nice job if you’re just starting to work. It’s pretty easy to do, you just got to know the store. It’s pretty busy around holiday season but other than that it’s not that busy."
good,"A fun place to work for a starter job."
good,Its a very fast paced place. Only bad thing about walmart is that they give short breaks and sometimes the CSM's forget to give some cashiers their breaks
good,"It did not take long to learn the skills needed for my job. It became easy once you learned all your tasks. You needed to be friendly and helpful with everyone. Management could be available. However, if you needed to talk with someone, your option was middle-management or the CSM (customer service management). Most things/problems you had to solve on your own. But overall, I enjoyed working there. The people and the customers made it easy to go in. I miss it. But enjoyed the experience."
good,"Fun friendly people have good worker, when needed everybody work together friendly customers make time go by fast friendly manager and assistant managers"
good,This job is best for young people with little responsibility and retirees that need something to do. Not much of a career for the middle age group. The working structure of jobs are not meant for a career.
good,Worked for two years.  Very result driven.  Not big on family and core values.  Very money driven and making sales through customer count and low margin.
good,"Walmart seems great on the outside, but on the inside, it's completely different. My management team at the time wanted heavily unrealistic expectations when the department I worked in was always understaffed."
good,when you clock in you go straight to your location that your told that you will be working and get you job done when you learn where all the items go your work pace goes a lot faster
good,"The people I worked with were very nice and management was good too. I enjoyed my time here, but felt like I needed something with better benefits and PTO."
good,Grocery store business is a steady business to work at i had good managers that helped me a little with hours and also was in multiple fields in department
good,Its a good job but they choose and play favorites on who moves up and who gets this position no matter the qualifications between the candidates. Just favoritism. But overall its a decent place to work.
good,"Lack of training and poor staffing are the main ingredients for the burn out of the hard working, dedicated associates, who have held the structure in this industry, which unfortunately, are the less fortunate."
good,"The only positive to working at this place is the people I worked with. Other than that I honestly really cant say much else about it other than if you are lucky enough to be promoted to Assistant Manager, the pay is fairly decent."
good,"great company great opportunities lot of room for growth, bad hour bad scheduling. the point system need work on 4 point its a bad system when a person is injured or sick you must o throw third party to approve the leave of absence. pay is terrible."
good,I Fun Work plays friendly people sometimes can be an easy pays Someday can be a fast pace. Managers are fun and easy going to go if you do your job. Need to stay on task
good,"There were some crazy days answering phone,sending money us world wide though wire transfers,  make money order setting taxing exempt for customer thought are system,paying bill for customer though bill pay system ,and dealing with returning merchandise. to say lest it make you somewhat   flexible and  able to multitask."
good,Walmart has a lot to offer for those who are willing to work for it and they never had a shortage of hours for their truck crew people and tried to take good care of us.
good,"it was very good working there and learned so much , how to speak to others to increase our communication skills and work hard ,work with a saftey learned working team work etc"
good,"i enjoyed working in the deli but some of the people were not fair to work with and the schedules were not fairl . Alot of other people always got the morning hours and they would set only the same people for the night shift to close the deli . During our interview we were told that we would get both morning , day , and evening shifts"
good,"Each day was just about the same. We would unload a truck, either filled with pallets or boxes. Then we would either break down the pallets and stock what came off of them, or stock the boxes that just came out of the truck. This job taught me important customer service skills as well as quick problem solving. I thought the management was just okay, they had their pros, but also a lot of cons. Walmart was welcoming and tried to be helpful to their employees. The hardest part of the job was not the tasks, but the monotony."
good,walmart is good to work for and is a great place to shop and save money. they also is a company that is always near by and ready to hire people everyday
good,You always have to work hard but don't get paid enough money to all of that work. Sometimes management doesn't do their job which makes it easy for those slackers to keep a job
good,"Long hours and little appreciation. Expectations were at time unrealistic."
good,In my opinion it is a friendly work environment and it has flexible work times for the most part for people who may be in college and have to balance both work and school.
good,No guidance . I worked with them for a year and didn’t receive a race . They also have no appreciation for there employees. I was forced to the job of three people because of poor staffing. Also dealt with verbal abuse from managers. Was one of the worst experiences I’ve had in the work place.
good,Clock in work customer servicethen the cashier the next 3 hours. Some times I would stock the back and take items back to where they needed to be. not enough hours
good,"Beneficios bons, colegas de trabalho execelentes. 1"
good,"It was an okay place to work, just lack of communication within office personal but overall ok to work there pay is alittle low for all that you are responsible to do."
good,"Enjoyed working with Co workers, and helping the customers, Wish I had better pay tho.  I met a lot of really nice people in the community"
good,"Overall Walmart is okay if you don’t mind part time, however you do not qualify for health insurance. If you don’t mind working the overnight shift then you are offered a set schedule with full time status"
good,"A typical working environment. Being a cashier, there were constant interactions with customers and fellow employees. I enjoyed being able to use my Spanish for customers who struggled with English. There was always something to do. Hours would get cut short and the breaks were small. I didn't like the fact that we all had to clock-out for a lunch break. I also had a problem with being scheduled only 5 and half hours so that they weren't legally required to give you a lunch break."
good,"Well to keep it simple all we did was change tires, balance the tires and mount them. On top of that we would change oil and oil filters of the vehicles.  It was an average oil and tire building the only difference was you were under paid. At the time it was 2014 before they raised the employees salery, but at the time you started out making $8.45 an hour. At other shops the average shop worker doing the same thing makes anywhere from $10.00-$12.00 starting out. Now I believe the starting pay is $10.00, but at the time it wasn't worth staying around. I enjoyed the shop work for sure, but it wasn't work it at the time."
good,Aprendí a colocar marcancia en los estantes y a trabajar rápido.
good,"Wasnt a bad place to work overall. Overnight managers were the greatest, the hardest part was dealing with a certain coworker who thought that she was a supervisor and was far from being one, the company as a whole is not family oriented at all like they say they are. They need to be a little more understanding about when people call off due to illness or family emergencies"
good,I worked at Walmart store #1860 for 5 years and it was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever worked; I mostly worked retail. The management was in constant rotation including the store manager. Leadership lacked at the top level and it was hard to work with everyone not communicating effectively. The most enjoyable thing was the associates who helped create a friendly work environment and the nice customers who made it worth coming to work that day.
good,"Great company to work as a part of. However, there is an ongoing issue with workplace politics that need to be addressed immediately. Overall, pleasant environment and extremely enjoyable."
good,"Pese al buen ambiente, la paga es demasiado baja, no recomiendo"
good,Good place to work at on night shift in walmart coworker were great training was easy and wells explained have to work in a fast paced if need it just keep stor clean
good,Se daban platicas para conocer las ventas del día y los objetivos de los mismos
good,"*Contato com fornecedores , para agendar entrega de mercadorias,"
good,"Some days were better than others, there was always something new going on. Communication is key, without it work life at Walmart would have made impossible."
good,For the most part it was a good job. I had pretty good managers that I worked with. I was able to transfer my location when moving to California to take care of my in-laws.
good,"You get to meet new people and help them. You can transfer in different fields easily. If you like feeling like your appart of a team definitely check it out. "
good,It was a job to help develop yourself as a great associate and they give great advice on how to deal with customers who are not having a great day and what we do as associates to brighten their day.
good,It was a good company in the beginning but due to corporate changes the company isn't the same as when I started.  I am looking for a more employee orientated company.
good,Working at Walmart is awesome. Most of the staff treats you like family and everyone looks out for each other. You get to meet a lot of different people and learn about their different cultures.
good,The management did not really work with the employees. The customers were very nice and well mannered. Management just needed improvement. I would work there again.
good,"Walmart's training and supervisory team was poorly managed. In my opinion, they did the minimum requirements in order for state and government to stay away."
good,"Quick Paced, Collaborative, Team oriented. There is a lot of micromanagement within this environment. It is very competitive in terms of advancement.!"
good,Loved the hours i worked but the job is very demanding and sometimes impossible to reach productive goals and management is not understanding. I think it would not be a bad place if management was more knowledgeable and understanding.
good,"Sorry to burst your bubble if you want to work at Walmart, but, they do not pay you well enough and hard on you even if you are brand-new for the working force. The staff will talk about you behind your back and honestly, it is not worth it."
good,"I do not work there anymore.  Although, when I did go in I went straight to clock in and went straight to work.  The day went by very fast with breaks every few hours."
good,The company is a good place to work where you can gain great knowledge on the different jobs and processes of the departments throughout the facility.
good,"Working here, with it being my first paying job, was a great stepping stone on learning what other opportunities I had in the ""real world"" work force. I learned great personable skills and learned how to multiple tasks at once."
good,Walmart is a huge place to work for a lot of people and there's always something to do. I did enjoy working there and wish that I would have stayed longer.
good,"It was a fun place to work. As with any place of employment, some workers are more enjoyable to work with than others. Being able to complete a task on my own was the most enjoyable aspect of the job for me."
good,worked there during my pregnancy and i was constantly left alone in the department and i had a hard time getting help when i needed it and the only positive of working there was the regular customers that came in and specifically ask for me to assist them
good,A workday mainly consisted of working the register and maintaining the register area clean. The culture was very relaxed and not very inspiring. Management was sub-par.
good,"i build bikes, grills, furniture, and other stuff they need me to do."
good,Walmart is a good start up place to work with especially if you are in College because they are more flexible with your hours and are their to help you as much as possible.
good,"I didn't really njoy working here. Management was subpar, it was hard to find help from coworkers, and customers (like you get anywhere) seemed to feel entitled."
good,"Work enviroment was good. The hours was the worst part, cause you never had consistentcy. The pay was tollerable. Loved meeting all the new customers every day."
good,Was my first job and would of probably kept it if other life things didn't get in my way. I learned all the ways of keeping up the place and keeping the floor clean.
good,"typical work day was fast pace, but easy and sometimes fun. i was able to work lots of over time almost every single day, especially on black Fridayi was able to work 16 hours that day"
good,In the back warehouse area of the store was a little bit unorganized with pallets. I learned how to use their stock system to scan in and out inventory to and from the back.
good,"Poor management, easy, mindless job, hires anyone, full time, mediocre benefits, great $1/day college program, very doverse environment, not too bad overall for a starter job."
good,Walmart is Walmart however you look at it. This place is great if you have low expectations and low standards. Managment is a joke at times but sometimes you will find that one manager that really understands.
good,"As a worker at Walmart I enjoyed working there, I have always had nice customers approach me. My employees loved me and loved to work with me. I was a great asset to Walmart."
good,Hours are inconsistent and moving up is nearly impossible. Pays well enough for what it is. Nice if you just need a few extra dollars but could not live comfortably off of it.
good,"The company habitually asks too much of it's employees without paying them enough to compensate for the stress of the work. Most of the people working here tend to consider the job as temporary, regardless of how long they're there, and departments have a high turnover rate because of the lack of pay."
good,"Stocking and organizing merchandise."
good,Wasn’t a very hard job as long as you made sure and kept epistles clear stocked well and everything in order shouldn’t have a problem. If you’re a laid back type of person it’s ok
good,"I have been working at Walmart full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"as a maintenance worker you would start your day by checking the front bathroom and observing the rest of the store as you went to the back to clock in.Then check the back bathroom, this should give you an idea of where to start your day."
good,"Started in a Manager Position, Stressful to say the least, as years went by Decision to retire so, relocated in Reno NV and went from Management to hourly."
good,"Setting up for work, having our nightly meeting, Unfortunately overnight work is not for everyone. Learned Walmart Policies, how to co-ordinate with management on workplace strategies. Hardest part is keeping pace with the young co-workers, always satisfying on a job well done."
good,"Flexible hours and the company tries to make it fun to work there with food/events, but it doesn't make up for the lack of proper management or Paid Time Off."
good,"Walmart was paying me $9 an hour and I was working part-time, but I needed a full-time job to support my wife, and my three children. i was working for about 20 hours or less"
good,"too much office politics, too much bs, too much micro managing, often petty managers, talking out of both sides of their mouths.  "
good,"Empresa tem ótima estrutura, porém era mal gerida (período e unidade onde trabalhei). Não tinha tantos benefícios, porém havia possibilidade de crescimento."
good,"Management does almost nothing, but yells at you when you’re slightly behind schedule or forget to do something. They also make promises that they cannot keep."
good,great place just not a lot of hours had a cool boss my co worker are are but I need some better for my family it just wasn't enough hours for me that's it
good,Very stressful place to work when no one wants to help you and management has favorites. Keep piling work on top of people who already have other tasks to finish.
good,Walmarts management are very back and forth. They tell you the different ways they want you to go about the same thing and they put all there notes on the employees.
good,"Good opportunities at Wal-Mart, fair breaks, work is not too hard, co-workers are very  friendly, enjoyed my daily tasks. Flexible and willing to work with your schedule"
good,Was left by myself love customer service work in a deli and bakery the reason why I left is because management didn't know how to do the work that we did
good,"received, organized and stocked materials coming in from the trucks every morning. fast past environment, always had something to do. work place environment was positive and very hands on for each employee."
good,Great work environment! I learned alot about stocking and packaging and other products and services; management was great! Culture was ok! Job was ok as you were providing products and services for customers; I enjoyed bonding with my customers the most!
good,A typical day at work for me consisted of stocking the store all night. Occasionally help customers when asked. I enjoyed being able to listen to music while I worked.
good,A typical work day greeting customers taking returns solving problems the best way you can its very diverse and some of the managent are the best and also have some that’s not so great but over all it really is a great place to work
good,"i am not risking my boss seeing this and firing me over a bad review, so i will say this: be prepared. Be prepared to put up with alot of bullcrap, but be prepared to make new lifelong friends."
good,"It's fine job to have goods days and hours as well and low to moderate pay, can be stressful at some point but slow pace job too, they have amazing CO workers"
good,"Productive fun work place, depends on what shift and what store you work at, was located out of town up north, when I'm from the south, Too much SNOW,  and a lot of times hard to commute to work"
good,Enjoyed working with Walmart traveled alot hard to balance life and home life. Now they only hire part time employees.. They don't afford part time employees benefits and the pay isnt that good to work part time for what u have to do. Customers don't get the attention they need and no one says hi any more.
good,The work was over loaded on employees. The scheduling wasnt up to par and there was no room nor allowance for over-time. I have to the best and least busiest shift was 10pm to 7am. Pretty laid back crew.
good,If you were to be late by 1 minute you ill be written up.  you get a 10 min. break from he time you start walking to the break room all the way to the back of the store till the time you get back to your post.  in all you got a 6 min break.
good,I started to work at Walmart and then got the opportunity to go to college. I took that opportunity and spent 3 1/2 years working and going to school.
good,"Walmart taught me what I need to know to do the job. They were good at letting you know when things changed. However management was crazy. It seemed like it changed every week which made it difficult to know who to talk to about things you had questions about. The pay was good I started out at $9 an hour then after about 3 months I went to $10 an hour. After being there for a year their pay rate changed. I then was being payed $11 an hour. I would recommend it because the people their are nice and it pays well. However, if your not willing to work hard its not the place for you. The hardest job is the times you have a set time you have to get something done if you don't get it done by that time then you have just put everyone else behind. The easiest was being about to talk to my supervisors. Management is a different story sometimes it was easy others I had to wait a long time to be able to talk to them. Also they will some times change your schedule or mess it up. They are very excepting and will take anyone who needs a job. There is no discrimination."
good,A typical day at work can be slow or fast past depending on the day of the week. Working there I've learned different other skills. The management there is ok but can be improved. The hardest part of the job is standing for long period of times and dealing with unpleasant customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new job and meeting new people.
good,"i enjoyed working with all the other people i worked with. They revamped the dress code, so you don't have to spend the day uncomfortable in a stuffy polo shirt."
good,"It all depends on management and whose the leader in charge, unfortunately. The work environments is a warehouse, so don't get caught up in fancy names."
good,You dont get enough hours for part time work. In the beginning i was getting 20 + hours a week now only 9- 10 hours a week. The night CSM is very rude and nasty towards the evening workers when she comea on.
good,Alright company to work for but not for me.  Production driven and also on the point system.  No tardies tolerated no matter the circumstances.  Very Very Very high turn over rate
good,"Working in retail has many different aspects of the job, A cashier especially. You never know minute to minute what mood your next customer might be in. You could have a great customer and then have the worst. So staying positive is the best way to get through it"
good,"bajos sueldos, horarios completos de intermedios, exigente para el trabajo en si, pocos beneficios de la empresa, no respetan vacaciones solicitadas, jefes con pocos estudios."
good,"I always do my job to the letter to the best of my abilities and loved doing my job, interacting with my customers and coworkers alike and feeling accomplished whenever I completed my work, but there were many times where I could not trust the judgment of our csms and assistant managers. I have tried again and again to communicate with them both on the clock and off, both over walkie, phone calls, office meetings and regular chats, and was told that nothing was going to change. They expected work to be done faster than was actually applicable, their actions when on register was questionable which I would constantly help to correct, and whenever work would be done or completed, instead of any form of confirmation of the job well done, there was only criticism on how it was done, even when it was done correctly. I did my best with what I was given and can only hope that management there becomes better there for others."
good,"Consulted at Walmart on a Dotcom project to increase their content quality online. Worked with Merchants, Suppliers and CSPs to increase the quality scores and increase the number of items in the catalogs."
good,I Learned that Walmart can be a Family for love ones. They help others & Support. I love toes anyone working there for a future job. It more of a high school job.
good,"Je commençais toujours a 14:00, car j'étais associée de production du soir. Je finissais minimum a 23:00, la raison de mon départ est vraiment simple, le transport en commun ne se rendait pas du Walmart à chez nous aussi tard le soir le soir. Mais j’appréciais le travail quand même, déplacer des choses transporter des charges j'aimais vraiment sa être actif."
good,A typical day of work was starting at 2 PM and at that we unloaded the truck that was usually until 4-5 pm. Then after we would stock until 10 pm. The hardest part was the unloading of truck and the easiest was stocking.
good,It’s pretty outgoing job with benefits and flexible . They try to improve work abilities for people and try to help out the community and our willing to go above and beyond for their company.
good,there is little to no opurtunities of moving around. some employees can be biased but most are pretty nice. the management team isnt the best at times.
good,"I enjoyed Walmart for the most part, met a lot of great people, good company, generally cares about their employees, I will say it is a little hard to get noticed at first"
good,The workload is unreal but if with no customer service it can be completes; it contradicts the goal of the store to have stockers stop working the freight to go completely across the store to assist in shopping. The customer service is not the problem. Mgmt not understanding why certain tasks couldnt get completed is stressful. We are only human applying our best robotic skills possible in as fast a fashion as possible.
good,Walmart is a good place to start your work experience. It was a good experience to see how retailed store works. Also learn to interact with customer and help with them with the knowledge you have.
good,"Co workers,"
good,A typical day at Walmart would consists of me making sure everything was in order. all plant life is still appealing and intact. id water all of the plants and clean the pallet drive through. at 9 id unlock the doors and await customers checkout.
good,Walmart is a good temporary place to work but I feel they should give out more pay raises and have legit training available to new hires. I would recommend Walmart to a friend.
good,In my personal opinion i think Walmart is more of a Part-time type of work unless you are a high ranked manager  or good for high school/ college students.
good,"There is no normal day at Walmart. Good for a first time job. They cut hours for no reason a lot, and trying to get time off is extremely hard. Trying to navigate the backroom is like trying to play tetris and sometime you can not find the manager you need."
good,Would be doing the night shifts. So I helped prepare the store. Put up panels using a diagram to set up store before the grand opening.  once store opened I put out product.
good,Added many experiences to my work history and communication skills.  Constantly making sure customer's are happy when coming into the store and leaving happy as well.
good,"Working in the cap team, there are very consistent hours, though they would interfere with  lot of scheduled events elsewhere being 2-11 pm, and the days will change unless you tell management that you cannot work on specific days. You are able to chat and have fun with your coworkers if you work in the back and are able to work quickly and accurately while doing it. The physical nature of the job will help to improve health and strength. However, the summers can get hot and the truck unloading areas don't have much for air conditioning."
good,"I typically started my day by organizing stock from the morning trucks.  After that, tasks would be given to complete around the store. My manager was great, but some managers abused their position."
good,"There is good breaks and lunches no overtime though the pay is great if you get the hours, a lot of times especially now cause they  are losing too much money all associates hours are being cut and some are layed off from work"
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, cashiering, stocking and management. If you are seeking this type of work experience than I would recommend Walmart."
good,Walmart is a place where you can find the items that you need. It is also a good place to find items you need outdoors and too find grocery’s that are low priced
good,I enjoyed my job like people I work with and my customers. But I didn't like management how they treated their people. They way talk to them. By talking behind everyone backs.
good,I was a stocker at walmart a year work hard loading and unloading truck looks like it was never recognize I went out for a better position and didnt get it
good,There are pros and cons.  Every department is different.  Some have amazing leadership some not so much.  Some areas have great moral others don't.  Some leaders are exceptional and others aren't.
good,Management schedules are not very work / life balanced. Not a sufficient amount of associates available to get the work done in a correct manner. Company expectations are not reasonable with amount of labor hours allocated.
good,I was able to manage my own department and make sound decisions. Fast paced environment with customer service being the focus. Work place culture was fun with co workers.
good,Walmart is a decent company to work for. A typical workday can be fast paced and fly by. In the downtime you have time to replenish your stock and get ready for future customers. Sometimes you are so busy you barely have time to take breaks. Over all it is a nice place to gain training and skills at.
good,If you dont have a good manger u will hate working there but other than that it's an okay job to work. Work and mind your business. Pay is alright but what do u expect it's a big company
good,I took part in the building wide remodel. After our daily task list was met we then went and helped the floor workers with either stocking or cleaning.
good,"I did like waiting and helping customers ,guiding co-workers and working in different  departments and also keeping the area's clean and running smoothly."
good,Hard work cut end hours bad management bad work desicision and the night shift gets the stiff end of the deal things need to improve or people will continue to quit
good,"If it wasn't for that I would have probably liked working here long hours busted my butt as a Department manager for 4 departments with no staff. So it was like department manager in name only. "
good,"Learn to operate a register, customer service, and  did CSM work by setting lunch schedules, providing money when needed, direct customers to empty cashiers and made sure that everything was done on a timely manner."
good,It is a great place to work if you want low pay and very little chance to advance. I worked there for almost two years and only received a $.22 raise. starting pay is 11.00 an hr.
good,i started as a cashier and moved quickly to a Customer Service Manager. I also helped with a brand new store set up.  worked as a photo lab employee then went on to run my own lab.
good,"Laid back "
good,"Each day can be a trial or an adventure depending on how you look at it. My typical day is derived from lots of different objectives setup before we are assigned to our areas. I am a meat department associate. I also help in Bakery, Deli, and Produce on an as-needed basis. We are a 4-fold crew. I have a Department Management for my area. I also have my Support Manager who covers all 4 areas along with a secondary SM. They are under the ruling of a Co-Manager and a Support Co-Manager.  I generally have 3 pallets of meat that I have to downstack, scale, and/or directly place onto the sales floor. Anything that my handheld 'pings' as overstock, I stock into the steel. Throughout the day, I help customers, refill areas of the meat wall that are empty and keep my work area clean and safe."
good,Worked through high school  at walmart. Worked with my scheduling needs and paid decent for the job. Was promoted rather quickly. Work wasn't complicated but customers could be rude.
good,it was i good company. but the management was either to soft or to strict and the hours where just hard to get and if for some reason you got over forty hours the yelled at you an=d then wrote you up for trying to make more money
good,"Empresa boa, com ótimas pessoas para se trabalhar. Bom para um bom comeco e para o desenvolvimento proficional"
good,Working here was definitely a challenge at times. They are always busy so you have to learn to move at a quick pace. Overall it was a good learning experience.
good,I stopped working at Walmart because of some co workers there that created problems. But in all gear place to work. Management needs better hiring processes to get people who actually work and not slack off
good,"Stressful but the hours were flexible. Had to zone a lot on the shelves. the grocery discount was ok, got from 10% to 15% off price. employees were enjoyable to talk to and be around."
good,very chill environment to be in. The management was very nice and understanding since they knew I was a full time student in college. I would recommend this jog to anyone.
good,Great for a short time position job with wonderful friends and work environment. learned a lot about medications and how drugs work in the pharmacy. greart
good,The people you work with at the company on the same level as you tend to be decent folk with just the occasional slacker or jerk. The only issue I had with the company was in store favoritism as well as managers or supervisors who didnt really know much about how to properly lead the people under them or who tried to hard to impress those above them.
good,lots of work to do with little compensation. not the best managers in the world but it was tolerable. long shifts and late nights. not the best job in the world
good,Very hard working job. Work 4 days out the week and always have the weekends off. Sometimes it's pretty easy but other times it's full force. Great job overall.
good,the people are fantastic.  The pace needed to meet their 100% goals are brutal and break your body down.  Being moved due to short staff was unfair and very hard on your body due to extreme cold temps.
good,Work was good and hours were ok..never had a problem with managers. Easy work environment. The work place was easy and laid back. Managers were great.
good,"Hours were great in the beginning but after August 2018."
good,"It was a hard job, but it was very rewarding.  You unload a truck in under two hours and then separate the break packs.  Once that is done you will stock shelves until you need to pull freight to the floor for the third shift stockers."
good,"Clock in , find out what register your will be working at . find customers to check out when not busy. straighten up merchandise around you as needed."
good,Walmart is a large corporation that provides many different opportunities. Overall walmart has pros and cons. It is an established company that gives back to its community and helps others.
good,"I would have stayed here because I loved the job culture and talking to customers. But you could barely communicate with managers, and they wouldn’t work with my college schedule"
good,"I loved working for this company for many years.  Originally went to work there with the plan to one day retire from there.  I worked my way up to management and was thankful for the opportunity to work there and looked forward to going to work each day.  Over the last 2 years, the focus of the company has changed from giving the feeling of being a part of a family to one of only concerned with the numbers and no support of the associates."
good,I like working with the other associates and providing excellent customer service to each person.  The hardest part of the job was the long work hours.
good,Walmart is a good place to work its great hrs and they work with you on everything the managers are super friendly and there great at provide customer servise
good,people are very nice. the hardest part of the job is standing all through 7 hours shift. and some of the customers took advantage of their right when it comes to returning/exchanging their items without receipt.
good,"Even though it is stressful and senior management was a career disappointment, the company that exists today is not the company I started  with. The family centered store that was once a driving force fell off somewhere. However you are able to get out of the company what you are willing to put in and I raised 5 children while working there."
good,Everyone has been to Walmart at least once in their lifes.  You have to like customer service to work there and be able to handle any thing that comes your way.
good,"I handled several positions at Walmart. This included stocking merchandise, cashiering, and customer service. The daily changes made job exciting. Loved changing g the merchandise seasonally."
good,"Focus and speed is what is needed for this job. If you are ready to hit the ground running and maintain a quick pace while great customer service. This is the job for you. Treating you like one of their own, Walmart will make you stronger everyday."
good,"Walmart was a fairly decent job .  Working at Walmart , you’ll be surrounded wit some helpful & non helpful others . It’s a much Laid back chill place d"
good,"While in the bakery I decorated cakes and stocked the shelves full. My hours were flexible but manageable. The management above me would overlook employees lack of being on time, and use of drugs"
good,I really was disappointed to only get 37 hrs per week. realized Walmart did that to its entry level employees so they weren't entitled to benefits. no wonder employees want it unionized
good,"They say opportunities for advancement, but in our particular store, they hired from outside most of the time. And half those people didn't understand the roles they were placed into. Pay was decent, but unless you've worked with the company for many years, someone doing half the work of the entire store got paid the same as a door greeter. Most of the people at my store were good people, fun and caring. The crew I worked with seemed like the best of the store. Learned many things while working with them, from those who had time to share what they knew. Helping people is what it's about. Loved interacting with customers, hearing short stories, learning a little about them, having fun, while attempting to help them with their needs"
good,"Walmart definitely teaches alot I've worked in all departments and each one is different the only thing I can say is that reasoning with your scedual is a bit off, but great place for work experience."
good,"Walmart is the juggernaut of retail that everyone loves to hate, but in my experience, Walmart is a decent job for retail. The work is pretty easy, customers are nice (for the most part), and it's rare that you have to seriously exert yourself. The discount is nice also and it's pretty easy to get more hours if you show you're a hard worker. There's also a genuine opportunity for advancement if you enjoy retail. "
good,"It got tiring working until Midnight M-F even part time. Cashiering did not pay enough, I didn't want to work extra hard just for a little more cash. I felt like with hosting I was in dangerous situations just trying to protect our assests."
good,I rI normally catch shoplifters. Handle safety issues in the store along with making deterences in the store to limit the shrink. we handle grid boards and safety boards.
good,come in and get straight to work start with a team meeting then go right into restocking. a lot of work with not much pay i feel they could improve their employment by employing more people and allowing people to work together as a team
good,"Definitely was an amazing experience , enjoyed the other co workers and challenges that came my way, was well worth it and I learned a lot from working their"
good,"Walmart was fast paced place to work in. If you like staying busy, it's the job for you. People in management seemed to be nice. A typical day at work was busy"
good,A typical day. I learn. Management. Work place . management. culture. good but hard . and enjoyable. management. I did not feel comfortable answering it.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. It was quick for about half the shift then a bit slower. Long breaks and discounts on stuff. Managment was good. Coworkers were ok too.
good,"i really love working , but once you are put to work with people, who are not good at their job and don't care to work as hard just because they have been there longer or cause they have a higher title, it is extremely frustrating especially when you are doing and going above and beyond cause that is your job to do so,"
good,Taught me how to be a hard worker and how to deal with all types of different customers. Great place to build your skills and learn how to function in a workplace.
good,"Walmart like many companies is having some growing pains and adaptability issues. They were once a great place to work that really cared for and took care of its employees. Fast forward to the last 10 years and it it is a different company than it was. By eliminating positions, combing positions, hiring outside companies to audit things like the unloading process that have no clue about them just prove to people who have been there 15 or more years that they really have no clue how to adapt and want to make the most unrealistic and asinine changes to try to connect with it's customer base, all the while alienating it's employees who are easily 15 to 25 % of that customer base"
good,"It’s a job at Walmart so it's not going to be something super awesome and grand, but it’s not bad. I wouldn’t work there for too long though, you can move up easily but it’s not always worth it."
good,"Very fast past. Lots of interaction with clients,and very multi cultured. I've learned how to not take things personal.  A typical day at work was filled with not knowing what the day was going to bring. Management was very supportive in all areas of the job."
good,The lack of communication creates problems resulting in associates being on the wrong page and receiving disciplinary actions because of it. The company is somewhat flexible allowing you to be self managed.
good,I didn't care for management when needed help they wouldn't help and If you had a question they get attitude no communication or no meeting  cut a lot hours
good,Work is fast paced. Always something to do. Learning a great deal about customer service. Trying to always be ahead of the curve. Co-workers become more like family members or very good friends.
good,"A typical day involves a large amount of walking and pushing at a somewhat steady pace and also helping customers load large purchases into there vehicles. The troubling part of the job is frequent under scheduling as well as the lack of proper equipment and assistance outside when in need of help."
good,Most co workers are nice but some management can be uptight and demanding even if they're not your management multi tasking is a must because they will have you doing a million things at once
good,"Overall I liked the work experience,The pay could be better.But the my share wasn't bad at all, we would get it every four months, depend of the profits,customer's experience,etc."
good,Very good job for students. Flexible work hours and understanding managers. Also provides opportunities for advancing your career with the company. Good place to learn excellent customer service.
good,The pay is no where near commensurable with work. Managers were stressed out also because of the laziness o other workers. Stressul environment to get work finished when other employees disappear on their shift or are hiding and texting.
good,people didnt even care about your ell being because they no so many people are eager to get in the door very drama filled im proud i know longer work there
good,"enjoyed the team work, "
good,"I was a sales associate and cashier. It was what you would expect. The pay is entry level and they only promote based on seniority, not ability. The benefits are good though."
good,Many times I had too much to do during a day and the managers would constantly get on to you for not being fast enough even though few people would do that job faster
good,La empresa es buena solo que el sueldo es poco y las prestaciones son pocas tambien
good,promotion is unlikely hours suck insurance is half the pay check if you want it and raises of 15 cent just don't cut it and you always get drug around to other departments too work
good,Working with community and enjoying customers conversation while i was working stocking shelves after unloading and downstacking pallets of freight. Getting to know many different areas of store and meeting new people
good,"Wal-Mart"
good,Easy work. The back room is the best picking and binning is boring but off loading the trucks is alright. Sales is boring and customers are a holes and that’s it
good,It was an ok place to work. Breaks was sometimes late tho. The break room was nice. Sometimes had surprised food for the employees like pizza or other stuff.
good,Only issue I had was management and hours being cut. I had been hired as part but hours were cut in half. There were also lazy managers that would make others look bad to make themselves look better.
good,Walmart is a good place to start to learn to work. They don't have a stable schedule it always rotate. It does feel good to help others. And it is good to have discounts at a store you like to shop at. Only thing is there's no over time and pay raise not so good and pays not so great.
good,It’s s place you can definitely grow if you put the effort and want to learn new things you will be able to better assist in all areas can be stressful but it’s worth it
good,"Customers at Walmart were a joy for the most part, of course you had those that were not but, patience is a virtue.  Management plays a lot of unnecessary games with their employees, for such a low pay rate, like forgetting to pay you for days you worked."
good,"Some days it can be a little stressful when it was a lot of freight that had to be stocked and I was the only worker on maybe the grocery side and didn't have any help but then I learned how to just do what I can and as much as I can to get my job done,management wasn't fair at times hardest part about the job is when the managers will have you to do some one else work that you wasn't trained to do but other then that I liked working there the job could be fun when every one worked together or either helped each other when it was enough workers."
good,It was an okay job to work there. If I had to go back I would but I would know what to expect from management. They showed favoritism towards certain employees. The didn't give credit when it was due. The people they select to be CSM's are horrible and they fell they are above the rest of the cashiers.
good,the most enjoyable day at work is being fast and efficient making sure the customer doesn't have to wait too long to be checked out or seeing a customer with a smile on their face my job was to scan their items as well as bag
good,Stocking shelves facing items. How to use a power jack. how to do some paper work.  Working overnight was hard on my body. Getting a pay check.  Working with others.
good,"Having worked at the DC for too long, I would have to say their corporate ideology is flawed beyond belief. While I can't deny they provided me the livable wages to raise a child, buy a house, graduate from college and live a decent life; their treatment of staff needs work. "
good,"Management at Walmart is simply unqualified. No one really knows what they are doing, yet every manager has crazy expectations. The management is also inflexible and not very understanding to life circumstances. For instance I was enrolled at Rutgers University and they scheduled me during the same time. I would tell repeatedly that I could not make those hours but they just ignored me and penalized me for coming in late."
good,we unloaded the truck and put everything in there zone. and when we are do with the truck we would take the carts and pallets to the floor and stock the shelves
good,it has been a while since i worked there but communication was better than in most places.  it was very fast paced but was easier to work with teams.  only the shirt of the uniform was provided and the rest of it you had to provide yourself
good,Walmart is a nice job and I would recommend for people to work there. It would be great for a first job. Friendly management though sometimes it does get unorganized. It’s a friendly environment
good,I did not work there long enough to get a good feel and understanding of the company. it was right and wrong sometimes and due to How I looked I was definitely singled out.
good,"Empresa que te permite crecer, un ambiente de trabajo calido, donde te permite desarrollo amistoso entre asociados y clientes."
good,"The job is easy but the only part I don't like is having to work in the cold all night. My co-workers are pretty cool. Working on overnights its laid back not to busy (not having alot of customers throughout the store), so manage to get things done on time without it being crowded."
good,"it's an alright place to work.  Being just out of the military, the hours are good.  The only thing i don't like is that it is all about who you know.  If you have connections to a higher up, you'll have a very easy time working for this company."
good,"This job provided me 40 hours a week benefits, the whole package. I enjoyed my job there and earned alot of praise through my time and was considered for management. One problem was management was hard to get a hold of. Eventually I decided it was time for a change in scenery."
good,"I really feel like you are underpaid at Walmart, took me almost 7 years to get to where I am at, the raises are only like 25 to 30 cents a year, my schedule is pretty good, have 2 days off in a row, work 40 hours, but if you aren't a manager they cut hours a lot, but overall it was not a terrible place to work, just cant see myself spending the rest of my life there!"
good,"My typical day was to run reports, check on my employees, stock the front in of the store. Clean and clear all the cash registers. manage breaks for my employees. help customers check out and with returns."
good,"I stayed very busy, kept working fast paced. I liked it for the most part, I love working with the forklift. just want to make enough money. I worked 40 hours a week if not more and my paychecks didn't pay off enough to keep a rough over my head for my kids and wife."
good,This is a good job to start out with. Some days are hard and stressful but it is something different everyday. It is a great job if you love changes and are constantly working at a fast pace.
good,Well the discount was great... I didn't stay long due to another career that paid more. But I meet some good people. Customers is never right. They lie and steal but you do have some that are honesty about what they purchase.
good,Place wasnt the best. Management was kind of terrible but the overall experience you get from working there is something you wont forget. From the customers to the friends you make on the job itself
good,I work in Walmart for several years I have relocated too different stores training there cashiers on job performance I worked every department inside of Walmart
good,"I was happy for a time.  But walmart does not value long term employees.  After 13 years I needed to relocate asap,  walmart was unwilling to find me a position. Worked very hard for many many years. According to walmart ur life must revolve around them. Through my many years i did meet lots of great people and have made lasting friendships.  I was able to learn new things and expand my skills. Management can be helpful if u talk to the right manager."
good,estibar  cajas   la parte mas dificil  los cordinadores
good,The place over all isn’t that bad. Once you get how everything works. Write ups are an everyday occurrence. But if you just keep your nose clean and perform then you will have no issues.
good,To become management you have to know someone in management.  They already know who they want to promote before the choice is made.  You are overworked with no praise or thank you.
good,"Good opportunities to learn different aspects of the retail field"
good,working for this company was to pay my bills. i was threaten to be fired several times went i went to management complaining about another worker instead of looking into the situation the threaten to fire me then 6 months after i was treated poorlyi talked to hr about it a sexual harassment case and then they finally transferred me to another store so i did feel like things could have been better when i transferred though i loved the new store i was at they were respectful and showed concern to anyone who worked there
good,was a great job but the management was so compartmentalized that staff had trouble with extrapolating the information handed down at times and the manager I was working for was a bit insensitive
good,"Walmart is an average company to work for. Very aggressive management and limited growing opps. However, a big name to start the career. Work here with an exit in mind."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The staff where wonderful and very helpful when needed. I perform my duties such as riging out people items. Helping assist customers with items they cant find or locate in the store. The hours where very flexiable and they gave out decent hours each week. I left walmart to futher my education but i really enjoyed being employed there.
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work. Some of the management is cool. You get an hour lunch, 15 minute breaks. The only things that suck are getting called to register and push carts"
good,"Overall a Great place to work. Some opportunities with the Management Teams, but nothing that could not be overcome or worked on or with. I really enjoyed my time with this Company."
good,Many employees at this store had been working together for many years.  They were very welcoming to new employees and everyone was always ready and willing to help out a specific area other than there own if needed.
good,It wasn't a bad place fellow employees were pretty awesome but the management wasn't really flexible with helping you with scheduling if you are a parent.
good,Job was eliminated but Im ready to move away from retail.16 yrs of employment but rarely recognized for good job management inconsistent with employee productivity.
good,"They don’t appreciate your work and effort you make for the company , some of the manager are parcial just with some people end if they don’t like you no matter how good you do your job they just let you go"
good,"As a retailer, Wal-Mart ran their business as one. Management cared about their employees and was willing to help anyone that was willing to promote within the company. I managed to get prompted a few times due to hard work and the help of managers giving recognition to those who made the effort to promote. The experience was fresh and fun while being my first job. Although sometimes hours weren't as flexible as I would've like them to be, I still managed to make great progress within the company."
good,"Pay was not worth it, expected to handle other departments that they don't train in, hours were never consistent and pay was bare minimum with little raises."
good,"Relaxed work environment,  tremendous opportunity for advancement. Great benefits,  competitive payscale. Nice work schedule,  great pay, weekly payscale."
good,"Every store is different. But if you have qualifications that can help set you aside from the rest of the general employees, you'll have a better chance of succeeding. For instance, because I went to an all-technology based high school was was attending my community college, I received a much higher starting wage than several of my other associates."
good,"This is a good job for teenagers just out of highschool. As well as people looking for  a job or career in managment. however, the pay is minimum wage and there is no growth for career advancement."
good,Staying busy is a plus. I enjoyed the stability.  The hardest part was going above and beyond and no appreciation was given.  Some people was held accountable but others not. Just confusing.
good,The people there were kind but several of people complain about the job. Maybe it could’ve just been that day in particular being stressful but it is overall a decent and fun job with nice and caring people in it.
good,"I will never work at Walmart again. It is a very depressing place to work and the management could care less about the employees."
good,"Was my first job and it was seasonal. While I was there, they did team meetings to cover things which was really cool to be a part of. My other jobs didn't really do that and I've been disappointed ever since. Work meetings to communicate to team, especially when you don't see those employees otherwise."
good,there was always stuff to do and if you know how to do more than just your area whether it be working the register or unloading the trucks then your always being moved around and never in one spot.
good,It be alright if they would not cut hours they hour new people instead of the ones that been there  more time and they won't let you transfer department
good,"Working for Walmart can be hectic.It's a fast pace, place of business. I learned how to walk away. The culture was not a problem for me, I actually learned a few things. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. The most difficult part was the management. I was complimented often on my management skills."
good,the work at walmart was somewhat stressful but it was ok and balanced because of all the different personalities around. The management was great and understanding.
good,"I was a cart pusher, i could relax at times but at times it was a living heck. Even had a super visor try to go after me. Some decent people and some not so decent people."
good,Good experience not a bad place to gain knowledge. I held many positions and had multiple bosses and coworkers. everyone experiences are different I do enjoy my vacations
good,Very good job for hard workers. Don’t apply for this job if you aren’t willing to work hard for long periods of time. Very safe working conditions that allow you to be your best self.
good,Enjoyed working with the people and the customers. I had a good store manager. I didn't like all the extra hours we worked with being salaried. I was in operations and it was not uncommon to put some miles in a store.
good,"cashier work was great work it thought me a-lot in the retells "
good,"My work with Walmart was mostly physical labor with customer service induced. I changed jobs due to career advancement with another employer. Most of my peers at the store in Junction City KS, were kind and pleasant to work with I just wanted a pay increase and wasn't granted even with my college education."
good,"Walmart is not a terrible company to work for, but offers limited opportunity for advancement and personal development. Stores are frequently understaffed and management is rarely engaged or well-trained in the execution of their responsibilities."
good,Walmart has become a place of employment that I wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy. You have to constantly worry about losing your job or or being outsourced. While the pressure remains for you to work your butt off with little to no training. I loved working there up until 2017.
good,"I worked at Walmart for only 3 months, on Friday-Sunday only due to school. Not long enough to really review much. Was in the electronics department and learned a bit. Overall it's an entry level job for students who could use a little extra cash and join the workforce."
good,I enjoyed working overnight in the maintenance department where once we got our assignments for the night we were basically left to it to get it done without micromanagement from the supervisors
good,"i learned how to stock scan things that we have to put on inventory or the stuff that have to go on the sales floor"
good,"Starting pay is not bad if you are young or just starting out.  Coworkers are good, most customers are great.  Management varies.  Most management are not on the same page, therefore, you get mixed instructions.  Benefits will be excellent if or when you make full time."
good,Working at Walmart is like working at most retail stores. It can be busy or slow depending on the time and day. On your feet during the shift keeping things going in a orderly manner.
good,"retail is a steady job , but its not for everyone"
good,"applied for job change, but they found every reason for me not to change. After I quit they did not want me to change cause I done good job taking care of 1/2 of the store when short. Should have told me before I quit to keep me instead of keeping me in the dark"
good,"Working hear was a great experience to get knowledge as a cashier "
good,I haven't worked for Wal Mart in over 15 years. Not really sure about their work environment any longer but it was always busy. Never enough hours to accomplish the many tasks assigned to you daily.
good,Its a company that you can learn a lot if you propose but lack of other things that affect the employee. Works a lot of hours and only give you two breaks (15 min. and 20 min.) with not lunch. It really depends on what you're looking for and what you like to work with.
good,Typical day at Walmart was assisting and checking out about 50 customers or more a day . Working there taught me patience and punctuality. theres isn't much i can say about management. they did their job well and helped the best way they could when i needed them.
good,"Overall place was atrocious. Management was awful, typical day at work involved working and getting complained at the entire time. Hardest part was working without snapping on other employees"
good,"The job itself is a good job but the people you work around are usually rude and self centered people, and they do not listen to you opinions when they ask you for them."
good,"I worked at walmart almost a decade ago when I was in college because they allow you to change stores and I hopped around schools. I did pretty much everything in the store from cashiering to mixing paint, but the place I was the most familiar with was jewelry counter. I pierced ears, ordered custom jewelry, created displays, and I really loved it. It was the perfect job for me because I have chronic pain."
good,"Each walmart is different. On my personal level the management is not very nice, cant communicate very well, go through other employees to get to you. Flexibility was not very there. Management jumps to conclusion and doesn't approach serious and non serious situations appropraite."
good,Could be very stressful at times and very fast pace especially around the holidays. Worked a lot of weekend and holidays long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work in different areas of the store which allowed learning more areas of the store.
good,My daily routine make sure all my area's were covered and all merchandise was in my backroom ready to go on display for store. Make sure all trucks got dispatched and heading our way so we can unload.
good,"My only complaint is management. I know management varies from location, but where I was, it was poor. No communication at all. Also, a lot of favoritism. People get away with too much, and was difficult for me to move up to a management position because of favoritism, but overall, decent place to work. Workers are fun to be around, decent benefits, 401K, etc."
good,Working at walmart is good for your typical part time work if your looking for something while you go to school or for some extra cash. The work environment is not exceptional but they manage it well enough that it is functioning. You will learn to work as a team and to get along with others in your department. You have the opportunity of meeting a lot of people where walmart employs so many people. This is a good starter job that will teach you some basics about employement before heading to your next venture.
good,i would clock in at 4 am. by 4:10 we would start moving freight from the back to front while sometimes being assigned the dairy department as well as frozen.
good,Typical GBS company.  Almost no job security and major changes daily.  Senior leadership is clueless as to how to effectively motivate and promote the correct people.
good,A typical night at Walmart was stocking the shelves with new merchandise as they  arrived nightly. I also broke down boxes and emptied trash.  I enjoyed working with many of the youngsters.
good,Walmart was my first job I ever had and I would recommend working there to anyone. It was not the job for me and there didn't seem to be much room for advancement.
good,Poor communication between management team members made smooth workflow difficult.  Penalization when customer service took time away from other job duties..  Overall negative experience.
good,"boring, rude customers, lowzy managers, horrible pay. No benefits. Good for students. Not for a full blown career. Do not waste time trying to advance"
good,a typical day at walmart consist of walking the store looking for shoplifters. The culture was very friendly. Management was willing to help. the hardest part of the job was trying to apprehend shoplifters.
good,Good work life/ balance for a student in college. The hours I was given worked well for allow me to continue my studies in my chosen field of and career.
good,Working as a cashier was easy just didn't want to miss all the holidays with my kids. I didn't like taking all those test in the beginning but other than that it was a breeze. just wasn't for me tho.
good,Uma empresa que foi ossível ter uma experiência diferente no meu currículo.
good,A job in which one has to have good customer service skill because of the daily interaction with customers on a daily basis.  If one is bilingual it's helps the company and the customers as well depending on the location (demographics) of the store.
good,When I first started at Wal-Mart we got great benefits now we have to earn our vacations. I loved working at Wal-Mart now to me it's just a job not a career. I am a people person I love people. I really enjoy helping people. I have worked with people for 37 years and enjoy talking to them and helping them find what they need.
good,It was good to work there . But the managers was nice but didn’t really care to much about me getting home. So I had to walk home sometimes at night after 12 o’clock . I didn’t make it home until almost 1/2 o’clock am.
good,The job was ok and did help strengthen my customer service skills. There is room for advancement. Everyone is given the same equal opportunity to advance.
good,"My experience working at Walmart was a eye opening one. I had never worked in retail before. Starting with one of the biggest retail stores was interesting to say the least. It was a great experience, a lot to learn at a fast pace, but got easier with every day."
good,"I felt stressed coming into work, especially around the holidays. Not a stable management provider in the electronic section when I was working there."
good,not the best place to work at mainly because of the lack of flexibility with a stable schedule. employees and their schedules are moved around throughout the week making it a rather hectic schedule to follow.
good,"Wal-Mart is a stressful job to work at! Its fast-paced! The managers were terrible though, the schedule were never made correctly and they used to take some of our workers to send to another part of the store leaving us short."
good,"Very fast paced. We started by putting everything out. Changing the salads, checking for expiration dates on meat and cheese. Then getting all the fried food cooked and done by 10 am and rotisserie chickens."
good,"change tires. oil change,stock tires and oil.take orders as required by customers. report all tires sales to manager.make keys.clean bay, and outside."
good,The night shift worked very well together. Some nights managements  expectations weren't achievable. I enjoyed the customer contact. The hardest part was getting all the freight done and store looking good when we were short of employees.
good,It's ok and it's better than nothing the pay is better than minimum wages are but management can be improved it was in their interest to do your job and go home type of job!
good,Corporate office is fast pace place to work.  Management could work on people skills but the benefits and pay is very good.  Corporation just need to learn to treat employees better
good,"It was ok to work at. Depends on the store and department you are in. I only quit because i got hurt, due to inappropriate cleaning supplies for the oil batch."
good,Depending on what you are going to be doing something simple like cashiering the work can be extremely mundane and mind numbing. If you are lucky enough to have managers that will let you present ideas on how you should set up a feature or something similar then it can be a little more stimulating.
good,assistant managers would assign assessments after assessments even if you werent finish with what you were working and Schedules were out of order with no management at all
good,mucho compañerismo y apoyo por parte de los lideres de equipo
good,"I liked working at Walmart for a while. Then my hours kept getting cut. Trying to raise a family on 10 hours a week, is impossible. So I started looking for a full-time job, elsewhere."
good,"I work in the pharmacy which is pretty laid back. I love the people I work with and management is helpful. Can be a stressful environment but all workers there are hands on and willing to help. There aren't a lot of benefits to my job because I am part time but I have paid time off, sick leave, 401k, and stock options. Full time employees receive that and insurance.  "
good,The job wasnt bad but some of the people that where there made the job difficult. I met my best friend there but i wasnt a fan of the management at the time.
good,"Flexible scheduling when need be.  Fast paced.  Many managers to answer to, which isn't always a good thing.  Lots of turn over. Many coworkers to work with."
good,I furthered learned how to excel my customer service experience. I also learned how to work in a fast-paced environment. I also handled money efficiently.
good,A typical day was greeting customers and checking their carts for items that they may have not paid for.  It was hard to stand in one place for the full shift.  Moved scooters around for customers.  Answered customer questions.
good,To me this job falls under the category of one that good for those who need something steady for a while. This job was stressful when it came to dealing with people on a daily basis but it had its rewards.
good,Everyday was a new day. It was hard work and always on your toes. Never knew what you were going to do that day and was always had to be done at a certain time limit. The management was ok. The workplace was great with great employees to work with and would help out whenever others would ask for it. The hardest part was having to make sure things got done at a certain times when we were running behind. The best part was the employee's and the great atmosphere that was brought to the table to make the work day go smooth.
good,Personnellement tout étais bien mais le respect entre coéquipier n'était pas présent. Un gros déficit par rapport aux heures de travail.
good,Do not do anything more than work here at Walmart. We have time to do the job and establish career advancement. Not a financial goal withing this company for me. I hard to leap into management even after graduating with a diploma from high school and college. Same treatment every day for the rude customer who don't come around.
good,it was a good experience working with my crew members although i found at times that there were numerous barriers when it came to communicating concerns.
good,"A typical work day consists of cleaning around your work station, greet customers, stocking shelves, and standing all day. The hardest part of the day is the rust of customers at once."
good,It was a good job to have starting out. all equipment is up to date and co workers were very friendly it was like being apart of a family management was very dis-concerned with employees. But still a good place
good,Walmart is a great place to work. They care about their employees and often gave us raises and gift cards. They provide a relaxing break room with everything that you need. The best thing about it is all The Smiling Faces. The customer service is number one.
good,"most managers and customers are okay or tolerable, but this job is tough when you're treated poorly on both sides of the fence"
good,"Customer Service is a 100% effective rating at Walmart, it taught me to handle every situation with a smile. Not all customers will be happy but I explained to best of my ability to customer of the decision, if they were not satisfied with my decision I did offer the fact of speaking with my supervisor who can over rule my decision and I would be disappointed ."
good,"i worked for walmart during a remodel, it was a good balance of hard work and good times with some good people. I didnt work there long but it seemed like a good company to work for."
good,"I think is god company to start with there is some chance to get higher position. As long as you are coming in time and doing your job you are fine. When ever start not to come in time delay and many calls, you be fired."
good,"Walmart is a great and beneficial company ti work for, it helped build my experience in any work environment. Which I know now is what have equipped me to step out into a new arena well prepared."
good,"Wal-Mart was the highest paying job I had. It's a good jon to apply for if you like moving at your own pace. You get three breaks during your shift only if it's a 6-8 hour shift. You have a chance of getting a bonus and promotion within 3-6 months of getting hired. I started off as a cashier within 3 months of working I received a bonus and a chance to apply for a different position. Due to me completing and graduating my pathways and (CBL'S) Computer Based Learning. A few months later I learn that was recommended for a promotion from one of my supervisors as a cashier. So I got promoted and another bonus withing a couple of weeks of being recommended. There is plenty of opportunity to grow and learn more at Wal-Mart. The hard part about working there is being expected to know where to find everything in the store. Management differs on which Wal-Mart you work at. I learned new recipes from customers, hot to work retail, and the opportunities I have with walmart. Having a job"
good,"Walmart is a clean store with helpful employees, however Walmart has to learn to take of employees in the same manner they want employees to take care of the store. Walmart is not loyal to employees who go above and beyond."
good,"Although I won't complain about working here as I was in desperate need of employment at the time, it was a very average workplace. The work was fast-paced and stressful, and my co-workers were not very friendly in general. I felt extremely isolated there, although I would not necessarily use my own experience summary to deter people from working here."
good,walmart is a great place to work at as a starting job. it has good hours and flexibility but the advancement rate is very selective in who they choose. it doesnt go by senority or work ethic but by whoever they want to advance
good,Walmart can be stressful but overall the benefits are good and pay. They require you to learn every department which benefits you. If you are seeking promotion
good,I loved working at Walmart. All of the different customers is what made the job so great. I would meet some of the weirdest looking people while working the night shift. I loved helping the customers find what they were shopping for.
good,i enjoy working for them but I really want to get back in the field on which i went to school for. The Hazel Green store is a good store and management is great.
good,I don’t really remember much of working at the Walmart because it was a really long time ago the job wasn’t too hard and people were ok. I guess I can’t complain because like I said it was a long time ago
good,"Good place to start working. The hours are flexible and you have options on deciding where to go in the future in regards to working in different departments. Moving up, career wise, however, is very dificult."
good,"it was good for a first job, i made friends with co-workers and management alike. My only complaint is that the people i had to clean up after made me second guess working in the position i had"
good,"Walmart is a good first company to work for.  While they do hire from within, sometimes advancement is difficult to obtain.  The other difficulty is the hours spent.  During holiday season, Walmart is all hands on deck."
good,"managers change a lot at Walmart. A good manager makes the Job pretty nice. There is a lot of customer service, and communication skills required. When you have a good manager it can be a great workplace culture the wrong Manager makes it miserable though."
good,Fast paced. Downside is to many managers not enough people on the floor working. But it is hard to get fired just do your job at your own pace I worked too hard. Got burnt out.
good,"Im a sales hardware associate. responsibilities are to run the paint machine,take care of merchandise,work freight, and service customers. Its not a bad place to work."
good,Working at Walmart is kind good due to the safe environment  they give vacations paid sick paid discounts and good pay great teamwork Medicaid and 401 k
good,I have worked for Walmart for 15 years. I have also earned two degrees while working at Walmart. I feel that it is time for me to begin something new and supportive of my field.
good,"Empleo operativo, administrar un autoservicio"
good,"Processed payments, money transfers and cashed checks"
good,"Walmart is fast paced but there are some laid back days, I don't think you get paid fairly enough for the experience that you have. The reason being is because I myself only get $11 an hour, while somebody off the street that has just started also receives $11 an hour."
good,Walmart is very stressful and busy and the help can be limited. Customers are a little hasty and rush you and ask for ridiculous tasks and the managers have a very very strict attendance policy which made it hard for someone like myself who has a chronic illness
good,One manager in particular made it very difficult to get through a shift. Managers only worked 4 12's so depending on your schedule you might work with 2-3 different management teams every week and the inconsistencies made doing my job difficult.
good,I actually liked working at walmart! But the management at the time was poor and treated the lower level employees not so good! The coworkers were great tho!
good,"Never worked for walmart, just hauled frozen and produce to stores in New England. Wasn't impressed with the management and certain dispatchers. The biggest issue was I was being taxed by both NY and CT."
good,very busy and fast paced in the day and night the morning is slow random schedule sometimes I would leave at 10 and come in at 7 and they had us work in all departments of the store
good,I liked the job ok but the fact the supervisors don't really listen to the needs of their team members is disturbing. I needed to be in a different area of the store for stocking.
good,"Typical warehouse environment. The people are friendly, the management is nice. production and safety are the the highest priority next to accuracy. if you can work fast accurate and safe then your good."
good,stocking the juice and drinks and maintaing a neat and clean work area. practicing safety at all times and keeping a friendly demener toward customers.
good,"I would recommend to someone to work, its obviously not a career and the environment did not seem the greatest. But I made some great friends and the hours were not to bad! It was a job a needed in a emergency and it did its job. I knew managers whom loved it there and some whom were extremely stressed."
good,The place is good to work for.i mean you have some day that will bad but what job does not stress you out. But for the most part they should pay more .
good,Aprendí muchas cosas en esta empresa que me ayudaron a fortalecer mis aptitudes y mi camino laboral y profesional
good,I did this job for the summer. My job was to unload the truck and stock the freight on the floor. Once that was done the whole store was zoned and faced.
good,it was a good place to work at everyone work together. coworkers were friendly got along as family. i had enjoyed my time there with the company. I had some good reasonable hours.
good,Walmart D.C is a very active and physical job. It is a great job for alot of people straight out of high school. You basically lift between 10-70 lbs.
good,This specific store doesn't have consistency in their management. They play favorites and it takes over three weeks to put in for availability changes.
good,"Depending on your area of work, you are usually very busy. It's a non-stop work environment, but you have a break every 2 hours and an hour lunch in my store; it goes by fast."
good,"It was a good job overall. This was the first place I worked away from home and lived on my own. I was a cashier, I checked out customers, put away returns, and zoned grocery aisles."
good,"people got along with each other, everything was fair, easy going got the hours you wanted they were flexible with schools, got discounts and understandable if you needed time off"
good,"while working at walmart during the holiday season was very challenging; however, i was able to make the best of it and assist customers with locating the special items they were in search of and the co-workers were nice and friendly."
good,"I enjoyed my time there it was also a great experience. There was some management issue a lot of workers had issues with,but they worked them out in a timely manner!!!"
good,Its decent pay for the work but the hours are terrible you work all different shifts and never get any time off on weekends you can only take your time of during the week.
good,it was a good place to work every one was friendly bit after working there a year they wasn't making me full time employment status and cut my hours down to weekends because I was going to college
good,i learn how to use the cards upload an take off wic stack bags talk to ppl it showed me how to handle some things it also learn me how to b respondalbe to ppl
good,"For a first job for someone just starting out, you do gain valuable customer service skills and hopefully an unparalleled level of patience to deal with some of the corporate BS."
good,"I would recommend Walmart as a employment opportunity for others,  just not sure it's the right fit for myself at this point of my life. Looking for more consistency and stability in a workplace."
good,Workers are determined about there work. Management is ok. They have trouble promoting there workers or showing who doing a good job. Managers take all the credit
good,"Ability to assist in different areas of the store was a great change of pace. Hardest part of the job was working weekends. For the most part, it was a good experience. They really need to adhere to the  10 foot rule."
good,"You start out in electronics, you end up in photo, crafts, online pickup,  how to multitask,  i have cut and sell materials, electronics , cashier, stocking , all of this is done on a fast paste."
good,It was an average place to work..they didnt like to give raises and they refused to allow overtime.. you would sit at work from the start of your shift until you could clock in because they wouldnt allow ot
good,"In Walmart I would just go in for the warehouse and I would get the assignments done they would give us, also it involved lots of team work and carrying loads."
good,Backroom inventory is very fast and difficult to meet demand unless you are in peak physical condition. Coworkers have a range from supportive to toxic.
good,poor work culture. Management was not very friendly. No open door policy from the manager. Terrible attitude from asst managers. not at all acceptable for my taste.
good,"Walmart was an safe up paced work place, sometime fun to work I learned with working for Walmart how to use pallet jacks, how to wrap, how to change price tags, the hardest part about working at Walmart for me at times was the can isle, Stocking can food products"
good,"The job itself was easy. My day usually consisted of answering and directing phone calls. Answering customer questions and directing customers to different departments."
good,Many opportunities to move within the company. Wages are fairly competitive. Full time is a guaranteed 32 hours. Good place to work if you want to move into management.
good,Theres alot of room for moving up. you get a chances to make friends and meet new people. you learn how the store runs daily. You can learn new things everyday.
good,Walmart is a special place for anyone customer or employee I had acool team of people to work with to keep me motivated to keep going in life and at work
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart. Don't agree with the point system but I loved my job. They would try to work with You when You needed help. I'd go back in heartbeat
good,A typical day at work was I would stock school and office supplies. I would check customers out up front. I learned that it's important to be communicative. I wasn't impressed with management there. The workplace culture was fast paced. The hardest part of the job was getting along with others. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch time.
good,Walmart is a good place to work as a starter job but not much longer.The managers are good to you as long as you do your job to the fullest extent overall  Walmart is good to work for.
good,overall Walmart is a good starting job to work out it has its ups and downs but its a pretty good environment mangers were there when needed but it just wasn't for me .
good,Wal-Mart is your average job just go to work and do your job and leave. I loved my job just had to leave due to it being the weekend shift. Id go back if I could get on the week day shift.
good,"loved overnights my nightshift crew rocked, never a dull moment, always lots of fright to be worked, 11 to 7 went by fast everynight, i would recomend night shift any day"
good,"I worked for Walmart but threw a company so I dont know much about them personally just the company I worked threw "
good,it was fun while it lasted. The pay sucked so I had to move on and find better opportunity. The discount was ok nothing to be amazed about. Good position o learn the position as an LPA
good,Started there but was hard to advanced here got frustrated with the open door policy their tough schedule fast paced at times was scheduled changes to often no set hours tough to get full-time felt can't advance working part-time
good,good place to work. awesome people that work there. If you prove yourself you can move up quickly. was able to move around departments easily. good place to work
good,"The most honest thing I can say about Walmart is that ""it's a job"". I enjoyed some of my coworkers there, but as far as the company is concerned, I wasnt feeling the whole ""Walmart Family"" vibe they tried to instill. Its retail, the pay is decent, you might make a friend or two, that's as glowing a review as I can give."
good,Unload trucks and stock shelves with incoming merchandise. Greet customers and help with  orders clean warehouse and  keep shelves stocked take trash out
good,"good place to work , just lack of training for the associates. Wonderful place to meet many customers and make good work friends. No longer interested in working as a sales associate, thank you"
good,"Most of my co-workers were pretty compitent, when corrected. It was 50/50 if they were going to follow policy/procedure (FIFO;First In First Out) when brought up to managers it would seem to be brushed off, and most managers seemed to be more open to walking the store, than doing productive work or assuring productive work was done according to standards."
good,at Walmart they had their fav workers and the hours was low and not enough so I couldn't live on what I was getting then I oved back home to Illinois so I didn't have my job
good,"•There is always work to do"
good,"Self Checkout was where I was stationed, and it was the most stressful customer service job i have ever worked. There was a high school mentality upon the employees and management."
good,walmart was a job where everyone helped each other. my position required me to provide great customer service to customers and make sure my isles that i was assigned for the day is fully in order and stocked.
good,Needs a little work here and there but overall good job to treat their workers a little better with like management was going to go early workers little better could work more of a sufficient
good,It was cool. I cant really speak on it but what i can speak on is i don't like doing reviews unless i want to. I'm just typing now because i can't continue for some reason.
good,It was my first job as a pharmacy technician so I learned a lot. Walmart has strict policies about taking lunches and was not a supportive learning environment.
good,I really didn't wanna do this but it wont let me continue if I don't so here it goes. The job in not that hard really if you enjoy working with people. Every day is pretty much the same. You scan and bag and communicate with the customers making sure they got everything they needed to. The coworkers I have are pretty fun to work with for the most part but I can't say the same for every Walmart.
good,Lot's of work to do. Busy all the time. It was nice to working in the dairy room in the summer. They did need more equipment on site to do the required tasks.
good,"The beginning pay at Walmart is very good, but there is a reason for it. As an associate, you will deal with a high volume of customers with a wide variety of personalities, some good, some bad. The other associates are people just like you, and are typically pretty cool. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with angry customers. A fair amount of people have short fuses when it comes to shopping, so when one little thing is not to their liking, they find the closest worker and get mad at them. The most enjoyable part, however, would have to be the positive interactions between customers, coworkers, and yourself. There are many more happy customers than there are angry ones, and helping someone have a positive experience is always rewarding."
good,It was an okay job for temporary placement I would not consider this to be a long term job. Its not easy to move up in this enviroment and a lot of people in and out of jobs.
good,The management watched every move you make. They act like that you are going to steal something all of the time. The store manager was very good to work for.
good,"There isn't much to say here, besides that you get what you expect. Working at Walmart was not the most enjoyable experience, but I didn't expect and more or less. Not a bad work environment and great for people without much education, but don't get stuck there."
good,Loved the job at beginning but expected too much of an associate at the end. Felt like I wasn't appreciated at the end.  The special occasions were very nice and a lot of the associates would join in. Management had their set duties just like us. Most of the time we would get along. I was very proud of being associated with Walmart because of the culture.
good,"i was a cashier for approximately 2 yrs, i had a great experience working with different  culture and languages.  also i had to work different hours and long hrs"
good,I was a GM Support Manager for this company. I believe the company is trying to go back in the right direction with all of the new training classes managers have had to take.
good,It's a great place for advancement. The pay is good. They offer a great PTO package. Management was great to work with. They take time to help develop associates.
good,Walmart gives you accumulating paid time off the longer you work there. And for holidays you get paid time off for that too. The dress code is relaxed and he environment has slow days and busy days. There is no over time unless the managers are short people and want someone to stay until closing time. The managers are kind of flexible about scheduling once you hit your 90 days other wise you work the availability you pick for your schedule
good,Wal-Mart is a widely known retail store. They have many different managers that work with you throughout the day that can get a little confusing at times. Overall great place to work and opportunities to grow.
good,It’s a great place if you want something temporarily. Pay is not great but it does have great benefits and very flexible with hours. Need better management
good,"A typical day at work tends to be busy a little over average. I am a cashier, so I have to scan items and have good communication with customer. If I am not busy, I clean my work area or stand at the end of my aisle and direct people into my line. Working here, I learned how to give good customer service and how to be quick and efficient when I'm scanning items. The management at this facility is very nice and does good with adjusting to both customers and employee needs. The workplace culture is mostly upbeat and fun. At times, it can be slightly stressful, but the employees do a good job helping each other out. The hardest part of the job may be dealing with an angry customer, but working here teaches patience and communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is how much everyone gets along and how fun it is when everyone is together."
good,"ran a crew of 12 or more unloading trucks stocking back stocking and helping customers. The shift was 4 pm til 1 am and no overtime was offerred. I tried to transfer for family reasons and was not able to,"
good,Not really a place for someone with a busy lifestyle or children. There is not much opportunity for advancement if your not a favorite personality .No matter how good your work ethic is opportunity advances are depended on how long you've been there.
good,"If you work inside you get treated better, but cart pushers are constantly working alone, taking care of everything by yourself. Management rarely checks on cart pushers, so some cart pushers are lazier than others."
good,Can be stressful at times. Hard working associated are overworked while other associates are given less tasks I learned to be more self sufficient in performing my tasks and was recognized as being a hard working associate by management.
good,I like the gm and had a positive work experience except for the bullying without discipline actions. As well as not getting several advanced asked days to visit terminally ill mother
good,The job was temporary at the time. I was a cashier at the checkout.  Have to interact with customers every single day at work. The management was caring and helpful. The work place was safe and fun
good,"Loved working with my co workers always super friendly have your backs when you need help. The company does a lot for there stores, base on the store your at they do a lot for there workers."
good,I balanced this employment oppurtunity alongside a social media management role . In tandem this was a great time for me as i gained fluidity multi tasking
good,it was a good nine years overall. Just ok with the way i got screwed over in the end but thats what happens when you dont kiss butt to get ahead and earn your way up. Some people in management need a dose of karma. Keeps ya honest.
good,"Great work place. It was fast paced. Management was great, so we worked better.  What was great was we had fun while working. It was overall a good workplace because management was approachable and respected us."
good,Most enjoyable part of the work is fast paced environment and flexible working hours. Big company and the location is near my home so that I spend less in commuting from home to workplace.
good,"I provided customer service for people. I would help locate items for the customers. I would cash the customers out, take their money and give them change."
good,"I gathered all carts and helped customers load items into there car.  Weather is a definite problem, not enough hours and pay because I was finishing school couldn't work enough hours."
good,The people you work with are knowledgeable and cooperative to work with.   The company is well organized and provide great benefits.  The store location was close to my home.
good,Very fast paced not a bad company to work for but only really good part time work during peak season which is around the holidays after the holidays they cut your hours
good,"Working at Walmart can be a very different experience depending on what department you are in. In my case, it was mostly enjoyable. I would, however, warn that one hand rarely knows what the other is doing. Your workload can increase in a moments notice if you happen upon the wrong manager. Likewise, you can be pulled from given tasks to other tasks with little warning."
good,Walmart can either be a fun experience for you or it can be a rough one. It really depends on the associates you work with and the customers you have to deal with on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart it was fun learning new things everyday and getting to meet new people everyday.you got to see how it is working for a place that is located every part of the world and that is a great place to work for.
good,managers was nice. customers was not so much. Great place to gain experience. Advancement was prominent from within. Nice atmosphere and cool place to work.
good,"the management was horrible. they treat you like a robot, not a human being. the job itself was ok. I didn't like the backstabbing going on there, not my cup of tea."
good,"you go to work and get your job done.  If you have time you can help other people in your department.  You wont necessary work in different areas, just your assigned.  being a team player is important to succeed."
good,Wal-mart was okay to work for wasn't too streesful. could probably get pay a bit more though. the people or your co workers are pretty fun to be aroung and work with
good,"working this position was otherwise enjoyable aside from the fact that it was less than the optimal condition for me, a person who has problems standing for a long time. while i was employed i'd informed my supervisors of my condition and it was not taken seriously even taking it upon myself to talk to the store manager about the issue hoping something would be done along with doctors notes. if you can not stand the physical demands of the job, there's no point in applying."
good,everyone was lazy managers picks and choose who gets wrote up and who doesn't hard place for a forever job. it was also really repetitive like working on a assembly line
good,"Very busy lots of lifting and pulling"
good,"Clock into work, have a quick safety and review meeting while stretching. get equipment ready and go to work. make sure area is clean and you have proper equipment to do the job right"
good,I enjoyed working with different people in different situations. Walmart is a fast paced place to work and you have to have great customer service skills and be patient. The problem I had was needing help in different departments and not getting it after letting management know numerous time.
good,trying to be more high tech; mobile express; etc more online orders trying to be like Amazon using more automated cashier stands they have place where to pick up online walmart orders
good,"Walmart is a pretty decent place to work if it's your first job, but when it comes to paying for the bills, you might want to look elsewhere. However, Walmart is very easy to get hired at."
good,"productive work place, good benefits. Walmart is what you make of it, you can use the job as a stepping stone or you can make a career of it. Lots of room to grow."
good,This was a bad job no set schedule . could not be with family at any set time. I really do not want to ever go back to walmart. It was no bathroom breaks no managers around when needed.
good,"Working in the automotive center was a easy job and laid back job, manager will leave you alone and let you work as long as the job gets done right. Alright place to work."
good,"The job itself is alright. The company admits they're all about the customer, but lacks the ability to meet demand in scheduling to help the customer body. My experience with them has been frustrating in the aspect of, my job becomes more difficult when the lack of human resource is imminent. I enjoy spending time with individual customers to find the different things that are going to help them the most, and with such a large company, in a place as popular to shop at, it's near impossible when there is a single associate on the floor."
good,"Fast paced, i would recommend to a friend if looking for something temporary. I can say that we had a good team when i was working there. Very busy made my days go by fast."
good,Poor management . I've learned Alot with my position and other positions in other departments.the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the water coming from customers coming into the store while snowing. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers feel okay to come into the bathroom with fresh sent and cleaning with a smile on there faces telling me how a good of job I am doing and they thank me for it.
good,My day varies but overall depending on the location you are assigned will determine your advancement. I have notice dependin on the region how progression occurs.
good,I loved working at Walmart but the guys would bully me and throw food at me and the managers would see it but they never did anything about it. I didn’t feel safe working there either.
good,"en el trabajo es ambiente bueno, los compañeros si te apoyan y los supervisores. los fines de semana si hay más trabajo. lo que aprendí trabajo en equipo."
good,"Corrido, tem que ser dinâmico,  aprendi bastante em logística, boa relação com a gerencia."
good,I worked at Walmart a while back and have heard they have made significant changes. When I worked there it was very mismanaged and at times the management contradicted each other's directive.
good,Bad management okay money  bonuses every three months  hard work never good enough.  Don’t really care about personal issues just want you to work work work no matter what you were going through in your personal life. You don’t really matter.
good,The most useful benefit of the company was its generous stock option package. A generous amount of hour were available most of the year. Work assignments were not difficult or unreasonable.
good,Walmart is a poor company. Do not intent to work there unless you just don't care about being screwed over. The management team doesn't even follow the policies in place.
good,pretty nice and fastpaced. managers are always changing moods so you never know. pretty strict about their rules which i would say is a great thing for a company.
good,dont really have anything to say about walmart. Worked at the distribution center not the super market.the distribution center was an ok place to work.
good,it was nice being a cashier you get to interact with the people all day long makes the day go by faster. you get to help people as well by making there day before they leave the store.
good,"Walmart in Clarion, PA is usually chaotic and extremely packed throughout the day. The management team is nice but expects more than employees can accomplish in one shift. There are many rude, obnoxious and odd people that come into this store and have harassed me on multiple occasions. Being a young girl working at night in this facility can be creepy at times. Working with many other cashiers and training new employees is a major part of my shifts at Walmart."
good,They should pay more for what they ask their associates to do. Low pay rate for the hourly supervisor. Too much work in short time and too much responsibility.
good,"It was fun to work for the company. It was a temporary job, for the moment, to pay the bills that I had at that time. Just to get by during the year so that I could get to another job."
good,"The job itself was fairly simple - in theory, but our managers were indecisive, impulsive, and didn't seem to communicate with one another, they just couldn't make up their minds regarding the layout of our stockroom, and they were constantly experimenting with what kind of freight should go where. The relatively simple process of unloading merchandise, sorting it by department, and sending it to the sales floor became more and more complicated thanks to managment's obsession with warehouse feng-shui. After a year, I had enough."
good,i worked in clothing so was always busy putting away and picking up clothes off floor. Also my manager had me doing jobs that she was supposed to do but would have me do instead.
good,walmart is a huge company. if you like keeping busy than this is the right job for you. a day at walmart is always a moving day. the amount of customers you help to the amount of merchandise you have to stock on the shelves
good,"Cashiering – Receive payments by cash, check, credit cards, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, or change due to customers. Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints. Establish or identify prices of goods, tabulate bills using cash registers, or price scanners. Greet customers entering establishment. Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas and complete other general cleaning duties, such as sweeping and emptying trash cans."
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 17 years.  There are many opportunities for different positions in this company.  The turnover is high as well here,  but one must be able adapt to change. This company is changing constantly and is trying to keep up with technology,  and how consumers want to shop for their merchandise.  I was looking for a career change due to all the heavy lifting pushing and pulling.  It takes a toll on someone after 20 plus years in retail."
good,Multiple managers giving instructions can be confusing. We get hot dogs and donuts when we do well. There is a wide variety of people that work here that can be friendly. Customers are very interesting when shopping they ask a variety of questions and tell interesting stories.
good,Working for this company can sometimes be a nightmare they'll put you in one spot and then they'll put you in another spot Management's can't cooperate together on what to do and then they blame you for doing it wrong
good,"i have worked there for  a long time. i really enjoyed it at first and still kinda did for awhile until you start getting blamed for everyone else work ,i work hard and i prefer to work hard , but there is a lot of people who work there that doesn't know this sentiment . if they were more responsible and actually cared for their job maybe i would stay to be completely honest ,I'm not saying its a bad job i just would like to be rewarded with the hard work that is done and have the people who dont work or do their job let go and it would be much better to have a good team to work with"
good,working for Walmart is a breeze. having great people skill definitely helps. Keep working and your day goes by fast. Have to look out for management they are very two faced and will toss u under the bus to save their friends n themselves.
good,People That Deserve To Get Promotions & Up In The Company Are Put In Last Place While People Who Work There Heart Out Are Just Dogged Out On The Daily
good,"Great job for someone strong at delegating and followup. Difficult to balance work and home life. Schedule is not respectful of managers with families. Pay is great and with the right management, teamwork is encouraged."
good,"Wal-Mart seems to have been a much better company to work for.  Now it doesn't appear to be like that, at least at the store I work at.  I enjoy the work and the people I work with.  The ability to advance is endless but the focus on employee appreciation is lacking"
good,"I loved working there. Very fast paced, and kept me busy. The workers were friendly, and my management was good. They gave long lunches and breaks...."
good,Its been years since I last worked there. I do know that they have been growing and expanding with the remodel. I am sure it is a company that would let you move up.
good,"boring threw the day never really liked talking"
good,"Stay focused  on what you are doing. It’s very demanding and they’d like for you to be working at all times. Poor management at times, so it takes so getting used to with that"
good,Working at walmart is fullfilling. i enjoy working around customers and different employees.  Managment could be better but overall my experience has been good
good,I Have nothing bad to say I’m just looking for a new job! The day consists of safety and stacking everything the proper way! Hardest thing is the fact it tears your body down!
good,I worked on my feet each time I worked. Didn't make enough to eat and pay rent. I walked all the way to work to only work six hours. They do give you 30 min lunch.
good,Walmart is a good place for work experience and to open doors for more career advancement. Walmart helps to improve communication level and increase social interactions with the community.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. The people you work with are easy to get along with. Its fast paced for the most part but does have its stressful moments.
good,"I like working there, the associates are friendly and they work as a team. The manager are quick to work with you if you have an issue regarding your schedule"
good,"18 years of age or older, able to work well with others as a team member,A Deli Clerk's duties are performed primarily in the Deli department. Work includes walking, standing for prolonged periods, and lifting deli products weighing up to 50 pounds. Duties also include frequent interaction with customers and associates."
good,Great with team work. I do what I am told. Great with other people that I work with and dont work with. Am willing to learn new things and work my hardest to contain what is needed.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with it was never a dull moment you could work in different departments there was always a chance to advance and I worked 3 different departments
good,I do not have any comments at this time regarding the company. It is not something I can disclose at this time. I will not violate any company guidelines for external use.
good,"If you're a young person they really work with you. however, management was horrible when i was there. they were very disorganized as in people were missing their breaks constantly or you would need money or help and no one would come for at least 15 - 20 mins. Also if you get a bad manager you're stuck, i got a new manager who kept trying to schedule me during my college hours which did not follow my availability schedule. i brought it to his attention and he tried to blame it on me saying i shouldn't be changing my schedule. then he saw on the computer that the system had put warnings in on my schedule saying i was not supposed to work those certain hours and he blamed the computer and didn't even change all of my schedule just a few days and told me to come back later."
good,"Typical hours are 10PM to 7AM. Main responsibilities, merchandise stocking, customer assistance, zoning ( working merchandise to be appealing to customers) and cleaning work area.Learned to process my time to adequately complete the job.The hardest part of the job is getting used to rotation of supervisors and their different expectations every 6 months. Night time hours allowed me to be more productive with less interference."
good,Walmart is a challenging job because of the hours sometimes you have to squat and bend for 12 hours non stop other then your lunch and breaks.  You also have to badge in and out throughout the function of the job that sometimes could be hard to comprehend.
good,"While I wouldnt recomend this company for long term employment, they are great place to learn a retail career. Their starting wages are fair and above average with other retailers"
good,"Walmart was a very fast-paced, hands on kind of job it was a lot of cash handling and customer interaction. It taught me how to work in a nonstop environment."
good,At Walmart there really was no telling what the day was going to be like. Some days was really easy going and some days where full of adventure good and bad
good,I enjoy Wal-Mart company as a whole they treat you like family you get to meet and interact with people everywhere its a great time anytime I'm there !
good,"I loved helping customers find/purchase what they want or need. I worked hard every day, was always first dept manager on the floor to start work, and one of the last to go. my management team was great t first, then became mean and bullies."
good,"A typical day would include organizing shelves until lunch the after lunch i would stock the shelves, the management had some people that were fun to be around and others that weren't, and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making friends"
good,"Nice job, not a career. It was a great place to work but ultimately the money just was not there for a long term sustainable career. Forced to work too many holidays."
good,Ok place to work for. For the most part it seem to be a typical day of work. They do allow you to move up from any position your in. Managment can be a bit scary sometime.
good,I got assigned an isle and had to stock the items from the back to the shelves in that isle. It wasnt bad work but being third shift hurt my ability to drive home after work because of the distance and the route.
good,"The hardest part of the job is work, life balance. I loved the management and associates but 10hr days turned into 13hr days, 5 days a week turned into 6 days a week."
good,"While working at Walmart isn't the best option, and there are plenty of alternatives to it; I can't deny that it is a solid option for people who are entering the work field for the first time. It will give you a grounding on what to expect in sales, and will bring you out of your comfort zone while you interact with people on a daily basis."
good,"fast paced, unhappy customers with the long lines, learned to deal with people of all cultures and temperments.  different managers all the time. friendly co workers"
good,Walmart has a great plan for one stop shopping they need to be a little more focused on employees and the efforts that's being made on the companies behalf
good,"Working for Walmart is as you would suspect. It's stressful, can sometimes be relaxed and casual without the management screaming down your throat. And if management isn't getting onto you? Customers are being rude and nasty."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart, management could be better. Customer service is my main focus taking care of customer needs only wish I had a manager team that seen my hard work and delication. And stop having picks with certain employees"
good,There are number of thing I like about this job .we moved thing in a fasted paced .and you can't comments personally or make personal comment.Its was always about solving the problems and another thing I liked about this job was I learned something New everyday.
good,The new scheduling system does not give anyone enough hours each week. The managers can not make schedule updates. Some days there are to many cashiers scheduled and others not enough.
good,"very busy from start to finish"
good,"Cashier work in evenings, solving customer problems or questions in timely manner. Had no problems with the cashiering part but had a hard time restocking bag because they were under the bagging area and not accessible to me with my hip problem."
good,Walmart has a plethora of things to do. Most of the time you will get pulled from your area to somewhere else to work. Personally I worked in apparel but spent an hour in grocery a day and was constantly called to run a register. Overall I liked the busyness of the job and having multiple task to work on
good,"I was a night stalker at walmart in Yukon oklahoma; and this female manager was tracking my every move, and then when I called her on it she got really mad and then i quit 3 days later."
good,Wal Mart is a great place to work at. It give multiple opportunities to advance with the company. Pay is pretty good especially if you have been there a while.
good,"The store was high traffic with never a dull moment. Days were always very busy. Co-workers were amazing, helpful and enjoyable to work with. I only worked part-time so did not get the benefits or compensations and I was required to work all holidays so did not provide good work/life balance. I did enjoy my work environment and would recommend them for people looking for work with room to grow!"
good,"Hardest part of job was resetting mods. I was over 5 departments and i was also having to stay on top of price changes, inventory, new stock, cash handling experience,"
good,I stocked and replenish product. The must enjoyable part was helping and getting to know customers. The work environment was nice. Management was okay.
good,"It's an awesome experience to work as a Cap 1 Associate. I am not a morning person but the hours goes by fast. I start at 4am and gets off at 1pm, so it's a great place to work at with awesome people."
good,From my experience at Walmart I would say the biggest problem was not having enough associates to get things done properly in a timely manner. That is my biggest concern for Walmart employment.
good,If your looking for somewhere to move up and make 15.00 and hour+ Walmart definitely is the place. It is very slow pace work even when you were working hard but you usually are always picking up somone else’s slack.
good,"Walmart tends to have it's own set of politics to maneuver, however it it has great people who care.  There are class development opportunities for personal growth.  A lot of Sam's ""beliefs"" are not followed as closely as they once were.  They expect high turn out with increasing workloads.  They are however highly flexible in work hours so long as the business needs are met."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is starting bright and early getting bread and donuts prepared for customers. I think the hardest part of the job and being hands on doing something for the first time.
good,"While some employees could get away with doing nothing , the ones that did work were constantly being pushed .... right out the door. Not everyone was held to the same standard"
good,"Walmart is nice place to work. Expectations are fairly reasonable, the hours basically consistent. Usually good about scheduling around associates life. If willing to make a career you can advance. Overall decent not great"
good,"Every time I wanted to move up in my store something would happen (the job i wanted was dissolved, or given to someone else outside the store). Management always tried hard to help with anything but sometimes got side tracked."
good,I applied at walmart when I started college. They were quick on hiring and getting orientations and interviews done. After being there for two months you can tell who the favorites are.
good,Manager doesn't not take the time out to training you proper you have to learn from other.They don't know how to talk to you they are rude and disrespectful
good,I started on stocking shelves this was very fast paced.the breaks are for one hour this gives you a much needed break. Sometimes you would need to help others to get their stock put on the shelves. I then went to maintainance. I liked it a little better. I cleaned and stripped floors and did all kinds of other maintaince
good,I normally started my day off by checking what aisle I am on after that then I go get my carts and start stocking make sure all my trash is in one area and my stuff is clean
good,Walmart is always looking for help for a reason. They tend to put a lot on people to do and expect miracles even at the expense of employee health. I had great HR people where I worked but the pay was not worth the amount of work piled on. The new scheduling program they have does not take into account that people may want a life and if you try to change your availability so that you will have time to spend with family then it starts to cut your hours. Great job in a pinch but people come and go. I hope that Walmart gets things figured out because they use to be a lot better to work for.
good,I'm just happy to still have a jobe there. So days can be hard if you let it. The people there are awesome day and night people everywhere shoping talking looking online stuff. Are layaway is sweet
good,I worked at walmart at 16 had a lot of complaints due to me not being able to sell alcohol so they moved me to door greeter and i disliked that very much.
good,"well a typical work day can be slow or very fast. there are times when youll have to deal with very upset people, so youll have to help them and also complete your tasks"
good,"Walmart is a good paying job but it is overwhelming at times. Delegating tasks isn’t the problem. It’s the fact that they treat you like you don’t. Over all, it’s a 50/50 thing. You gotta take some good with some bad."
good,"Some jobs are forever, some are until you figure out what you want to do with your life. Wal-Mart should fall under that category. Sure there are people who stay there for many years, but they've built a relationship the company that is hard to break after a while. Being hired now, it is not the same family company it used to be, so use it as a temporary job."
good,Walmart its good now but when i work there in 2005 the pay sucks 8.90 . The employees are good n if u need help they will help u . Good place n it was good
good,muchos trabajaores casi no tenian tiempo para pasarlo con sus familias ya que llegaban demasiado cansados a sus hogares y algunos
good,"its busy, hard work, decent. Good breaks, and the other employees are nice. some management is nice and funny, all depends oh which one. typical day is pretty boring"
good,The worst part of this job was the customer's always wanting more and for less like the place was theirs to do what they please also people who never watched their child.
good,"What started small, with a single discount store and the simple idea of selling more for less, has grown over the last 50 years into the largest retailer in the world. Each week, nearly 265 million customers and members visit our more than 11,200 stores under 55 banners in 27 countries and eCommerce websites in 10 countries. With fiscal year 2018 revenue of $500.3 billion, Walmart employs over 2.2 million associates worldwide. Walmart continues to be a leader in sustainability, corporate philanthropy and employment opportunity. It’s all part of our unwavering commitment to creating opportunities and bringing value to customers and communities around the world."
good,Management did not care about others and made the environment worse by only caring about themselves. It was stressful because management would be off and leave at the same time making it more difficult for everyone else to deal with customers amd issues that arrives.
good,"uhh it's Walmart. Unless you a high level manager there you ain't gonna make no money. was laid back not really stressful, but its a minimum wage job. No real job growth."
good,i was in the dali and stock shelfs it was a good job i left becouse of transperta problems with my car i love eveyone i worked with we had a good time it was like familey
good,"I had a great time working at Walmart warehouse. Working there was always fast pace at all time. Working at Walmart warehouse was a fun experience for me because, I got a chance to see a lot more things that i didn't see in the Walmart stores. Overall it was a nice place to work."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement within the hourly positions, but few exist above that.  Insightfulness, trained approximately 20 technicians in the day to day operation of a fast paste environment."
good,"Its Walmart, its pretty much what you would expect. The costumers can be rude and ungrateful but most of the time its good.  There's also plenty of room for advancement."
good,Everyone that I worked with at Walmart was friendly and were very open to conversation. I didn't have any truly negative experiences while I was working there.
good,"stocked grocery shelfs, talked to customer and directed them where the items they were looking for.  Enjoyed the people that I worked with so busy that time flew by."
good,"I was often motivated as I quickly rose from Cashier to CSM in under a year.  I tried to go above and beyond in areas of customer service and I was often praised for it."
good,"Several opportunities to advance, VERY GOOD policies for personal purposes to protect the employee, flexible hours and great health benefits after a year"
good,"There is always something to do besides your basic tasks that you were given every day. I had learned to be consistent at working with the time i had to get everything done. I had to stock furniture before, wasn't too fun because I always had to find someone to help me lift certain items, which of course that is what you're suppose to do, but it wasted time getting things done looking for the help. most enjoyable part is when you're almost done with your tasks and you feel accomplished."
good,"It's a retail job. It was okay. You work, you get paid. Management isn't too bad since they barely interact with you. Just work and you wont have any problems."
good,Not much to say. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible. I was paid fairly for the work I did. It wasn't hard but very fast paced at times. Management could be a pain but it was okay for the most part.
good,great company only down side was that I was part time working full time hours without any benefits until I reached my 2 years. the most I've gotten was holiday pay and a quarterly bonus is the store reached the goal.
good,"Preparing medication and other health care products for patients. Measure dosage of medications according to prescription orders. Process prescriptions using computer software.  Label and record dosage information. Monitor storage and inventory of medications and supplies. Customer service, monitor incoming and outgoing calls for prescription orders. Accurately assists the pharmacist in all duties pertaining to the medication distribution."
good,"Pays the bills, not a bad place to work if in need of a job. As long as you do your job you will be fine but most times they always find something wrong"
good,Walmart was not a bad job just very demanding which taught me a lot on the fly. Many times I covered departments and learned how to utilize all machines required to satisfy customer needs.
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work at as long as you don't mind being treated like a robot. Management doesn't care about you as a person, they just want the job done. It doesn't matter if you are sick or have kids, they do not care about your outside life and are not willing to work around your schedule. They just want people who fit their business needs. Management will promote brown nosers, not those who actually deserve to move up."
good,"Overall is a good place for students and elderly to work, they have positions for everyone, it’s not a very hard job depending on what your doing and what your skill level is"
good,"Walmart does not care about the well being of their employees, all they care about is money. The pay is okay, but it is not worth the hours I put in with no help"
good,Walmart management at Bryant were constantly in the way of advancing in the company. I had to go above my Department Managers head in order to move up in the company.
good,No the best place to work. Was more of a job in need than a career. Management is too busy about numbers than it employees or customers. Not a good thing to have in a business.
good,"It was fun till I had to relocate. I worked in backroom and salesfloor stocker. My team was basically the A Team of the company. I hated working at my Walmart, because I was underpaid. I stayed there for almost 3 years cause I was driven to put food on the table."
good,"worked 9 years at  walmart in New Brunswick.  It was great really liked it.  Moved to GP, AB and the way things are run and no one cares here, I left within a month."
good,I didn't work for Walmart itself but for another company within Walmart. It was a joke. The Walmart detective was following me and other good people around like we were criminals.
good,"I worked many departments at Wal-Mart.  It was a nice place to work for starting out.  This was not a career for me but I did enjoy working here until I found more permanent employment,"
good,cuenta con reglamentos establecidos y los cumplen en un 90 %
good,"This company is very cost conscious, but  tends to promote from within making it a good opportunity for advancement in all areas, even in the retail stores as well."
good,I have been with Walmart a very long time. It has changed so much. It used to be a great company to work for. It used to have a family atmosphere but not anymore.
good,You need to be able to continuously work in a fast paced environment from when your shift starts to when it ends. The people working there are great and helpful.
good,"i didn't have to deal with customers. management at the time was iffy but has since improved. don't get a job out on the floor, look for an office job like claims or receiving."
good,This is an easy job but it’s very fast paced. I enjoyed working there for the short time I did. The company was shut down for some reason it is a great company
good,"Typical work day is 12-14 hours"
good,"I liked working at Walmart in some areas  every time i had a problem they wouldn't fix it right away, but over all its good place to work if you need to make money. i made a couple of new friends and i still talk to them daily"
good,You will have to be quick and friendly. It has it's tough times but it also train you on how to deal with different types of people. Hard work will move you up in position.
good,"I would say that there are too many managers, not enough associates, the company tries to promote closeness and family values but it feels like we are all replaceable numbers on a screen at corporate. My current direct manager is great, we discuss my goals and motivation frequently and he encourages me to do my best. That said, the store manager and other assistants love to promote from outside our store. it feels like if you want to advance you need to look for a new job."
good,its a great for for first job learn a lot it the manger some times can be really hard to deal with and the hours and pay is ok not that great but you can make it
good,"It's a decent starting point. It isn't really a place where people have a career at, but it is decent for a person who needs a starting point in their job search."
good,"love helping the senior at the cash out, always fun and pleased to talk to. also co worker . was easy and fun for me but the pay was low and hours was not helping me.  Wal Mart only hire part time. it was just temporary for me.."
good,"Aprendí bastante sobre sistema Smart y Cash Office, el ambiente laboral era promedio. Lo que no me gusto del trabajo fue no lograr tener una vida laboral y privada desde Jefa de Local lo cual no me agrado del empleo."
good,This Company has been very beneficial in teaching me a lot of life skills. I was able to learn how to multi task and stay busy. I learned great customer service skills that i will keep with me for my entire life.
good,Walmart has some very nice people working there the staff are very friendly and relationships with staff are formed some managers don’t really help towards a schedule around my schooling.
good,I was fired from this job but when I file for unemployment I was told I was wrongly fired because they but they were letting other employees take more sick days then they were firing me for
good,Very flexible with working hours. this is beneficial for families and working students. Being able to move up is very difficult though. Multiple members of management.
good,"The workplace culture was that of working on a huge team. For instance, if I was unable to help a customer, I could lead them to the direct assistance they needed without fail."
good,During my tenure with this company there were some good and some bad the most current is what i have experienced since working at this store. There have been numerous situations where discrimination has been a severe problem here at this store as well as well as the good old boy system
good,"Decent Work Place Environment, Long hours, but decent pay, schedule conflicts are hard to solve but other than that the job here is decent, nothing special but it pays bills"
good,Tle was fun being outside and working on vehicles. fun engaging management team. Hours were weird and was short handed most all of the time. I would work there again if needed.
good,Need little more work on absentee policy. only missed 4 days in 5 months all due to illness. They have no leniency on missing. So if you get sick you are in trouble.
good,"Responsible for cleaning and maintaining the property, including the restrooms, aisles, shelving and parking lot, keeping the store “open ready”. Assisted with replenishing inventory, customer service and merchandise resets."
good,Walmart was a good place to work I liked working with a lot of the associates. The only problem with Walmart was poor customer service. No one smiles when they talk to the customers. Not many associates to work and help out. greeters walk away from their doors when they are suppose to be greeting people they just talk with each other.
good,its a great place to work with so many other opportunites fast paced quick busy store most of the time good environment and co workers are nice competitive work but difficult in working hours
good,Okay place to work. Face paced no help from Management. When asking for assistance takes to long for it. Not enough hands on training considering what is asked of it's employees.
good,"The days here were long at times, my manager was great and understanding until we had to switch managers then the second one wasnt the best. Customer service had its ups and downs but it was a good job to have while in school"
good,working here is allright I wasn't making enough to pay my bills so I got a second job and ending up getting fired from here for calling off to many times
good,"I would never work there again, and wouldnt recommend this job to anyone. Management just needs to do better as a whole to help build employee moral!!"
good,"Walmart pays well but its a lot of problems to fix daily, things are always changing, a lot of hours. I hardly get to take breaks or lunches. Its hard to balance home life and work life."
good,"Some days are busier than others, Learned how to approach and handle shoplifters without causing an violence. I wanted to to the job, cause I do not like thieves. Hardest thing was stopping the shoplifter without any physical contact."
good,"Te ponen la camiseta de la empresa"
good,"No período trabalhado, faltava muita organização, por se tratar de inauguração do centro de distribuição."
good,Good place to work then it's just boring and lots of heavy stuff to lift and new manager was worthless so really helped me leave and look for something new
good,"Productive & physical, can be stressful especially during inventory, feel safe with police officer on site, great co-workers, some managers are approachable and helpful."
good,Walmart always keeps you on your toes. You meet a variaty of different people and learn so many new things. You always have something to do or someone to help. There is never a time to just sit around.
good,"Working at Walmart helped me with customer service, to know people, practicing my English and Spanish, the management started getting better at the end."
good,"Typical day at work?"
good,"I learned a great many people skills working here; I always say, ""I had to let customers come to me angry, and make them leave LESS angry, to as great a degree as possible."" I worked the Customer Service counter. Many people come from the woodwork, so learning to deal with that type of person, without being unprofessional was, in my opinion, an ASSET to my character development. I firmly believe such an attitude is something that most people could use a dose of training to be a bit better poised; sadly, I find myself as one of few associates that even learned this type of diplomacy from there at all. I find that the disfunction in Wal-Mart, though LEGENDARY, is ironically the biggest thing in my history of jobs that taught me proper functionality. I am very pleased not to work there any more, though; they are BEYOND incompetent. I don't even shop there anymore, if I can help it at all."
good,"Good part-time job. Chance for advancement.Periodic raises for job performance. Friendly staff and management. learned how to ""zone"" different departments"
good,"The job is doable, everything is laid nicely at the start. The first week was fine, as I was learning the basics and getting used to the routine at Fresh cap. But as I continued, they would change their policy almost every week, you were constantly learning how to do something in different ways. I don't know if they are trying to find the most effective way to do something by trial and error, but it was very stressful when you were constantly making mistakes. Also, they patience of the manager wears thing after the first week, they expect you to be on the ball regardless if none of the managers or supervisors are on the same page. Not a single positive reinforcement, just pure criticism. And don't think you will have help always, there were many days I was alone handling a 4 man job all day. This was a unique experience, and everyone should try it once to fully understand and appreciate their local Walmart employees."
good,"Working overnight a Walmart is not anything special as far as I'm concerned. I've worked retail before so I had a bit of experience coming in; however, the overnight hiring process was determined by whether or not newcomers could stay on the remodeling team which a lot of us sought to be unfair as we were understaffed the entire project and could not meet the deadlines for projects meant for at least 25 people when we didn't have half that many people for a lot of the project."
good,"my first full time job after I finished high school, it was fun because there was a lot of people my age, and I meet my son's father there.I learned a lot while I was there"
good,"Working as an overnight stocker  at Walmart was a normally relaxing environment, but like many other companies, can get competitive and fast-paced during the holidays."
good,Very busy. Lots of people that tune goes by super fast. Meet different people in so little time when checking customer out. Hardest part is remembering numbers for fruit.
good,This is a stepping stone for teenagers and it can really give a foundation to moving to up in a company. Company gives raises often and the starting pay is good
good,"This was a nice enough place to work but I did have some problems there most notably it was nearly impossible to move to a different position no matter how hard someone worked all the management seem to care about was the MasterCard we needed to sell. In other words, you needed to make people feel uncomfortable and trick them into getting a bad card just to have a chance of getting promoted."
good,the only way you got to climb the employment ladder at this company was if you were a brown noser and or if you were male. The company played favoritism and was one of the worst companies to work for.
good,"At Walmart, I was assigned to be a cart pusher. This being a desert town in summer, it could be intense at times. Management was mostly hands-off, in fact I had a lot of time to myself to work. Though I would often be assigned to help with other associates at various tasks. The physical labor, I would say, was the hardest part of the job."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced environment.   It is a great place to move up through the company if you desire.  The schedule, however does not always permit a well balanced life between work and family."
good,I have nothing to say just that I Met some awesome people there.And Two really good Store managers out of all the Walmart’s that I’ve worked at from Arizona to California the indio store was the worst.
good,I work at a call center branch for Walmart place was pretty cool there is a no phone policy so it was easy to stay focused on work very overwhelming though when it came to scheduling appointments outside of work it may cost you your job
good,"It's an average job, it would be easy to stay in the same sport for years. Management style depends. Scheduling and getting the hours requested is changing and becoming more difficult. Now it requires the scheduling across several departments to get your hours."
good,Lots of opportunities at this job. Lots of different jobs to do. Great people. Lots of chances to advance.  Handed to travel. All in all. It was a really good place to work
good,"I started working at Walmart when I was a senior in high school, for my age and my schedule I can say that it was pretty flexible. I don't believe it was a good first job for someone still in school though. There was hectic days and it got stressful but I have no bad things to say about Walmart. It's a good company."
good,"I cannnot speak for all stores, but the one i worked for started out as a great place to work almost 14 years ago. The managenent team was great, we had true leaders who cared about the success of the store and its associates. Gradually it started to go down hill, a team is only as good as its leaders. The past few years I worked for the company were very trying. The core values that once made it a great place to work were almost nonexistent. The lack of respect and constant fear of retaliation made for a hostile work environment. There were only 2-3 managers you could go to unless you wanted your issues/concerns spread around the store. When I left the company our turnover rate was the highest it had ever been, and was directly linked to our management team. A little appreciation and recognition goes a long way and for some teams all that was pointed out was the bad and not recognizing the successes. I could go on and on but i will stop here. If you do decide to work for the company I hope that the store you work for has managers who lead with integrity and respect."
good,I was always moving a lot and never bored.  I liked making sandwiches and making salads and rositteree chicken.  I liked the fact that I was not stationary.
good,Too many demand for quality work and not enough time or staff to meet the needs of the company or the needs of the customer.  Staff is rarely recognized for their hard work and the compensation is no where near what it should be for the hours available and the job requirements.
good,"Overall working at Walmart was okay.  I mean, Walmart was there for me when I needed a job and has rehired me more than once. They're strict on attendance. My direct supervisor had an issue playing favorites. .."
good,"It's great for younger people who need a part time job, you meet all different kinds of people."
good,i love the staff the store manager is an angel shes so beatiful i love her so much the staff is great prices are great everyone is nice for the most part the only thing thats not good is the pay its not liveable i cant pay my bills or afford gas at the same time wich is the only reason i dont want to work there
good,"Loved working for walmart , learned a lot if only we would get pay raises to help support the cost of living I would have stayed.  The environment is a great place to work."
good,Cashier bagged product and put up returns when not busy. Helped CSS collect money bags and put new bags in drawer for the next shift. Helped were ever I could
good,Managers can be a pain. They really work you into the ground and if operations in the store run behind than they often blame one group rather than the managers trying to do better.
good,Walmart is very busy and fast-paced. Customer satisfaction is the main goal of the job. Management can be helpful. There are lots of theme days with free food.
good,walmart is a great place to learn to deal with customers and interact with co workers. The down side is they can not accommodate a part time schedule for students.
good,You will meet plenty of people and learn to deal respectfully with them. Other employees will help you when your falling behind in your area. Stay busy and your day will go by quickly and smoothly.
good,So much fun to work there.  Had fun working in grocery.  Everyone was cooperative.  No conflicts.  All supervision supportive.  All associates hardworking and friendly.
good,Management duties  in Walmart is always changing and some were just recently let go.  I've come to notice that many of the upper management personnel are not very customer friendly.
good,Enjoyed going to work but advancement is slow. Able to work hours needed so I could care for my ailing father. The pay is not good too low for what the job entails.
good,"A typical workday consists of starting out with a team meeting to discuss the tasks at hand for the day. Counting inventory, restocking inventory and assisting customers with inquiries and purchases."
good,"Too much click.Lack of people skills among upper management and some level of hostile environment as applied to diversity in promotion and retention."
good,It was a great job and I loved it. I was getting 40 hours a week at first then my boss hired new people and my hours got cut and I really wanted the hours.
good,Was an okay job to work at. Work was very fast passed and you are pressured to wok faster so you can do more. Coworkers were a mix of lazy drug addict morons and people legitimately trying to do a good job and make a living
good,I worked for Walmart for six years . The only reason I stayed is because the economy was slow and it was hard to get another job at that time. Finally I found a better job
good,A typical day at work was go in with a positive attitude and get the job done and always be productive and help customers in manually fashion. I learned how to run cash register.
good,"Busy checking out customers, can be learned even if you've never operated a cash register, friendly environment, just be mindful of how you handle cash to avoid being short and receiving fake coupons. Making friends with the employees and customers is the best part of the job."
good,"They don't pay enough, they don't give enough hours for their employees, especially the cashiers. Cashiers have one of the hardiest jobs there and they only get less than 32 hours a week. I wouldn't recommend a job to anyone."
good,This is not okay place to work if you're looking for consistency and doing the same thing everyday just hope you can get along with your manager a lot of them when they get the management role it goes to their head and they think they are badass they don't understand that it's a job
good,Be prepared for customer service and short notice change of plans. Things are usually straightforward with repetitive action but people will only look after their own department.
good,"A Typical Day At Work Would Be Us Setting Up The back room get ready to unload the truck, the Trucks Can be anywhere from 500-3000 Pieces."
good,This was a job that enabled you to have first hand contact with your customers and this could be very rewarding in most instances..it also allowed you to get feedback directly
good,Walmart preaches diversity and consideration for all employees... it is followed loosely & on a case by case basis. Average pay & benefits as well as company discounts.
good,the environment I worked in at walmart was second to nun with a high target on employee usability and cleanly work environment plus the benefits of working there
good,"Advancement at the store I worked at depended on how well you were liked by management. In the 1.5 years that I have been there I have put in for at least 5 different positions and I only had one interview. I am not the only one this has happened to. "
good,"A typical day at work included customer service and stocking, having to work in more than one area getting pulled numerous times out of the day and a handful of disrespectful customers."
good,Pay and benefits are great and quick advancement opportunities. Poor policies and not a look of room for understanding when it comes to caring for your family.
good,I enjoy working in the customer service areas. I learned much during my time there. I enjoyed helping out patrons. I learned how to use the telzon to scan the items and to do inventory.
good,"Pros: "
good,Don't apply here if you like your weekends. I worked at Walmart for 2 years and never had a weekend or a Saturday or Sunday off  without having to book it off
good,I was a part time student going to late shift for produce.small town so I was the only one taking care of the produce. People where not always nice but I kept to myself
good,They people you work with become part of your family. The work load is steady so the day goes by fast. You build strong relations to your customers. very much enjoyed it
good,Its okay for me to work overnight. Breaking down the truck Pallets. Stocking the foods on the floor site. Breaking boxes as we stock the foods. Working with the crews and managers.
good,"fun work place but not a safe place to work in, need more organization for departments within the store and who works in what department, lead people should direct workers and put them in certain areas for heavy lifting of items and who can operate equipment in certain areas of the store."
good,This job is nonstop... So wear good shoes and bring some food. Also there isn't any AC in the warehouse and the temp gets into the in the 100's during the summer. So be prepared to sweat a lot.
good,Walmart can be a great place to work at if you get the right management. I enjoyed my time working there. But the issue with Walmart is that they don't accept doctors notes except under special conditions.
good,Good place to work but not enough pay good people to work with and enjoy the hours management could be hard to work for at times. Need better pay to take care of my family without living pay check to pay check.
good,i love working for walmart; enjoy talking with customers and meeting new people;  always enough cashier supervisors to assist when needed; pay is low and hours vary
good,It helped me feed my family and that's what mattered to me... As long as u just do your work and try not to miss work you will do just fine...it's not too bad
good,Walmart a suck company...I wouldn't have my dog work for them... they cut hours and the system sucks... hopefully the change there management.. this job sucked so bad.
good,"Management had problems with communication, they were not on the same page. Co-workers provided a pleasant working environment although some employees lacked good customer service. Hard to locate manager for assistance at times and didn't always provide enough hours."
good,"Équipe de travaille super sympatique et agréable. membre du personnel abordable. et possibilité de monter en grade."
good,Supervision at most walmarts will be like most retail places. They will be on you like white on rice. Micro-managed for sure. Unreasonable completion timeline expectations.
good,Working stock form pallets to shelves overnight was sometimes challenging with the amount of freight that was received.  Returning re-shop items to their correct department shelves to clear the customer service area.  Organizing entire area of department including end caps and action alley displays.
good,"breaks, lunches, discounts, hours, good pay, flexible scheduling, proper training. "
good,I was a job starting job. I didn't want to work at walmart but it was the only place that gave me a call back. I never fully hated working here but you do end up having some really terrible managers.
good,Typical day at work was never the same from day to day. I was a cashier so I dealt with customers all day and not all of them were always the best. Management was ok. Some were helpful and some were not.
good,stressful environment strict adherence to rules not much leeway work flow was always the same feeling routine.  the job was dull. An employee would have not much chance for advancement without many obstacles
good,Not great not terrible. Not a lot of flexibility with schedule.Gained great management and merchandising experience. Did not like having to work overnights.
good,At my time of employment they were well known for being the largest employer of Americans on public aid.  But I hear that they are starting people out at a decent amount of money as of 2018
good,"Everyone is doing the best they can, but the organization is so massive that it's hard to get everyone going in the same direction.  The result is a lot of work silos and competing directions all at once."
good,"If you like a high demanding job, this is a great place to work.  Not very much workplace and family balance. The company is very generous with their PPO."
good,"Walmart was a stimulating workplace that was fast paced and challenging.  I enjoyed being an inventory specialist. I enjoyed working in a team and interacting with my coworkers. unfortunately, I had to leave their employment because of a discrepancy in my work hours."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work and has its perks for working there. The meetings are always knowledgeable and fun to be at. Walmart is a great place overall.
good,It was a good place to work. They really cared about there  employees. The only  thing I didn't like was the late hours. the people where friendly and courteous to each other.
good,"Go to work on time, stay to yourself, listen to instructions and always come to work ready to work. Be a team player, always ask questions when you are not sure."
good,Great Horus very flexible  scedhile. managers were compliant. employees got along well. many benefits as well as understanding. no problems with paying and salary.
good,My overall work experience was ok I guess. It had its good days and bad days. some days were more relaxed then you had your days where it was hectic. I jus didn't like that they managers and department managers could never be on the same page ever. One manager would tell you to do this and here comes another manager and they would tell you to do something else.
good,Pay was horrible . Hours were inconsistent. Have you get off st 10-11 at night and come back in at 6am.  Forget about breaks. Customers were typically fine.
good,"A good job for someone in their twenties, they promote from within, different areas to train in, they have good benefits if your full time, still.. its walmart so your going to have cons"
good,Good productive place to work. Pays for the work you do. Has a lot of positive people! Also has a lot of positions for those who want to learn new things if another position is not working for you.
good,"Not a bad place.But definitely can be stressful.Pay is not bad,but could be better.Most managers are decent people.Most other fellow associate's aren't too bad.Common sense does help."
good,Walmart is a revolving door. Not many employees make it a year. Over all Walmart has been a good start for me to get back into the work force. B- would be a grade I could give
good,Walmart DC is an alright place to work but expect hard work and fast paced work as a orderfiller your timed and required to work faster and harder then the day before with an expectation of meeting that 100% Mark
good,Good place to work management was very good and got plenty of hours I met a lot of different people and was able to help people the hardest part was dealing with the heat other then that it was a good place to work
good,"reasources available as company is big, however lots of pressure from head office and also micromanaging. lots of locations so easy to find shifts in other stores"
good,If you like to work. Take care of customers needs.  Strive for excellence in all you do you have opportunity for advancement.  But as with any company sometimes friendships get in the way of fairness.  And they are not gracious with people who have to get to another job.
good,"I worked the night shift as I had another job during the day.  That's when most people do their shopping, so my time went by fairly quickly.  Wal-Mart is a well known company, so everyone goes there to shop.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers at times; however, the most enjoyable was how quickly your day went.  Your first few days are basically training on a computer in the back, and then you get hands on training as well, which was helpful."
good,"I enjoyed working here until I felt that I was being singled out by my manager. Also, they do not offer overtime. They are an equal opportunity employer though and if you do not mind working very hard for decent pay then work here."
good,"En el poco tiempo que estuve fue un buen trabajo, pero me sali porque se me ofrecio un mejor trabajo lo que me molesto fue la actitud de la que era mi jefa porque me amenazo que no volveria a ser contratado por alguna tienda de walmart de nuevo a lo que conteste que no habia ningun problema."
good,Decent place to work. Hours and pay were pretty good. Management was friendly for the most part. Hours were fairly flexible. Coworkers were also friendly.
good,"Fast paced, and stressful, but good pay. You definitely son't feel important here, just another worker bee That management couldn't care less for. It was only my second job and i was told i was hired on for full-time, but then I was let go with all of the temporaries on new years day. I decided not to fight in and just found a new job with less stress."
good,"A place where you have to me on the move, making sure everything is stocked and in place, tags are on the merchandise and be able to assist clients with questions and fining things."
good,"Every walmart manager I've met plays favorites. Make sure you are the favorite. Do that and show up to worth and you'll be just fine. Oh, and don't do drugs."
good,This job was okay but could be better. Management was poor and played favorites. They make you do more then what you are paid to do. They make you work overtime but don’t get paid for it.
good,Walmart shifted from being a grreat inclusive company about working together to a company driven by executing directives. I worked with some of the best leaders. There are a lot of great people in this company and they are leaving. You were inspired by a great meeting and then reality set in when you went back to your desk.
good,Walmart is a great company to start your retail career. You will be a cog in the machine.  I still have a lot of friends that I made in Walmart.  Worked with some great ppl and most store managers honestly care and do the best they can with very limited resources.
good,I worked for Walmart for 17 years and overall it was a good ole boys company. I was not about to kiss butt to get somewhere in company. So it took me longer to advance than others.
good,"The environment was relaxed, but the pay was not enough to pay bills and they made it an issue if you were sick. You had to basically be dying if you needed a sick day."
good,Went in last Friday and worked until lunch then was fired at 1pm because they said they are over budget. If I was gonna get fired why even let me work at all.
good,"I would arrive at work at least 15 minutes early to put my things in my locker, put lunch in break room and be ready to clock in.,"
good,"This was my first real job as young adult, I enjoyed working there at night. It wasn't as busy during the day. I would recommend family and friends to work there."
good,The job was normally doing the same thing as you did the day before. There was no differences and what you were doing was very boring and repetitive. There would be days were all I would do is move products forward and on the right spot on the shelf.
good,"Many days I leave work feeling unappreciated because management seems so disconnected, Other days I love my job & what I have the opportunity to do. I think it all depends upon if you are liked or not. I hate to say it but I observe more than I would like to see."
good,I work the fitting room area. Assist the customer when need as will as putting out products. I sometimes assist with the jewelry dept. That team work to getting the job done is very important. When you are short handed the job can be a little hard to do. The enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers.
good,Never enough help front end manager does not check in or store manager bother to see how our schedule is going to be for the day. They don't bother to see if we have enough cashier's or to see how many call in's we have. There were several times when i was threaten that i need to get several things done before i went home for the day or i was going to be held accountable for it. So basically i was threaten.
good,"started off in shipping and receiving then transferred over to automotive and it paid a little more and I've always enjoyed working on cars , so it was a positive work environment for me."
good,"Walmart was a pretty cool job. My main task was to stock shelves, help customers find what they're looking, and answer any questions. The staff was great and communication was also great."
good,Great place to start as a first career.  Training was offered on site with CBL's.  Managers were very open and welcoming.  Schedules were flexible and management was willing to work around any conflicting events.
good,"When working in a team with varied ages/experience, not everyone has the same work ethic. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean anything.  The harder you work, the more is expected. It can be a good thing, it pushes people to do their best, but also allows those who slack to get away with it."
good,It was a good working environment and fast paced they are very understanding and will work with you if you need anything at all. They will sit down and listen to you if you have a problem and they will try to help fix it.
good,It could get very stressful with no coverage most of the time . You had to do the work of 10 people when there was no coverage . Sometimes it was a wonderful place to work
good,"Working in all types of weather conditions, dealing with not so pleasant customers, inadequate tools and equipment and lack of recognition made it hard to be completely fulfilled and happy with the hourly pay."
good,Good place to work if they gave you enough hours. Managers are always switched from department to another after so many months so you never have the same manager. Not sure if there is more for me to say. But they should at least give people more hours especially if they're willing to work.
good,The environment was fast paced. Opportunity for growth and development. Very customer focused with sales goals.  have to make decisions fast and be open to change.
good,never had a problem out of nothing or no one. A very good work experience. I would work here again if I can to be honest. I'm bout to fill out the app right now
good,A typical day at Walmart was outlined at the beginning of the day.  I learned about communicating with other company employees for optimal performance.  My manager was encouraging to different work styles & open to my schedule.
good,It was many years since I worked here. but was a job when a single parent. barely paid the bills.. but managed worked while I was in school and son was asleep when I worked overnight.
good,It was too fast paced for me.  I learned how to stock.  I was a small person and it was hard to do the stocking.  Unhappy workforce.  The hardest part of the job was how fast paced everything was and it was hard to keep up.  I really didn't enjoy the job.
good,"I have been at my company for three years now and have learned a lot from working with some amazing salespeople.  However, I am starting to feel like I need some new challenges."
good,They did not care overall. The manager sucked. I worked for 5 hours and the manager wanted me to work for another employee. But overall the employees were nice with the costomers.
good,Great pay. Crazy workload. You work a lot of hours and the volume is very intense. Not an easy job by any means. Extremely physical and work conditions vary according to weather. The warehouse is not heated well and is not cooled.
good,Walmart is a productive and customer service oriented place to work. Typical day at Walmart consisted of prepping and completing orders in compliance to customers request.
good,"first we gather up carts for the truck. we set up everything unload the truck and go to break. Then we work for two hours, go on an 1 hour lunch break and then return to work. We get three breaks. The job sometimes is only as hard as you make it."
good,Trucks were never done on time due to low employment on afternoon  unloading team. Some managers looked out for themselves while others helped out more than usual.
good,Get ready for a day full of different challenges such as unhappy and demanding customers / staff. Keeping a smile on your face really helps getting threw the day. The in-scene and out-scene is a method that prevent unnecessary  conflict.
good,Its a good job to have until you find something better... not bad if it is the only thing hiring for the pay its  not that bad.... hard to move up ..... favoritism plays a big part in moving up at walmart
good,"My experience at Walmart was ok at first and then they got very demanding and adding more responsibility, yelled at you and threatened your jog if you didn't get everything done in the 8 hours you worked."
good,Has taken care of me for many years but the ever changing way they do business seems to cater towards the younger generation. Understanding that Walmart is an ever evolving company and in order to progress it has to make difficult business decisions at times therefore affecting many existing associates both current and former
good,"El salario era muy bajo y exigente en lo laboral, horario extra forsosa"
good,I Learned a lot working here and thoroughly I enjoyed working with the customers as well as my co-workers. Walmart was a very faced paced environment which that I loved.
good,company is a great place to work but some of its policies that it was founded for no longer stand for what they used to but if you need a job you can usually get a job.
good,Friendly work environment. Fast paced so the time goes by quickly. Low pay. Resume booster. Good for your first job. Try to get a full time position because they try to get you as a part time employee and cut corners having to provide you with benefits.
good,"For the amount of money made, the work done is worth it. Worst downfall is management. Being talked down to on a daily basis and having management play a popularity game is very unprofessional. Was threatened with a write up for taking my only 15 minute break of the day."
good,They are not a bad company to work for but their polices could use some work. There is no communication between managers. If you are a new hire be prepared for a lot of grunt work.
good,"Working at Walmart was stressful. No one is ever happy, they constantly change the way you're supposed to close the deli, and constanly move things when things were fine the way they were before. And employees do not work as a team unless you're on closing shift."
good,"I learned a lot from Walmart they allowed me to gain customer service skills, backroom skills, stock skills, certification for electric pallet jack & scissor lift."
good,"I am a fast learner, and like challenges,. Get along with everyone I work with. Willing to go extra mile for customers. Have good customer service. Will help when I can."
good,"I can't really speak for all locations but I didn't mind the one I worked at. If it weren't for shoulder issues preventing me from being able handle the repetitive movement from scanning, I would have stayed."
good,"Super awesome amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!n It was soooo fun the people were soooo welcoming and i would work there again, just as much as I like shopping there. YAY."
good,i dont have much to say it is a good place to start at just like mcdonalds pushing carts isnt the only thing you do in the winter you shovel snow lay salt. there is many other jobs at walmart
good,"its a okay job, its like a big high school the management is not the best. but its a good job to get by with definitely. will get 40+ hrs . some management is understandable and will work with you. its not a bad job just stay to yourself."
good,Walmart has a wide variety of clients that visit daily so this job provides you an excellent opportunity to improve your people skills regardless of your department.
good,this was one of my favorite band help make people days go smoothier ecause I love to meet people everyday I was 26 years old and wanted something different
good,My job experience at Walmart was good. During the holidays are extremely stressful but we succeeded. I would be happy to work at Walmart again. I would recommend to my friends to work there.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart, as an over night stocker in the grocery department. I would have to stock anywhere from 2-4 aisles nightly, and some times it was easier than other nights, to finish in the time allowed. "
good,"walmart is walmart the employees act like normal customers just with their name showing, managment needs some work. and no matter what time of day you call personal is never there."
good,"I enjoyed my experience as a Walmart employee because it allowed me to connect with, and help many people. I also increased my business skills there by consistently influencing Walmart Credit Card sign ups and WCCA processing."
good,"This is a good place to work if you need to make a little extra money for the holidays.  The employees are always kind to each other, the hardest part of the job is working nights and weekends and constantly being on your feet."
good,"Sometimes it can be a bit much but if the work load is fairly regulated, then it's a pretty good job. I would recommend a person to work a t a good walmart that has good management!"
good,"Walmart is a very friendly environment, Management could use a little improvement however Walmart is not as bad as people make it seem. Also they could improve on taking employees opinions on the work place"
good,Each day I had my regulars who loved coming in to see me. Some days I would have cranky customers but handled them with politeness. Management was not the best.
good,"The best part of working in the pharmacy is helping patients. The hardest part of the job is the hours that you have to work, not being able to have a set schedule with a small child and the company also not willing to work with you on your schedule."
good,it was a good place to work but not a very family-oriental  either. They work you for less pay. They give you less hours and pay. I dont like management they are tude
good,"i started the day with scrubbing the floor with  machine then  i had to use the buffing machine, then  sweeped the  floor i also had to striped wax off floor then apply the new wax ."
good,"I was a deli associate"
good,Basically just clean Walmart for 7 hours. When the main parts of the building are clean you can just take it slowly and clean slowly so you don't get bored.
good,"I have never been disappointed in anything I have gotten from them, even when they go through a third party to get something to deliver to me. They are just exceptional."
good,"I worked for WalMart a couple different times, in Viroqua and La Crosse. I worked in jewelry and vision center.  It could be stressful, you had to be careful what you said in the vision center, had to comply with the HIPAA privacy policy, keep information confidential."
good,No one never came work we was always Short staff we couldn't finish our work wasn't no team effort at all co workers all fighting with one another horrible experience
good,"I appreciate the company for giving me the chance to learn the management aspect of the business, but they have completely turned me off to working in retail.  I will never work in retail again."
good,Not the best place to work but definitely has its pros. Some of the management seems to care little for what the workers want. But for the most part they are caring and understanding. But progress will never happen.
good,I made some good friends at Walmart in the little time I was there but most of the people I knew there were really good people they even though I barely knew them they made me feel like I was part of there group already
good,The best part about working here is the people you meet. Walmart employees become like family to you. The management team is very poor at the location I worked. The pay is okay.
good,i always made sure i would get my job done.  no matter what.  was closely watched by management after collapsing on the job in 2008.  management always had my back.
good,Working at the company is really good when everyone is understanding and work together rather than being bias. I’ve learned a lot of things at this company that could possible lead me to other job opportunities.
good,"Wasn't too understanding about my trade schooling. Can't say much more than that. Work was easy, manager was not. Co-workers were interesting though. Had one that wanted to fight me because I wasn't bringing enough baskets in at once. Hope he's okay."
good,"Its WalMart  There is not much to say.  Jobs catered to minimum wage.  They do promote from within and can be a nice place to work however, management is hit or miss.  Some good some bad."
good,"I started as a cashier, It was fun talking to the customers. I received praise for quick and accurate check out but also in how I handled occasional issues, wrapped and bagged fragile items. I kept things neat. A few months later I was moved to Customer Service. this involved knowing the returns procedure and what was and was not acceptable (although we did have a Manager that would okay ANY kind of return because she hated conflict). Then I became a Department Manager for Ladies Accessories which was 5 tiny departments rolled into one. That was nice. I had a good crew under me and I treated them fairly. I taught the new people how to do product displays, use the TelZon price gun (its a hand held computer now), If you are a hard worker, and you have a good store with a good manager, you can do very well. "
good,Good place to work and meet new people and friends. The pay is also decent. The managers are friendly and will work with you to help you succeed in your position.
good,"Helped with customer service and checked customers out when they was through with shopping, Management was very friendly and co workers helped each other out when needed"
good,It was good learning experience. I enjoy working with people and helping people. This job allowed me to do both. I enjoy staying busy and multitasking makes for a great work environment.
good,Overall it was a good job. During the holiday seasons it does get extremely busy and chaotic in the store. It can be very physical demanding and exhausting standing in one spot all day and the repetitive movement can be exhausting.
good,"i learned about communication skills and organized skill, learned about multitasking. the hardest part of the job is making sure not taking people tips no matter what. but at the end of the experience i met good people and i have experienced customer service."
good,Fast paced work environment.  Be ready to work once you clock in until it's time to clock out. Work hard to get noticed by upper management if trying to move up in the company
good,"I loved working for walmart, although the managers expected too much while giving us unreasonable time restrictions. For the fresh department, they need a dishwasher, and they need more cameras."
good,On average I had to work over my availability and I had school at the time and they would schedule me right after school when I told them not to multiple times.
good,They didn’t have enough workers to cover each department . I feel that Walmart is to cheap to hire enough workers. They would have to pull from other departments to cover other departments
good,This is a great place to work. The managers are amazing and are very understanding and willing to work with you for any problems you might have. And will always work with you
good,"Walmart's are different at different locations. It just happened that I had one that was pulling me away from my job before I ever was able to finish each night to get buggies in or unload trucks each night for about a month. My manager started asking me why this and this wasn't done and I told her. Instead, I got written up for it. The whole open door policy isn't that helpful as I had went to the manager over her a week before all this discussing what was happening. I don't care to help in other areas when needed, but other people have jobs to do also. Management never understood that apparently."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consist of greeting customers, operating a cash register and cash handling skills. The workplace atmosphere was busy and quick-paced. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time and being laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was having first choice to purchase on items that came into the store."
good,"go in and count my register. check out and bag groceries of each and every customer. call a manager if needed and try to get each customer out as quickly as possible. Management was good, but when I worked was sometimes slow and not understanding. Hardest part of the job was bagging, and most enjoyable was that since it was high paced the day went by pretty fast"
good,the people are nice. the work is not hard. the pay is not great but decent. if you work there dont just expect to sit around and get paid for it. you have to be a team player.
good,"I left mostly because I was exhausted from the twelve hour shifts. I enjoyed my work and most of my coworkers, even if I didn't particularly get on well with my manager and didn't like my hours."
good,just average no real complaints except the wal mart I was working at had sub standard equipment. they were cheap in that regard. I worked grave yard so it was slow pace
good,"Was a awesome department I worked in garden , loved the co-workers and department manager. VERY fast paced work when it got busy , sometimes slow not often. Team oriented"
good,"For me personally, it was okay. There were some rules that they had that I thought were unfair to the employees but everyone is different with how they see things."
good,I stocked shelves at night. It easily got to be repetitive and dull. i left due to lack of reliable transportation. I loved working overnight thought.
good,"For this job you have to respect the schedule and be on time, the breaks are short and the schedule are flexible, but you can work in different departments."
good,"I enjoyed being a greeter. Customers were friendly. I would tag returns. If the alarm went off, we were responsible for checking receipts and logging info into a book. he"
good,"Scanning and bagging customers purchases, handling cash, and giving back money. management was cut-throat. They talk bad about their employees. It was alright at times."
good,Enjoyed working there because of customers but management was never there to help in a timely manner. Had waited 30 minutes one night just for management to walk 20 feet over to my register. They were all talking together having a good time while I collected a line waiting for assistance.
good,Can be a fun place to work but management needs work you can move up to higher position if you work at it but trying to live up to management expectations can be the hardies part of the Job.
good,Management  is okay. Work hours are okay. Employees are okay. Overtime no. A lot of heavy lifting. Discounts after a few months. Can relocate. Far paying rate.
good,"Management is misguided and it's hard to get anything done as they have unreasonable goals for the day. They will expect you to do tasks as move an entire aisle in less than an hour, or unload an entire truck worth of stock in two hours. These are only a few examples but it is still quite bad."
good,typical day starts at 400 pm. put the rollars into place set the area up with skids to unload products. unload truck by hand one box at a time place product on skids and tahe to proper area on the shoping floor
good,"Too many bosses, not enough associates. We worked with a skeleton crew but were exoected to get so much accomplished. Its nearly impossible. "
good,"The company wants employees to produce numbers too high for the staffing. The management for the department I worked in was great, but corporate just set the bar too high"
good,Walmart is a very fast paced enviroment. Alot of customers sometime from the begining to the end of your shift. Also alot of cleaning and reatocking shelves.
good,"The Walmart bakery is a good starting place for people to explore about the career. You can easily learn about decorating cakes, writing with icing, simple piping skills, and bread/ doughnut production. Good quiet job if looking for part time."
good,its's stressful and management is usually bad but there are a few good eggs. pay is good which is why a lot of people stay. if you work overnight there usually isn't a lot of customers so it's good for people who have social anxiety.
good,Walmart is a good place to work at if u can handle the managers and the types of employee. They expect you to sork as fast as u can to get what you need done but you will get written up if you dont.
good,"Walmart as a whole is a great opportunity for an individual's first job. A great way to get used to a taste of the civilian world, and having to  know what adult life is like."
good,Lot's of movement and lot's of communication. Their was always communication within the employees and managers. Most enjoyable part of the job lunch time.
good,"Working here was alright, co workers were mostly decent as well as most management. They had decent break times but the pay was horrible when I worked there"
good,Working at Walmart is an good place to work at But the mangers aren’t good to work with . I would work at Walmart again but with different Management .
good,"retail oriented, sometime stressful, often odd customers who can demand much while paying little for it. Prepare to give refunds for anyone who asks, and answer to some who know nothing about your job"
good,"Good place to work but most of the time hours/management sucked.You just have to try to put up with them but after a while you will hate it, But your first couple months should be fine."
good,Very easy job all I did was stock the isles and bring pallets of merchandise on and off the floor . Management was happy with my work I was always trying to learn more.
good,I enjoyed my time at walmart because of my time with the staff.The management made it difficult to accomplish our daily tasks due to poor decision making.
good,"My experience here was abysmal. Promotions don't come along quite often, They'll hire just to hire and see which fits, i worked in the same position for a year and a half and that's what pushed me away."
good,There were always different daily duties given to me that helped me learn different things about the department that I was working in. It was very exciting to me as I love learning new things. The thing I enjoyed most was learning how to cut different types of meat. I was also excited about being able to provide the customers with an excellent shopping experience by being there to answer any questions they may have had and providing them with my services.
good,The management is not good. The part time hours are very minimal if hours get cut. If not then the hours are too long. There seems to be no in-between. Customers ask where items are even though the department may be in a completely different area.
good,"I spent all day outside picking up garbage, collecting carts and helping customers load their cars. The hours were crazy and fluctuated. Not for everyone"
good,Walmart is a good nice place although I couldn't see myself working there long period of time. Its about picks and chooses not about your work ethic. Not a equal work place.
good,In the area of 6 months I had to take 2 seperate pay cuts that had nothing to do with my job productivity I am a very hard worker and I've never felt appreciated once in five years
good,"Theres always something that needs to be done. Management Im not to happy about there is a lot of them that do not help out but they rather sit in the office and ask you to do things that does not even involve with your job title but I do it any way because I like to stay busy I enjoy my coworkers. the hardest part about ""my job"" would be complaining to management and nothing being done about the issue they just sweep it under the rug and let things go because they don't want to deal with it`"
good,It’s not the best but I have managed with it. Just want something different and something I would enjoy doing instead of standing in one spot for 8 hours.
good,"Night shifts are more demanding."
good,"It's the standard retail experience. If you have ever worked retail it's about the same as any other store, less politics, some fun people who are usually very helpful."
good,easy job duties but customers were rude and demanding. most managers were helpful but others would just let you drown in a line of customers without hopping on a register to help
good,walmart was an okay place to work as far as hours go job wise it was easy overall customers make the job stressful at times but the pay is reasonable and the other employees aren't that awful
good,They keep hiring more cashiers so the rest of us are getting less hours. Sometimes I am only getting to work one day a week and that is definitely not enough to live on. They used to give me a lot of hours and now they are cutting back and cutting many workers' hours.
good,Busy store but kept time going by. Always was busy. Managment needs to work together in helping some employees. They need to think of how many departments one person does but at this current moment I think things have got better from what I heard from current employees now
good,Fast paced and stressful not enough payroll to get done what needed to be done. Would be shifted  to work all over the place and expected to have your own department up to par.
good,it was a okay workplace but the drama pretty much wasn't the greatest to work with. it was not as great as i thought it would be with employers but i still did what was needed of me to do there.
good,The work wasn't hard and the pay wasn't bad for overnight shift. The management were working along with us so it was a good environment to work in. Great team.
good,"You will always remain busy in this workplace. You learn something new everyday along side co-workers and management. Overall, this job is very fundamental."
good,Typical work day meeting on the day. What I learned was really stuff i already knew. Management some where good some not. The culture of the place is alot of different things going on at once. The hardest part was the holidays. The most enjoyable part was being able to go sit down and cool off.
good,Management is poor and uncaring. I once requested my birthday off 3 months in advance and they denied it regardless of me letting them know I would be out of state. They also penalize you for being sick.
good,"My co-workers were always fun to be around and always made the late shift seem fun, whenever I had to work it. Some managers were willing to show you what needed to be done and how it needed to be done, some did not and just told you what to do and then have a chiding conversation with you on what you did wrong as if it was 110% your fault. Some managers never took the blame for something and made sure higher up managers knew it was the associates. Don't get me wrong some did actually take blame in what was their fault, they stood up to the plate as a manager should but not all. "
good,"i cleaned classrooms everyday on a typical day at work, i learned that cleaning is fun to do, making friends is easy, my manager was super nice and sweet, the hardest part was moving the stoves back into the classrooms. the fun part was every Friday where my boss would just sit and talk with us"
good,"Mala empresa no se preocupa por los empleados, presión no tienes buen sueldo,"
good,es sumamente agradable pero el rol de tiempos se complica por los horarios
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with different customers through out the day and being able to satisfy a customers need,as well as growing with my surrounding associates."
good,"Walmart was my first job, it gave me the opportunity to improve my social skills as well as teach me how to manage transactions. Although it was rather fast paced, I was able to continue being productive. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with incredibly busy hours of the day."
good,I've worked for walmart 15 years.I transfered from c.a. to richmond.I worked auto care center for 13 years and produce for 2 years.I learned alot from the company.they have good benifits if you take advantage of them.I would reccomend the company for those who seek employment.
good,the job for me atleast  was pretty tame of course i had days that were more difficult than others ut on average i never felt to overwhelmed i would not mind working there again
good,"Workplace Culture team oriented, reward driven, customer centered."
good,Very well trained in my field. Advancement within the company is highly encouraged. Work place culture is somewhat followed by individual management. Loved working with people.
good,My walmart experience was helpful in elevating my work experience. Assisting the customers allowed me to gain the experience of knowing how to deal with a variety of different people. I as well gained experience in receiving and unloading.
good,buen ambiente laboral mucho trabajo en equipo buen trato al cliente
good,"When I worked at Wal-Mart  I worked on the evening shift , since I      worked another job during day. So I came in 3:00, went to my department, fabric; I would relieve morning employees for breaks, I     would start waiting on customers putting merchandise away, wait  on customers from other departments"
good,"Walmart is a pretty fun job. I love to work, so i love getting the mot hours i can! It is not for everyone though, you do have to talk, checkout, and help customers"
good,"The first time I worked at Walmart was around 18 years ago (for 5 years) and the second time only for a few weeks. I didn't like the culture not very friendly(second time around). When hired on, I said that I wanted to be a Customer Service Manager what I had been previously, but that wasn't going to happen..."
good,It was a good college/starter job and actually taught me a lot.Very glad i worked here but never will again. Taught me how to deal with all types of customers. S
good,You get what you expect coming to work for wal-mart.  They are an alright place to apply if youre not too picky on your position and income and just in need of money in your pocket.
good,Great people to work with. However dealing with management can become a hassle in order to get day to day jobs and tasks completed. Not overly recommended for a career
good,"I work as a cashier, For that you have to be very patience and have a good actitud because you will find out a lot of different people. "
good,Typically worked 8 to 12 hours per day. Respect for the individual is the company mission and we attempted to do that with every individual. Hardest part of the job was balancing management duties with being a staff pharmacist. Most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with my staff and getting to know all the customers personally.
good,"I enjoyed my customers. And assisting them. I enjoyed the challenges of becoming a speedy cashier. I would love when I had the biggest orders to ring up, just to see how fast I could get my lines to be shorten faster."
good,very fast and stressful..trying to keep up with management time schedule''enjoy the people co workers..learn how the system work and how to be more efficient..
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, lots of room to grow and excell within the company. Only thing that needs changing is some department heads and attitudes."
good,Walmart is a ok place has its pro and cons the pay is ok and the benefits r ok they never seem to have enough help sometimes man ferment is not as good as they should be
good,"i would like to work for Walmart again because of the benefits are great you can pull  from your 401k at any time, and invites in stock. steady work was a plus to"
good,"packing freight to send to stores. The hardest part of the job was the childishness of some employees, the best part was the fast paced hard work and good pay."
good,"I would definitely love to work @ walmart again. And woould gladly recommend it to a friend or family. My over all experience there was great. All the fun and exciting people  got to work with, and not mention the discounts. My kids loved me working there. It made them happy to see me home in the evenings, and @ night. Walmart worked really well with me."
good,"Pay was decent, easy but physical jobs depending on your role. Must be able to multitask, ad preform multiple duties in the same day. Short breaks, friendly co-workers but also not so great ones too. revolving door of employees, but some good ones that hang around."
good,"Walmart can be a good job to have and is really easy. The typical day at walmart is chilled, quick paced, and enjoyable really. The only problem is the management and the schedule making. Even if you're full-time, you're not guaranteed full-time hours. Management doesn't really help either when it comes to that."
good,Okay if your look for a little extra money for bills   managers can be rude.  If your a person that over look manager being rude you can work there.  I was temporary so I really did matter
good,"great experience , benefits were good, management was poor at time of my employment. overall great job worked produce met  many good people. would recommend to others."
good,"Stocking freight all day"
good,"Walmart likes to work you and not pay you for that work. Once you start you are wearing all hats, janitor, cashier, courtesy clerk, greeter, parking lot attendant...so glad I was not part of the regular store. It's a ""here today gone tomorrow"" type company due to the turnover rate. I can not speak for all Walmart locations, and I have worked several different locations, most are so unprofessional and the clientele is ghetto. Walmart should stop running smaller companies away and share the wealth. I learned that increasing your education is a must in this world and that is a great thing that Walmart will assist you with. They also offer free drug and alcohol counseling, which I thought was very nice of them, considering they drive people to do what they do. I'm just saying"
good,A typical day at the job is not enough coverage. What i come to learn is how to have management control.The hardest part of the job is No communication and no one is ever on the same page.
good,The best part of working for walmart pharmacy was they have a dedicated pharmacy cashier. They close for lunch breaks. Employees get a discount on some GM and produce items
good,"Wal-Mart's environment is very fast paced and can be stressful, especially for people that are dyslexic. I hope that management will take in to consideration for the more challenged employees."
good,"It was alright the employees were pretty lazy though, had to pick up their slack.Manager was nice and very friendly. Pay was good but rather have something paid higher."
good,Very low pay.. Management always calling you in on your days off.. Discount was not worth the time or money.. Very little days to call out sick even in emergencys
good,"employees are not seen the same as they once were we are now replaceable. Many rewards were taken from us, company acknowledgment of hard workers does not occurring as they once did."
good,"Doing new things, meeting new people, and just the overall fact and challenging yourself to try new things. Just have to do it to believe me I guess. Wasn't the worst job in the world."
good,"I like working doing the time that i worked at Walmart &Co,they had good benefits it was a good place to work everybody had there own assignment to work ."
good,"lots of standing, depending on the store customers are either thrilled to see you or hate your guts. Managers other then your own like to tell you what to do even if you have been instructed other wise(Do as your boss or the store manager says). try to work mornings when its calm.  be aware that doing your job may include denying a customers request and that will upset them, if they ask to see a manger dont get upset just got get them, they will handle it."
good,"you have to love what you do at work because if you don't then your job will not be a happy place.I mine come on do you want to go to work everyday of your life to work in a place where every day people are not happy,all they do is nag and wine and complain about everything.Oh no i can't do that i need some happy in my life if i can't have that then i can't work for that company,not for me. I come from a dark place in my life and i will never let anyone take me there ever again."
good,It is a great stepping stone to other jobs. I learned a lot of valuable skills and how to work customer service over the years. Staff members are appreciated.
good,"Une expérience enrichissante dans l'ensemble, mais aussi épuisant."
good,if you love being drilled this is the place too work and lose a lot of wait when they first put you too work they don't explain anything they just throw you on the floor butt that's how you learn how too work..so I did  like everything about Wal-MART because they made me a strong person and for that I am proud of who I am today.
good,Learned how to multi-task and adapt to work demands through my years with Wal-Mart. Showing hard work ethic and willingness to advance was given many opportunities in various areas of the retail environment
good,"had a lot of flexibility in schedule  , good benefits package   , worked"
good,It was good  was dirty  and greasy didn’t like  that the other records were nice it has been ok I liked the people I worked with  they helped me out.a lot it was a good place to work
good,"Fast pace and busy.  Working for retail is always busy especially during certain times of the year.  Management would come and go, so it would very.  Some good managers and some not so go but overall it was an okay place to work for."
good,"You have to work on the holidays, it is hard for an hourly paid associate to get full time status, they keep most of their employees at a part time status so they save on benefits and on pay roll"
good,For the most part it was a good experience no horseplay environment always lifting and stocking supervisors were mostly on point so there were no time for slip-ups
good,"No es malo trabajar ahí, solo que si es un poco cansado."
good,It was good for awhile but then as I work there long to be Honest the job seem like it would get worse. Less and less people cared and it was frustrating but i mean it could have been worse.
good,I was in the deli did some bakery work the managers stole money money and did not train you.You are thrown in a department where other employees train you off there experience. You are not pointed if you was sick and admitted in the hospital with a excuse but if your mother father child was sick you would get a point i was sick with a health issue and was sick at work and was pointed for leaving early it was unfair I worked hard over a year and a half for them.
good,"Subes rápido de puesto, muy buena empresa, la recomiendo."
good,"Walmart is a company that gives great prices at their stores. Walmart distribution is not a good company to work for. They pay well but the building is hot, muggy and ridiculous. After hired, they laid off almost everyone they had hired the month before, they have a habit of this. If there is low volume, you're new, then you'll be gone soon. Luckily I left because of the terrible work conditions about two weeks before."
good,walmart can be great if you follow requirements and job titled duties. they are a family oriented business but have strict rules for extended families.
good,"If you are not freindly are pateince you don't belong here.You have to have all the above to work here .They don""t allow overtime is the only pproblem"
good,As long as you did your job properly and followed all safety guideline you always knew you had job security with Walmart. The employees were easy to get along with and the hours were fair I just didn't agree with the pay rate
good,I really enjoyed doing the remodel at walmart. would have loved to go and remodel another walmart but the opportunity wasn't there. would like to have stayed on after the remodel but they didn't have any full time openings and I drove over and hour one way to work so part time wasn't feasible.
good,"You went in you stocked the shelves, kept the area neat and clean helped customers . If they got busy would might also end up on a register helping ring up the customers."
good,"Honestly it really depends on the stores location, customer base and management team. All these can influence your associate experience. If you can keep calm and do what your tasked you will ultimately be fine."
good,"I use to love working for Walmart until they took the fun out of working. I use to be motivated to work but good things like that dont last. When they changed our paid vacation days to having to accumulate time to use for holidays is what pushed me to try to change careers, plus you cant use the time you accumulated for sick time on yourself,  someone in your family have to be sick in order for you to be able to use sick time so if I'm sick and cant make it, I can't get paid for the sick time I accumulate.  When they got off track with Sam Walton's ways that's where they lost my motivation to work hard for them point blank."
good,I had many opportunities to learn New things at this job and got many raises with this job. Fun environment to work in and great staff for the most part.
good,"I worked in different areas of the store courtesy desk, hardware, shoes, stocking and setting isles. I liked the steady work just couldnt get enough hours for me."
good,salaire presque minimum et beaucoup de changement partout
good,"stock "
good,Walmart is a good place to shop at or work at if your a manager. but in the auto tech part you got over worked under paid and treated poorly. I would never go work for Walmart again.
good,"A constant ongoing work capacity of fast and efficient. Safety is first , could be a really dangerous place to work, always be careful anything can happen."
good,"good place for entry level work. there is room for advancement within hourly supervisor roles. benefits are good. decent attendance policy, after you have worked there 6 months, you get a discount card for 10% off"
good,"Not the greatest company to work for. Claims to be family and employee oriented but they're not. Also doesn't provide full time in entry level positions (cashier, etc) . Pays state minimum. No benefits."
good,A lot of freedom for creativity and ownership of work.  Great group of people to work with from the bottom to the top.  Fast paced and always very busy.
good,"Venta al cliente "
good,Learned the different types of customer moods and how to maintain positive and help correct situations in a timely matter. My employees we are a team we helped each other out and communicate each day. The management it was hard when they not on the same page when we ask certain situation.
good,"great working with people on the sales floor and helping customers find what they needed and keeping the floor and cooler clean."
good,It was fast paced due to customers. Hectic during holidays. You deal with some rude employees and a lot of customers. Hours where never the same every week
good,"It has been years since I have worked at WM, but I can say I was treated fairly and the pay structure was different.  I appreciated my time there and the people that helped train me"
good,The pay and hours were not good. Hard to raise a family on the pay and the hours as well. Very fast paced. The management up top could never be pleased.
good,just work what you can plus don't try to be a fixer put out what you can do do do do more more more but you got to have a plan when you started there don't
good,It’s a good start out job for those who are looking to get into the retail market. Start the day with down sizing your pallet of merchandise and work it to its proper place. All the while learning how to stock read labels work the pallet jack unload the work trucks. The management was amazing overnight kept the culture with a great attitude. Hardest part of the job not knowing your merchandise as the most enjoyable part would be helping customers locate the merchandise they desire.
good,"Not a good place to work if you have small children, or sick family members. I would go back if I could. I loved being in Asset protection. now that job was fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, because I liked the work and the people I worked. That being said it was hard to get ahead unless you were one of the favorite ones. no matter how hard you worked."
good,The pay is good but if you live very far off from a store expect to pay out the pocket for gas but you can move out to your store if you can find descent housing
good,Ok place to work. Life work balance is a joke. Job duties change without any notice it happens immediately after they tell you your position will include more responsibilities.
good,"days are steady"
good,I had a good team here they did me good they let me do a little of everything i had 2 years experience doing this. this was a great company to work for just moved back home and had to for my boy was getting born in a saver environment and closer to my family.
good,Both the people I worked with and some of the customers made you fell like family. There was never a boarding moment when at work. Though the management could learn a better way tho talk to and handle employees
good,My day at work. i start my seeing what kind of sandwichs are out. I then start to make all the stuff that is out. In my years with walmart i have work around alot of different kind of people. I  have made alot of friends.
good,Come Set the backroom up. meaning lay pallets down put the line in the truck. then ask your supervisor  is it ok to start unloading the truck.after that proceed to putting boxes on the line
good,This company values it’s associates it goes above and beyond for them they care about the employees and their families.... 😂 I would pick this company to work for hands down
good,"Walmart was my college job, I enjoyed the tasking, and interacting with customers in specific departments.  There were a lot of supervisory roles that made it hard.  Too many people telling too little people what to do."
good,I enjoyed working in electronics. I enjoyed the job overall but it was time for a change since I was there for a few years. I got along with the coworkers and I enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,My time at Wal Mart was short due to being a temp and relocating back home out of state. The work was tedious but tolerable it made the shift go by fast
good,"Walmarts a very good job , but can be difficult as to everyone wants to try to be better then you so its always competive. But Walmart is a very fast place and fast moving ! Great place"
good,it was not a bad place to work untill they cut my hour after being there for 2 years and gave them to some one else so when they did that i had to quit because they put me down as pt
good,"Decent place to work. Flexible schedule.  Decent pay, but still not enough for the work I do. Management is pretty good, my current manager is the best!"
good,"good customer service"
good,Hard place to work. Good pay. Fast paced. Hard on the body. Management in my department very nice. Hard on your body long hours and alot ot work. Very had on the family
good,"plenty of breaks"
good,Lo que mas me gusto fue como aprendí a sobrellevar la presión tanto del cliente como de la gerencia .
good,A typical day at work would be making sure the shelves are stocked and kept tidy while helping customers find everything they could possibly need. Walmart is a very good place to work.
good,Lamentablemente existen jefaturas antiguas sin liderazgo lo cual genera conflicto entre trabajadores
good,Its a decent way to start off a career and get experience. although they can do better at the training process. Its a good job to begin a starter career and gain pharmacy experience.
good,I liked my job and what i did it was fun working with different people because im a person that can get along with mostly every body co workers were a group of people that worked together as a team as well.
good,Often overworked due to limited associates or resources.  Management time treats their associates fairly but does not compliment nor motivate associates enough to indicate a job well done.
good,Can be interesting to work there  some people will work fast and be helpful some people won't they'll drag there feet and all the work to everybody else to complete
good,unloaded truck pushed freight clean up product on floor helped guest. was not impressed with the way they treated their employees. pay was not the best
good,The management now don't care about the customers.They have to many friends and family working together.When calling Asst.Mangers they don't come concerning a problems.
good,Make sure you go to work. Make sure you watch your temper. Call at least 8 hours before your shift if you cant go in so they can find a replacement. Just have fun.
good,"It's a decent workplace as long as you do your work without any slack. Some days are more stressful than others depending on management staff. Most coworkers are what makes the day go faster and better than most. Usually every quarter there is a decent bonus, but then again sometimes there isn't one."
good,Mostly decent place of work as long as managers listen and communicate with each other. I'm not going to list things that I see wrong simply because its IMO.
good,"Apply for a great work environment. Great job  enefits and more. I learned great team commradery , determination and teamwork skills to get me through life"
good,"this was a good job with lots of hours if you wanted them, but depending on what department you are in it can be a challenging job dealing with customers and other staff members."
good,Very successful company but has lost it's way by focuses on bottom line and disregarding the true customer experience and have created unhappy employees
good,"Managers never seemed to agree on a task. Some will use their management name to threaten some people. Quick pace. If kept busy, (most likely to happen) days will go by fast."
good,With working for Walmart and for 2 years and starting out as a regular associate I have come to realize that yes every job there is easy but it is the managers that make it difficult. They truly expect a lot from everyone and sometimes it’s just too much. I have worked in the deli and went up to the rank of a support manager which is one step below being an assistant manager and I must say while the pay is good the amount of stress I go under for the actual outcome just isn’t worth it in my opinion. I have seen managers pick and choose favorites all the time. Or see someone get targeted and when I have brought it up is like the upper management doesn’t care. All around I would call Walmart the sea world of retail.
good,helping and checking out customers as quickly and accurately as possible keeping your area cleaned and organized sometimes helping other departments when needed
good,I would work here again if it was or is possible. I am not sure about the kind of clients they are working for. All and all it was a good place to work.
good,"Walmart keeps changing with the times. Most of the older people cant deal with it. Walmart needs to slow down so the older people shop there. Staffing is always horrible every day of the week especially on the weekends. They never want to hire the people that are needed when their needed. The best part I like are the associates who you get to bond with and for the most part you like them and like working with them. "
good,"Met a lot of great people, and most coworkers were great. I learned a lot of things during the time i was there. It's a good place to start working if it's your first job."
good,Loved meeting new people. The people I worked with are really nice and understanding. It was a fast paced working environment with many levels to advance to.
good,"I used to go in and work and do my job, but I had to leave because my one manager was a monster. The power went to her head, she had favorites and treated work more like a high school than a place of business."
good,"As salaried management, I was treated really well and respected at one store.  When I was moved and told it was for career advancement, I was essentially placed at the bottom of the totem pole and had my access restricted and duties/responsibilities cut back.  Every store is different and every manager is different. If asked to go back working for a particular manager and store, I wouldn't hesitate to accept.  If asked to go back working for another store and manager, the answer would be no.  All Walmart's are different regardless of the word of mouth and culture they spread.  Its hit and miss for a new hire unfortunately."
good,"Walmart was always an ok place to work. Occasionally you will run into managers that will treat you like you are nothing, but thank God they only last about 6 months because they rotate around."
good,Changing policies from corporate with inconsistent compliance from management led to numerous knee-jerk changes instead of steady progression.  Thankfully middle management was able to support a fair number of positions but were unsuccessful at alleviating the issues overall.
good,there was a lot of drama circling around employees that i did not care for i believe that works stays at work and personal things stay that way its great to make friends at work but leave the drama for after not everyone needs to know
good,"Start from day one of job is training for three to five days with pay. after the training is the continues program build by the company for the new hire. while were doing that program with already engage to the actual job where all the stock are at the back of the store.  First we do some inventory before putting all the stock to the floor and filled the empty shelves for the new merchandise, What I've learned and observation is turn over process from the first shift to the second shift must be proper,  Management is very supportive, the hardest part of the job is deliveries and the most enjoyable part is meeting different people, gaining a new friends."
good,"Fast paced inconsistent work environment. Can be fun or stressful based on upper management. Competing with amazon, so policies and procedures have constantly changed over last several years and job security is diminishing based on pressure to perform tasks."
good,"covering more than 29 stores, traveling everywhere in Utah, from north of utah, to south of utah. 100 % accurate on dispensing RX. supervise all pharmacy staffs. customer service, insurance health care"
good,"Working with walmart okay. The managment had very little to no communication. Although i did learn important sale skills, customer service skills, how to keep track of inventory and how to maintain and stay on schedule."
good,I really enjoyed the company but honestly I feel that the company or store I work for is pretty corrupt i been with the company for two years and I witnessed people who have only worked there shorter then a year get promoted it really ruined my confidence plus I thought at Walmart brothers and sisters couldn’t be managers in the same department well that doesn’t matter at our store the brother and sister are both productivity managers in bakery and deli I been with this store for 2 years and im really unhappy with the decisions that they have made
good,Walmart is okay. I worked there for a few years and it was fine. Customers usually have no respect for you as a walmart worker and they let you know it.
good,"The day starts with preparing/tidying, replenishing shopping bags at the self-check area."
good,Employees are sometime great and nice and friendly others they seem to have a bug up there buts. They do have great prices and great sales sometimes and awesome discounts
good,Walmart was ok when i started but the management always picked on me about dress code which i was in compliance with. I was always sick with a cold or some other illness due to air quality.
good,it was an ok place to work id go back it was fast pased ut fun place to work for. i used a forklift to unload and load produse trucks and did other duties
good,Love the job but there is no consistency in the rules and priorities sometimes is real extrict and sone times very frustrating for the lack of organization
good,Each Walmart has a different experiance depending on your managers. Not everyone was friendly and you have to take a deduction for being absence for being sick even when you go to a doctor and recieve a note.
good,Walmart is a great place to work for most I don't like the way they play with people lives and the money with all the things they do say it's the system there are many things they could change when it comes to there employees.
good,"stocked merchandise on shelves, and tables. assigned job areas, depending who called in sick, that's the area I normally would get to work, stocked groceries, chemicals, electronics, toys, sporting goods, automotive, hardware, pets, housewares, home decore, garden."
good,This is a fun place to work in your community especially if you enjoy working with the public as customer service is a priority with Walmart.They offer benefit packages to suit your needs.
good,If you want to move up in the company being a cashier wouldn't work. I have been told many times I would be moved up to a CSM but my front end manager lied. Hours were cut from 33 per week to 7 per week.
good,"They work you long hours. They do not care about your outside life, children or health. You work weekends and holidays. I would not recommend walmart for anyone trying to grow"
good,It wasnt a bad place to work.  Some co workers was not to friendly to work with and wasnt getting paid enough for the work that did for the company. The hours was not good for a mother of three
good,"stock shelves, repacked open inventory, faced and straightened inventory, helped customers find items in the store, ran the fitting rooms, "
good,"I learned a lot and will carry new information towards my new job, the environment in the pharmacy was peaceful and nice to be around, good vibes and positive energy."
good,Friendly staff and many opportunities to advance or to switch jobs from within the company. Management may not always be on the same page but for the most part can come together to make it a better work environment for you.
good,Una empresa sociable y un poco estable pero con gran calidad
good,It was definitely a different place from what I was use to. I had worked at K-mart in the early nineties and now the cashiers at Walmart deal with alot more situations.
good,"As a cashier you get to see a lot of customers, some that come in all the time. You're constantly answering the phones as well as customer questions. There is no time for standing around, you have to constantly remain busy."
good,I love working at Walmart!!! But with all the changes especially with cutting the hours even if you’re full time doesn’t give you the guarantee that you will get the minimum hours you need.
good,"Typical day at work was positive"
good,"Otherwise, you should find another job afterwards. It is not meant for career advancement unless you decide to become management. It is more of a job for retirees or college students."
good,This particular Walmart has guidelines for what needs to be done that are absolutely unreasonable. If they departments they give you call for 18 hours of work you are still supposed to get it done in 10.
good,Walmart was a good place to work. I received adequate breaks. The management team was sufficient in working with the associates. The most enjoyable part of my position was unloading and stocking the produce.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart at first but it became stressful. I put in for a new job and they bypassed me and kept putting me off. The position that I wanted was there but they wanted me to stay in the position that i was in.
good,"The vibe at walmart is mostly neutral not very much energy. The people can be sometimes obnoxious and they need work teahing new people the ropes. It was a good learning experience though, Teaches you to be patient with people you dont like and how to say only the things you need to say in order to get through your day."
good,"I actually liked the job, I was really good at it I was one of the fastest tire changer. I had to leave because I was not being noticed no matter how hard I worked still not enough."
good,"I worked the customer service desk.  I cashed checked, processed money orders and money transfers.  Money transfers were the most difficult.  I also rang up customers."
good,The management now don't care about the customers.They have to many friends and family working together.When calling Asst.Mangers they don't come concerning a problems.

good,"I worked the customer service desk.  I cashed checked, processed money orders and money transfers.  Money transfers were the most difficult.  I also rang up customers."
good,I believe Walmart is a acceptable good job depending on needs. They have good benefits and flexible hours including many different departments and promotions.
good,Its was okay. I enjoy my job they could do a little better when they are scheduling to make sure they do have coverage for all shifts and not have employee exhausted because their not able to take care of the customer like they are suppose to.
good,"I would recommend it to anyone that can keep a very fast pace at cutting meats & cheeses while watching the things that need cooking, plus paying attention to customers"
good,Walmart is very short staffed. You have to do way more than your share of work management doesn't offer much help. It is very hard to get your job done because you are expected to do about 2 to 3 peoples jobs.
good,"help customers and checks out clients, bag the grocery's, ask how their day is going, ask if they need assisting and give proper change back if needed."
good,"if you are looking for a place with variety of jobs, go for it."
good,I don't care about Walmart I did not like it to much work for lil pay  I don't recommend working there unless you could put up with their shenanigans dam
good,its an ok job is always busy. you get to learn a little from every department. you work on a fast pace your shift goes by quickly. I learned a lot from being a cashier.
good,Walmart managers are uncaring about the employees. Sick time is non existent and Dr's excuses are not excepted. The pay rate is good in my area you start at 10.00 and go up to 11.00 within the first 15 months then you get a raise based on performance each year
good,The hardest part of the job is when the boxes bust open !! And u have to clean up the stuff before you can unload the truck or load it or when weather gets the things wet it's a mess !!
good,"Schedule isn’t done right , they do not give enough staff  pay is alright for what it is not to bad . I don’t plan and being here for ever their isn’t a career here unless your one of the main managers"
good,"Walmart makes every attempt to remain relevant in the market place.  This helps to assure their associates have the confidence of remaining employed. "
good,Walmart is all about customer service and always agree with their customers even if their right or wrong. Walmart respect all decisions their associates make through the policy.
good,"Walmart is a place to work. They've been sued enough that they aren't going to try to steal your wages or time, but the culture around ground level associates is toxic. If you don't really care about Walmart then it's probably not going to be a long term career."
good,I worked at walmart mostley cause of the fact i was use to the type of work that i was doing. it was very fun to me throwing boxes around and building end caps.
good,Greeted customers. Handled money. Management was very helpful to cashiers if they needed any assistance. Normally day would run smoothly. Other days it would be a little fast paced.
good,"Very busy atmosphere throughout the day. from processing freight to assisting to customer""s needs.I learned a variety of skills such as fabric cutting, processed on-line orders as well.I enjoyed collaborating with my co-workers on different product we carried."
good,its a good place to work enjoy working with my co workers they help u get threw your day i learned a lot about different types of cars and dealing with different types of people
good,"Workplace is good and family type environment to be in, it's employees really are the ones that make this company a good company to work for. Overall it's ok"
good,its walmart. not to much more to add then that really. 9 hour shifts with 1 hour off for lunch. if your a hard worker look to be doing a fair amount of work.
good,the work cuture at walmart was not bearable the manager had therir choice of worker..The job itself wasn't hard but the manager made it hard by not work with the employee.
good,I had a fun time working here. My boss was Awesome. the hardest part of the job is Customers and sometimes management. If your want to be promoted you have work extremely hard.
good,"As a baker/fryer I got product ready for sale as well as stocked shelves. Assisted customers with any questions or concerns, and assisted the manager with inventory at the end of each month."
good,"i liked working at wal-mart , in fact if i didn't have had car troubles that caused me to quit , i would have still been working there. wal-mart pays good."
good,I was working full time hours but no benefits. the managers were rude . I mostly worked 8-9 hour shifts and many of them were late hours even though that wasn't my availability.
good,"senior needed help with everything, I was always staying busy. I love going to work just don't understand how the environment needs more team work. It a awesome job when treated with care."
good,well a typical day would be greeting the customers as they enter/leave prevent loss or stolen goods. maintain a safe enviroment place saftey hazards accordingly and remain optamistic.
good,Poor management skills. No team effort. Poor leadership skills. Paid biweekly. Running around like idiots. No-one knows what's going on. The employees don't care about the job.
good,• Provide training to new employees to uphold company policies and sustain customer satisfaction  Champion promotional items to increase sales revenues and actualize consultative sales techniques to achieve set sales goals; confirm and change price signage on designated products during seasonal promotions
good,"I was employed at the busiest and highest grossing location on my island, which made it almost non stop most days. Even offering assistance to other departments. Downside, was my direct superior would have so much on her plate daily, it was very difficult to receive assistance from her when really busy or when I would get backed up."
good,It all depends on the store you work at.  Rural stores are better because the people and town care about Wal-Mart.  The inner city stores are cut throat.
good,A good part-time job while attending school. Very flexible with my hours to work around my school schedule.  I also could work additional hours while on break.
good,A very busy job but it’s makes the day go by so much faster. You can have fun while doing your job and you get to meet new people everyday you work. Such a good environment.
good,great place to work at i worked in the maintenance department and automotive. both required cleanliness that was up to regulation code and standards..
good,Walmart was a great place to start learning and getting more hands-on experience with vehicles but was difficult to work with when it came down to management and the lack of care for the customers when and if they desired to speak with them.
good,It had its ups & downs working at wal-mart. Hardest part of working had to be dealing with the customers but management was rude & always with an angry attitude.
good,"This job offers low pay, but with enough ti spent with the company, it is possible to advance. I would recommend walmart to someone with low monthly bills."
good,"They tend to have you work and do your job but when it comes to getting there help they don't come they hide they hire bad people they do whatever they want they don't manage correctly they are good at giving you hours but they Don't do their Job."
good,"Walmart is a very busy store almost everyday , I work in customer service so a typical day for me is very busy doing so many different things being involved with different customer hoping we give them the experience they’d like"
good,Really no hours they want me to come in whenever they wanted me to.Wanted to work everyday but couldn't.They don't care about you there.I couldn't receive any overtime
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Fast paced and wonderful place to start your career or to work at if you in college. I did enjoy my time there. Just wish they paid more.
good,"I like to assist customers"
good,"wal-mart was a very fast pace environment, which i truly enjoyed but also very trying at times.  all around enjoyed my position with wal-mart as i have also maintained friendships with co workers."
good,"I work with a pretty good group of people. Personal opinions are not very openly shared for fear of persecution but as long as I keep to small talk, everything is fine. The work is monotonous but there is plenty to do and if I happen to run out of work, I can take advantage of the many courses offered for free through the company."
good,"My experience working as a customer service manager at Walmart is that no matter what you do, you will never be treated as a ""manager"" and will solely be a ""glorified cashier with keys"".   Don't expect any help from upper management if you have a problem as the front end is treated as a ""necessary evil"" and not a necessity.  You will easily be replaced and management will have no issues with coaching or terminating you for any mistakes made."
good,"Had a great time at Walmart as a cashier and I like the people that I worked with. I like the Management that was there when first getting there, but you had some Managers didn't connect with workers or even try. My best part was the customers and starting to have regular customers after a few weeks of working."
good,"Walmart was my first job, so I put up with more than I should have. They were not accommodating with scheduling or emergencies. They told me to my face the only reason I was hired was because I could work weekends."
good,I worked in the pharmacy so it was always very busy. I was a clerk and I would ring up peoples medicine. I really liked working there.; I would recommend them to anyone
good,"When I worked there, It wasn't the best place to work. Management would rather run around the store for hours to find someone to help customers then to offer a hand to help themselves. Maybe it changed but who knows!"
good,Worked long hours when I was there.  Had to stay at night until the store was clean and ready to open the next morning which would sometimes be a couple of hours past closing time.
good,"A typical Day at work is you never have to ask what to do next because there is always something to do. I learned quite a bit working for walmart I have learned various departments and manager roles such as department Manager, support manager, csm, and started out as a stocker and cashier. I would not be where i am today without the early managers in my career taking the time to teach and train me where i can train other employees in the future. Management was great. Hardest part i would say is getting projects done on time so everything can be ready for the next day.."
good,The best part for me was the customer service customers can be a pain but its retail. And I learned something new everyday .Hard part was dealing with managers and the fact they have there own rules .
good,Good co workers rkers make the place feel like enjoyable sometime even managers helped with the task that we as associates needed to finish before shifts ends
good,"Need better pay, More hours , Point system need to be improve. Great Trainng , For the Jobs, fair Management , Location was good for me , Frendly co-workers."
good,An ok place to work while trying to find something else. Management always has rose colored glasses on when when looking at how the personnel should be distributed on busy nights
good,Thaw company is ok overall but the department mAnagers need to start taking more action for their responsibilities instead of passing them off to new hires or even new managers that really don’t know what they are doing
good,walmart has an important role to fulfill everybody and everything in this store we have to watch because of its quantity and the large amount of people coming in.
good,I have worked at Walmart a few times over the course of my career. It was a great place to work and good people to work with. The pay was low and I had to use other sources of income to make ends meet.
good,I wasn't given enough to do alot of the time. I had to try to find things to do.I would plan to sweep the parking lot at least once a week. I would keep the trash cans kept empty in the parking lot on my scheduled days.The management was lousey.They would give you a performance evaluation.I hadn't really had any hard parts of the job to do.The most enjoyable part of the job was putting away all of the supplies away the came in for the departments.I also reranged the maintenance shelving so everything was all in one area.
good,I had a small job. The work was difficult and tiresome. More breaks would have been appreciated. Would recommend to someone looking for a quick gig. Average rating.
good,"Unload trucks"
good,I start by sorting carts of merchandise to proper places.  Open cash registers and supply proper amount of cash. Clean area and stock forms for the day.  Check call in to see who is not coming to work today so I know how to schedule my day and breaks and lunches for other employees.  Hardest part if putting up with immature people who have attitudes and don't want to be at work.  Finding replacement for those who called in for whatever reason.  Enjoyable is that the customers are pleased to work with me and appreciate my assistance.  They apricate my pleasant nature and my willingness to be helpful.  Often get compliments.
good,"good pay an hour, but very strict for being on time. people get terminated if you get 4 points in the first 6 months. to call in you have to call a completely different company so there are no ""favorites"" between the management"
good,Come in set up warehouse for trucks grab pallet from outside then bring in tha conveyor line start the truck finish then stock fright unload frozen an dairy
good,Very hard work and they have their picks at walmart it’s bad they don’t care about their employees families and if they need off and the pay is not worth it at all
good,It's hard to judge all walmart's the same as some run the store according to the vision and value of it's employees and management. But unfortunately the ones I worked at had issues. The first one I worked at valued the employees and controlled turnover. However found many upper management in the back in corners crying due to verbal abuse. At the second one there was a revolving door for employees. Turnover was off the chain. No proper training or proper equipment for them to do their job properly. A lot of favoritism and clicks with upper management. Also was common to work 14 plus hours per day and sometimes 9 days straight. Also would be called in on days off.
good,"great place to start off with some advancement. Your able to learn hands on different places in the store. may become a promising future, after being there for a while could earn benefits."
good,walmart was ok for the most part buit when it comes down to your children they don't wanna  work with daycare or school schedules that's why I left cause I had a new born and they wounldnt work wih my schedule...
good,It was close to my home and I could get there easily. The employees were pleasing to work with. There was enough time for lunch break to leave and return before your break was over.
good,"Ots a great place to work at in to be at it’s just the hours they give me it’s like it’s not worth"
good,"A typical day was long and sometimes hard. I learned a lot about customer service. Management was friendly. The hardest part was being on my feet all day, most enjoyable part was clocking out for the day."
good,it was good fast paced great deligating organized awesome crew . Gm ran a smooth store no complaints other than the pay..................................................
good,"It’s up to you, a job is a job if it’s not what you want to do you just need it to pay the bills. If you want it as a career then make it that, I’m not going to say don’t work there or do work there, it’s up to the individual."
good,I liked working at Wal-Mart because of the people I met and the new things that I have learned. I loved working with my co workers and seeing the same customers when they came in and also new people.
good,It was fast paced and you had to be on top of your game. There were moments when I would have to work multiple positions throughout my shift and receive quick training.
good,Walmart was an ok job to work but I only think school kids should work there. If you have a family an all always busy you should not work there.. but overall it’s a great job for students
good,As a Manager you given opportunity for growth but not all the tools to be successful. Upper Management rule by fear which is not the best way to run a business.
good,"Unloading the truck, sorting items by departments, stocking, being on your feet all day. The managers really push you so that the team finishes all stocking that day. Sometimes a lot is asked for just one person they sometimes have to do extra tasks and it can be very stressful by the end of the day."
good,"I've got mixed feelings about this company. On one hand they do some really amazing things for the communities their stores happen to be in. However, it's been a constant battle with having faulty equipment, the building it self has several problems that seem to never get properly fixed. I've witnessed some employees get reprimanded for the smallest thing while another will constantly come to work late yet never have any consequences."
good,"it wasn’t too bad, it was stressful and there’s a lot of pressure put onto people i was in the process of moving and they couldn’t transfer me fast enough"
good,its been almost 30 years since I've worked for Walmart and I know things change so my opinion is of no value for today's work force.  Have a great day.
good,Working for Walmart is okay it has good days and bad days but overall it’s an okay job to have. I would recommend others to work with this organization.
good,I have worked over 18 years with this company and 13 years in safety. I dealt with all types of people and have learn so much about how fast things can change. In a blink of an eye. So I'm trying to do a new change for myself. Staying positive and growing.
good,Walmart was my first job and it was a very interesting experience. I got to see how working in a retail environment was like and I have to say its not exactly how people describe it. I mean yea you have those moments of oh its the worse job ever but there's usually something that gives you solace that you know you could be doing much worse.
good,"Walmart isnt a bad job to have, To me walmart was something to bring in some money, till i could find something better the biweekly pay wasnt enough to live off of,"
good,"Overall could be better in some aspects, but I can not complain much because a job is a job. They work with my schedule. My coworkers are extremely nice and helpful."
good,"Did various positions in lawn and garden deli cashier overall a positive work experience would recommend staying away from the deli. management was good ,"
good,Wal-Mart was the typical retail store.  The demand was high for excellent customer service while usually being under staffed and often times underpaid.
good,"Fast paced environment, with expected routines. Many employees were not pleased with their employment with the company, which made it more cut-throat."
good,"I m the kind of person that have to keep busy to don't feel bored , I learn a lot cause I got many friend I was learning about all store , I had many angry people gearing stuff at the store and we have to give them the best service with a big smile"
good,"It was very fast paced management was o.k for the most part."
good,I enjoyed working with the people and serving the customers at Walmart. I liked learning all of the different departments and becoming a Jack-of-all-trades. However the assistant managers are harshly managed by upper management and therefore they push the sales associates too harshly and inefficiently.
good,Overall Walmart is a great place to work and gain retail experience to advance in the industry of grocery and retail. I would however recommend for promotional purpose that one look for company with stability.
good,"Wal-Mart had pretty poor management. The manager for my department (asset protection/loss prevention) was actually a great boss to have. However, the rest of the store and managers was pure chaos."
good,It was a great place to start your career off if your going to college... taught me how to communicate with others that you don't get along with.. hardest part is unloading the truck.
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work for if you’re looking for something temporary. Expanding your career at Walmart may take longer than you expect it to, but if you enjoy your workplace then go for it!"
good,"There was plenty of work but poor management communication, gave direction without follow up or checking in. Just come in and do as much as you can with what information you've received (not a lot)."
good,"en mi opinión era un trabajo con buen ambiente entre compañeros ,aprendí a contar el dinero de una manera mas rápida,ser muy paciente por parte de gerencia no me gusto por que pedían rapidez y ellos no apoyaban dándonos los instrumentos necesarios,la parte mas difícil era contar un valor muy elevado de dinero."
good,"Greeting people, providing excellent customer services. Working a very fast paste. Keeping work station and area organized, clean and safe. Helping customer have a great shopping experience."
good,"Average place to work if you would want a part time or full time job. Wouldn't recommend for the only job to have though, need to have a second job for where i live at."
good,"Need to adjust their expectations, hot and cold at times. Need better fans when inside trucks. 3 month bonuses. There are not a lot of positions that come up for advancement."
good,"I like the shifts and full time hours easy pace with routine environment, enjoy  being apart of experiences of watching one your stores grow from open to what it is now thanks.."
good,"I mostly enjoyed working here, there were times that it wasn't my favorite place to be. Your breaks and lunches were subject to management whether they were on time."
good,Thaw company is ok overall but the department mAnagers need to start taking more action for their responsibilities instead of passing them off to new hires or even new managers that really don’t know what they are doing

good,"I work with salary management to help manage associates operations within the store.  I am responsible for the store presentation.  I work along side salesfloor associates to help teach, train, and motivate."
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart is very busy. We have consistent customers on an hourly basis, however, we do receive 2 15-minute breaks, and an hour lunch. We have great associates around the store. Walmart has great customer service at all times. The hardest part about the job is when it gets very busy and we have to get the customers in and out of Walmart in an orderly fashion. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is the friendly customers who like to have a nice conversation about their visit to Walmart."
good,I do not want to write a review for this place of business. I  worked there for 27 years and want to move on to something else. Everyone can form their own opinion.
good,"I'm tired of writing these reviews but walmart is an okay place to work. Easy work, decent pay, breaks, hour lunch is ridiculous though, especially since its unpaid."
good,A high demanding job with very little work life balance (When in management). If you start from the bottom you will need to push to get into management to really make your time and sacrifice be worth it.
good,"work and job load is very easy, a lot of physical labor and moving around but your body and muscles adjust to that after about a week; most employees are lazy and stand around and talk to one another at a very loud volume"
good,"Working in Walmart is kind of of stressful, at least at the front as a cashier because you have to make sure that all costumers leave the store happy."
good,There is always something to do in the floor and is a really stressful place to work. U can work a lifetime and always be a part time no matter how hard u work here.
good,"If you are just starting in the work force, this is a good place to start. They are willing to train you and changing positions is relatively easy. Flexible work hours. At my particular location, management is not quick to respond and half the time won’t respond to a situation."
good,"It was OK, decent hours and benefits if you are on your managers good side. If not then good luck. Management was about a 50/50 at the store i worked at. would never go back to work for them."
good,"Met alot of people, tried to make their shopping experience pleasant."
good,"I found the best part was the customer service aspect.  I enjoy meeting new people and striking up conversations.  One has to employ good customer service skills.  Trainings are available."
good,the company was ok to work for but it was alot of work for that little pay and had to go through alot to get my raise that I was entitled to get but it took about 3 month before they gave me my raise and the back pay that I didn't receive
good,"The area that you chose might not be the area you work in everyday. Sometimes you don't get the days off that you wanted, and amount of work isn't defined by money."
good,"They are okay if you need a job that helps pay rent, but if you can do better than do better. Stocking was pretty relaxing had a list of items do stock before the morning came."
good,"It is a great company to work for, you can advance. The company will guide you in the right direction for success. They love great leaders and positive attiude."
good,"Fun relaxed.  Fast pace"
good,"Walmart will hire anyone, so this is a great first job or last job for a retiree.  The pay is very low for supervisors who have a huge amount of store operations, customer service, cash handling and employee responsibility!"
good,Walmart is a fast paced and nonstop work place.  I enjoyed it because I like to keep bust while at work.  I work hard and like to do my best to improve the company I work for.
good,"Walmart has a competitive hourly wage, but they seem to be unorganized. They are hard to work with on working hours, and always seem to be short staffed."
good,A busy fast paced retail job that kept you on your toes. I learned many new ways of how to manage and how not to manage people. It was a rewarding experience that adds to my accumulated knowledge in the work world.
good,I really enjoyed being given the opportunity to begin my optical career with this company. I enjoyed the staff and the doctor. My manager was great at training and directing me.
good,"Un amibiente laboral de forma correcta , varia la forma de trato depende de la gerencia a cargo"
good,"I do not want to comment on this at this time, sorry for the inconvenience. The job was just not for me and the people making promises they can not keep."
good,"Walmart has very high expectations if you pursue a salary position.  It is very hard to be an insider and be chosen for other positions outside of the silo.  They put a lot of weight on international exposure, fresh college grads, and associates who do not push back against direction that may hinder the associates or business.  The recent added levels of leadership has muddied the waters.  This has caused very inconsistent direction in the field, with my peers and I working for several different goals when we should all work for the same goal.  We have the autonomy to make decisions and lead our business.  Although we may be questioned about a certain decision, our leadership does not punish you for the decision you made as long as you gave a good business reason why.  On the downside, morale in our department, which has around 2,000 associates, is the lowest now than I can ever remember in the past 15-20 years."
good,"Long hours, under staffed, transferring was difficult, poor pay, should pay employees better, no benefits, well fare company, employees unhappy, won't go back"
good,I loved working at both places because the customers and other associates were amazing and fun to be around. It just made working so much better and easier.
good,"At Walmart you learn that teamwork and communication are the most vital skills needed to be a successful associate. Your typical work day will entail of mostly zoning aisles, stocking, and customer service. Regardless of your position you will be required to help any department if told to do so, so you will learn how to do everything in the store at some point and time. Workplace Culture at Walmart differs from store to store but for the most part it revolves around competing with your coworkers in employee reviews and sales. This causes passive aggression and back-stabbing, as well as favoritism in the work place. It can be toxic, so becoming comfortable and being likeable at work is essential for job security and promotion."
good,I didn’t really like working at Walmart because the management was horrible and the lack of higher job opportunities was 0 to none. Long work hours with not the good of money
good,"My review of this place is that it was a very decent place to work at. There are a lot of people who shop at Walmart so of course I was meeting new people everyday. I liked working there, the coworkers were all very nice and enjoyable people to be around."
good,Not a good place to work. It’s very stressful and management doesn’t support employees. It’s too much gossip and cliques inside Walmart. Underpaid employees brings down morale.
good,Most of the Managers are great to work for. Co workers are awesome to work with. Yukoners can be hard to deal with sometimes but still can be enjoyable place to work.
good,"Since the day that I started I felt like I was unwanted in my current position.  I feel as if I am being watched every move I make, I am being discriminated against because of my race.  I am not comfortable, therefore seek other employment."
good,I have worked for Walmart Distribution Center for nearly 70 days when I had an accident at work and was put on restrictions.  They have tried to compensate my employment with a different position.
good,Walmart was a temporary job very busy they pay well for the type of work you will be doing. Walmart offer major benefits and over time pay the only thing is they are not curtious of family emergencies or any call outs for that matter
good,It was great I got to communicate with my customers any problems I had we're resolved easily  my managers were easy to talk to  and ever day was a breeze
good,Overall a good place just sometimes management was slow to let employees know what was going on.  And how scheduling was changed which cause some misunderstandings
good,I come in clock in set up and start work. I've learned that I have good customer service skills and the work place is very multi cultured. The hardest part of the job is me leaving the job permit.
good,"A good place to work for,  I'm thankful for all the people I learned from, I believe I learned to work in all most every department. If you are looking for a good fun job Walmart the place to be, A great career with Walmart be a good start in any ones life. Being a team player not being afraid to learn something new. If you can lift, walk, smile, greet people you would be great for Walmart. Fun good place to work for."
good,"its a good place to start off with, managers are pretty good, only downfall is they always cut every ones hours. and schedules are not as flexible as they say they are when you get the job"
good,"I don't have a good review,  I was dismissed unfairly because at that ime I had a premie baby and she needed to go to frequen doctors  appointment. Because I missed so many days I got fired."
good,"If you want something part time, this is a decent job for that. It usually isn't too stressful and there is usually a person to help you depending on the job. For the most part they will work with you."
good,"I had to pick, package and ship customers online orders. I really enjoyed working in the fast paced environment. T hey had a very hands on approach of teaching."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for if you aren’t looking to advance. It’s great to work for if your looking to go back to school they work with you and your hours.
good,"nice job for college kids to work, they do well working around there school schedules, they don't pay enough for the cap team that unloads the truck and then has to stock all there freight by end of there shift."
good,I really loved the people I worked with and most of the managers. I learned how to work together to get tasks done. Wal-Mart taught me that sometimes you aren't going to love what you do but you have to do it if you want to make a living.
good,"I was in charge of the front  end of the store.All of the cashier,maintenance people outside people cart  people, just making sure everything ran good. Taking care of my customers"
good,"I have been with the same company for 16 yrs and I think it is time for a change.  I know how to do many positions for this company and I feel like I am being taken advantage of . I don't need to be thanked for the jobs that I do , as I am not looking for that , but it would be nice to feel like I have made a difference and feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of my work day , and I have not felt this in a long time . What I lack in college experience , I know I make up for  in my desire to learn  , and if given the opportunity,  I know I can show any company what I am capable of !"
good,I woukd get a pallet with all of the stuff I needed to stock then I would stock everything I had to stock.  My next task was to zone the store for two hours then help others.
good,"you can always move up, fast paced, 8 hours, 1st 2nd and 3rd shift available, management is good, coworkers are helpful, hours are steady depending on job"
good,job requires lot of physical strength and multitasking. shifts are scheduled in the middle of the day so working a second job gets difficult. managers are helping and respectful. best thing is employee discount card.
good,"I liked working there some of the management were very understanding the pay was not enough for everyday living expenses but it was okay . I enjoyed working with co workers though i was alone a big percentage of my job . I learned how to pack, package , cleaning and some costumers service i also worked other department at times ."
good,Walmart needs to build more on team building and less on demanding employees to do things. This company is big and I feel will grow more if they can focus on there employees.
good,"I was in maintenance, which was not the type I was used to.I lost 55 pounds in the first three months.I saw what needed done and wanted to make sure it was done right even though a lot of the time I did not have the help I would have liked, but that was my situation and can not say the same thing will happen in other areas,"
good,"A typical day would be going to your register and checking out customers, on slow days you would do returns or ""red-line"" your lane. it is a very easy job that starts out pay at $11/hr"
good,Every day is unique.  The position is patient-oriented.  It's a fast-paced environment in which we all need to work cooperatively as a team.  The best part of the job is getting to know and like the regular patients.
good,Job duties was to report to my work area at 4am in the morning and work the floor by restocking the shelves on the sales floor before the store close.
good,"Walmart can be a good place to work if yo are properly trained for the position. You may come across times where task will become difficult and you will have to handle them on your own.  It is best ti go and focus on your job, and your job only. Try to not to engage in gossip."
good,"responsible for handling all incoming phone calls and as well as confirming sale appointments and performing long-term follow-up on all unsold customers , internet leads, showroom visits, and incoming calls and Pricing discounts and rebates"
good,"●	Ensure high quality products are available in produce, deli, bakery, dairy, meat, and other departments"
good,"Here I have learned to cashier, make car and house keys, mix paint, sell from and aquarium.  But I had to ask to learn these things.  I am one of the few associate working overnight who know how to do these things."
good,"Each day brought new challenges. Retail is a fluxuating business and this reflects in the work from day to day,"
good,Walmart was a good job at the time because i volenteered for the special olympics to train the children but the days were easy unloading the trucks and then sticking the shelves getting two 15 minute breaks and one hour lunch.
good,I keep apparel departments stocked and organized.  I understand the importance of product availability for the customer.  My questions are answered in a timely manner.  I would like to receive more hours of work time scheduled.  I enjoy helping customers very much.
good,Uma rede de super mercado estrangeira que  da possibilidade de crescer e também a muito desvio de função
good,"For the most part Walmart has friendly co-workers, however some are not so friendly and you also have to deal with rude customers. They're not always rude though."
good,I was always busy I will do what ever anyone would ask me to do. I will work late if I have to. I learned everything management was good. hardest part is to help upset customer. getting along with everyone that you work with.
good,"not bad to start,management ,kept changing .some of the assistant managers did not want to help you with a problem, some did .Did not know how to work a handheld but learned it there."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, family oriented. If you want to advance they will assist you in doing this if you ask. Most management is helpful. Friendly and also hold accountability if needed."
good,"Walmart employees are overworked, under-appreciated, and under paid for the amount of work managers ask to do. The manager I had was also biased. She chose who to reward based on personal feelings."
good,"In Walmart my responsibilities were to make sure everything was clean especially my register for the day and also organized, to have enough bags and to make sure I have them checked out properly."
good,Good place to start work as a person who is in high school or is in college still. The enviroment dealt with alot of different types of people. Walmart is a good starting job not a full time career type job unless you like that sort of thing.
good,Creo que sí se organizarán más yucha integración como equipo sería mejor
good,"Walmart employee "
good,okay very easy work good scheduling and breaks really good benefits and stock options nice and cool place to work also and management is very understanding
good,I learned a great deal in my 12 years at Walmart there was a pretty good work atmosphere for the majority of my time with the company. I am grateful for the opportunities afforded my family and myself from my time with the company
good,For being such a big company I thought it would be a great company to work for. But I was clearly wrong. The don't care about their employees what so ever.  It's a cut throat company.
good,Enjoyed everyone I worked with. We all had a good time in the back room to make the night go by faster and easier. Enjoyed working with the management team at night as well.
good,"there was a lack of worker always freight in the back, pallets on the floor in the middle of the day. but over all in the begin with the original management was good but got bad over time when they switch the management around."
good,"Walmart was a job, I attended every shift on time and did many extras and was never recognized by upper management.  The pay was low for the amount of work and the duties that I needed to perform as an assistant manager.  overall its a good starting place for employment"
good,Working at Walmart was a fast job. After the first week you basically know everything you need to know on your own. Everyone in the working environment is apart of your team so your always around someone for help.
good,"wal-mart is an exciting place to work for, the stff are well trained. everyony is well trained for safety the member are very fast passed an move veryquickly with ther work"
good,"its a ok place to work nice benefits,health,optical,life insurance not much more u can ask for.the bonus every quarter is good,401k helps alot of people."
good,"This job was fun, but very fast paced.  No breaks until your time is up! You stand for 4 hours straight until your break for 15 mins. Scanning and bagging was a challenge between you and your employees to see who had the fastest scans. Fun job, good benefits, good start off pay! Great hours! Willing to work with you!"
good,"A very big complaint from not only myself but also every employee I spoke with was that they bounce your schedule all over the place. Not only are you bounced from 1st, 2nd and 3rd shifts but you don't have set days off, so you can never schedule anything in your personal life."
good,"I had a very nice experience at walmart , learned a lot of new things and met a lot of new people that are benefited l to my life now ."
good,"Wal Mart provided an income, I was able to grow in the company but I do feel after several years that positions above mine are few and the salary did not reflect my years of managment for a big box store with massive responsibilities"
good,Extensive training but not enough time to feel comfortable doing the job alone. Many aspects of tagging or labeling freight were overlapping and confusing.
good,"the job is fast pace, you will need to beable to work on your feet for 8 or more hours a day. they will work with your schedule. they were all delightful to work with."
good,"it was ok"
good,"Come clock in, get our register ready, clean the belt every time is dirty, count our money, be polite to the customer and help the customer with anything. Do our best, smile all the time, be clean and fresh."
good,"My first week at Walmart was very interesting. I learned that a lot of the employees there don’t care about the culture of Wal-mart nor the customers that keep business going. On second hand there are some incredibly cool, understanding managers that are willing to promote you if you show your worthy of it with that being said, growth within the company is very achievable."
good,"good workplace/relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Good company to work for with lots of career advancement opportunities as long as you have a strong work ethic. Many benefits including paid time off, healthcare, stock options and profit sharing."
good,"It is fun working with these associates, we can joke and have fun with them ,we are like family ,caring  for one another and the customers .there flexible work schedule, we can ask for days off at anytime , take vacation anytime of the year,we get are raise every year."
good,Some of the managers think they own the employees. Other than that everything else is good. You get two fifteen minute breaks and an hour or half hour lunch if you work five hours or more
good,Average work place.  Pretty good benefits but a stressful place to work.  Managment is a hit or miss because they are always changing.  Work culture is average.
good,I do not  believe the pay reflects the work done by the workers. Also i took the test for manger and passed it and with 3 available positions open I was told i couldn't three separate times so no growth for employees. once you get in a niche they keep you there. And never got my raise for finishing my pathways.
good,All in all Walmart wasn't a bad work place. Within a year I learned and knew almost everything in every department! Management was up and down all depending on which one's working at the time. the cultural aspect of it was excellent very diverse and a lot of team work which made the days go by smoothly! I would say the hardest part of the job was the random last minute request from management to stay longer and to decline would sometimes lead to a verbal warning or write up!
good,This facility has some amazing people working there.  The relationships that are made are great.  The management that is onsite is great.  Area Managers work long hours.
good,I worked in the frozen/dairy department with one other person as help its very stressful and a lot of responsibility. There is also a lot of heavy lifting involved from lifting pallets to lifting boxes filled with juice or milk over your head to place in a bin. Its very fast passed to which you have to skip a break or get your lunch time cut in half just to finish all the responsibilities that are asked of you and at times still cutting it short in time since they would be on your case for getting any minute of overtime.
good,If you have training and younger it would be a great job. i had no training and the managers were not really training me they let every one else and they were not sure
good,"It's retail, customers can sometimes get there way under your skin, so it was difficult to work with some of them, but you're gonna have that anywhere you go and its good practice for the next difficult person you may have to deal with. Overall, the job was a-okay. I worked in the garden center mostly, so I watered plants most days there, and on rainy days or during winter when we only had indoor plants, I would help out in other departments like Housewares or Automotive. I had a hard time switching positions though and was told to apply for certain management positions, which I had already planned on doing. I applied for them, but most of them were given to those that worked outside of the company, which was quite disappointing to me as they say that they prefer to hire from within. But other than that, I enjoyed the job and if anybody around the area was looking for a job, I would recommend it."
good,In the distribution center you are to perform over the expectation of management. Which is strict by the way. My role at Walmart was to pick and fill orders as they were received. You get two breaks one 15 minute break and one  20 minute break. It’s stressful work in the beginning and progressively gets better.
good,Management didn’t communicate and if you didn’t ask for time off at least 2 months in advance you weren’t going to get it. They tried scheduling me hours that I specified I couldn’t work in my interview.
good,I've discovered that every Wal-Mart Store is managed differently. They are the ones who set the tone of the work environment. You can work at a happy and collaborative setting or a very unorganized and understaffed one. Mine was a mixture of both.
good,They expect you to be able to do so much as one person. Under staffed always and one person is expected to cover multiple areas at once and complete a teams worth of tasks solo
good,"greet customers, register, run self check out, bag groceries, assist customers in finding items, clean area and stock, sell protection plans, offer credit card apps, thank customers for shopping at walmart.  i liked my job then i was offered a fulltime mod team but never recieved it got placed in deli because my position was filled and i dib comes easy to me because i have always worked well fast pace busy body did not like the situation felt like i got railroaded.  this job come really easy to me i enoy working in people relations or customer service."
good,this is also no ones business.  Why should I have to rate previous employment just to apply for a job?  I will not be providing any information at this time
good,"Walmart is an excellent place to work in for students, however, it is very difficult for those who work there for a living, there is a little room for growth and low salary that can barely covers the cost of living."
good,"Its retail- big box retail.  Just like any other retail establishment, they expect too much out of too few employees, and of course the pay is not adequate.  Enough said."
good,"I was fired for “inconsistency”. Meaning I was not working consistently enough for them. I am a minor and at the Wal-mart I work at, you are not treated as equals there."
good,"It was good in the beginning but all these changes not good at all. Too much favoritism, especially where I worked.. If they didn't like you they would find anything I do mean anything to do verbal written"
good,un trabajo en el que aprendi mucho y excelentes compañeros laborals
good,"- Well organized establishment"
good,"The policies laid out by Walmart as a company are fair, but the management leaves much to be desired. Every job position is task-oriented instead of focused on sales."
good,"Although I was pretty content and happy with my over night position, the management is an absolute disaster and they let the company fall apart from the inside in.The employees did their best, and the immediate managers tried their best but the store managers are only there to collect a check"
good,I worked there for . 2 years.  Worked night and day shift.  It was ok. Lots of customers.  Had to make sure all the produce was stocked and products were good.
good,"Walmart is a good company with great benefits. However some of the managers aren't as helpful, understanding,or positive! At this job you are able to pick different shifts which is a plus. The worst part is that not all employees take pride in their work."
good,It can be easy going or extremely hard depending on the day and who you work with. Sometimes the other associates are to easy going or slack off and you have to make up for it and as a cart pusher it is expected as much.
good,"My day started by unloading pallets and placing them in their proper location in the back room, then I would have to fill the meat sections of the store with product from the back. After that I would check through frozen meats such a turkey, fish, etc."
good,It is an alright place to work.  You have to watch out for people trying to steal when working at self-checkout registers.  Management is alright.  You have paid time off for vacations.
good,Reducing hours will you work extremely hard for the money have to deal with customers that will never seem to be satisfied a lot of managers don't like to do their own work they get the associates to do it for them overall is just exhausting
good,"Good place, decent people. Anyone can be hired and given a job and are given the chance to prove themselves. You are also able to move up and make a decent amount of money."
good,The job was decent for the stocker position if you are fast. The environment is mostly friendly and lively. The management does try to help you if you fall behind or there are any issues. Just be prepared to see things you never thought possible at stores (if you never seen anything on the internet).
good,My job was to assist customers and stock merchandise and maintain a organized backroom.  I also built modular and end caps to display merchandise to increase sales.
good,"Too many levels, bad communication, and wrong people promoted. Walmart is not a bad place to work but definitely has some issues. I had some good managers that taught me a lot, but a lot of bad ones as well."
good,"busy, always standing, walking, helping a customer. Learned customer service, working a register, work closely with managers. Managers are not so great, overall. I worked at 2 stores and both stores had really strict and short temper management. The hardest part of the job is to learn providing great customer service and you will always be fine. The most enjoyable part is having funny and great customers that will brighten your day."
good,"This job was alright, but they didn't allow enough hours and the pay was not great. They didn't offer full time jobs, only part time. Management was not that great at this location."
good,Nothing much to say besides it was an interesting place to work at but the distance that I had to travel to get there was ridiculous.The hardest part of the job was getting through the traffic to make it there.
good,"wal-mart is an exciting place to work for, the stff are well trained. everyony is well trained for safety the member are very fast passed an move veryquickly with ther work"

good,Needs improvements My store will not give you a cancecto work up. i work hard been there for 4 years n still havent moved up . I hoped as I gain more time in walmart I could move up but that's not the case at the walmart I work for.
good,"Good place to get started, with lots of paid training. Variable schedule, fast paced environment. Always different day, different experiences. Unpredictable, management was ok. Discount was ok, not great. Pay kinda stinks, but at least you have some job security."
good,"It was nice working at Wal-Mart and it keeps me busy every time I work the people that works there are friendly and especially the customers, only if it wasn't a temporary job.."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work."
good,	Conduct and investigate internal theft issues
good,It’s a great place to work the management team try’s to change things up and make it more interesting for us. Its an great environment to work with friend in the community you grow up and plus u see a lot of old face
good,"A typical day at work consisted of going to the back room gather clothing that goes out on the floor, answer the incoming phone calls and send them to the correct department."
good,I really liked my customers. Didn't to much care for the manager. It seemed like the workers didn't know how to separate personal from professional sad to say.
good,"Worked in the pet department and was required to pull stock out from the warehouse and restock shelves. A lot of heavy lifting in this department and pulling the carts of stock (40lb boxes of cat litter) to the opposite end of the store. Managers were easy to get along with. No training for handheld scanner, and was constantly called to front check out to handle customer overflow."
good,Was fun at first but after a while became too much to handle. Managers were hard to track down. Breaks would be given late and some associates were treated better than others
good,Night shift there was very laid back no problems with anyone at all I liked stocking in packing the merchandise on the shelves....the people there where are very nice
good,i really don't remember working here. It was a really long time ago so I really can not think of many things to say about working here to be honest. Sorry
good,The job was not stressful at all it was more of the wages paid at the time I work for the company I was paid nine dollars a hours to work overnight on shifts that no one wanted to work and i worked multiple departments
good,Walmart has a good working environment .Some management  needs people skills but over all working with the customers was one of the best experiences I have had.  I gained knowledge  in people skills and learned how to delegate
good,"working for wall-mart was an okay experience, mainly the work was fast pace and the days went by very fast and quick. there is always room to be promoted in the company"
good,"Stocking shelves and bins, labeling bins, lifting, pushing, pulling, customer assistance, cleaning up spills, teamwork, full time work, works with your family needs if you know them way ahead of time and no one else has already requested that time off, medical benefits. If you get hurt prepare to fight to keep your job or for the company to follow a doctors note on your behalf."
good,"Was an ok job, every much what one would expect from working at Walmart. The pay was below average but I am told that has since improved. The hardest part about the job was dealing with customers who tried manipulating the system."
good,Meat/poultry Department was understaffed. Staff there was generally accommodating and friendly. Work itself was arduous but fine. Maintenance was easy enough. Certain tasks got long due to having less hands but ultimately were fine.
good,Average pay and good benefits are a plus. Friendly co-workers make the day go better. But the usual work day is stressful with a heavy work load and unrealistic expectations.
good,"I did not mind my job at Wal-Mart, but at this time I would rather be at a job that was more related to what I am going to school for. The hours were flexible and I could work when I wanted to pretty much."
good,"My 20 plus years there  came to a disappointing end with micro-managing, inept management, direction from too many directions, obnoxious schedule requirements,  a stagnant performance appraisal policy, ( capped hourly wages),  recruitment of un-qualified individuals to save on payroll."
good,Walmart a relaxed fun place to work. And it’s very entertaining. You have many areas that you can work room for advancement. Walmart likes to promote from within which is a plus.
good,good starter job but for anything else its just another job.  Started out okay they do give a bonus if the store makes money each year if it doesn't you get nothing.
good,"they always need/ needed help "
good,It was great working for Walmart. I made some good friends and also learned a lot of new things. Managing the bakery was the best position ever. I truly loved it.
good,"it is a good company to work for sometime management can be tough, in all it is a faced pace work. it is a good starter job and you can move up quickly"
good,"i enjoyed my time working at Walmart. My coworkers were great people as well and managers. The work wasn't difficult, it was actually quite easy. an overall review is a thumbs up."
good,Hours are all over the place. I would use them as a part time job because your have to do pallet after pallet by yourself and smash every little bit into your shift before you can leave. Full time you will be a slave. Part time is realistic.
good,"The job is wonderful but sometimes working my position and like two other people at the same time. Friends are good, and the changes are never told just one day walk into work and oh by the way this changed."
good,"Work was easy and productive.  My job duty consisted of unloading and loading trucks that contained Walmart products and, restocked shelves and maintained the neatness of the store."
good,"I unloaded semi trucks for Walmart. It was a very fast pace job, you had to be organized and manage every department. It was a great learning experience."
good,Walmart like all places have flaws but it is a decent place to work. there is a good chance you will be able to keep your job as long as you do what you're supposed to.
good,You were in charge of multiple departments. It was nice to be in charge and be the duty manager. You had all kinds of responsibility. There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The associates were excellent.
good,Working here the shift would start at 7 am and end at 3:30pm.  There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The coworkers were always nice and more than happy to help out. The managers were great.
good,Working here the shift would start at 5 am and end at 1:30pm. Which was nice because then you had the rest of the day to do what you had to. There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The coworkers were always nice and more than happy to help out.  The managers for the most part are good.
good,Wasn't that much work to do while i was there. a great place to start out and helped set a career path if that's the way you want to head with this company.
good,"I worked at Walmart for a year and a half. The only reason I probably stayed was because the pay was decent, the hours were pretty good, flexible schedule, and the people were great. Management on the other hand was something else. They made me feel as if they didn't care about all the work I'd put into my job and I was easily replaceable. My own department manager acted like they didn't know how to do their job and I was constantly having to pick up their slack and fix their mistakes that made our customers upset. Even on Black Friday, I worked Pick Up Today and it was horrible. They didn't put anyone to work, I was stuck with all these orders and no help. Assistant managers passed by like they didn't care. Due to that I had to leave, it was getting hard to deal with along with college. It was so stressful."
good,"working overnights was hard a lot of freight that had to be stocked in different departments,and it was about timing and each job had to be compleler at a certain time"
good,Everyone I worked with was great and amazing even some of upper management was nice. But management would also lie and run things very backwards in my opinion. It’s suppose to be a Walmart family but Walmart as an industries could careless about its “family”.
good,"Walmart is a very good place to work, Walmart managers take very good care of their employees. And Walmart is very fair in their decisions. The managers are helpful and very concerned about the customers needs and the employees needs as well."
good,I worked at Walmart Associate Store for  almost 1 yr. The schedule was fixed.. They could schedule you anytime of the day. Some of the managers were very mean.
good,You get to meet new people. The atmosphere was great. Its very challenging therefore your not just sitting there bored. They have the best coworkers ever.
good,"I meet new people daily, got a chance to grow and learn how to manage a group of people, learned how to become a trainer to those who were coming in. taught me how to interact well with customers."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers find items and was thanked by those customers many times. Enjoyed helping customers by filling in as a cashier at the front. While in the Home department enjoyed returning items that were re-saleable to the shelf and taking items to claims that could no longer be sold. Also helped customers in the Jewelry Department, Accessories, Shoes, Home and really all over the store!"
good,I dont really care for the environment at walmart. To me it was the place of work I felt comfortable in at all also the pay is minimum wage and you doing really get much at all for working there for 3 years besides a .25 cent raise
good,The management does not take the time to schedule very many people to work everyday. You need more than two csms more than half of the time and they don't have that
good,"working at walmart is not so bad, it all depends on the people coming in. some days it will be fine, just working relaxed and going home others you will have a problematic customer and it will become stressful. the customer is always right so even if youre correct you lose."
good,Walmart was my first experience in the labor world. Here is where I learned how to bring proper customer service and that customer satisfaction comes first.
good,"I learned a great deal of team work and time management. I worked grave yard shift,. so it was extremely difficult to manage while attending school. I loved my coworkers."
good,This job is one for those who are just trying to start their lives being independent. It is not to hard but not to easy and the more you show you can work the more they will give you to do. It is okay as a career path but I would suggest you use it as a place to get your feet on the ground while you figure out what you really wanna do with your life.
good,"Walmart is good place work but the pay is too low so have to change  "
good,"Demands high productivity of staff. The bottom line is the only factor in consideration. Wage is determined by previous work experience, so not always minimum wage which was suprising."
good,"Great place to work, had fun,  could do without the drama but what work place doesn't have some sort of drama. Loved the management..................."
good,"I learned to be patient, what to do in a stresfull situation, how to get things done effectively and the right way. It was a good job for $11 an hour."
good,"Most days are too busy to work, only someday is a quiet day. If you get an assignment, it is easier to work through the day. A messy environment that is the thing that all associates have to face every day in the workplace. But you can earn a lot of things from your job if you are interested to learn. Most supervisors are easy to talk with. It teaches you to become a hard worker."
good,worked in electronics while attending school.  decent job.  Management was very nice and worked around my schedule.  everyone is given their job and does pretty good doing it.
good,Great place to work at but after being there for 12 and half years it’s time for a change job and learn more about Cars I know vw wil give me the  opportunity
good,"Supervisors make work load very clear and understanding. Although repetitive, you will always know what you are doing throughout the day even if managers are absent."
good,falta de caracter y habilidades de liderazgo de parte del gerente general del walmart
good,"I worked very hard at my position with Wal-Mart. I worked for $7.75 (minimum) on my feet all day for a few days a week. Sometimes I didn't even get 8hrs. I didn't have a car at the time and the managers knew that but they still gave me very poor hours. No benefits, and the store was VERY busy."
good,it was an okay job for a college student they do promote within which is awsome your good work does get acknowledged which is also great and you get discounts around the holidays.
good,"Typical work day I was always busy and I always had something to do. "
good,It is a good first place to work. I am grateful for the time I have worked there and the expierience and friendships I've gained. I'd reccommend this job to anyone.
good,The manager was pretty much the only reason that I Almaty was a good place to work over the summer.  It was nice and a good environment.  Nobody was grumpy. I was good at what I did so there was never a problem.
good,walmart is a good place to  work . I  work as a cashier and stocking and facing up product when time is slow and clean and wipe down area. Everyone their is very help full and friendly .
good,"Walmart was a decent company to be employed with.  The training walmart has is amazing and out of store.  Teaches a lot about you job specific.  However, once the new scheduling system took effect it flawed a lot of the positives about the store."
good,"Stocking shelves and bins, labeling bins, lifting, pushing, pulling, customer assistance, cleaning up spills, teamwork, full time work, works with your family needs if you know them way ahead of time and no one else has already requested that time off, medical benefits. If you get hurt prepare to fight to keep your job or for the company to follow a doctors note on your behalf."
good,"Was an ok job, every much what one would expect from working at Walmart. The pay was below average but I am told that has since improved. The hardest part about the job was dealing with customers who tried manipulating the system."
good,Meat/poultry Department was understaffed. Staff there was generally accommodating and friendly. Work itself was arduous but fine. Maintenance was easy enough. Certain tasks got long due to having less hands but ultimately were fine.
good,Average pay and good benefits are a plus. Friendly co-workers make the day go better. But the usual work day is stressful with a heavy work load and unrealistic expectations.
good,"I did not mind my job at Wal-Mart, but at this time I would rather be at a job that was more related to what I am going to school for. The hours were flexible and I could work when I wanted to pretty much."
good,"My 20 plus years there  came to a disappointing end with micro-managing, inept management, direction from too many directions, obnoxious schedule requirements,  a stagnant performance appraisal policy, ( capped hourly wages),  recruitment of un-qualified individuals to save on payroll."
good,Walmart a relaxed fun place to work. And it’s very entertaining. You have many areas that you can work room for advancement. Walmart likes to promote from within which is a plus.
good,good starter job but for anything else its just another job.  Started out okay they do give a bonus if the store makes money each year if it doesn't you get nothing.
good,"they always need/ needed help "
good,It was great working for Walmart. I made some good friends and also learned a lot of new things. Managing the bakery was the best position ever. I truly loved it.
good,"it is a good company to work for sometime management can be tough, in all it is a faced pace work. it is a good starter job and you can move up quickly"
good,"i enjoyed my time working at Walmart. My coworkers were great people as well and managers. The work wasn't difficult, it was actually quite easy. an overall review is a thumbs up."
good,Hours are all over the place. I would use them as a part time job because your have to do pallet after pallet by yourself and smash every little bit into your shift before you can leave. Full time you will be a slave. Part time is realistic.
good,"The job is wonderful but sometimes working my position and like two other people at the same time. Friends are good, and the changes are never told just one day walk into work and oh by the way this changed."
good,"Work was easy and productive.  My job duty consisted of unloading and loading trucks that contained Walmart products and, restocked shelves and maintained the neatness of the store."
good,"I unloaded semi trucks for Walmart. It was a very fast pace job, you had to be organized and manage every department. It was a great learning experience."

good,You were in charge of multiple departments. It was nice to be in charge and be the duty manager. You had all kinds of responsibility. There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The associates were excellent.
good,Working here the shift would start at 7 am and end at 3:30pm.  There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The coworkers were always nice and more than happy to help out. The managers were great.
good,Working here the shift would start at 5 am and end at 1:30pm. Which was nice because then you had the rest of the day to do what you had to. There was always something to do. The pace was quick. The coworkers were always nice and more than happy to help out.  The managers for the most part are good.
good,Great store with many options and opportunities through out the store. Walmart was a company that had alot of obstacles and challenges that were very difficult but ended up being a great help in life.
good,"Good team work, Some opportunities, convenient. Workers was good to work with even some managers. But some managers did not want to help. But Walmart was a good work experience for me."
good,It was nice stocking because there wasn't a rush to it. I really enjoy working for the company of Wal-Mart almost as much as I enjoy shopping from there.
good,At Walmart we had to unload the trucks and put items where they belong on the pallet then we will be delivering the pallets to the aisles .stock food .
good,"It's a great place for a younger person to get a job.  Gives you skills you didn't know you had, especially if you're a little shy. Scheduling employees is the only downfall."
good,Typical day started at 6am made sure things were ready for everyone else to come and do there part. Hardest part was someone else taking credit for my work. Most enjoyable part making friends for a lifetime.
good,The management always was stressed and brought the stress upon you..Treatment was horrible like their raising 5yr old kids that's how the talked to employees not out of respect that we are all adults..
good,I give it one thumbs up for working with other employees from different departments. The work environment is a fast paced. But the scheduling hours were everywhere from working 5- 7 days a week to 3-4 days a week.
good,"almost impossible to please upper management , most days not satisfied . Retail is a very unforgiving industry. very stressful and too demanding. Great work culture."
good,"Easy scheduling along with flexible hours for the most part. Walmart isn't the worst place to work at, depending on the location. Nothing fancy about working here."
good,"i really dont know what to say hear. But i will start with, i really dont like the company but its a job with a sence of brotherhood. I would work there again in a heart beat."
good,"a typical day at work would be scanning groceries at the register for 2 hours, taking a 15 minute break, going back to the register for another hour and 45 minutes, taking an hour lunch break, and repeating the pre-lunch process before going home. it was very repetitive. l learned customer service skills at this job. management was generally friendly and helpful. Walmart had a culture of excellence, saying that we should all do whatever we can to help customers feel taken care of. most employees ignored this culture. the hardest part of this job was trying to calm down angry customers and the most enjoyable part was competing with my fellow cashiers to see who could scan groceries the fastest."
good,"I never intended to leave Walmart. A customer complaint on me because I couldn't get her check to go through.. She demanded that I give her my name, I refuse to give my name, because she were very mean. She wrote a letter to the president, and they terminated me.. I loved my job.. it's like I have lost a lot. I were on my job for almost 12 years. P.s., I never thought that I could lose my job just because I didn't give my name."
good,The day will go by quick. There is a lot of nice people that work for Walmart.  I your willing to work you will have no problems with management.  Walmart is a nice place to work.
good,"Help with customer on returns and exchange. Make the decision as to what is acceptable with company policy. Assist customers with online orders. Consistently improve customer Satisfaction through expert resolution on conflict, issues and concerns. Cross trained and provied back up to other customer service Representative when needed"
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 10.5 years and overall it was a decent place to work, but it was clear to me that Wal-Mart was not a career for me. I would not go back to Wal-Mart in the same position I held before leaving the company"
good,"Generally okay. Some days were hectic, but things were mostly fine and not very taxing on a regular basis. Management was decent and had a good amount of workers. My only gripe was when, during the hottest days of summer, we lost the ability to get cold water because we were apparently leaving the empty bottles wherever."
good,The job was descent for me as a college student. But I found it hard to find ways that I could further myself  in the company. Management was descent .
good,the customer service at walmart could be alot better with all the workers that are there everyday and since i have worked their before i noticed it and thats alot coming from an employee
good,I enjoyed my position a lot but the management had a lot to learn about their employees they didn't investigate anything when there was issues just jumped to their own conclusions and that made it a hard place to work for as the trust was broken between management and employees.
good,"Great co-workers, good environment, Generous breaks, lenient on time off as long as you have someone take your shifts and an overall great place to work."
good,"This job helped me fine tune my management style. It was easy to do while attending school and working towards my degrees. As just a temporary job, it served its purpose"
good,It was a nice place to work until management changed the way things were run.  Never had enough help and the help that was there they ran off after they started to make any money.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers and answering phone calls. The culture was you only focus on getting your job done and help the customers. The hardest part of the job was keeping an eye on the fitting rooms while running to the opposite side of the store to organize shelves. The easiest part of the job was greeting the customers and helping them into a fitting room."
good,its an ok place to work if you were younger it s stressful at times but you can manage it ok the management is very hard to please the people and the customers are a plus when you are working
good,For the most part a good place too work. Mangememt could use some work. Mostly friendly people. Open shift is always recommended. No dress code just have too look presentable
good,I do not wish to comment about walmart at this time I have nothing to say and I am not writing anymore on this subject. Also its not ok to have a 150 caracter minimum when I have nothing say!
good,the job is good and easy sometimes your manager put you to do something different but is ok the nice people I like helping the costermers and do my job good
good,"They were sometime inconsistent with job activities. The people I worked with were really nice. The management on whole wasn't bad. The shift was hard sometimes,"
good,Walmart was my first job and i was still in high school.  It was an alright job.  Management made it stressful sometimes but other then that it was an ok job.
good,i learn how to stock but walmart mangers are not that great some of them was rude they pay raise is not good they wanna work u long hours but dont wanna pay good money.
good,Good place to work but management needs a little work and no organization skills. Hours is all over the place and schedule gets changed in a snap of a finger without your knowledge.
good,"The typical day was you clock in, unload either the general merchandise truck or the grocery truck then take a 15 minute break about 2 hours into your shift then take at least an hour lunch about halfway into your shift then take another 15 minute break about 6 hours into your shift while in between each break stocking shelves, unloading the frozen\dairy truck with broken pallet jacks then set up for overnights to do their job."
good,Nice friendly workplace management is welcoming One good thing about working for walmart is quarterly bonus.There is lots of room to further your career
good,Good place to work for someone just out of high school or in college. Has decent benefits and career advances are very obtainable. Would recommended for someone looking for a first time job
good,"Working here is hard work especially working over nights! You have to move fast. They are look for fast , respectable and consistent workers who want to work. All of this work isn't enough for the pay."
good,I liked working there but I was wanted to try something new I mostly just graduated from high school so I was desperate for a job and Walmart was right there.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart because they were so flexable with my hours but I did not like the cashier position, I did not like standing in one spot and the pressure of a whole line of people it felt like it was hard to get a break to catch my breath"
good,"Working for Walmart was on the average. It all depends on who is running the and who they are connected with. The was a lot of buddy"
good,Little to no cashiers especially towards the end of the night towards closing. Well managed work environment great opportunity for career advancement .
good,It’s a good place to work if it has the right management .... the pay is great the hours aren’t that good .. the job it’s self isn’t that hard long as you are a ppl person
good,"Very busy making sure everyone is safe outside/inside the building while using L-carts/ rocket carts getting stock from the back off of pallets to put on the shelves, or taking the product off the shelves to take to the back for inventory, zoning the shelves to make the store look presentable for the customers and visitors.All the while helping the customers either check out when they are done shopping or load/unload products they have bought or returning, and find what they are looking for either in the store or online or at another Walmart. I learned to be careful when your walking while helping customers find what they are looking for. Some of the Management needs to be changed. The culture is great. Hardest part of the job is trying not to have fun at work. The most enjoyable smiling customers, working with people you enjoy working with, and learning to work with a few that drive you crazy."
good,It is extremely stressful to work for Walmart.The employees are very competitive to the point of deliberate cut throat actions against each other to propel them selves to the top.
good,Days stayed busy and productive but there was poor scheduling and hours did not stay consistent despite being full time. Coworkers were not held responsible for lack of work.
good,"Job was boring and slow never advanced and always had customers complaining about everything, even if you didn't  smile while they were in your lane trying to pay."
good,the people that work for walmart make the store. the actual managers and the company of walmart itself does not care for the associate. There is very bad communication going on between the steps of management. Its very stressful. Not only do you have rude customers to be friendly too you have management which gives you way to big of a load and expects it to be done. the associates themselves are one of the best perks about working there. they are some good people and you come away with a lot of friends.
good,"So very little to say, honestly. It was nice working there but I had complications with my means of transportation and it caused further complications with my attendance."
good,the only downside is that they do not hiring full time people. the company only hires part  time to avoiding giving employees benefits...……………………………..
good,I like the hours I work and everyone gets along well the Managers are Understanding if you have a problem and they also have a open door policy if your having problems with others.
good,"Very enjoyable workplace with management and other employees"
good,Walmart was an okay workplace. A lot of days we were understaffed so lines would be long which made it hard for us ones with good attendance. The managers were fine. Some days good some not. Overall it was cool.
good,some days was very busy others we had no work. overall lack of communcation between managers and the support managers really didnt help with needs of the empolyes when the manager was out
good,It was easy all i had to do was show up and listen and do my job. Sometime i needed help and i asked. Nothing difficult about working at walmart as a stocker.
good,"checked out the client "
good,Wal-Mart has opportunities in just about every career field.  In regards to the Risk Management area it is fast paced and high stress.  At this time many benefits are being changed.
good,it depends on what type of area u are assigned in automotive was the easy one 2 me n funirutire was the hardest 2 move cause u wood have 2 move heavy things sometime by yourself
good,"this job pays well and benefits are the best I've seen hours are decent and I get the week off , but none of that matters if they have a strangle hold on your throat with their production requirements to the point  you're scared to go to work because you might not unload as fast as they want and be written up and possibly fired for it , if that sounds fun then this is right up your alley!"
good,A typical day at work is being a cashier helping people check out also working at the services desk when needed helping customer return items. I also work in the Jewelry dept. helping customer and telling them about the piece of jewelry the would like to buy. I help out in shoe dept.  unpacking box's of  shoes and putting them up out on the floor. The hardest part of the job is you hours are never the same always different and then having to deal with customers who in life is to just make other people around them just miserable because they seem to never be happy with them self and we do it all with a smile on our face. I enjoy learning new thing like when I learned the Jewelry dept. are learn the customer service desk on how they do things I love being able to help other people and making sure the are taking care of. I am always there to help and do what every they will need me to do. I have never called in are beaning late for work.
good,"wasnt the best job but its what pays the bills. i was frustrated often because i would be doing one job and in the middle of it was told to do another job when i am busy. the employees for the most part were friendly and nice, and wasnt a hard job, just communication wasnt the best so that made it hard"
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Advise anybody that want to work at Walmart they have great . the managers will work with you. The customer service is great they help you out with anything you need.
good,I had a good experience with Walmart it was great. I just need more pay . The hours are great. It all depends on what you get hired for really. You get a lot of benefits and bonuses from there.
good,It is a stressful place to work but they pay well. Associates are asked to work a lot of hours and there is no overtime for salary. Everyone is always under pressure.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work and it has opportunities to advance, but i t needs to work on employees that work there. Hardest part was getting through the day without getting reprimanded about something you did or didn't do correctly instead of them teaching you the correct way you are supposed to be taught. What i enjoyed the most was the team effort everyone put together to be come one."
good,"I loved my co-workers, the job wasnt bad, but the management was awful. They were often nowhere to be found when I needed their help, such as making me change or assisting with a price check."
good,A typical day at this employee is very busy and stressful. Some of the mangers are very helpful. Employees need more training and benefits. More advancement for the employees in the company.
good,lower management has power complex under handed tactics with working hours with part time/ full time requirements other than politics its an easy enough job
good,"Go to bakery bag bread and label,i learn how to price change,change mods,inventory,work floor,do freight,also had to work deli slicing meat, and meat department."
good,The associates are great.  There are great customers in the store. I have learned a great deal on how the business works.  The store is busy all during the day.
good,"I worked as a Part-Time Cashier while in High School, and it was a fair job for some easy cash. Minimum wage was much lower back then, but the work is the same now as it was. I'd say it's a nice job for the current pay."
good,"Hours can be cut at the drop of a hat but they will hire 100 seasonal people around the holidays just so they cut hours and save money "
good,"It paid well but the employees and managers often argued and differed in ways of doing something. Managers would tell you one thing, then an employee who had been there for a long time would tell you something else entirely and it caused for an extremely confusing workplace."
good,Wal-mart was a terrible place to work.  company policy means nothing to management.  Hard work is met with criticism and half-assed sloppy work is rewarded.
good,Not walmart in particular but the routine and the know how to do whatever needs to be done on that job witch goes a long way had management experience so was able to help my management if needed
good,Walmart can be a difficult place to work.  Walmart will take managers and work them over hours and try to say the company is in a good place.  Very politcal
good,You definitely have to have great customer service skills and a lot of patience. Management team sometimes don't here you but most will try to help. It does help if you can move up to do less hard labor work.
good,Great place to work. you got to meet new people everyday. it was a lot you could learn from walmart and grow in the business if you stayed long enough to learn all the things they had to offer
good,"Many jobs begin as temp to hire. Management has difficulty maintaining consistency. Foreign workers cause more work for those who can speak and understand English, since they don't understand how to read and write English - they cause inaccuracies that others must then fix."
good,"In order to raise base pay for new workers Walmart had no qualms in cutting the amount for raises each year to their loyal regular workers, and cutting their pay."
good,"it is fast paced and you meet a lot of people. Being a cashier only  gets a little monotonous.  hours are crazy, no one can have overtime and they are always understaffed.  the hardest part was  the  conflicting personalities.  unless you have been there several years, or work in the office, the hours were too low to survive"
good,"Poor management, lack of understanding that employees are human, poor attitudes towards coworkers and work ethics. An overall disgusting company that cares more about the money than they do the people."
good,"If you have good management it is a decent place to work, but if the management is lousy your experience will be lousy.  Not a place I would recommend."
good,This was so many years ago that this information is probably not valid at this time. I worked in the pharmacy and got a three dollar pay raise all of those years ago when they came up with that tiered system of pay.
good,I've had a fine work experience here but I feel it's time to move on. The r have been plenty of good times but sometimes it's a struggle. Balancing hime life and work life gets difficult sometimes.
good,"Your asked to do the job of 5 people "
good,Working at Walmart as a cashier has its pros and cons. But what work place does not? You either had friendly customers or rude customers. I liked being a cashier and helping customers.
good,my typical day at work was running the cash register some of the csm is rude couldnt get ur breaks on time the hardest part of my job was stocking heavy boxes but the enjoyable part was helping the customers
good,Working at Walmart being a Manager gives you a  great learning experience. You learn to work in stressful situations. You learn time-management and work in large groups.
good,the management staff will work with you. sometimes they don't know what they are doing . but they will learn . they were very helpful when I was sick and then returned to work
good,"Not a terrible place to work, the core of the Walmart culture is amazing but its up to the local management to implement it. the hour break are nice and the amount of food/ snacks that are provided (via non sellable but still edible food)."
good,I did not enjoy working for wal-mart but i did get to grow a little bit. I would not  go back  unless i absolutely had to. It's not a place to stay...
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work, but the new program, One Best Way, (computer scheduling) is cutting everyone who is not a supervisors hours and making everyone that wants their 40 hours to scramble for unwanted or unscheduled shifts."
good,"Depending on the day at Wal-Mart, whether it was the weekday or the weekend, it could get a little stressful. The shifts could get very difficult, ranging from enough to little to none."
good,"Again, I find these questions offensive in some cases and invasive in others."
good,When I was working at Walmart a typical day at work was just coming in with a positive attitude everyday working through my scheduled work shift allday.
good,"Though few people ever got rich working in a Walmart store, my experience was good.  The job was tough at times, but mostly good.  They do tend to promote from within, which is good."
good,the only downside is that they do not hiring full time people. the company only hires part  time to avoiding giving employees benefits...……………………………..
good,I like the hours I work and everyone gets along well the Managers are Understanding if you have a problem and they also have a open door policy if your having problems with others.
good,"Very enjoyable workplace with management and other employees"

I also work in the Jewelry dept. helping customer and telling them about the piece of jewelry the would like to buy. I help out in shoe dept.  unpacking box's of  shoes and putting them up out on the floor. The hardest part of the job is you hours are never the same always different and then having to deal with customers who in life is to just make other people around them just miserable because they seem to never be happy with them self and we do it all with a smile on our face. I enjoy learning new thing like when I learned the Jewelry dept. are learn the customer service desk on how they do things I love being able to help other people and making sure the are taking care of. I am always there to help and do what every they will need me to do. I have never called in are beaning late for work.
good,"wasnt the best job but its what pays the bills. i was frustrated often because i would be doing one job and in the middle of it was told to do another job when i am busy. the employees for the most part were friendly and nice, and wasnt a hard job, just communication wasnt the best so that made it hard"
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Advise anybody that want to work at Walmart they have great . the managers will work with you. The customer service is great they help you out with anything you need.
good,I had a good experience with Walmart it was great. I just need more pay . The hours are great. It all depends on what you get hired for really. You get a lot of benefits and bonuses from there.
good,It is a stressful place to work but they pay well. Associates are asked to work a lot of hours and there is no overtime for salary. Everyone is always under pressure.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work and it has opportunities to advance, but i t needs to work on employees that work there. Hardest part was getting through the day without getting reprimanded about something you did or didn't do correctly instead of them teaching you the correct way you are supposed to be taught. What i enjoyed the most was the team effort everyone put together to be come one."
good,"I loved my co-workers, the job wasnt bad, but the management was awful. They were often nowhere to be found when I needed their help, such as making me change or assisting with a price check."
good,A typical day at this employee is very busy and stressful. Some of the mangers are very helpful. Employees need more training and benefits. More advancement for the employees in the company.
good,lower management has power complex under handed tactics with working hours with part time/ full time requirements other than politics its an easy enough job
good,A good place to work part time. The management need to be trained on customer service. The company pay scale should be raised due to the cost of living in this area and need benefits for part time employees
good,A typical day at Walmart if clock in run registers help stock and clean clock out. I learned how to run a register and handle cash. I learned that some customers may become family or friends. Management was good. When I had a problem I could easily go to a manager and talk to them about it they would listen and help out. The hardest part of the job was when we were slammed with customers and down a lot of people. The most enjoyable apart of Walmart is the people I worked with. Walmart is not just a job its a family.  I became very close with a lot of people. My Walmart family was there when my mom went into the hospital multiple times.
good,It is not a bad place although if you are a replens driver you dont get enough help in the department when needed. Overall fine place to work. Lots of engaging events and charity volunteer opportunities as well.
good,basically the day consisted of being in a truck and unloading freight and if you cant stand high temperatures I would recommend looking elsewhere for work.
good,"A typical day involves clocking in, and being assigned to either a registrar, by an often already stressed looking Customer Service Manager, being sent to cover a break or lunch at one of the doors; or to provide coverage or a break in another part of the store. Usually learning about the same time, about how many people called in, or the front end being seriously understaffed that day. The good thing about working here, is that you learn how to work together as a team, with a lot of people from a variety of backgrounds. The hardest part of the job, is that your schedule is different just about every day, and your hours will vary from week to week. You will also often end up working just about every holiday, except Christmas."
good,"It's alright for those looking for first time job experances, but as for long term effects it will start to die out after awhile. I mean, its a great place to work don't get me wrong, in terms of semi great mangement, hourly lunch, and 15 min breaks with good work qulities, but over all i still can only see this as a first time job starter up for those looking for expercance rather than something long term."
good,"I did not dislike the job, I dislike the poor management that precided over my part of the store. They were very carefree if on some people, but strict on everyone else, they were lazy when i came to assisting us when we needed the help."
good,"buen abiente laboral, trato amable, horarios flexible."
good,".stressful but fun"
good,"Learned a lot about how retail store works, Management was okay, Good as your first job but not a place for educated people as they hire all kinds of people"
good,I worked night shift so it was kind of slow and boring you'll have a couple of customers come there at night but not much working in electrics ! I didn't really learn much it was kinda like teach yourself. The management was friendly.
good,Job is okay if your desperate for money then it’s a good start. Daytime is better than night shift . Day goes lot faster but night you can do whatever you want as in doing stock or resets & being able to listen to music
good,"Once you clock in, you have a job to do. Wether it be in the front end, GM side, or grocery, etc. There is always something to keep you busy. Hardest thing about the job is working with co workers who really do not do much, best part is feeling welcomed."
good,You have tasks everyday that are assigned by your manager that you have to follow. You can not be late or miss work a lot because it will count against you. And working in different departments will help you in this company
good,"Cashier, Change department, and stock. Interact with customer and help them find items. Stock overstocked items in the back room. Put items that are in the back room on the shelves"
good,I like working  at Walmart  they give  me the hours that I want it. It is a good place to work I didn’t like been on my feet for a long time ...........
good,"The management is a joke, I heard that about the place before working there but thought it was just anti coorporation heresay. Sad to say its very true"
good,I didn’t work at Walmart for a long period of time because I went to school and collage so I was only there for a short period of time but I did learn people skills
good,too many    managers. too    many    regulations. short    staffed. decent equipment.   decent    tools. quick   service. terrible    customer    base.
good,my typical day at work was running the cash register some of the csm is rude couldnt get ur breaks on time the hardest part of my job was stocking heavy boxes but the enjoyable part was helping the customers
good,Working at Walmart being a Manager gives you a  great learning experience. You learn to work in stressful situations. You learn time-management and work in large groups.
good,the management staff will work with you. sometimes they don't know what they are doing . but they will learn . they were very helpful when I was sick and then returned to work
good,"Not a terrible place to work, the core of the Walmart culture is amazing but its up to the local management to implement it. the hour break are nice and the amount of food/ snacks that are provided (via non sellable but still edible food)."
good,I did not enjoy working for wal-mart but i did get to grow a little bit. I would not  go back  unless i absolutely had to. It's not a place to stay...
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work, but the new program, One Best Way, (computer scheduling) is cutting everyone who is not a supervisors hours and making everyone that wants their 40 hours to scramble for unwanted or unscheduled shifts."
good,"Depending on the day at Wal-Mart, whether it was the weekday or the weekend, it could get a little stressful. The shifts could get very difficult, ranging from enough to little to none."
good,"Again, I find these questions offensive in some cases and invasive in others."
good,When I was working at Walmart a typical day at work was just coming in with a positive attitude everyday working through my scheduled work shift allday.
good,"Though few people ever got rich working in a Walmart store, my experience was good.  The job was tough at times, but mostly good.  They do tend to promote from within, which is good."
good,"Days can go by fast or slow depending on where you're at and how busy it is. You learn cash handling, as well as ""working with your eyes up."" Management varies between stores, some upper management, don't care as much as they say, some lower management can become good friends. Hardest part of the job is always gonna be working with customers, anywhere you are. Enjoyment is getting to make new friends with anyone, employees and customers alike. Doctors notes, and hospital visits apparently don't excuse you from receiving points for a missed day."
good,make sure when you are running the register you don't have to use the bathroom they take 3 hours to relieve you then act like you are in the wrong for being upset they took so long. make sure it's not a medical emergency you having to go to!
good,"Reliable hours, however management is debatable sometimes depending on who you have. Everyone is stuck in other places. They do however, do not discriminate on who they hire, making it ideal for people who need an extra dollar."
good,for a stocker when you come in the unloaders are pulling the merchandise out to the floor you just stock the shelves and crush the boxes when your done and make the aisles look neat before you leave
good,"I've had two relatives work a long time for Walmart (12+ years) and then be let go over medical issues. So when I started to notice the amount of work piling up and then getting no help from management I decided to cut ties.  I did not want to be put in a position where it would be seen as my fault, when we were understaffed.  My wife was also fired from there, at 7 months pregnant."
good,Everyone work to make sure the customers  is takening care shelf are full right item right price each day is different the assocaite teach each other and learn from each other     work to many hours also to much change item most fun people helping others
good,"An entry-level job title, the position of Walmart stock associate involves moderate-to-heavy labor. Primary job duties may include loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves."
good,"good benefits,long hours,poor management,no weekends,to much favoritism.no raise on time gossip on the front line with mangers,long hours long hours lunch breaks are short"
good,"Managers were respectful of workers. Hours were good for me. It was almost fun greeting and thanking customers."
good,working here was pretty cool. if i wasnt trying to advance my work experience i would going back. i had many long fun nights here! this was the best first job
good,It had good people and the work wasn't to hard but it definitely wasn't easy. The only problem I had was having to go at 6a.m. The pay was good. And they had decent benefits.
good,"It's a good place to work, it gets crazy sometimes, but what workplace doesn't? Managers are ok most of the time, most customers are friendly, and look for you when they really like you."
good,"Walmart has a lot in the way of automated answers to HR questions, which is nice for someone who works an unset schedule. Management can be downright rude and nasty to employees though."
good,it was walmart my manager was fine but others are not it a gamble whether or not you get a capable half tolerable manager or just another idiot  pay was terrible though i hear its better now
good,It pays my bills put food on the table. I learned alot of different types of jobs there to keep me busy and the hours work for my schedule they offer great benefits.
good,Only issue I had with Management is they say they have an open door policy but that's not true. Management is always people who are big headed and I like they are not human. I enjoy working with the customers at Walmart Walmart was a wonderful company to begin a career end. But there's a lot of jealousy and Walmart was a woman that I work in for instance. Open door policy is supposed to be a private thing between Associates in management and it's not that way and Walmart
good,"A typical day at work for me is greeting the customers, making sure my area is clean,helping customers finds item answering questions if need and help other areas in the store. Ive learned to be patient,respectful and the customer is all ways right. Managment is there to help when need.there no hard part of the job its what you  make it to be.the enjoyable part of the job knowing that the person is satisfied and happy they was served with respect and i knowing i made some one smile even when they are having a good or bad day,lets me know im doing a great job."
good,A good place to work part time. The management need to be trained on customer service. The company pay scale should be raised due to the cost of living in this area and need benefits for part time employees
good,A typical day at Walmart if clock in run registers help stock and clean clock out. I learned how to run a register and handle cash. I learned that some customers may become family or friends.

good,"Is Ok to work hmat Walmart is fun to have ppl that work with you were a all a team, all the managers are good and have listening ear, they always try to make things better"
good,"Walmart was always busy & crowded, lot of work to complete on a daily basis, lot of cleaning and it kept me very busy, I was very over whelmed and tired after my shift ends ."
good,Wouldn't recommend Wal-Mart unless you live in a very nice part of any city. It was hard to get a full-time position. The wages were barely over the minimum and you couldn't get benefits if you weren't full-time
good,"This was my first 40 hour a week job. I liked it for a long time, yet left when I became burned out. I went back to school and never really looked back at it with regret."
good,i was a cashier the first time i worked there. that would be slow at times and then really busy at other times. the second time i worked at the customer service desk. there i usually stayed pretty busy
good,it was ok but pay was not ok for cost of living in bay area now a days. i would recommend this job for anyone who is a student or wants to move up quickly in their job.
good,Walmart isn't the best company to work for. Management is not professional when it comes to taking care of their associates. Wish it was better. Looking for other opportunities.
good,The work involved unloading a box truck and stocking shelves. I left this job do to personal issue. The staff there were easy to get along with and very helpful.
good,"I learn that Walmart has the craziest customs! Management only care for themselves, at lest at the Walmart I was at. Workplace is crazy and fun at times. The hardest part of the job is working alone."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart it was a great community and a good environment to work at I enjoyed the people I worked with because we worked as a group and a team
good,"I think this was a nice place to work. The work requires a fast pace, good for keeping me in good shape. I also received a discount from the store for any purchase which makes it a good deal for me and my family. This was a fun place to work."
good,"Sufficient training programs on line and by management."
good,"I liked working for Walmart the manager there was ok, a little ruff but after working with her shes a really nice person. the staff was nice and helpful to the customers."
good,"You must be ready for a variable schedule, varying levels of business in the store, different personalities, cultural differences in customers. Once the customer service managers know that they can rely on you, none of the above will change, but you will be depended on to train others and your overall experience will be pleasant."
good,"Walmart was a nice place to work.  Had great training program and minimum pay to start was sufficient. If i needed a day off, it was given as long as it wasn't excessive."
good,"Fast paced and challenging work days, one must handle work load along with providing customer service. Management can sometimes be harsh due to the days work load, Although, one has learned to manage time, work load and ability to provide outstanding customer service when needed. Also one learns to manage a departments inventory to help with replenishment and on hand numbers. After a hard day of work accomplishing ones task while providing customer service becomes rewarding."
good,Busy place to work.  Many tasks to be done in a short amount of time.  Rude customers all the time.  Retail environment was very busy and hard to keep up with at times.
good,It was where I worked. I liked most of the customers and I feel most of them appreciated me service to them when they came through my line. Got a chance to deal with customers on a one on one basis and enjoyed talking to them when I was not busy.
good,"Work day started between 8am and 11am and lasted for ten hours. Co-workers worked well together and was friendly to one another. There were several training opportunities for pharmacists, including diabetes care specialist, immunization and MTM. Corporate management visited the pharmacy frequently.,"
good,"Very stressful environment, its very organized and has a lot of potential. it has a lot of things gooing on at the same time. it is good place for hourly associates."
good,Working at Walmart the experience will vary based on area you work.
good,"They do not use my skills as inventory worker, management and HR"
good,"It paid the bills and I lived comfortably with the bare minimum while i was single.  Now that I have a family, I see that this company has lost what Walmart was supposed to stand for, being a family business.  as for advancement in the company, It all depends on your management and whether or not you are on their good side. basically who you know gets you where you want to be."
good,was a good company to work for as a student but provided limited opportunities. management lacked basic understanding on how to treat employees and how to run a successful business
good,"I worked at many stores and each one was great. Management was always friendly and easily to talk to if an issue ever came up. The group I worked with on a daily basis were always friendly and great. The only complaint I had was the inconsistent scheduling, I never worked the same time on the same days every week. It made it difficult at times with babysitters."
good,good palce to work not much time for life event great for someone that do not look to have a family to take care of anytime soon . If you do have faml
good,"You have to be pretty tough.  It's a lot of hard work, and not much communication for employees, so sometimes rules or situations would change and you didn't know it, until someone mentioned it in passing.  Managers really try their best though and my co-workers were just the best people on earth,"
good,I am always on time I work hard help others when my task is complete  I go and help other associates  complete  there tasks when mine is complete I also stay late after my shift  to help out where ever  is needed
good,"#1 Checking out Customers"
good,It is a alright place to work.  The associates are mostly good but there are some that are lazy.  The customers are mostly able to get whatever they want when it comes to returns.
good,"A typical day for me was not too busy and not too slow. There was work to do everyday and never and slow day."
good,Its an Ok place to work. Management can be chaotic at times but other than that its ok. Sometimes management argues with each other and yells at employees for no reason.
good,didn't even make it thru the training course..i was almost done and I had to move ASAP..they then took me off the schedule..i was very upset.I begged my new manager for another chance
good,Walmart is a fast paced job where you never know who is a friend or who is an enemy. Everyone is out for number one and there is very rarely any teamwork.
good,"It has an environment where they sell almost everything, so you have to know how to deal with all types of customers. You need to be able to adapt to seasonal changes."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work.  It worked well around my school schedule.  I really loved the discount card.  It seems to have changed a bit since I have been gone though
good,"good pay, amazing associates. strict policies that are required to be followed. hardest part of the job is making sure everything is ready to go before morning shift gets in. the management is very strict and makes sure the work is done properly."
good,Many of the people Working there were great and fun to work with. There is a lack of communication between the members of management. I would be told to do one thing by one member and then another would tell me to do the complete opposite.
good,I really enjoy working with this company and I was lucky to have a good supervisor. Management makes sure that the working environment is good for us all.
good,There’s no way to report horrible customers. There’s no such protected rule for employees. Customer services and sale rates are number one but workers aren’t nothing even we are harassed every day by those rude customers
good,"Customer Service Managers at Walmart are the first level of management that customers interact with; CSMs approve price changes, coupons, returns, and exchanges; organize and direct associate breaks and lunches; make change at the registers and pull money at end of day; answer associate questions and concerns; train new associates."
good,"Walmart has a good working environment."
good,It's a ok place just a boring and non fun place to many undedicated people but it was ok to work there it just had to many childish grown ups and sometimes bad customer service
good,walmart is a decent company. the pay is okay. the job is high stress. but overall the best place to go if your stuck in a jam.would not choose as a career optoin.
good,"Walmart is a good company with any jobs to offer you, but they have a poor benefits as entry level jobs, paying the minimum salary. It´s a good place to start your career but is not for entire career."
good,been working there for nine years its a very fast paced hard working environment there is a lot of standing and lifting long hours and mandatory overtime
good,I expressed my opinions on how to make things better and more effective for evwryone and my opinions got shot down..i left walmart on good terms to pursue my career at walgreens
good,"Working at Walmart isn't a bad idea for a first job, or to have a part time job during schooling or even to help support a second job. But as a stand alone job to live off of, I do not recommend it. With new scheduling systems in place, hours are not guaranteed and the pay is nowhere near enough to live on alone."
good,"It’s easy being a cashier, but you do have occasional meltdown from a customer which can make it hard on your day. The pay is great even for part time. Working here will give you plenty of work experience to try and get a better job."
good,"Is Ok to work hmat Walmart is fun to have ppl that work with you were a all a team, all the managers are good and have listening ear, they always try to make things better"
good,"Walmart was always busy & crowded, lot of work to complete on a daily basis, lot of cleaning and it kept me very busy, I was very over whelmed and tired after my shift ends ."

good,pleanty of options for advancement in management  training in salaried management hard to communicate with the diverse none speaking English associates
good,"it was a great experience..its was the fact that i didn't really have helped alot, also i struggled to find communication with upper managment..they never had helped me with a plan"
good,It's not too bad to work here as long as you get work done. The hardest part of the job was receiving the products form the trucks and stocking the inventory.
good,"Worked nightcrew for 2 months temporarily. Just unloaded delivery trucks, stocked shelves, inventoried back rooms, and cleaned. Just stick to your tasks and everything is good. Job itself wasn't demanding, but coworkers were."
good,"the work day would be hectic sometimes and slow other."
good,There are some days I am required to something in 30mintues when I know I would need longer to do it. Somedays they ask me to do more than I can in a 7.5 Hour shift. Not have the managers back me up when I have been in a bad situtaion. And they could care less that I have been ther 12yrs for advancement.
good,"I work for Walmart for 11 years, it is really time fro me to change. Ready to start a new life and grow with different company. I like to help others and I care for others."
good,"A lot is expected from one working at the D.C. However, they provide a good salary and decent benefits package. Working ten hour days four days a week was a plus."
good,Stable position if your looking for one. I worked overnight and enjoyed my time there. I stopped showing up to look for other work because i was bored.
good,"I had a great time working for walmart at the short time that I was there, I had to leave because the place that I was working and living at the time, the owner of the motel said that "" I could NOT work and live at the motel and work at Walmart at the SAME TIME. I was working as a overnight stocker. I got down at a reasonable time to open the office at 0900. so the people and management was very disappointed that i had to leave because of this. Now that I left the motel business/ hospitality that I am welcomed back to work for Walmart again."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a lot of hard work but we all worked together well. We were short staffed a lot of the time, which made working in the deli stressful, but we managed."
good,"a typical day at walmart is interacting with customer all day, this can be a very stressful place of employment, management does not care about their employees very much"
good,Its an ok place to work.. It takes a lot to work. Its fun at and friendly place.. Eight hours a day 32 hours a week isn't much to work with and only getting paid every two weeks.
good,"For the few years I was employeed, I actually enjoyed my positions.  It's the mgmt that causes most of the stress, they allow their issues to cause other employees grief."
good,Walmart was a great starting point for me and you learn  a lot at a fast pace. I recommend anyone coming out of high school to consider this Walmart as a starting point for your career.
good,It's a nice place. I would love to work there again. To he people are nice. The environment is a good. The customers are great and the have a nice discount
good,Management can make or break your experience. I loved my stay at Walmart for the most part. My direct supervisors and managers were always great. The people above them not so much.
good,Some of the locations they put you in for security are boring and there is no one to talk to. They expect you to just sit there at times and not pass time with a phone or internet.
good,Aprender fazer a deluçao se mercadorais e recebimento de carga pois no começo tive muito trabalhar pois Aprendi fazer ate sangria ou seja nesse mercado os funcionario acaba fazendo tds as tarefas
good,Walmart is a culture of its own. Generally shifts start off with a opening meeting. Assignments are given daily and you would get check on throughout the day
good,you have to be really strong to maintain your job there you have to be helping all the customers some are very rude and managers down your back it has its good and bad days but not everyone will like this job
good,Não é uma Empresa muito individual não gosta de ouvir as opiniões dos funcionários
good,Its fast pace and your on your feet all day! the breaks are too far apart . The management is friendly and we work as a family . I like my co workers .
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when you're working hard and customers or other associates compliments your work when your bosses don't. It was a good experience working for Wal-Mart though.
good,Running a cash register in helping them complete their purchases.  Stocking shelves and doing inventory on a monthly basis.  Customer service and management could have been better understanding of the employee.
good,"Working at Walmart daily was good, I would have liked to gear toward advancing in the management areas, but I was unable to stay at that location any longer.  At that time I did not have my own transportation.  The diversity of culture was good many people from different walks of life"
good,The associates are the glue that hold the stores together. Management comes and goes and the demands are endless. Walmart is going through some changes that will not be good in the coming year.Relieved I got out when I did.
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. There were too many managers assigning duties and I often wondered which one to listen to. I enjoyed my co-workers and interacting with customers.
good,Flexible hours. nothing too serious they provide great benefits and good pay for a single person. All you have to do is your job and arrive on time. There will be opportunity for career advancement.
good,"for the truck unloaders your always in the back room sometimes you have to stock the product as well, some managers are real jerks but there's also a couple of good ones."
good,It was a good place to work to get back into the job market. I had been retried for six years and they were willing to hire me. And they were willing to here any ideas I had to make work more productive.
good,"I learned how to zone a department, stocking merchandise, binning,doing go backs and more. Management is not quite good when it comes to their employees they prioritize customers opinion than employees.the workplace culture is ok, the hardest part of the job is how to please the management and encounters those customers with bad attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with my co associates."
good,Walmart for me was a very highly paced atmosphere. The culture wasnt so so great. But one some pros of Walmart is that you get awesome benefits and discounts. This is a job where your security high. And one can live off the salary earned.
good,"Walmart is a basic job. There is always room to advance but it takes time. I worked as a cashier and that's basically ringing and scanning customer items all day long. After your shift, you were required to stock some shelf items and clean the area."
good,It was a good place to work. I learned all that I could to try and make sure that my shift in my department ran smoothly. I took charge and made sure everybody got breaks and I covered them to make sure everyone was happy with the situation.
good,"Working at Walmart Canada isn't to bad of a job. It's laid back, environment is nice, employees are nice to work with. Even the management is nice. The only down part about the job in my opinion is the hours for the job can get ruff. Most of the time you wont get scheduled when you want to be."
good,"Just your typical job. Nothing special. They don't care much about their employees. Although the pay was okay, it wasn't really worth the stress and the little time off that we were given."
good,Walmart can be a difficult place to work for as you never know if your job is safe. Managment is decent and sometimes not professional in situations needed to be.
good,"Overall, Walmart was a fun and cooperative place of employment. They really worked with me with my pregnancy issues and that helped a lot. Yes I would consider working there again.."
good,"Hard work, long hours and customers can be harsh."
good,"I would say that this job may not have been the most engaging, however it is a necessary job. People shop here quite often and so it is necessary to have people work here."
good,"Working nights paid an extra $0.50 an hour which was nice, management was okay. Training as a stocker was easy although HBA was one of the worst departments to work in."
good,"helped to stock shelves and prepare for next business day.  management was ok for the most part but at times were very unrealistic as to what could and could not be done in the time we had."
good,"The management is so terrible at my previous location. I got into a car accident and they would still harass me about coming to work. The store manager was terrible, the customers are always very rude, you work sometimes more hours than expected because you cant leave until your line is empty.. and you have to complete an online course or they'll fire you.. then on top of that you can only miss a certain amount of days (5) before they fire you."
good,This is a alright place to work. I didnt stay long due to the vigorous work environment. The people that i worked with were nice and i enjoyed the customers.
good,was cold all winter.  They did not turn on the heat. Heat was controlled. in Arkansas. It was not a fun place to work Management did not train me.  I had to learn on my own and from other employees
good,"As a cashier, you deal with a lot of people. Some not as good as others. But those who aren't mean to you, makes the job worth it. They offer a decent pay for your work as well. For the most part the hours weren't too horrible. The worst part of the job was the management/ supervisors. They play favoritism among the cashiers. If you were one of the ""favorites"" the CSM/CSS would allow you to do almost anything you wanted to. Sometimes going to management about it was pointless because they didn't really care. I know a lot has changed since I have worked there, so it could be different now. But the management and supervisors were the biggest reason I felt like I had to leave this place."
good,"Worked with a good team"
good,"I would unload trucks,stock,order ,do inventory,sales planning, set up end caps,handle meetings with vendors,clean freezers. also help in grocery and dairy"
good,"It was okay but I was expected to go faster than I could and know more than I did. That's it I don't have more to say, I didn't work there long......."
good,Slow and management is no good also if you need time off you never get it and they slack on keeping there workers busy and they slack in training their workers
good,You have a job to do and they want no excuses  for why it doesn't get done. They can give you excuses but they don't want to hear yours. It can be a nice place to work if you stay to your self and avoid any conflicts.
good,"It was great in the beginning, in terms of last 6 months It was getting rough they wouldnt promote me. No communication. I made some great friends there. Just needed to explore other parts of store"
good,"its Walmart. not much more to say. its a stepping stone job that overworks its employees and treats them like slave rather then the ""valued workers"" they claim they are."
good,It was alright not my favorite place to work. Didn't really care for the night shift but it was easy and boring. Nothing special. people were nice and all.
good,"I don't think it is fair to lump all Walmart into same group. No business is better than its management. I was at Walmart 4 years and there were 5 different Store Managers. Hiring within is great to a point. It also keeps new ideas and competition out of the store, causing it to become stagnant."
good,this job was stressful they pay u 10.30 an hour but want you to work like your getting paid 15 an hour the managers are nasty to crew members and the store was dirty and unorganized
good,Walmart is a great starting point for anyone looking to advance themselves in any career opportunity.
good,Walmart is a good company to work. Has many different options of a career path within the company. A strong culture and foundation. Competitive compensation depending on the job title.
good,"Typical work day consisted of organizing breaks and lunches assigning a register to cashiers, and assisting customers with problems.  I have learned how to be a leader of many people. Hardest part of my job was working an inconsistant schedule.  Most enjoyable part of my job was the closing procedures while working with the frontend crew."
good,"El equipo gerencial pasa mínimo 12 hrs en el club - tienda hasta 24 o más de corrido. ne te permite tener una vida personal, el sueldo que recibes lo terminas dividiendo en los 3 turnos que trabajas y ganas lo mismo que un asociado que trabaja 8 hrs"
good,none at this time.it varies and depends on the person if u can deal with a lot of change all the time then your good if u have a family its hard to balance especially single parent families
good,"At a typical day at Walmart, I checked out customers on the register, helped them find items. The management did not work around my college schedule and tend to have favorites. The work environment is sometimes fast pace depending on the time of the day. While some days its very slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting employees and kind customers."
good,"Walmart is a very fast paced business,  usually a steady work environment. I learned how to talk to customers and coworkers. this job is very diverse and has all type of employees"
good,I really enjoyed my job and was paid fairly. Plenty of paid time off and employee discounts. Mandatory overtime was probably my biggest complaint. Lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. The customers are who made the job worth while.  The work load was overwhelming, not enough staff to get the jobs done."
good,"Extremely busy and customers can be very hard to deal with at times. Pay is decent for the job, great coworkers, management in my area of the store are great."
good,so been working for them for years but recently has become very difficult to work in the transition to tightening expenses and changes to tech which will ultimately lead to a lot less people needed to run the facility. The tech is cool but the writing on the wall is that you wont be needed. time to look elsewhere
good,It was a good first job for me. I got plenty of hours when I’m not in school because school takes up a lot of time. I’d recommend Walmart to people that I know to Walmart for a temporary job.
good,the best part when i was at Walmart was always unloading the truck.On truck days it go by faster do to the extra work to make the days go by faster. without no truck it wouldnt be nothing for any one to do.
good,My typical work day started making sure that my area was clean. Then I would check in vendors or do whatever the managers would like me to do. After everything was done I would have to do the paperwork for the end of the day and put it away. Then I would have to make sure my area was clean again
good,"More task then hours to complete, need more hours for associates to complete all the tasks. More complaining then complimenting. The morale is in need of management that cares about the people."
good,"flexible schedule, decent amount of hours, management is very friendly and helpful to new employees, pretty easy to get overtime if wanted, departments are good about helping each other out"
good,"-a typical day would be stocking from 10pm to 8am"
good,I would say if you are in a manager position your income will be stable if you can call it a income. The demand is high and everything is so political.
good,people can be jerks. it wasnt work the stress most days. the managers were incompetent to say the least and some of the other employees were not the best by far
good,Working with Walmart allowed my the opportunity of learn a new craft.   Walmart also allowed me the freedom to develop that craft and experience a great work environment.
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. There were too many managers assigning duties and I often wondered which one to listen to. I enjoyed my co-workers and interacting with customers.

good,manger where more consume with making sure no one had overtime then they did about the work place. Even when asked for thing that could help the employee they would never change anything and many thing couldn't be done
good,"consistant work and repeditive. fast pace, hard work sometimes. management can be a pain sometimes but if you work hard and fast they pretty much leave you alone"
good,"a typical day at work start at 2 unloading at truck for two hour after we take a break 15 min and everyone go to each dept to stock all the boxes from the truck, the hardest part of the job is trying to finish all the boxes at the end of the days."
good,This place is exactly what the news reports they do treat associates unfairly and uses salaried management as a tool to replace hours that are taken from associates.
good,i haven't worked there in quite a few years. The staff overall was good but every business has its good and bad. i was there for a year and met really good people co workers and customers.
good,Run all the freight that 3rd shift didn't do the night before. Make sure that all process are done for the day. Make sure that your department is zoned to their standards not theirs (mine was higher)
good,"If you were a man, it could be a great place to work. The money is pretty good. The lifting is brutal. Some of the things that you have to lift are extremely heavy."
good,walmart was all about providing service to the customer. the hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done in one day.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers
good,"Ever since I have worked for the company, I have received little to no raise in my salary. It is quite the slow process of even trying to get one and it is not even guaranteed"
good,this job is very demanding as most cashiers are expected to be happy all the time and the manager at a particular location was very demanding and didnt take into consideration the feelings of the workers
good,"It's good, but depends on the the manager's your working with."
good,Overall I think it is okay for younger people or those retired just looking for something to stay busy and a little extra income. For Walmart to be such a huge company their starting pay should be higher.
good,"Sales floor team members should be more aware of things. "
good,"Wal-Mart is a great part-time and or job to get into if your looking to get into management.Also, a great opportunity or a first time job. There is a lot of room to move up and be promoted."
good,The work was hard. alot of heavy lifting. Only as an overnight stocker was the pay worth it. Benefits were not that good and very costly for the employee
good,"It was a good job. I enjoyed my job at Wal-Mart, but the people to work for are always on your back.  They tended to try and provoke you into doing something wrong everyday."
good,"As a night shift stocker, my night would start at 10 pm and last until 6 am, 5 times a week. I learned how to properly stock a large department store and how to organize Walmart. The employees were very nice and unique, never had any problems with them. Hardest part of the job was working overnight then going to school in the morning, which is why I quit. Most enjoyable part was the freedom to go at your own pace and have a lot of space to roam."
good,I really enjoyed the position i worked at the facility. because my husband was offered a higher paying job by relocating to a different facility within the same company we moved.
good,Es una buena empresa te da las presentaciones de ley y es un buen ambiente laboral
good,Walmart treated me unfairly due to my good work ethic. They limited to the front end because I was great with customers and my job but they paid me unfairly as opposed to my coworkers while overworking me.
good,"It is what is expected from Wal-Mart, although I did have amazing co-workers and an excellent supervisor.  The hours weren't the best, but it was a job and one that I needed at the time."
good,Not much to be said. It's a large corporation that sucks you in with promises of advancement and a career when they just want temporary labor. They don't want long term associates.
good,"Room for advancement, completely unflexible on hours, no overtime, managers are generally pretty pleasant, good bit of breaks......................................."
good,"This job is physically demanding and requires a lot of stamina. You are faced with a large amount of packages to handle in a limited amount of  time. You have to work quickly and efficiently to get all your work done within your shift time. It can be stressful and sometimes feel overwhelming, especially the closer you get to the holidays as the amount of packages substantially increases. If you like a challenge and don't mind hard work this is a good job to have."
good,"walmart is a fine place to work whether your position is door greater, cashier , stocker, or the different departments within walmart you will find which ever is the right fit for you"
good,"Worked as a manager here and found it to be extremely stressful with the work week typically going from 50 to 60 hours, but it taught me alot and I think its a great learning experience."
good,It was a fun job and all of the managers where easy to get along with. The only downside was the pays was not very good and they liked to cut hours depending on the time of month.
good,"Well lets be real, retail is retail. There's a lot of days where you consider throwing your name badge at management and quitting, not even gonna lie about that one and some days you might even want to punch a customer. The pay is good for retail but bad for living, the quarterly bonuses are nice, you get lots of discounts on other things like phone plans, flexible with hours. In the end is it worth it? Ha, no. "
good,"Walmart is a job most suitable for those looking for part-time employment.  Although the pay would be considered good for this type of work, it is not enough -- especially since hours per week are often uncertain -- to sustain a decent lifestyle as an adult. My employment there was only meant to be temporary. Standing for hours at a time can be rough on the body. Yet, I have enjoyed developing a rapport with customers. It has given me great pleasure to see them leave with a smile, or even a laugh."
good,I liked the majority of people I worked with and it was fun. It was also just working at Walmart though.I worked at one of the better facilities for sure and I miss some people.
good,It was nothing fancy. You moved boxes every day all day. The management was adequate at best aside for a few outliers. I did make some friends while I worked there and I still keep up with them.
good,"There is a Walmart store almost anywhere. It is a great place to work. Great way to practice and exercise good team building skills.  Overall, I would recommend Walmart to anyone"
good,I got along with 90% of my co-workers and management team. The hours were all over the place. Some mornings following late nights. It was hard on my family life.
good,loved working with the customers and meeting new people in the communities. Walmart does offer some help in communities but over the years greed has been the goal of the company. Anything to make more money.
good,start the shift by breaking down pallets. It was nice we had 3 breaks and a lunch. The managers were pretty chill.it was like I had a free gym membership. I would work there again.
good,The managers often check up on you and watch u while u work then give u feedback on how you could improve this and that.Some days it was hectic and others it was more relaxed.
good,"This was to be expected. It is a job, pays the bills, and straight to the point. Nothing shocking. Go to work, stay out of people's business, and do your job."
good,Walmart was ok to work for. They sent me through classes themselves. Their management was ok. They just tend to lay several people off every year. Doesn't seem stable to me.
good,Not bad for a summer job. Worked 3-4 days a week. wasn't very challenging work but dealing with customers can be a challenge. Required to be very friendly even when they are not being.
good,Great people doing great things... a passion to succeed everyday.
good,"Alright job. Not something I would like to do for a life career. It doesn't have the greatest pay for starting out, but I do like that your pay grade raises based on not only position but also your experience."
good,"Decent job, people are pretty good, however hours and days worked are inconsistent and pay raises were almost insulting they were so bad at that time."
good,"Tem práticas boas, porém, nem sempre correspondem ao discurso interno. Promoções demoradas. Discurso de 'capital humano' não chega na ponta em termos efetivos. Supervisores não são pessoas que pensam, apenas que obedecem de modo rígido."
good,Lots of skills were learned here and management could be better for employees to stay longer. As an employee i did not feel valued. Team effort could also be better.
good,"I started out as a cashier, moved to lawn and garden, became full time as a truck unloader, became deli manager, and worked in bakery. Learned a lot as i moved up the ladder."
good,On a typical day you o'clock in go to your register make sure that was clean bags were set up work area was nice and neat and start taking care of customers as they showed up to your register. During your schedule you would take care of customers in between customers make sure there was no debris on the floors go red which meant wait for customers and let them know you are open
good,"I did have a good time working there, I learned how to make displays, stock/rotate product. Check for expired products, My favorite part of the job was the crew I worked with, Everyone was pleasant and easy to get along with."
good,"Start: Open customer service desk."
good,"I worked overnight. We stocked, received truck and inventory. I loved this job didnt have to deal with customer. Stock your area make surr its clean go home."
good,"Since i join work, there where all types of changes, one that i did not like was having to have a new manager every month, Walmart was getting together, before i left the store got a new starting paying rate that was 11, great pay for easy work."
good,the Walmart i work at is stressful the management act like they don't care about my needs. not a good place to work. I work for ogp and people act like we don't do any work when we make over 75% of the money. they never appreciate the good but be quick to point out the bad.
good,It was not a horrible company to work for years ago but it has since went down hill. They worked with my school schedule pretty well and was pretty understanding.
good,great place to work. enjoyed my time there. lots of growth potential. lots of on the job training. needs to be more salary competitive for amount of work required.
good,"The place is fine you'll get hours and paid fine. Sometimes customers can get nasty but they'll get over it. The managment there was not military friendly, I'm currently serving and I was told that my military job was getting in the way of my job there so I left."
good,Learning different parts of the store was really helpful because when I had to help customers I knew exactly how to assist them. Was thrown in a lot of departments so I was able to adapt quickly and I became a fast learner.
good,"This model is the replacement for, and continues the tradition of the EOS 5000/88, marketed in January 1995 and the EOS 3000/88, marketed in March 1999, which were very popular because of their affordability, small size, light weight, ease of operation, and silent operation. It is intended mainly for the East European and Asian markets."
good,"wouldn't go back there to work as they do not have the work hours required to make a half decent pay, no benefits because you don't get enough hours to qualify for them."
good,"resets of department, sporting goods associate the sale of guns and ammo, fishing, hunting permits, cashier."
good,I worked for Walmart for 16+ years. All 16+ years on third shift. I started at the entry level and worked my way up to hourly supervisor. The majority of my experience with the company was positive.
good,supervises do not know how to lead and managers did not train the supervises. they would give 14-16 hours worth of work to be done it an 8 hour shift then get mad when it did not get done.
good,"a typical mourning come in at 4:58 strech for ten min, we talk about how much work we have for today, find location of work station, start working, clean as we go. the hardest job is getting the numbers they ask of us. the most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers. what i learned is that team work makes the day go smoothly."
good,"Good Job, Management just has to do better getting organized..."
good,Job was good.  Loved the set schedule.  friendly people.  Pay is not that good and benefits are horrible.  General manager was easy to work with and very nice.
good,More often than not you can find yourself taking on a workload that is way more than you should be doing alone. Customers can be very unruly on average. Employees don't always have a positive attitude.
good,Offers many opportunities to advance and learn new skills. The culture allows you the chance to connect and make friends. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the number of customers and maintain your area.
good,"ok experience, managment up on you a little too much, people there made it better, pay higher then minimum wage base on work experience. overall ok expereince"
good,Would work long hours at all times and would not be adequately paid for this. Had to work long hours at holiday times as well and was really tired when got off.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is the usual, lots of people and buying more than what you came in for. The most enjoyable apart of the job was interacting with a diverse of people."
good,Fun if you can set your mind to finishing a single task. But no time for anything else. You have to meet your goals on a daily basis. Not recommend if you get stressed out easily.
good,Must complete tasks before your time limit. I learned that don't be afraid of asking your manager about your task. But also learned about some managers isn't going to give any advice on your task I had to learn quickly. Besides of the work it was a very fun and appreciated experience for me.
good,Empresa está em cima do muro entre se adequar à realidade brasileira ou impor a cultura que usam nos EUA.
good,"My brief time with Walmart was interesting.  I had a great opportunity to meet some really great people. It was an honor to work among some of the most humble people I ever met outside of church. I met people who went above the call of duty to ensure that customers, in particularly the elders and the handicap, received noteworthy service.  It was a privilege and an honor to service people who was kindhearted and valued the service received. "
good,Aprendi a lidar com vendas pois era minha primeira experiencia.
good,sans commentaire à complèter plus tard pour le moment
good,"I loved working with my coworkers, management was excellent, when a customer complains management will usually take your side and help you explain the situation"
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. I'm just looking for work to better myself and my  family. I've had good and bad experiences but what job doesn't. Overall I would recommend walmart to younger people if you haven't already been there for years.
good,I like working here but I had to be put on leave because I had my baby and no one to keep him so when I finally got a babysitter they wouldn't let me come back to work there.
good,"Well lets be real, retail is retail. There's a lot of days where you consider throwing your name badge at management and quitting, not even gonna lie about that one and some days you might even want to punch a customer. The pay is good for retail but bad for living, the quarterly bonuses are nice, you get lots of discounts on other things like phone plans, flexible with hours. In the end is it worth it? Ha, no. "
good,"Walmart is a job most suitable for those looking for part-time employment.  Although the pay would be considered good for this type of work, it is not enough -- especially since hours per week are often uncertain -- to sustain a decent lifestyle as an adult. My employment there was only meant to be temporary. Standing for hours at a time can be rough on the body. Yet, I have enjoyed developing a rapport with customers. It has given me great pleasure to see them leave with a smile, or even a laugh."
good,I liked the majority of people I worked with and it was fun. It was also just working at Walmart though.I worked at one of the better facilities for sure and I miss some people.
good,It was nothing fancy. You moved boxes every day all day. The management was adequate at best aside for a few outliers. I did make some friends while I worked there and I still keep up with them.
good,"There is a Walmart store almost anywhere. It is a great place to work. Great way to practice and exercise good team building skills.  Overall, I would recommend Walmart to anyone"
good,I got along with 90% of my co-workers and management team. The hours were all over the place. Some mornings following late nights. It was hard on my family life.
good,loved working with the customers and meeting new people in the communities. Walmart does offer some help in communities but over the years greed has been the goal of the company. Anything to make more money.
good,start the shift by breaking down pallets. It was nice we had 3 breaks and a lunch. The managers were pretty chill.it was like I had a free gym membership. I would work there again.
good,The managers often check up on you and watch u while u work then give u feedback on how you could improve this and that.Some days it was hectic and others it was more relaxed.
good,"This was to be expected. It is a job, pays the bills, and straight to the point. Nothing shocking. Go to work, stay out of people's business, and do your job."
good,Walmart was ok to work for. They sent me through classes themselves. Their management was ok. They just tend to lay several people off every year. Doesn't seem stable to me.
good,Not bad for a summer job. Worked 3-4 days a week. wasn't very challenging work but dealing with customers can be a challenge. Required to be very friendly even when they are not being.
good,Great people doing great things... a passion to succeed everyday.
good,"Alright job. Not something I would like to do for a life career. It doesn't have the greatest pay for starting out, but I do like that your pay grade raises based on not only position but also your experience."
good,"Decent job, people are pretty good, however hours and days worked are inconsistent and pay raises were almost insulting they were so bad at that time."
good,"Tem práticas boas, porém, nem sempre correspondem ao discurso interno. Promoções demoradas. Discurso de 'capital humano' não chega na ponta em termos efetivos. Supervisores não são pessoas que pensam, apenas que obedecem de modo rígido."
good,Lots of skills were learned here and management could be better for employees to stay longer. As an employee i did not feel valued. Team effort could also be better.
good,"I started out as a cashier, moved to lawn and garden, became full time as a truck unloader, became deli manager, and worked in bakery. Learned a lot as i moved up the ladder."
good,On a typical day you o'clock in go to your register make sure that was clean bags were set up work area was nice and neat and start taking care of customers as they showed up to your register. During your schedule you would take care of customers in between customers make sure there was no debris on the floors go red which meant wait for customers and let them know you are open
good,"Working at Walmart was extremely easy and was never really anything to stress about, it’s just not a place to advance unless that’s what you look forward to doing and plan on working there for years but overall not too bad"
good,Its Walmart spend an hour there as a customer and you will have all the same complaints hourly associate make. The associate are good folks doing the best with what they got. Upper managment and home office changes there mind so often there always work to do redoing what you did just a week prior. Hours are good most the year except from january to march when hours are slashed big time for hourlys.
good,"I was look forward to working at walmart, my co wrokers are very nice, same with the management team, the management team is easy to talk to and is very understanding."
good,"Help customers with questions, purchases, and carry outs. Stocked, and cleaned area. Overall easy job. You worked your shift, and go home. Customers, and managers can be annoying."
good,"Although managent has changed for the better, the previous culture is still existant. Once management learns how to communicate to staff with respect then things will be a lot better."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good starting point, in some cases may be the right career choice for many people who can climb the corporate ladder, Wal-Mart wasn't for me."
good,One problem that I often saw was the poor management at my Walmart. It either resulted in the loss of customers' time or the loss of the associates' well deserved break.
good,I got a chance to work with alot of good people and made alot of good friends when I work for Walmart before. I don't mind going back and work for them again
good,"It was fastpaced, and a long heavy work day. Had to unload between 1-2 trucks and there was no team lift involved. Had to stock shelves and it was more of an independent job."
good,"Very challenging work place.  Used computers and computerized registers.  Stock shelves, ordering inventory and keeping inventory organized."
good,it was an OK place to work but as the saying goes to many chefs and no indins. other then that it was a grate time and i worked with good people my manger  was a nice guy and listened.
good,"I work overnight Sunday through Friday Morning. I work really hard and I do my very best every night. I like working in apparel but I am put elsewhere when certain mangers are there. The management does not care about where you excel, they are all on a power trip. It's not a company that I would recommend working for unless you can handle being treated unfairly. The dress code is relaxed which I like but that is not a reason to stay at a job."
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun place to work, but it was only an interim position, had no benefits as was interim, was paid minimally  wage at the time, and could not meet standard cost of living, as I didn`t have enough  hours. Otherwise I really enjoyed working with the customers."
good,The location of the walmart that i worked at was the only thing that i did not  like. My shift supervisors were nice and the pay was okay but the store manager and front end manager were horrible.
good,fun fun fun stayed busy all the time love working with the people my boss was great my co workers were alot of help when i first started working there
good,It is a good job to work in if you have a lot of free time on your hands and are flexible to work what they want to want to. Also depending on which one you do it can be stressful with handful of customers you get on a daily.
good,"The managers like to pick favorites out of the cashiers and if you arent a favorite then you wont get breaks on time and you wont get bathroom breaks when you need them. i was yelled at because i ""used the restroom too frequently"" when it was maybe twice in a 8 hour shift on the clock. They allowed their favorites to be late and wear leggings but when i was even two minutes late and wore pants that looked like leggings i would get written up. Other coworkers were allowed to wear all their piercings but i got yelled at for my nose ring. It was a very unfair and competitive environment."
good,"It was decent part-time work for a young person, but I don't recommend anyone seek a prolonged career in Walmart. I ended up working 30+ hours in a week plus volunteer work in other businesses in town, and Walmart hardly tried to accomodate the two days a week I asked for time off (even if I scheduled them off 3 weeks in advance)."
good,Decent place to work with competitive pay.  I feel that they should take more time with their employees before terminating.  I would like to work with them again.
good,This job was a good stepping stone for me. There was no way for advancement. That was my only major issue with the company. Management was great when you needed them.
good,Wal-Mart could be a good place to work they just need to work on thier management skills and treat their employees with more respect and better managers.
good,"Responsible for receiving merchandise, unloading or unpacking it, marking it with codes to be identified, stocking shelves. Works in stores, warehouses, stockrooms and heavy lifting."
good,I learned management walks and demands.  Employees do as much as they can during the work day yet it will never meet or comply with what is demanded of you
good,"great workplace, loves veterans, easy work, great people to work with and great people to work for, hours are flexible, competitive pay, great starting pay"
good,Great people  fast paced. myself and other cashiers would have little contests. the hardest part of the job is the slow time when there is nothing to do
good,"Walmart always had work and hours available.  However, there was no steady schedule.  My hours varied from week to week - so it kind of throw off my family and extra curricular time."
good,I would not readily recommend someone to work for the Walmart company as I feel they do not fully appreciate and value their employees. They do not pay the required wages for the amount of work that is done.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was a great choice for me to make as a college student. However, since the policies have changed due to scheduling, I wouldn’t recommend college students to work there due to the amount of hours available to people with a certain availability."
good,"I feel after working at this Walmart in Ny, the management is over worked and the same with the employees. The people are great to work with, and the pay is okay."
good,working at walmart was different because i got to see the receaving end for the regular consumer and so i liked that the job was rough but pretty good when you have people to work with
good,"it was an easy job and I learned everything that I needed to learn and they helped me whenever I needed any help, whenever I needed off they let me off"
good,"Had to meet deadlines"
good,It was easy. Good job to learn how to deal with people who are rude and to work on your customer service skills. Very easy and repetitive work. Recommend for first job but not as a final job.
good,Long term career possibilities and growth are available.  The company culture has changed over the past 10 years.  It is still a good company to work for and the pay is equal to the workload.
good,"Although I enjoyed my tenure at Walmart (more or less), the dark cloud that is ""production"" was constantly looming overhead. It was definitely less noticeable in certain departments but if you let it slip your mind for even a second, it could seriously endanger your employment."
good,"the typical day at Walmart was relaxed, I learned about how unhealthy the sandwich meat e buy. the management was a little off when I started but got better, there was nothing hard about this job."
good,Work is slow paced and there is not enough work to do. Employees slow down their work pace so they will have something to do. Customers are usually nice but sometimes they are unreasonable.
good,"I worked as a retail associate, and it was my first time holding such a role. It was a worthy learning experience, and it was my first stable job. However, the employer was unfair in the hiring process."
good,"working at Wall-Mart , was a very interesting time, they change your hour on a whim, other than that it was a  good place to be employed  "
good,"no enough pay , but managers cool, very fast paced work a big workload, lot of responsibility to get your work done daily. I would not recommend Walmart to adults it for teens"
good,I would arrive at Walmart at around 10pm. I would begin to break down all the boxes according to what aisles they would be going into. I would then take the product out of the boxes and put it where it needed to go accordingly. I would also help customers with any needs that they had as far as customer service goes.
good,Walmart is a horrible Play Store they don't give you raises they pay you basically minimum wage they were heated death the only good thing is you get a hour lunch.
good,"I would greet and help customers and fellow associates, zone the whole apparel department and make sure clothes were folded neatly and hangers were put on the shelves properly, and take items from the back of the store and put them out on the sales floor."
good,"Great place to work if you're salary. Pretty tough place to work if you're hourly. That pretty much sums up the experience in two short sentences. I would work there again, only as a salaried employee."
good,"Working there was a good steady pace. I loved working in the meat department, it was very cold in the freezer but it was very nice seeing the process how the meat and pother products is labeled!"
good,The management wasn't horrible but could have been better. They were easy to talk to but got upset or irritated when you brought concerns to their attention.
good,The job was easy to learn on what im supposed to do. Some managers weren't that friendly which made work stressful and uncomfortable to work at. Hours weren't the best to have to make a living.
good,"I would definitely say I learned about how to work hard and deal with all types of co-workers and customers while I worked here. I definitely wouldn't ever have settled with it, I feel it would taken the life out of me at some point."
good,"hard work, OK pay, no work life balance for managers, good health insurance for full time. Good vacation policy for full time. Bonus structure is hit or miss"
good,"Working at Walmart was hit & miss, they gave overtime when they wanted but for the most part it was’nt any. The mangers there would help you when it’s needed, it is a teamwork heavy environment, but sometimes favoritism played a part."
good,they laid me off and closed out store. besides that it was great. good hours and bonuses. but they would not give everyone their positions back so that is not ok.
good,"Average work environment, It was great for a college kid who is figuring things out within there lives. Nothing worth doing long time in my opinion. So yea that's all i have"
good,"Fast pace work place, very stressful, would have stayed at this employment but needed full time hours and stable work environment. Great employees. CEO needs to care more about their employees and their families."
good,I have been pleased with Walmart but looking for better work / life balance now.  The company provides good compensation and good benefits but now it is not worth the time invested daily / weekly.
good,work with great people and management and the company have goo incentive to achieve and roon for advancement. would recommend any one to this company.
good,"Great place to work, with a variety of different jobs.  Possibilities for advancement are high.  Will work around your schedule and needs. Also offer great benefits for full-time employees."
good,"Fast paced working environment "
good,Walmart is a great environment to learn basic job skills. Everyday there is something different to do. Management is good but that depends on the store.
good,Overall I had an okay experience working there and chose to leave based on that I didn't have a lot of experience and my bosses pressured me to feel like I needed to excel above expectations to keep my job.
good,La empresa es buena a nivel mundial pero siempre depende de quien tenes trabajando al lado y las posibilidades q te da.
good,Its a great place to work and a learning place for whatever level your trying to achieve.Most of the management crew are great to work with and easy to talk to.
good,A typical day at walmart will be depressing if there is no social accommodation. Talk to people and make friends because as a meat processor you will be by yourself all  day long.
good,"everything and every move comes down to the bottom line - they will preach customer service and taking care of the associates, but bottom line and Pand L will always come first."
good,"Walmart was the first company that I worked each day during the summer. I was still in high school and I worked around 30 hours a week. It was a lot of hours, but the pay was fair. Walmart customers were often irritated with the time it took for the employees to work. I also faced a lot of negativity from fellow employees as well. They often complained in front of the employees and they were agitated throughout all shifts, which made me slightly uncomfortable. Making schedule changes was difficult as well, ultimately my work experience at Walmart was ended because they would not allow me to change my hours when high school classes began again."
good,It was a steady job that gave me a moderate amount of work but never strived to push the employees or encourage them. The bosses are friendly and some of the coworkers can be quite pleasant.
good,there is alot of younger people that work for this company and the company is based off of numbers.  There are days that you will feel like you are not going to accomplish your tasks and there are great days.
good,Wal Mart is a great place to start in your working career. The days you work isnt hard and you get all your breaks and the team was very good at what they was there to do at Wal Mart
good,"As a Greeter, my typical day would consist of:"
good,"Friendly co workers, good benefits, and treats their employees well."
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Walmart. The staff were team players and I am a people's person so it was great being able to interact with the customers. It's fast paced but, I can say I had fun while working with the other staff."
good,I would come into work and look over the pass down. See if there was anything that needed to be finished. Management was fake nice and it was really annoying. The people there were all miserable so it made for a miserable experience. The hardest part was showing up for a meaningless job.
good,Company with a vision to succeed in the future. Well inform and training program to keep associates abreast on  up and coming trends and technology .Company vision by managemendt is not consistent with all stores .
good,"it was a fast pace environment conversation was great while standing in line. Lines are fast pace and its very easy to learn things and the desk, line"
good,"a comfortable job .very little stress for me, but would have liked to have been compensated more in wages. Management was okay and co workers for the most part were friendly and helpful"
good,"The company is more worried about profit and loss than they are of the backbone of the company, the employee. I feel the employee helps to dictate the fate of the company and will help the company profit when they feel that they can make a difference and not told how and what to do."
good,I enjoyed my job with walmart. I was involved in accident on my own time and day and broke my right fibula and upon return they had no position for me
good,"Walmart's Customer Service Managers were ineffective in managing their department staff. Their failure to ensure adequate staffing required them to remove staff from other departments to serve as cashiers. This occurred on a daily basis. They lack leadership skills. For example, while staff from other departments served as cashiers to cover their department the Customer Service Managers merely stood at the entry to checkout lanes directing customers. Effective leaders pitch in to cover shortages. There always were several customer Service managers on duty and they should have taken initiative tp help operate their department. I was assigned to work in Electronics but wasn't given the opportunity to learn my job duties because within a minute of clocking in I was reassigned to work a register.  If you want to be a cashier you will have opportunities to work.."
good,nothing to say about Walmart. Okay job to have but not a great job security. But a great fun jib to have if you get hired you will enjoy working for them
good,I would not readily recommend someone to work for the Walmart company as I feel they do not fully appreciate and value their employees. They do not pay the required wages for the amount of work that is done.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was a great choice for me to make as a college student. However, since the policies have changed due to scheduling, I wouldn’t recommend college students to work there due to the amount of hours available to people with a certain availability."

good,"Slow place, some management are rude and dont do anything but boss you around. Discount is nice and they said you would get a pay raise but only if you complete training exercises which they never let you do,could pay more"
good,"Working for this employer depends mostly, if not entirely, upon the management within the particular store that you work for. If communication and respect and knowledge and effective leadership aren't all present within each of the members of the managerial staff, then it is hard to feel like you work for a store that runs smoothly, much less appreciates you. It also becomes more difficult to care about doing a good job, when you don't see good leadership. I have worked for some stores that have good managers and others that don't so much."
good,"Interesting place of business, you always meet different race of people some bad but mostly good. Everyday is often not the same you'll never know what your day will turn out to be. You can't resist the urge to shop because you will always see the great bargains!!!!!!"
good,If your a blend in kinda  person this is the job for you I work for a year and a half for Wal-Mart with the hope of work place advancement and I was promised there was I did everything ask of me plus more and still I never even received an interview i was over looked every time very disappointed.
good,"The middle level management is very strong, as well as the core body of long term employees.  Many opportunities for movement within a the vast corporate structure."
good,"Make provision for a quality customer service delivery"
good,"I liked working there, it was a good job at the time. I liked the people I worked with and the environment there. my mother also worked there so that kind of made it like a home feeling while I worked there"
good,Walmart had to many team leads and not enough workers. I did like the advancement system they had in place. I started off as a weekend warrior and landed a Customer Services position within 1and half years.
good,"its a good job to start off with, most places are only part time, at walmart you work 8 hours (most days) but you cant be lazy to excell and it sucks when you work hard but your team doesnt then everyone fails"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. It teaches you patience on a daily and how to deal with all walks of life of people. A typical day is a very busy day.
good,"pay isn't good enough nor hours, no benefits and management does not care about employees.long lines with few cashiers and they expected u to move fast"
good,"Walmart did not pay me for pharmaceutical work, and the management was not very helpful and really cold "
good,"mi horario era variable, descansaba entre semana, era auxiliar de farmacia, hacia planogramas, escaneo y limpieza, recibia la mercancia y la checaba antes de que la agregaran al sistema, dispensaba la medicina a los clientes, despachaba en el cajero, revisaba la receta medica por si habia posible falsificacion, checaba la temperatura ambiental y refrigerador. Estas actividades lo hacia de lunes-miercoles."
good,The people at this specific walmart don't care about their employees as much as they say they do. They move you all around the store and don't raise your pay in work areas that require you to do so.
good,"People will say a lot about this company, but if you go in do your job you will do well. Different stores have different cultures, not every store is the same. I’ve work for 3 stores. My first store was very policy based and they management pushed you to excel at you job. Management can be hard on you at times but they want you to excel and help the store/company grow. There is always a place to move to in the company"
good,"I learned about how retail works behind the scenes, hardest part of the job is the lifting. Most people are good to work with. Good managers. Helping customers is the goal of the day."
good,"Walmart is a place for opportunities. There is so much to choose from such as: stock, modular team, cashier, deli, etc.  There is always something for you at Walmart."
good,it was a job that was long and stressful. it was a good job though and i enjoyed working there.it just did work out in the end. the people were very nice.
good,"I only worked in Maintenance position for Walmart. Their health care is costly, but good. There was poor communication with the "
good,"I cashiered hundreds of people a day, people work hard and stay busy. Customers make the job interesting whether it was good or bad. Walmart was an okay job."
good,"I am happy working with walmart. I am working as an orderfiller. i got good money and the schedule is flexible. If you work hard, you""ll get along with all managers, which is a good thing"
good,Fast paced with multitasking responsibilities. Accountable for anything asked of you during working hours. Smaller than Supercenter. The neighborhood Walmart is more convenient for just those buying groceries and household items.
good,"It was a good place to work. The people where friendly and the direct supervisors knew what to do. Upper management wasn't the best. They didn't do the job correctly, and didn't work the the associates."
good,"The work place is great to work in, meeting and greeting people and helping them with their shopping is great, expectations in associate responsibility are moderate to high.work load can get excessive."
good,"When it comes to the employees, Walmart needs a lot of work understanding their employers. It would be nice if they would listen to employers in regards to grievance."
good,working at Walmart was challenging.  Dealing with many different characters in every customer was sometimes challenging but over all enjoyed meeting different people.  Very fast paced but made the shift go fast.
good,Excelente empresa lo único que está mal de acuerdo a mí criterio son los sueldos que manejan hacia sus colaboradores
good,The job was fast paced and there was a lot of customer interaction.  I liked it there.  Most customers were friendly but some were difficult.  I learned a lot.
good,the job is fast past but the manager are not the great they want you to do 12 or more hours of work in 8 and then there hardly any graduate if you can do that
good,"As a cashier, I learned how to handle cash and developed good interpersonal skills. A typical day at work is fairly relaxed. You're alotted two breaks per 8 hour shift. Coworkers are friendly and pay is adequate."
good,Walmart is a job that requires you to be on time and work as expected pto is gathered throughout the year the they hire either full time or part time regular associates are paid hourly.
good,Was a great introductory job. Working at Walmart taught me a lot about myself as well as what I am looking for in a company that I want to dedicate my time to.
good,"The people I worked with were nice, and even though the job I had was considered one of the harder jobs in the store it wasn’t that bad. I wish management would’ve cared a little more about the concerns of employees though."
good,"Management did not work well with employees"
good,"Involves talking to customers all day along. Prospecting, Explaining, Closing and Wrapping the sale. Asking for referrals for business growth. 24/7 Job ."
good,"You always had to watch your back as a manager, because you were always watched under a microscope.  Great bunch of associates at store but company got away from family values and customer service"
good,I'm in college and they were really difficult to talk to about scheduling . they would give you the run around and would have an attitude when you finally got in touch with someone.
good,"Always busy, learned a lot about presentation. A lot of cleaning to do on a daily basis. Customers very junkie and violent. The discount  does not work on rollback or food.The most enjoyable part being able to have stock in the company."
good,"a typical day is very peaceful, as long as you are good and quick when it comes to restocking whatever aisle they put you on for that day. The managers are usually cool and nonbothering."
good,This is a very competitive job. The hours vary depending on what needs to be done. If other employees don't finish their jobs before they leave then you are required to finish for them. This is a poorly managed company now.
good,"This store was very clean and the training i had was very good. had a lot of product to stock because it was the busiest Walmart in the state, the hardest part of the job had to be the big load of stock and being alone."
good,Physically demanding at times and sometimes stressful. Good place for those fresh out of high school or still in. Good job to build character and a good work ethic.
good,Walmart is a great working experience if your good at customer service and its good to have as a first job because its a great way to learn a lot. What i didnt like was there was a lot of favoritism!
good,Good crew to work with in the Tire and Lube section. Unfortunate that most positions are part time with no room for true advancement or incentive to move up.
good,"Challenging, but rewarding. Retail is a fast pace environment and one must be able and willing to challenge themselves to motivate and inspire others to perform at their best."
good,It was no over time and no raises and hard to move up but it was good customer service experience to learn about and how to deal with different people for when you are ready to apply for a different position.
good,"Friendly environment, fast paced work, constant standing, clean place to work. Nice customers and management . Walmart is a great starter job for a high school student."
good,"The company changes constantly, updating policies and processes. They always push for the best customer service, and it's ultimately up to each stores sales floor associates and department managers to run the store and make it successful. Self motivation is a must, the salaried management team aren't the ones being productive, or representative of policy follow through."
good,Basic job good for a college student . Could use more employees. They always expect the area to look nice but it can be impossible when customers are shopping consistently.
good,"if you need to support yourself and don't have much experience under your belt, wal mart is the place to be "
good,empresa de grande porte mais com poucas oportunidades de crescimento
good,management was bad hours were sometimes inconsistent but not terrible other than that it  wasn't bed except management sometimes wasn't nice to employees under them
good,"I loved this job. I really enjoyed being around people. I worked at Walmart during Christmas season it wasn’t as overwhelming as I had thought, but there were more customers than usual. I liked the fast pace work though."
good,Dia a dia corrido e com mudanças de setor e possibilidade de crescimento na empresa.
good,Good job if you like to be left alone and do what you have to do.
good,It's only a great job for the benefits. Some of the management is rude. I started out as a cashier and then switched over to the Cap 1 Team. The supervisor doesn't train people right at all.
good,Walmart had to many team leads and not enough workers. I did like the advancement system they had in place. I started off as a weekend warrior and landed a Customer Services position within 1and half years.
good,"its a good job to start off with, most places are only part time, at walmart you work 8 hours (most days) but you cant be lazy to excell and it sucks when you work hard but your team doesnt then everyone fails"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. It teaches you patience on a daily and how to deal with all walks of life of people. A typical day is a very busy day.
good,"pay isn't good enough nor hours, no benefits and management does not care about employees.long lines with few cashiers and they expected u to move fast"
good,"Walmart did not pay me for pharmaceutical work, and the management was not very helpful and really cold "
good,"mi horario era variable, descansaba entre semana, era auxiliar de farmacia, hacia planogramas, escaneo y limpieza, recibia la mercancia y la checaba antes de que la agregaran al sistema, dispensaba la medicina a los clientes, despachaba en el cajero, revisaba la receta medica por si habia posible falsificacion, checaba la temperatura ambiental y refrigerador. Estas actividades lo hacia de lunes-miercoles."
good,The people at this specific walmart don't care about their employees as much as they say they do. They move you all around the store and don't raise your pay in work areas that require you to do so.
good,"People will say a lot about this company, but if you go in do your job you will do well. Different stores have different cultures, not every store is the same. I’ve work for 3 stores. My first store was very policy based and they management pushed you to excel at you job. Management can be hard on you at times but they want you to excel and help the store/company grow. There is always a place to move to in the company"
good,"I learned about how retail works behind the scenes, hardest part of the job is the lifting. Most people are good to work with. Good managers. Helping customers is the goal of the day."
good,"Walmart is a place for opportunities. There is so much to choose from such as: stock, modular team, cashier, deli, etc.  There is always something for you at Walmart."
good,it was a job that was long and stressful. it was a good job though and i enjoyed working there.it just did work out in the end. the people were very nice.
good,"I only worked in Maintenance position for Walmart. Their health care is costly, but good. There was poor communication with the "
good,"I cashiered hundreds of people a day, people work hard and stay busy. Customers make the job interesting whether it was good or bad. Walmart was an okay job."
good,"I am happy working with walmart. I am working as an orderfiller. i got good money and the schedule is flexible. If you work hard, you""ll get along with all managers, which is a good thing"
good,Fast paced with multitasking responsibilities. Accountable for anything asked of you during working hours. Smaller than Supercenter. The neighborhood Walmart is more convenient for just those buying groceries and household items.
good,"It was a good place to work. The people where friendly and the direct supervisors knew what to do. Upper management wasn't the best. They didn't do the job correctly, and didn't work the the associates."
good,"The work place is great to work in, meeting and greeting people and helping them with their shopping is great, expectations in associate responsibility are moderate to high.work load can get excessive."
good,"When it comes to the employees, Walmart needs a lot of work understanding their employers. It would be nice if they would listen to employers in regards to grievance."
good,working at Walmart was challenging.  Dealing with many different characters in every customer was sometimes challenging but over all enjoyed meeting different people.  Very fast paced but made the shift go fast.
good,"you get there and clock in, scan your badge and check your to-do list, such as zoning your department and stocking shelves, or taking inventory. also set up displays."
good,"Good coworkers, always making sure l had what was need for production would move fast. Great customer service was very important to have working for Walmart."
good,"Good benefits, good coworkers with great attitude. I began with the evening shift and was able to be home to be with my kids for breakfast. Also was able to work with my kids in the day, why l enjoyed my shift."
good,I made a lot of friends while working there. I really enjoyed the time i spent there and would recommend it to anybody. The pay is not the best but if you wanted to stick with it and get full time some how then the pay is pretty good.
good,"Walmart was a good place to work. I enjoyed what I did and the people I worked with. The hours of work were not unbearable, the only reason I left was because I had an oppurtunity to start my own business."
good,While I worked here it was something to get me by and that is exactly what it was doing. The work wasn't hard but the hours began to get cut more and more and I couldn't afford to stay.
good,it is fine but not enough hours needs better management. needs to treat employees better. pay was good. needs to listen to input from employees. not to be one sided in listening
good,Buena empresa para laborar y ambiente de trabajo bueno prestaciones buenas tambien.
good,Cashiering should be temporary and not forever but Walmart is a cool job for temporary or part time to get money and build up not forever but if u want a career that would be great
good,not enough staff and not flexible or accommodating to new/young associates. Favourtism is a big issue especially when it comes to full time associates. too many relatives woeking together
good,"always on the go, worked cash, customer service, and department manager. doing reports for inventory keeping sales floor stocked. ive learned how to control my emotions when dealing with angry customers, learned to use the computer programs, and much more. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are frustrated with a situation. the best part is working with the public and my coworkers"
good,I enjoyed the position but the lead crew was not very organized. Everything we did we did 2-3 times.  No team communication. There seemed to be alot of hostility amongest themselves.
good,walmart is the starting point of many individuals especially students who wish to work while studying. it is a great way to make money on the side while focusing on school.
good,"My day at Walmart was pretty solid yet when seasonal change comes around it can get pretty hectic, but fun if your co workers are positive. Not many complaints from Walmart at all besides the pay wasn't really there to support the cost of living."
good,Walmart is a place that sucks the good out of good people. A place that makes you wonder if bad people are just good people who at one point worked at Walmart.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to meet new people every day. It has great customer service.  The working environment is  a great place to be at
good,"This job was a tad slow at first but once they train you and let you go out on your own, it gets a lot better. The coworkers were the actual best part of working there because the management seems to pay no attention to anyone below them. I actually made it through a full day once where they completely didn't give me any breaks and when I spoke up about it, the manager on duty claimed to have ""forgotten"". Nonetheless, it's a no from me."
good,A good day on Cap Team 2 would be a day where we didn't have any trucks to unload. The whole team would be re-assigned to the work floor to demonstrate great customer service and improve the store quality.
good,It was an ok experience. It involved a lot of heavy work to do but it was nice after all. The co-workers always tried to help each other in times of difficulties.
good,my team loads merchandise off of truck and neatly separate so that it can reach sales floor without any damage .
good,"The store I worked for was fairly successful. (ie busy/profitable)"
good,Depending on your work ethic depends on how far you go and how much you are willing to do for the company. If you do so much work they will put more on you to make sure things are getting completed
good,i was always busy helping in other areas than my own area cause of always being short handed. i didnt mind switching around sometimes cause then i got to learn many things.
good,"It was an alright place to work.  The people there were very nice and they helped me when I needed it.  It was very boring, and the management was lacking."
good,Your scheduled 9 hours a day with two 15 min break and and hour lunch. Part time workers work 4 days a week. The management needs to pay more attention to the employees.
good,it was not great but it was a good experience overall alot of gossip though i dont like it when someone talk bad about someone behind their back.some good managers and some where just rude .
good,"Shifts are long, people are rude, and you're on your feet the whole time. Equipment is frequently broken. Dealing with the raw meat can lead to blood dripping on you or foul smells."
good,Una gran empresa con buenos valores pero con un sueldo poco
good,"Great place to work, always something to do when the truck comes in, but management is everywhere. No one is ever really on the same page with things, and its filled with drama."
good,"Walmart gave me many great job opportunities. I was very shy before working, and my first job here as a cashier really made me come out of my shell. Becoming a pharmacy technician was a dream of mine that I got to fulfill as well"
good,The job is good and I have did it many time. The culture was lack in many department because of the upper management. The crew member voice was not heard of and it was tough get the point across for the customer.
good,just a place to get started no work station they just need you in the store for 40 hours you can only get 40 hours you work hard for others to get promoted with too much foolishness going on
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. It was a fun productive and set pace place to work. Friendly customers respectful and responsible managers. Easily to learn more or move above or ahead to another department.
good,Walmart was a ok job go to work if I was cashier that day smile and the costumer is always right when my shift was over count the money out and go home
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you have to. Its an honest job. If you want to you can advance within the company, but they will end up owning you in a way."
good,Great company to work for.  The compensation is not so great. They are committed to their employees.  Offer a lot of benefits and opportunities. You just need to apply yourself
good,"My time at walmart was always going to be short, it's not a job I would stay in forever but its not so bad and the people I worked with in the bakery were really nice."
good,"An okay place to work for. No room for advancement unless you've been in for years and years, and someone just so happens to be leaving or quit their job. Thats how it was for me at least."
good,It’s a great start to get a taste of what it is like to work in the real world. I just wish they didn’t cut hours & management help out when associates need it!!
good,not a super bad place to work pay is ok no vacation time working conditions are not the worst 1 hour lunches no benefits and worked just under 40 hours a week
good,"Great place to work, Enjoyed the time i was there. Made a lot of friends. Enjoyed the environment and the places and departments that I worked in. Good job"
good,"I worked there while pregnant, and while they pay very well, they werent as flexible with hours as much as the advertise. After my child was born they refused to cut me down to part time or to have me on a fixed schedule. I was unable to afford child care and with the hours they wanted me to work i couldnt stay with them."
good,"I had learnt a lot about different departments in Walmart, so I got experience in cashier, produce, deli ect. although I did get to learn a lot at times it did get in the way of the work needed in my department, I however persevered through it"
good,"A good place to work and it is more collaborative but  not a good pay company. jobs are not secured , they can fire at anytime especial low season period, for a beginning it might be a good place"
good,"It starts off very well, but your training is practically non-existent. Though, it is a friendly work environment the managers seem to have a lack of communication."
good,Empresa focada no atendimento aos clientes e nos resultados.
good,A good place to work.It is very flexable.They allow you the chance to better yourself by going to school and they work with you.They just do not offer full time employment unlees you are management.
good,the break room was awesome had tv vending machines. very friendly people. i just didnt like the hours i was working at the time. Great communication there
good,It's always a fast pace environment. I worked CO so I counted/reconciled everything you spent. I worked the overnight hours closing down the end of the day. So I counted every drawer and reset it for the next day. It was ok being stuck inside my little hole jamming on my radio.
good,"It was great at first until changes in management  occurred. Managers have no respect for the employees or department managers. They demand with no ""thank you"""
good,It was a good place to work it was fast paced always doing something helping the customer cleaning stocking shelves sweeping mopping vaccuming getting carts
good,"J'y ai travailler que peux de temps puisque j'ai déménagé deux mois après mon engagement. Mon expérience c'est bien dérouler. l'ambiance était conviviale, je n'ai pas vraiment de point négatif."
good,"I was a stocker, so I did not experience the cashiering. However, I still interacted with customers when I stocked the shelves, as well as pulling merchandise from the back. Quick paced and tedious, but if you could do it fast then it was not all too difficult."
good,A typical day at walmart is doing cashier duties and I learned to be friendly to people management was friendly and the culture was good the hardest part of the job was that you had to work fast and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people.
good,"When not slicing lunchmeat for customers, I would either be stocking up the case or making salads.  When finished with that, I would check and see what slicer needed to be cleaned, break down that slicer and clean it.  My manager would come by often to check on us and see if we needed anything.  The hardest part of my job was when customers asked for lunchmeat shredded.  That always killed my poor arms especially, those who wanted 1lb or 2lb.  The most enjoyable part was serving customers as a team."
good,Very friendly workplace. you'll receive 1hr lunches and 2 15 min breaks. I enjoyed working here because everyone was friendly and its an very welcoming job.
good,I got paid great. Great coworkers but the customers made the job awful. It was constantly busy and the managers were mean. A lot of standing around and we weren't able to move from our spot.
good,Working in the Walmart pharmacy is a faced paced atmosphere. You work along other side other technicians as a team to provide friendly customer service.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, mesmo com pouco tempo de empresa obtive ótimas experiencias."
good,"Good place to work. Relaxing, not to stressful. Fast pace when you hit rush hour. Ability to multitask. Fair on hours.  Not so boring. always something to do"
good,"There are definitely times when working at a place like Wal-Mart can be fun, with the right set of people and management. But, it is a highly stressful job, particularly when it comes to holidays."
good,They need to be more organized in how they deal with there employees. That being said Walmart is a good place to work for students trying to better them selves..
good,"When I started at Wal-Mart I was perfectly OK  with the job of cart pushing and not having managers watch over us every minute of the day. That part gave the job a bit of freedom and allowed us to do what is necessary to be efficient at our job. As time went on however we found out that when we did run into a situation that required a manager's hand not only did they take forever to actually fix the problem, they didn't follow up so the problem just kept happening the second they turned their backs again. If we bothered them again about it they just ignored us thinking the problem would be solved or that they just did not want to deal with it. Long story short, the job is fine as long as you are OK with management basically ignoring your existance."
good,It's a job but can be stressful and dramatic due to nature of customer.
good,I had a nice experience at walmart but I do feel management could use some training. I had a good work/life balance but they wanted me to work for the most part any time instead of my availability which is where I had issues.
good,Better than many other retail or part time jobs in the area. Too much work expected from you and not always respected for working hard. Would recommend for a first job.
good,"The work load is always unmanageable.  There is no ceiling at Walmart.  I don't have a lot of polite things to say about the way Walmart operates, however, there are a lot of good people who work at Walmart and a lot of good customers who shop there.  I feel as though the business structure could be geared more towards ethics."
good,"This job is simply not for everyone, its warehouse it cut throat and there is no getting around anything. Very fast paced. If you plan on going to school its not for you."
good,"Preaches an open door policy, but rarely is it practiced and only by a few managers. For the most part not a horrible place to work, but can be unbearable and annoying if you're stuck with management that doesn't care or doesn't listen."
good,"I worked 3rd shift stocking shelves and it was a fast pace shift..you have time limits to get your jobs done,some are accurate times some are hard to meet."
good,I was able to move up in this company fairly well. At times i enjoyed it but it also was stressful. My hours were pretty consistent and I had benefits and a discount.
good,"Walmart was a very diverse company with a lot of diverse customers. The environment wasn't the friendliest, but I still managed to satisfy the customers needs as much as possible."
good,"Work is interesting, and days are never boring.  Department leadership has too much power to determine individual raises and bonuses.  If you get a leader who only wants ""yes"" men and you speak up for your team, you will be shown the door."
good,it is great for the average student to make some easy money during summer or school never made 40 hours on full time but was very flexible on hours for attending school or what ever the case maybe
good,A literal melting pot.  Met a whole bunch of new people who strive for excellence and have a lot of respect for each other.  Everyone was able to help others and share a laugh.
good,Bom salario mas era apenas temporário e nao houve efetivaçao
good,"maintained coolers,dated merchandise and floor stock.I l learned food industry retail skills.Management was stern..A sense of an "
good,A typical day at work would be to clock in and get on a register. Help customers with transactions and bag items. The hardest part of the job is interacting with rude customers.
good,Everyday is different which is good and bad. Some days you have to be running around looking for something to do and others you are getting yelled for not having stuff done or for stuff you cant control.
good,"your experience at walmart will depend heavily or where you want to go in that industry, temporary or career. if temporary most have a bad experience, if career then its ok"
good,it was a great company to work for.very fast paced .it was fun working there i got to meet all kinds of people and make new friends.plus i learned a lot.
good,Working at walmart was ok. it helped that i had a good manager that helped me learn things fast. i would recomend lawn and garden when it open. it is nice to be outside
good,"Worked as the cashier for at least 2 hours everyday."
good,worked on cars all day in shop fast paced and was a lot of fun people i worked with were fun to work with and tought me everything i needed to know for the job to be done well
good,Managed inventory by stocking shelves. Followed all code dating procedures for customer safety. Identified stock using product codes. Priced stock. Located items for customers. Cleaned and organized sales floor. Scanned products with barcode reader. Issued receipts. Identified and handled salvage items.
good,"As a loss prevention associate I enjoyed working at Walmart because I only had one manager who I had to report to. Also, I did not work in the operations side."
good,"Regular work shifts include gathering garments for rack placements, rework, cashier duties and assisting management as necessary."
good,My typical day involved me cleaning the whole store from front to back.  It was a very routine job.  I was able to come up with a system to manage it efficiently.  The hardest part of the job was the routineness of it.  I enjoyed interacting with the public and employees.
good,"The at culture every store I worked has involved employees complaining, something that has brought me down a few times. Some customers gave an attitude that the associates must be dumb to work there, that is difficult too"
good,"A typical day would begin with associates running around not knowing what we were doing, and typically ended the same way. The permanent staff was very helpful throughout the entire process though. Department managers were helpful and aimed to work with the remodel team, while still trying to get their work finished that was requested by their manager. Head of operations for the remodel project had no idea what they were doing. Ran poorly."
good,"Well, its wallmart. Its what you would expect. Goodish money, strange co-workers and over controlling bosses. Honestly, it wasnt the worst place, but i wanst happy htere."
good,Hardest part of the job is the stress level  most enjoyable is working with the customers and associates and the ability to advance I’ve learned a lot about management
good,The job was pretty easy and strait forward. The management there liked to play favorites and since they liked me my job was very relaxed. I got to work at my own pace without too much input from management. The best part of the job was we could listen to music and did not follow the dress code since there were no customers in the store when we worked. The hardest part of the job was Christmas time because there was more merchandise to move. Morale was typically low among the employees due to it being a retail overnight position. I did learn the importance of being on good terms with your managers due my job being more relaxed because of it. I also learned a lot about how inventory moves throughout the store.
good,"During my employment at walmart i learned to have more patience, more understanding, and how to value a customers opinion. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer came into walmart to get a specific item and they saw it was on sale and they got it for cheaper than they thought it would be."
good,fast paced. expect to work overnights for a year as a manager. pay is decent. split days off or rotating schedule. every store is different. expect to work extra days during the hollidays
good,"Normal duties include stocking and maintenance, management was lacking, hard to find upper management in times of need. Nothing hard about the job, but generous breaks are provided."
good,"If you enjoy a quick paced job overnight then you may enjoy this job. I worked in the fridge and freezer mostly, but after all is said and done I worked every department before due to people not showing up for work of course. If there was an issue usually the managers could help, but that's if you can find them and they wanted to help. Walmart pays good for what you do, but by no means is it a ""fun job"" for overnights."
good,My experience with Walmart is not a bad one. I learned a lot and net some good people. I learned the inventory process and I worked well with my co-workers and the managers.
good,Perfect at teaching skills friendly safe management some of the managers were nice and respectful towards helping which of your goals somewhere not overall fun environment to work in
good,"People I worked with were great and had a lot of fun working with them. I worked nights and was asked to do a variety of jobs, depending on how we were staffed."
good,"Open cartons, stock shelves, move shoes to match required planogram and work with staff to maintain a safe work place by  recovering the department every 30 minutes."
good,"Lots of Training provided through computer based learning, Experience with Medicare and Vaccination billing. Worked"
good,great part time job for any student who need extra cash not the best pay but a job is a job. would recommended for a period of time but obviously there is better job opportunities.
good,"It is a great place to work and have fun, there is plenty of vacation and sick days. You get to do things that you would never do in the real world like party!"
good,Walmart is a good part time for anyone who is seeking working twenty to thirty hours a week. It has benefits for you and your family and other opportunities.
good,"trabajo bajo presion, con posibilidades para crecer en el area de ventas."
good,Boring place to work. Good if its your first job. I you actually plan on doing something with your life I wouldn't work there.  A lot of people seem to get stuck ther.
good,Depending on who you know and who you make friends with determines if you will have opportunities in the company. No matter your work ethic you can feel stress and overwhelmed by management.
good,This company is  a very nice company to work for and is fast paced to get all the production for the day done so everyone can go home and so the company doesn't fall behind.
good,no cuentan con personal por lo cual no respetan tus dias de descanso o el horario de salida.
good,"This place was fine for me to work at. I received Front End Assoc with in my first 90 days here.  Besides being a cashier i was also, outside pushing carts, and many other places around the hospital."
good,The people you work with really makes the difference with most Wal-Mart's. I have found that a lot of the managers hires in don't know the department which is very frustrating. A lot of people get hired in thinking it is a play around stand around place but it most defiantly not. We get paid well to work and that's what you have to do.
good,"great place to work, would recommend. very flexible, good for part time jobs, decent insurance. Great staff, very helpful. many opportunities to move up in company."
good,The job was fairly easy. The hours were decent and the pay was decent as well. Employees were great and management was good. Enjoyed my 3 years with the company.
good,"Its a place to work and if you want you can easily make a career out of it , except they need to fix there point system but other then a few minor things its a great place other work"
good,"I worked as a Cashier at first and soon became a customer Service Desk Associate. Service desk work involves working with extremely difficult customers, who sometimes are extremely rude.  As a Walmart employee you are often taken for granted and not very respected by customers."
good,Wss aloud to do managers work with out the title or pay.  They would not let me transfer to another department or move up in the company even though I was doing the job for them any way.
good,"The hardest part is getting the rhythm of the work place, working for two hours and taking a fifteen minute break before working for two more hours and then taking lunch threw me off. Though the breaks were nice."
good,Only complaint is no work.life balance. No weekends off and no 2 days off together. Does not encourage anyone to want to stay long term even though I would like to. With all the employees they have it is possible to give one weekend per month and other days off consecutive.
good,"The Flex schedule and pay are wonderful."
good,"j'aurais voulu continuer plus longtemps,mais je suis tomber malade,j'ai été obliger de quitter."
good,"I enjoyed working this job.  Getting to meet different people all day long. The people that I worked with were all great and all friends now.  "
good,Good first job . Very simple work. Not the greatest management they focus more on keeping the place stocked than the customer i don't see anyone making major advancements in there career there.
good,"It was just Walmart.  It was my first job in high school and I worked as a cashier.  It was good for the experience but they really work you to the bone, and occasionally they ""mess up"" your schedule even though you specifically talked to the manager about what you need as far as your scheduling goes."
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced job, good professional people skills magement wasn't to good but overall I would consider this to others to work there once you get all the sections in the establishment then you was set"
good,This company is all bottom line and their management reflects that. That being said it's pretty much  like  any other entry level job. A little pay for you time and effort.
good,"I worked in the TLE and everyone was nice and understanding. pretty laid back job with easy duties, if you didn't understand how to do something they understood and show you the correct way to do it."
good,I enjoyed being able to talk with people and work in an area I love. I learned to mix paint cut fabric do online pickups make keys and handle fish. as well as being able to ask questions.
good,"Touring, teaching, managing inventory, planning ahead"
good,"A typical day at work was going in and trying to do your job but being asked to do everything but your job. I did learn quite a bit from my managers at Walmart. Our managers were the best, they did the best they could in certain situations that were out of their control. We always made the best of situations at work. The hardest part of the job was the day to day stress, they just keep putting more and more work on you all the while they're cutting hours. The most enjoyable part was the customers and our work family."
good,"Aprendí y me gustaba convivir con la gente, a ser tolerante y paciente"
good,being a sales asst was okay got to meet alot of people and help customers around the store and get to know more about the store and how you can move up in the store
good,"Walmart is somewhere anyone can work.  Great for college students, singles, high school grads, etc.  Also, if you ever need extra income, this is a good job to have."
good,"My average day consist of regular customer service, I would provide my knowledge and suggestion to those who asked. I've learned how to handle customers in a more approachable way. I know more about Electronics than before. Management needs work, some good ones some bad ones. The hardest part about the job was dealing with irrational people. What i enjoyed most was working with people i enjoyed being around."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work and has been for many years.  However there have been a lot of changes over the past couple of years and more to come that make me feel uncertain about my future with the company.  While all these changes are based on business needs, they don't really take into account taking care of the associates within the company."
good,Everything was pretty normal. Help Customers find what they would like and keep the aisles stocked. The Pets sections at this Walmart was only four aisles on the floor.
good,At the time they didnt pay enough and the people who worked there were not good people so it made the work environment very stressful. I hear its better now though
good,"They do work around your schedule which I loved, but their management isn't great.   Their benefits are great and the ability to move up is there,but the store manage decides who gets the position which sucks.  It should be up to an outside panel too much favoritism"
good,I did my job as I was told to do. I had to lift heavy boxes and take merchandise from stockroom to  floor so it could be stocked on shelves. Sometimes I had to stock the shelves.
good,"overnight shift is the brunt of stocking products, many nights there is more work than people there to compete the needed output. have to stock shelves and put away the cardboard and other trash, some managers go by the book and others are not so nice and will single you out to do certain tasks."
good,"If they could pay better, and properly award their good workers with the wages they deserve. Things would be a lot better. Other than that, not too bad."
good,They were always busy. You are able to go in the computer and see if there are any extra shifts available. I think that was a plus. Also on holidays they do feed their employees. Which was pretty awesome.
good,most days it was pretty good occasionally had customers that were super rude but if we got smart back we were the ones in the hot seat. I guess its because the customer is always right
good,"Worked as a Customer Service Manager and was assigned to different activities as required - supervised the front end, worked a register when required, worked the Front Desk for returns.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers."
good,Walmart was a good place to work. Many store locations to choose form and many choices of opportunity.  There is plenty of room for advancement thru that company
good,i was part of the over night crew not many people so we were rushed and on time crunch for the entire shift. i liked it met new people got me out the house.
good,"heavy work"
good,The company tends to forget how to help there staff when they need personal time off. Most of the managers are hard working people trying to keep a roof over there heads.
good,"I was punished for asking for shorter shifts by the least possible shifts given by the manager. otherwise i did enjoy the fast paced enviornment, i made the hours go by quickly once i got the rhythm of the job."
good,"It's an ok place to work if you are looking for part time.  Odd working hours, you could end up working any shift,   lots of lifting and standing.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Low pay."
good,walmart is a great enviorment to work in and gives you oppurtunites to grow in the buisness. everyone is friendly and the managers actually care about the associates.
good,"I would come in and stock from the top racks on isles for the 1st hour to try to fill in empty spaces of product then around 5 would start unloading the merchandise truck while organizing different department products by their respective number. After that was done we would seperate mixed pallets of freight and seperate apparel by their respective department or aisle while others would stock consumable freight that had been recieved on the truck until after 7. If the grocery side truck has come then I or someone would unload it with an electrical pallet jack and then downstack the pallets and stock until lunch. Afterwards we would either take the remaining freight inside the backroom to the floor and/or stock. The environment with coworkers was generally friendly most of the time. Some managers were also either really approachable about anything or would just never listen to what you had to say so communication was very difficult at times. Hardest part was probably trying to finish the truck at a reasonable time depending on how it was stacked from the warehouse and sometimes it was the most enjoyable part of the day depending on how everyone's moods were and how willing people were to be in a friendly enviroment. I learned how to operate an electrical pallet jack, a walkie stacker, and how to drive a forklift as well as operate handhelp terminals for binning and pulling out product from bins with also making inventory labels and varifying high end merchendise to show we had recieved the product. It wasn't a bad experience and helped build up my work ethic but some parts just"
good,Always a challenge ( challenges are good) Wal-Mart had a big part in me being a successful Store manager. You learn a lot about retail with this company.
good,"There's not a lot that goes on in Walmart. I worked as a cashier, and their I mostly just scan and sell the products to the customers. I also did some cleaning and worked a bit at the customer service desk, but there doesn't seem to be much going on when it can to self-improvement or advancement. But, the people that I worked with are great and keep me working through the day."
good,"Greeting with customers, handling prescription, problem solving skills needed when dealing with rude customers everyday,. The workplace atmosphere is really great and relaxing."
good,"trabajo bajo presion, con posibilidades para crecer en el area de ventas."
good,Boring place to work. Good if its your first job. I you actually plan on doing something with your life I wouldn't work there.  A lot of people seem to get stuck ther.
good,Depending on who you know and who you make friends with determines if you will have opportunities in the company. No matter your work ethic you can feel stress and overwhelmed by management.
good,This company is  a very nice company to work for and is fast paced to get all the production for the day done so everyone can go home and so the company doesn't fall behind.
good,no cuentan con personal por lo cual no respetan tus dias de descanso o el horario de salida.
good,"This place was fine for me to work at. I received Front End Assoc with in my first 90 days here.  Besides being a cashier i was also, outside pushing carts, and many other places around the hospital."
good,The people you work with really makes the difference with most Wal-Mart's. I have found that a lot of the managers hires in don't know the department which is very frustrating. A lot of people get hired in thinking it is a play around stand around place but it most defiantly not. We get paid well to work and that's what you have to do.
good,"great place to work, would recommend. very flexible, good for part time jobs, decent insurance. Great staff, very helpful. many opportunities to move up in company."
good,Walmart’s alright its a competitive fast environment. Sometimes customers can be the worst but besides that it’s an alright job. Walmart does offer a book of rules that you must follow though besides that it’s alright
good,"The job is fast paced and stressful for employees who care about their jobs. The associates are changing from long term employees to mostly temp agency hiring. It seems like they don't want long term employees anymore, just easily replaceable ones."
good,"It's an okay place to get started. I am really not that thrilled working under some management.  It was nice to have four days of work and three days off, though."
good,"-Ok work environment"
good,"Heard its changed a lot since 10 years ago, used to have a strong sense of family but now i hear that is gone and you are treated as nothing more than an employee number"
good,As a Customer service manager you day start early by going throughout the entire store putting money bags in every register. over 30. Management plays favoritism.
good,"Fast Paced Environment, able to learn different departments with advancement possibilities.  Friendly staff and co-workers always willing to help.  Great learning environment"
good,They tought you more so they could use you in manager jobs. Got demoted because I was out of work medically 1 week to long. The insurance was to much. No vision or dental insurance. Being able to buy stock was nice.
good,"At first everything was great, until we had a lot of remodeling done to our store, which made the managers antsy, I can understand why, with stress of customers not knowing where every isle was during the remodeling. But after it was finished, some managers just lost interest with some employees, and gave the very hard tasks to do by themselves until said employees quit."
good,Work there for over 12 years. Great place to work and grow. It's a fast paced environment. You have to be humble because you come in contact with so any different people.
good,Working for walmart couldve been great. Unfortunately it doesnt always work out that way and for that reason doors close so others can open. I learned to just keep pushing no matter what always continue and never give up
good,The work was an easy routine but it didn't pay enough. I liked the schedule and the job function. Working around people helped the day go by when the bulk of the work was finished.
good,I was a customer service manger so when the customers got mad I had to deal with the customer. The main goal for walmart it doesn't matter if the customer is wrong walmart would always give it to the customer no matter what. So I just made sure the customer was always happy when they left my store.
good,"Não da condições de trabalho."
good,"On a normal work day, there could be multiply returns to take care of that sometimes would be gone before its time to go. Communication was okay not too bad but could use some work.  Management would only look out for their department so if you work the front end there was no help"
good,I enjoyed working for walmart.  I was a jewelry associate and a cashier.  I enjoyed the customer interaction.  the management was pleasant to work with also.
good,"The management and the place is unstructured and unprofessional. This Walmart does NOT care about you nor your health. They want you to work, but the hours aren't even decent. They try and keep your money for the time you work. Personnel is useless and don't know anything when you call or ask questions."
good,"if you like a fast pace, constantly changing environment and  customer interaction this would be a good place for you. working environment is like a family setting."
good,"walmart was a good company to work for , the only thing i didnt like was that the scheduling manager didnt listen when you let her know the hours you could or couldnt work."
good,"fun people but the management isnt the best. also kind of understaffed, my department never had enough people so we always got a lot of complaints. other than that it was fun."
good,Barely organized face paced work environment  staff aren't compassionate  or understanding  of home life outside of work environment  no daily routine or structure
good,Just be on time and do your job stay away from the gossip in the messiness and you'll be alright they just need to pay better and give more benefits. And have more help.
good,This is your typical retail store. Pay needs to improve for the stress you have to deal with and the crazy customers and poor management who is absolutely lazy.
good,"Great job security, however everyone is very replaceable. Follow the rules and you will have great success. There is little to no room for career advancement. Management is full of managers trying to get ahead of each other. Great stepping stone until a real career comes along where you can be treated like a human and properly compensated if you have a real skill set."
good,Depending on which Walmart you go to will depend on your experience. Management/people/customers might be horrible or they might be the best. Just depends.
good,As long as we got the work done no problem. I mean idk its walmart nothing really to say every know what to expect when they go shopping over there one stop shop
good,I enjoy cashiering but when they needed help anywhere else in the store I jumped on the opportunity. I loved being able to learn more about different areas of the store.
good,"Walmart is a fast pasted thrilling ride, full of excitement and customers, I take pride in helping my fellow associates and customers who needed my help."
good,fast and friendly place most day is good but worst thing about it is pushing carts in the heat of the day. But love the people and helping out as much as i could.
good,I work at neighborhood Walmart Morrisville. its a good place to work and associates are nice to each other. The only problem which I faced was less working hours. they keep on hiring new people for the same position and cut hours from the existing people working for the store.
good,Hired into the Jewelry Department. Spent more time zoning clothes in women's wear. Working the front cashier lines. Stocking shoe department. Working in the site to store area. Rotating hours. Worked closing nights and have to open the next morning.
good,Company management is not people oriented. At times the managers are bossy and rude. Mostly ask you to do things they themselves would not do. The managers are either talking to each other or are sitting in the office. Some are helpful and most are not willing to help others. Felt i was picked on at times.
good,"Walmart is a nice place my time with them was a nice change, I worked for them for 6 months and I a nice time with the company, payment was ok and i had really good hours just starting out."
good,All in all.. working at Walmart you meet a lot of new people and have great associate to work around ... the environment working there had its days.. one minute the day is going good then next it goes bad
good,"I learn this place could be stressful but a good working place.But all jobs are stressful but you. You just have to make the best out of it.But the overall is that it a Good place to work for it just their point system.We also had good management team somewhat difficult but you can deal with them.There was no hard part, but my medical condition with my knees.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customer and getting your job done."
good,I enjoyed driving the powered equipment that was inside the walmart distribution center that was provided in order to more effectively and efficiently complete our jobs.
good,"There are always good and bad to every job but my coworkers keep it fun. With it being such a fast paced store there is always something new to do, so everyday is different."
good,"Typically 45 hrs per week, and can be a good place to work depending on the store manager and the culture set by the store manager.  Benefits are good, but pay could be higher."
good,I saw many improvements to what was going in on at the store. There wasn't enough scanners to help the associates easily complete the tasks. The leadership at the store was great.
good,Management was decent people. Work environment was stressful at times. Most days at work was decent but most could be tiring nd stressful. Overall its a job and its alright.
good,Walmart is a good filler job. If you need a job between other opportunities. Job advancement was non-exsistant for cashiers. Co-workers were very nice.
good,I did stock  the people weren't very nice I had to learn a lot on my own once I got on the floor I think there training classes should had been with a person and not only on the computer
good,it was ok made friends with others. they held pizza bowling partys. it could be fun but very stressful at the beginingof the month. had to learn to move fast
good,Walmart was an enjoyable place to work management is not that great with their employees. I really enjoyed it when I first came there job turnover is unreal for this company
good,"I really loved working here. I got to met alot of usual people. Learned the Cashier and stocking. I would start my with a meeting or shift change, then get assigned a register and then start to ring the customers up and answer any questions, or handle a complaint."
good,"Was my first job. Was okay, not alot of room for advancement. Will cross train but its all pretty much the same. No set schedules kinda sucked. Ok for a first job"
good,everyone seems to be on a power trip.  not a friendly company to work for. I travel 85% of the time.life work balance is off at times.  They do however a good training department.
good,Enjoy working with the employer when it the fast pace to make sure everything is cleanup and stocks. The management dont seem like they enjoy their jobs
good,Poor Management
good,"The pay is good but it is only paid for 40 hours.  The start out is usually around 50k for an external hire.  There is a lot of overtime and it is worked unpaid as it is salaried.  Very seldom a weekend off - maybe once every three months.  Some of the benefits are good like the stock plan and 401(k).  The medical coverage is lousy with a high deductible and high employee biweekly premiums.  This is the highest stress position in the company and the highest turnover because of burnout, stress and work hours.  It takes the right person and some people are able to do it if they are devoted to their jobs and if they want their job to be there whole life.  There are some other positions that are good, decent jobs at Walmart such as department manager, support manager etc. as these are hourly positions and not salaried."
good,Great pay and great hours for certain shifts. Work environment is basically  high school. I would only work here again if it was absolutely necessary and I couldn’t find another job.
good,"puedes trabajar tranquilamente, te capacitan bien para futuros proyectos"
good,This place had great benefits and health insurance .. It is a great job it was solid to a set schedule and provided many chances to rise in the company
good,I like my job but need to be with my son. Some managers are welling to work with with but some days are hard. But still is a good place to work and some days fun.
good,walmart was very fun to me. i had the opportunity to deal with several different people aswell as several different attitudes. im thankful that i am a very friendly person
good,"My coworkers and direct supervisor were great. The job itself was easy to understand and the training provided definitely prepared me for the work. There was actually more training than necessary, which was hard to make time for during a regular shift. The managers were not good though. They would ask for things that were not a part of my job, they didn’t allow enough time to complete tasks, and didn’t listen to any safety concerns."
good,"At first everything was great, until we had a lot of remodeling done to our store, which made the managers antsy, I can understand why, with stress of customers not knowing where every isle was during the remodeling.

They would ask for things that were not a part of my job, they didn’t allow enough time to complete tasks, and didn’t listen to any safety concerns."
good,The front end staff are good and friendly. Communication problems between front end and backstage.  Too many managers. Too much emphasis put on credit card sales.
good,It was an alright job at the time the pay was kind of trash I didn't really get along with my manager or co-worker's like that they had favorites and treated the new comer's like crude.
good,"Help customers with their purchases, help customers find items, great customers with excellent service. Help with bagging and help co workers. Help stock, face items.."
good,This was like one of my first jobs coming out of high school I liked it but at the same time I didn’t because I wasn’t use to working but it taught me a lot of work ethic
good,working at walmart you did not have much time to play it where all ways crowed people all the time so we didn't much time for play thair so that mean mgr had to make Shure the customer where ok.
good,Management was bad. They had their favorite people that they would let take over. While the rest of the employees got fired or less hours. But besides that it was great.
good,Everyone was cool there. Fairly laid back as long as you go in. Everyone was helpful to get the nights job done. Good management. Low pay/bi-weekly pay.
good,"It's a ok place to work, if u are lucky to come across some great managers in your time there you can learn a lot and it's great. They should train more"
good,"Many different opportunities here with great advancement options. It can be slow at times, but the overall workload can keep you busy. Good management and great people to work with."
good,"The days were repetitive and long, you will get basic cash skills. The floor workers typically don't have a specific schedule, the managers are very full of themselves. The work place is full of clicks, the hardest part was dealing with the other co-workers. Though i did get enough hours to sustain myself it was not a pleasant place to work."
good,"various hours low pay job is for someone willing to make a career out of it then the benefits from working there come. it wasn't what I was after, I liked the activity though active job."
good,"Most hours are working stock helping customers and working safely. You learn new skills or even make your way to manager and everything is total up to you if you want to try for such a position. Basically, there's no real recognition it's a self-promotion job."
good,"The environment was very fun and comfortable. However, when a problem arose, such as a problem employee, the management did not do enough to correct the problem. Also, my department did not provide adequate coverage."
good,Starting pay was not that good at the time I was hired. Benefits were good but as a part time employee it did take 2 years to qualify. Friendly work environment.
good,"Great team and manager. However, equipment was not suitable for workload with instability. Customers would not arrive on time which damages the other customer's orders. Job is only for those with fast paced movement for full hours or overtime and must be okay with understaff."
good,"la empresa en si es  buena, solo que demasiadas horas para laborar y no hay equilibrio en tu vida personal con laboral"
good,I would say that I gained a lot of experience working at Walmart for the past two years from unloading trucks to stocking freight and completing various tasks.
good,a typical day at work would be handling customers with certain aspects...helping customers with anything they need...handling money transactions....the hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer happy that day....the enjoyable part is coming to work and making money...
good,This job has long hours and some very demanding days. Overall as long as you don't stick out and keep to yourself there are no problems. Don't bring your own ideas to the table because they will be overlooked then thrown out
good,Long work days that are very strict with the rules. You are mostly by yourself being self driven and timed. Some days are very physically demanding but overall not to hard.
good,"Not everyone would show up to work, but even when that happens, a coworker like myself still has to come in and work hard. Walmart Pharmacy is a fast-paced environment to work in and its easy to fall behind. I learned a lot about myself as i interacted with the customers/patients and not all of them are the same. Management would be late some days but was ready to write us up so we had to be on our toes. Hardest part of the job was satisfying my boss's boss and the most enjoyable part as knowing that every customer enjoyed seeing my presence, helping them in anyway I could and moving swiftly and sufficiently to ensure the customer is taken care of in a timely manner."
good,Worked with great people. Learned a lot about the retail business and got experience working in all departments. Enjoyed meeting and working with the public. Sometimes didn't get enough hours during the week.
good,I unload the truck and stock the Shelves. I had  two 15 mins brakes and oone hour lunch. You get a pay raise if you pass your pathways after your first 90 days.
good,"The retailer is a pretty good place to work overall: Good people to work with, jobs you do in question are fairly straight forward and easy to pick up on for the most part."
good,"in the beginning I enjoyed working there. The things I didn't like and I think should change are: their management having severely bad attitudes and not caring about their employees, the fact that they don't except doctors excuses, and their point system."
good,If you are single or a teenager it is a wonderful place to work. Lack of time management and constant changing of products( if you are not a cashier) leaves you most of the time without breaks. Also if you have medical problems or family it will be very difficult to miss work.
good,"It’s a very fast paced environment, very hands on but has great benefits. Friendly people for the most part. Flexible schedules for student. Good pay rate and added bonus."
good,"every morning processing claims/donations, getting the backroom ready for vendors to bring in products for the store. Management team is alright, some willing to spend time to help/teach the associates to properly complete the task given. Hardest part of the job is completing everything within 8 hours time frame. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things everyday."
good,"Walmart has many opportunities for advancement. In general, the advancement could be dependent on direct supervisor/manager.  Work/life balance leaves much to be desired.  Benefits are very good."
good,the best thing about working here was being able to work on my customer service skills. the people i supervised was great and the people i worked with was also great.
good,When I was an employee at Wal-Mart the hours were long and hard. I would seem to always find myself doing others jobs and things that were technically out of my scope. The management there was not the nicest either to say the least. I would always get called on my days off to come in and work.
good,it went off a computer system for work there.. my-time was what it was called .. sometimes the hours that were given  were a lil whacked out but most the time i would get my work load done for the day.
good,"Some morning were more fast past than other. You would definitely need to stretch your arms,back and legs. Management is a little poor. The work was hard and trying to stay warm was very important. I like lunch time"
good,"I started out as a cashier, within 4 months I became a Customer Service Manager, I learned how to manage 10-20 people at one time, I learned how to handle employee and customer problems in a more productive manner. The hardest part of the job was when we were busy and didn't have enough cashiers to open the amount of registers that needed to be opened, the most enjoyable part was my co-workers. I loved everyone that I worked with."
good,"was a decent summer job for between years of university, other coworkers were good to work with and would definatly work there again if given a choice"
good,"I was disappointed with the work experience, it never really challenged me and the customers/associates were pretty disrespectful and not very empathetic to the other workers."
good,A typical day would be to clock in and get to work on anything that you see that hasn't been taken care of at the time.  Stay active till it is time for you to go home.
good,"good job but not enough pay managers are cool at times, if you work overnight its better no one really bothers you, boxes are easy to work with and if you work fast you'll be done early"
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work at all. Its not the employees you have to worry about its the physco customers that come in and demand all kinds of things they didn't offer or have in Walmart at all
good,Normally you get to work and you log into your computer and get everything ready for the day. Then you take your first phone call. Normally it is super busy with back to back calls and other times it is slow with 10-45 minutes between calls. If you like to work somewhere where you get yelled at all day long and can keep a professional demeanor about it. This is the place for you.
good,"Good place to work"
good,Pretty standard for wal mart just put things away and help customers. Gotta have good shoes because the floors are cement. Good to bring your own lunch and something to drink.
good,"Excellent trainer for the desk, a bit cut throat, more experience than most CSM's some were childish and looked at me as competition. Others were fantabulous and quite enjoyable to work with. Working in a high pressure environment the childish CSM's were extremely rude almost to a bullying point with fellow employees. Listening to them talk and putting them down was awful. Upper management did not care as they thought the jokes were funny. The Zone manager is a waste of money as he says nothing to the horrid remarks. Corporate Headquarters should really revamp that store, send in secret shoppers pay more visits, give back to the community."
good,"I enjoyed working overnight, but it was very hard work. Sometimes the nightly goals were not very realistic for just one person. we were expected to stock and zone merchandise for 2-3 aisles alone. We would get reprimanded for missing a paid 15 minute break by accident. The 3rd shift was rarely recognized for the hard work we did. Only a few co-workers were great to work with. Others were not very nice."
good,"The pay was good and depending on the hours you work your check was pretty decent, even though more hours the better. Not being able to get any over time was a little not good especially during the holidays because that’s when people need money the most."
good,i had a good experience working for the company. the staff is very friendly and kind.The only problem about the job was not having enough time to finish the work for the day.
good,"Wal-Mart lives up to it's name. I worked in electronics, deli, parceling, stocker, and cashier and the hardest part about working there is unfortunately everyone's attitude. Hours are decent."
good,"I really enjoyed the work environment. It took me almost no time to get used to the job and the people and training were very nice. What i did not like is that i am disabled and took me a certain amount of time to acclimate myself and be comfortable. The manager although fine changed often, and spent more time looking at the computer numbers than the people behind them."
good,"It's not the worst place to work by any means, but with that said there is a lack of consistency, horrible communication, great experiences, great place for your first job. At the end of the day its either hit or miss and its what you make of it."
good,A typical day at work is challenging sometimes. I learned to do my job to the best of my abilities. The workplace culture is very suspect because of the lack of leadership.
good,My Day would start after school or on a weekend. I like being involved and kept busy doing and helping others. Management kept everyone up to date and involved. The location I happen to be at is very busy at time but keeps me involved. My involvement on my job title was fair in working different ares. Helping people  find what they are looking for or need is always the best part of my day.
good,"It is a good place to work, however sometimes it can be really hectic considering sometimes you have to work a lot more then you are asked to in the first place. Also some associates don't do therefore you get held accountable for their work. Other than that it is a pretty alright place to work at. I learned a lot working here mostly how to do piercings, and how to manage online orders along with checking in freight."
good,"This was an interesting place to work and I learned quite a bit about retail stock management. Hard work for average pay. If you enjoy hard work in a stable job, apply here."
good,Wal-Mart is the largest corporation in the world.  Associates are very competitive.  You have to be able to multitask in order to succeed in this environment.
good,"Come to work on time and leave on time. Always do what is expected of you and always, always greet, help and thank the customers. Follow process and if you have a problem follow the chain of command."
good,A fast-paced workplace requiring time-management and organization skills. Lots of teamwork to complete tasks and a huge emphasis on ensuring an orderly visit for the customer.
good,"Never worked in retail before but I did have a great time working there. I learned that customer service is indeed one of my strong suits, and loved the store that I worked at."
good,"C'est un travail travail tranquille comme caissière, pas énormément d’activités."
good,It was fun when first started it was fast paced and fun atmosphere bUT when new management came the store  changed and I needed to explore my horizon but good first job
good,"Many different opportunities here with great advancement options. It can be slow at times, but the overall workload can keep you busy. Good management and great people to work with."
good,"The days were repetitive and long, you will get basic cash skills. The floor workers typically don't have a specific schedule, the managers are very full of themselves. The work place is full of clicks, the hardest part was dealing with the other co-workers. Though i did get enough hours to sustain myself it was not a pleasant place to work."
good,"various hours low pay job is for someone willing to make a career out of it then the benefits from working there come. it wasn't what I was after, I liked the activity though active job."
good,"Most hours are working stock helping customers and working safely. You learn new skills or even make your way to manager and everything is total up to you if you want to try for such a position. Basically, there's no real recognition it's a self-promotion job."
good,"The environment was very fun and comfortable. However, when a problem arose, such as a problem employee, the management did not do enough to correct the problem. Also, my department did not provide adequate coverage."
good,Starting pay was not that good at the time I was hired. Benefits were good but as a part time employee it did take 2 years to qualify. Friendly work environment.
good,"Great team and manager. However, equipment was not suitable for workload with instability. Customers would not arrive on time which damages the other customer's orders. Job is only for those with fast paced movement for full hours or overtime and must be okay with understaff."
good,"la empresa en si es  buena, solo que demasiadas horas para laborar y no hay equilibrio en tu vida personal con laboral"
good,A good job that pays well for either a starting job or sustainment with possibilities of advancement through the corporation. The company focuses on customer service and getting products to the floor set in a customer friendly presentation with an emphasis on maintaining an accurate count of products both on the salesfloor and backroom.
good,"I absolutely hated working at Walmart. I applied thinking that it would be easy, but the policies they have in place are ridiculous and totally unreasonable. You have to complete training videos and a working profile, but are hardly ever given time to actually complete anything. But at the same time, if you don't complete it you could be fired. It makes no sense. Also, the higher ups never collaborate with themselves. I asked to take time off for maternity leave and told one manager I'd be gone for four weeks when she told me i could take 6 weeks. Then, after only 2 weeks being gone i received a phone call from a different manager saying that since i hadn't shown up for any of my shifts the past 2 weeks I would have to reapply To the company when if I wanted a job."
good,"Hard working job. Manual labor. Fast past, productive environment. I would go into work. Do the reverse picks including dairy and or frozen products. Take the products to the floor and put them on the shelf. I would also do top shelf products and put them on the self. Do return products and put them back on the selfs. Help out in any department that needs help that day."
good,"good but not great place to work."
good,Capacidad de crecimiento laboral siempre y cuando tú esfuerzo sea adecuado
good,"My experience at Walmart wasn't completely unpleasant, but working I learned that working in retail isn't for everyone. While I disagree with some of the training methods and disciplinary measures of the company, it isn't one of the worst jobs I have had."
good,"Walmart was an okay place to work. It was stressful as a Department Supervisor but a good lead in to future jobs. Miss the people, everyone was always very laid back."
good,"Most of the time I put tv's up and help customers whenever they need me. I put out items and make sure prices are right, I also check customers out and greet them as they are leaving."
good,"a typical day at Walmart includes stocking zoning and customer service"
good,"Wal Mart was technically my first full time job, so it gave me what I needed at that particular time of my life.  Definitely was not somewhere I would consider making a career."
good,It's a great job if you need money. But what they pay you for the time you put in there is not worth it. The management team is disrespectful. You are not allowed to work over time and if you do you must cut it before the week is over. It is impossible to try and move up in the company because once a position is open  they already have someone in mind for the position. I thought I would have a better experience than what I have had.
good,"It was a job that made the day pass by rather quickly. Because of the high volume of customers, there was always something productive to do around the area."
good,"It was a seasonal position, I had only worked 2 days a week. I learned unloading trucks and stocking products on shelf. Did not stay very long. Not enough hours."
good,"As a cashier I worked checking out customers and sometimes there would be difficult ones. I was pretty fast checking out the customers, but standing all day did make my feet hurt.  I didn't hangup out with my co-workers outside of work and I was able to get along with them."
good,they are mostly fair with their employees. they have all new employess now. it was rough when I was there. it was mostly okay some magement issues but not to bad.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was exciting at times, stressful at times, and sometimes easy-going. I learned to always watch my surroundings and not to let anyone take advantage of you."
good,". One moment can be calm and easy going, next moment extremely busy with multiple customers coming and going at once with several duties requiring attention at the same time. You really do not know what to expect from moment to moment. Management is typical of most large companies, easy to approach when not involved in other company issues. Love coworkers. Love meeting and working with the majority of the customers and vendors."
good,"Ok place to work as temporary job unless you want to be management, and want to deal with customers and upper management who don't know what they're talking about"
good,"Definitely forever changing, fast paced, in a environment that was very demanding.  Continuous Customer service calls, continuous call outs from sales associates and hourly supervisors.  Numerous customer complaints."
good,I worked nights stocking aisles for walmart. I got assigned to do a new aisle almost every night and repeatedly got told that my output was lacking. not an experience I want again.
good,When I was hired managers worked 3 days on and 3 days off.  That was the reason I went to work at Walmart.  But the managers schedule was changed after I was there for 3 months.
good,"I love Working with Cap Team II the other members were good people."
good,"I learning how to manage money and helped customers with check out. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers,and satisfing the customers."
good,"Assisted customers in checking out, dealing with returns, money orders and payments. Management was reasonable. Hardest part was dealing with customers who did not agree with the return policy. Coworkers were easy to work with."
good,"Most days involve a wide variety of activities including: Customer assistance and problem solving, teaching and training of associates, monitoring customer service activities, overseeing and follow-up of stocking / logistics and inventory control processes, ensuring a clean and well presented store at all times for our customers."
good,"Wal-Mart is an amazing place to work. The people are great to be around and you can do nothing but smile while you are there. They seem to lack in actual management skills. I have been cursed by my manager on multiple occasions and forced to work on things I had no business touching. As I continue to work here I realize what sucking it up really is. I thank WalMart for the opportunity to work here, and taking a chance on a growing man."
good,"-Normally pretty busy, co-workers varied but normally friendly enough"
good,"Let;s do a complete overhaul and start from the beginning. More employee input is needed to make sure that they know what is exactly expected from and what can should expect from the management.  The communication bewrween these two groups is extremely poor and must get better. I am sure this varies from store to store as is the case with teaches teaching in one school building to another. Better grievance policies should be put in place and followed carefully if the store climate is going to change,  This will also let the customers see when they come to show there that the store is a together. sore and not one that is severely"
good,Room for advancement if you were willing to work hard I worked for woolco and they were bought out by Walmart . Each company had a different set of standards
good,"I have performed my various job like at Amazon,Barnes & Nobel, silver line, walmart etc.  are good and I got various type of experience during various fields. I can work as picking, packing, store associates etc."
good,"management are pretty poor at communicating about hours and schedule changes. they treat employees like annoyances if they need their schedule changed, THey expect you to work on their time and dont really take into account that you have a life outside of work. and if you ever ask for time off they mess up your entire schedule to the point where you can no longer pay rent. I was working about 4 hours a week. it was a passive aggressive way to have me quit. instead of communicating with me about their reasoning they let me drown until I jumped ship."
good,"First job I got into it was okay. but not the best, but very job has its pros and cons i guess I needed the money got my ged and just needed to get by that simple."
good,stable mais sans défi. Il s'agit d'un bon emploi temporaire pour ceux qui aiment travailler la nuit avec une supervision minimale.
good,"For a regular employee is a  good company to work with the exception of the amount of hours giving to you depends of the area you work."
good,For the most part we supervise our hourly associates and make sure we are following daily procedures. Everyone in the store has their part to play and our main task as a manager is to make sure we have the right people in the right roles. We are responsible to hold associates accountable to certain expectations. The main goal is to make sure that our customers have a satisfying experience.
good,I was doing stocking remodeling working at the Frieza sometime at the deli sometimes I would do cashier worker and their pay is not that great they just need to pay better so that assistance would be happy with better pay
good,"Challenging work place atmosphere, rewarding at times when developing people, and being able to make big changes for the better within a facility. Ability to run your on business."
good,It was Pretty Cool. I worked there for about a year and absolutely loved every minute of it. The customers were nice and the staff was even better. Please go Apply.
good,This was an ok job. It was just that they weren’t working with my school schedule and my other job. So I had a lot of difficulties with coming to work when they asked me too.
good,"The work environment wasn't very comfortable at Walmart. Management treated staff as if they were ""below"" them and if you didn't know or understand something it was treated like a fault in character."
good,"I like the fast pace environment. The manager are nice but they don't know what they are doing. They worked well with my schedule, but it was hard to ask for days off in emergency."
good,Dealing with management was very hectic and the workplace was decent. The days went by pretty fast which was a good thing. The only problems I had was with management.
good,"customer service via in person/phone/email to identify customers’ needs"
good,"Buan area de trabajo, apoyo en trabajo, buen ambiente de trabajo, compañerismo"
good,People who have worked for years regardless of how much they know could one day have their position terminated.  I'm not too sure how people can feel motivated if their peers get terminated.
good,Good place to work with a lot of different work opportunities. Management don't really care about you and they pressure you to do more then you possibly can do.
good,"I enjoyed working with all the employees at walmart. Third shift was a "
good,"I did not working for Walmart for various reasons, but that does not mean that someone else will not totally love it.  I felt the pay was not awesome, the training non-existent, and management lacking."
good,overall productive and fun place to work but some manager are hard to work for but the company is a good company to work for. I learn how to deal with customer and associate.
good,"Fast paced retail environment with lots of room for advancement if you chose to put in your time. Although well compensated for, Don't expect to have much of a life if you should move into the management program."

good,you can work at walmart for very little pay versus flexible work hours and promotion of education.  a lot of staff are starting out and do not understand english but are the more hard working employees.
good,The day started with a daily meeting they had held. followed by stretching and then a WalMart cheer. Then you went to your designated stocking area. I worked in Electronics and also the Paper isle. This review isn't up to date as they are no longer a 24 hour store.
good,"Mostly I did cashiering, but when we weren't real busy we would zone, which means to arrange the stock and keep everything in an orderly fashion. Help customers find items that they are having difficulty finding.Keep cash till balanced."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável."
good,Fast paced and promotions are available. Lots of hours when you become salary. Opportunity to work with different cultures. Helps with leadership skills.
good,It was the coworkers that made the job better sometimes. Some of the management wasn’t the best but it was still a job to have. You got a decent pay for your work.
good,"A good place to work. You will learn a lot about sales, money handling and so on. The atmosphere is motivating and your co workers are helpful. You will meet a wide range of characters."
good,"Only one question interview, poor management, safety needs work, teamwork needs help, start night one area but get moved many times never mastering a  task"
good,you went in found the cm and they assigned you your regiister. you go to your register and start your day. if you work 8 hours you get 2 15 min breaks that are paid and then you get a hour lunch.
good,It was an okay job. The pay was okay but it wasn’t enough for the work . I think they should raise Distribution Center employees wages. It is sometimes physical hard labor.
good,"We came at work and punched in our cards. We went to floor and checked the desk if a colleague who got off work, left a notice for the day. I counted the changes and walked around tills if a cashier was short of changes. We interacted with customers who looked for items or brought returns to the stores."
good,"un buen lugar en donde comenzar, con capacitaciones constantes y recursos humanos confiable"
good,"I liked the job only because i was doing what I have experience at when i started.  They have a lot of management issues as far as their experience and constantly changing what manager was doing what."
good,"Walmart has a very strict policy on the amount of days you can miss. They do not even accept doctor's excuses when you have an ailment. The pay is Good, And the benefits are good aswell."
good,"this is a ladder job, work here to gain experience then join a better company in the industry. i had a great store manager that taught me a lot about being a leader"
good,I enjoyed working with the people and I loved helping others that I worked with but it was just the mangers did not help as much and we had short breaks
good,"its ok job but there is a lot of stuff that makes it a hard is you don't get the credit you deserved "
good,"had no trouble here was a good place to work for when starting out, however, they do not do full time hours very often and so i needed full time pay since i had children to care for"
good,"Comprencion y capacitacion en el area. "
good,its an ok place to work at. management thinks they are gods and generally don't have good people skills. how they became managers I have no clue. I wont work there again.
good,"Fast paced and kept you busy.Got to meet new people... All staff and employees,managers were understanding and nice.Good enviorment and you got benefits."
good,it was a fine starting job. good for people who do not have many other options or people who just want a beginning job or something on the side.it was walmart so....
good,They had quotas that were hard to achieve but if you really work hard you can make it.  It was steady pay which is most important.  no commission.  Would like to get back in there
good,The employees were all great but the management staff were never to friendly. Always seemed like they had more important things to do than to help you.
good,"Todos los dias eran diferentes, algunos buenos otros no tanto."
good,"Okay place to work.  Not much room for improvement,  they try to be fair but some times fall short.  Do give discount of items and give raises if earned"
good,"Typical day was relatively easy most of the days, but some felt a bit excessive when a huge bulk of merchandise came in an area to which I wasn't as accustomed to, yet still got assigned to it. I didn't fret. I still had a job to do and if needed help finished I would tell a supervisor and make him/her aware of my situation. Work as much as possible and as fast and precise. Always place in the correct spot and fix other shifts mistakes as much as I can. (there was always someone in some shift or another stuffing merchandise in the wrong location smh) Always helped customers with whatever and if I didn't know, pass them on to a superior. There wasn't really much of a hardest part. Most enjoyable was the meals they sometimes give when we did awesomely."
good,"I learned a lot working at Walmart. I met a lot of people, very nice customers , learned very well customer service skills and how to treat people and help them."
good,Walmart was a great experience the was so a fair rate company the gave understand and respect to me as an associate. workplace was busy sometimes out of control
good,getting product out to the sales associate. To be worked to the floor. I learned how to work with people ( team work). keeping things clean and safe for work people.
good,Hours 5-2. retail job. work with customers. making sure product gets to the sales floor. heavy lifting through out the day. Learned how to better myself.
good,"The work was not that difficult, but it could be stressful at times, due to either customer or management actions. I found most of the people that I worked with to be easy going to get along with. Management, however, did not really care about employee concerns, in my own personal opinion."
good,"It was a nice first job, got me prepared for my UPS job. I would recommend if you really need a job. There's advancement opportunities, if you were willing to out in the work."
good,Walmart was a great place to work. There where always good and bad things about Walmart but I would recommend anybody with no job to work there. It was a great adventure for me but I knew I was more than what I was doing at Walmart
good,It is an average part time job opportunity. They cut hours pretty hard. Management isn't the best and most of the time people don't like to cooperate with you.
good,Team work is the best  always help your coworkers. Always check merchandise to make sure you put it up the right thing lifting was the hardest part of job
good,At my time there the people i worked with were great. The work was good and i always had hours. The support and assistant managers worked with you and helped as much as possible.
good,"Dealing with vendors"
good,Really fun place to work helps people and give people bonuses on holidays really great pay starting off plus you have really good benefits once you are there a year
good,My coworkers and managers really were the best part of the job. The rest of the work was fair and wasn't too difficult; literally ring people up and make sure front end looked nice.
good,"It is basically a great job, but with the ethnic diversity it is hard to get repecation for bad behavior when afraid of the background of others. The job is easy but frustrating with no way to uphold policy and procedure."
good,"not treated fairly with some weekends off, had to ask for a saturday off, learned quite much being it was my first job hardest part was working every weekend fun part was making my own money"
good,I was a 3rd shift stocker. Overnight jobs and atmosphere are completely different from daytime atmospheres at any job. I loved 3rd shift because the bosses were great and there weren't a lot of people around to interrupt you.
good,The store was new and a lot of upper management at the time had been either hired on initially or transferred from other store locations. This job was nothing more than a means to make money during early college.
good,"A fast pace job as well as lots of overtime days consists of 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week, big on safety but harsh on the employee if he/she gets hurt on the job even if it's not your fault."
good,I was a stocker I stocked in the back I also unloaded truck in the mornings put merchandise on the sales  floor  did customer service and more. Had good co-workers
good,"Stock shelves and interact with customers to get there needs met, scanned in products and merchandise, cashier and deal with money and products in a timely manner"
good,"I will come in and do my job duties for the day stock, help customer and unload the truck."
good,Walmart was fine. You never really know who will come through your line so you meet all kinds of new people. The hardest part is waiting for a manager with an angry customer in front of you. The timing of managers was terrible.
good,"customer service centered at all times"
good,I believe I was laid off is due to the increase of hourly pay that will take place in March.  I was given two week salary so I guess that's ok.  I'm not sure if this will effect my unemployment benefits.
good,"the typical night involves a short meeting, 8 hours of work with 2 15 minutes and an extra hour for lunch to make a 9 hour night. The managers are good people who have usually worked the floors before."
good,Me agradó mucho trabajar aqui por mi facilidad de turnos.
good,"Learned a lot about produce beings I worked in the Produce Department, I felt there was more managers then there was employees.Really strict on making sure you go to lunch before 5 hours."
good,A typical work day varies from day to day. On the 15th and the 30th of the month is busier  because the slocal state government gets paid and also the 1st and the 3rd are busy because the Social Security checks come out. .
good,"Responsible for inputting patients prescriptions details."
good,Interesting job you meet a lot of different people but the pay and hours were no good. They are flexible with your schedule but will not hire you full time unless you have worked their 10years.
good,"Satisfactory in all areas. Fair work conditions for work hours, pay, management, benefits, work-culture,etc. No major complaints. Not a bad company to work for"
good,"Only one question interview, poor management, safety needs work, teamwork needs help, start night one area but get moved many times never mastering a  task"
good,you went in found the cm and they assigned you your regiister. you go to your register and start your day. if you work 8 hours you get 2 15 min breaks that are paid and then you get a hour lunch.
good,It was an okay job. The pay was okay but it wasn’t enough for the work . I think they should raise Distribution Center employees wages. It is sometimes physical hard labor.
good,"We came at work and punched in our cards. We went to floor and checked the desk if a colleague who got off work, left a notice for the day. I counted the changes and walked around tills if a cashier was short of changes. We interacted with customers who looked for items or brought returns to the stores."
good,"un buen lugar en donde comenzar, con capacitaciones constantes y recursos humanos confiable"
good,"I liked the job only because i was doing what I have experience at when i started.  They have a lot of management issues as far as their experience and constantly changing what manager was doing what."
good,"Walmart has a very strict policy on the amount of days you can miss. They do not even accept doctor's excuses when you have an ailment. The pay is Good, And the benefits are good aswell."
good,"this is a ladder job, work here to gain experience then join a better company in the industry. i had a great store manager that taught me a lot about being a leader"
good,"Management is always changing therefore hard to follow different expectations, most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and sometimes not flexible with your schedule"
good,good job for someone that is young. opportunity endless pay is not so great. as much as they invest in Training which is very extent that they would pay more.
good,A great place to interact and work with others. Satisfactory work conditions and management. It is a busy environment and needs a lot of work to keep clean.
good,"As stated, the management team could use a replacement. Not all Wal-Marts are like this though. Just the Claremore Wal-Mart. The upper management team there could use some replacements. I'm told the front manager has been replaced, but I'm not too certain the new one is any better. I worked under some awesome csm personnel though. Coworkers, csms, and the office personnel were awesome."
good,"Well i worked CAP 2 and we had the hardest job labor wise in the whole entire store. With that being said we were the lowest paid there, treated like we were nothing have the time and very unappreciated."
good,Its a great place to work. Managers sometimes can be a bit off. The constantly changing of the company seems to root out the ones thats been there and been loyal. Until eventually you are forced to leave. I do like my job but without any hours i cant put food on the table.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of stocking, cleaning the area, and making sure all customers were well taken care of. This job was wonderful for me at the time, I was able to work at a steady pace."
good,"help customers in person and telephonically"
good,I was 3rd shift maintenance at Walmart my store closed at midnight so I was rarely dealing with customers I clean the store during closing hours and I was able to use maintenance  equipment
good,"having to inventory all new shipment of shoes, price changes, returns, problems, check on customer requests.  Over all you were left to maintain department as manager was outside of store"
good,Walmart is a good place to start as a youngster. Many people even retire from Walmart. There are possibilities for advancement if you like what you do. You have to be patient and understanding in any department you work in.
good,"Fast paced and it makes it feel as if the shift flies by. You better buy some quality walking boots/ shoes. You are going to NEED them every inch (literally) of the way! "
good,"Face Paced , stressful, non organized, need to be a fast learner, heavy lifting involved, job benefits are difficult to obtain, job growth is medium to obtain."
good,Management didn't take good care of employees. Job overall was very easy and the only hard part about it was dealing with other coworkers. Pretty easy job
good,Great environment great people if you want to work here please do so don't hesitate to apply always hiring nice people have fun get paid well great benefits
good,"unica parte que dava um certo incomodo era o local,muito quente."
good,Overall experience was great. I would not recommend overnight to anyone though. Especially if you are in school. It was not easy balancing that schedule.
good,Wal-Mart is a ever changing company that has lost focus on what is most important which is its customers and associates that have made the company what it is today.  Technology is moving to a more interactive simplicity that takes out the personal interaction between people on a daily basis which is going to eventually make retail stores non-exsitant and take a toll on the economy causes there is a lot of people that won't have jobs when these company's are completely interactive.
good,"Wal-Mart is not a terrible job by any means, but it's also not the greatest paying job as well. They recently upped the starting wages to $11 an hour, but closed many Sam's Club stores and layed off countless associates to do so. There are opportunities to advance, but the pay, even for salaried managers, does not equate to the responsibilities that are put in their plate."
good,"Used to be a good place to work, not anymore. The only thing it has going for it is that it is stable.My company got shut down, so I needed a job, and I had history at walmart, it used to be my part time job. Went back, and after 7 years they finally talked me into taking a manager spot. Been doing it 3 years now."
good,"Get to work, clock in, and prep the back for unloading a truck."
good,I was outside most of the day due to me being a car pusher. The management was great and co workers were awesome. Don't have much bad things to say about working there
good,"getting the work done. sometimes wasn't easy working when had to do something else,  hard to get work done when had to stop to do other things. some managers were easy to work with and others were bear cats"
good,This was a nice place to work for just starting out. The work and pay were consistent with each other. Management seemed to care about it's employee base most of the time.
good,"The key duties undertaken by Walmart cashiers upon hire concern various aspects of customer service. Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying for discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. Cashiers also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions. The job features part-time hours at the start, with options for full-time schedules or promotion into managerial careers with experience. Work environments include checkout aisles at store frontends. Cashiers sometimes assist sales and stock associates with remedial tasks during slow hours."
good,Job was ok. Unloading trucks was easy and fun. They took care of you during the summer months. Not so much during the winter or peak time. No chance for advancement unless you like to kiss up.
good,I worked with the company for 18 years in just about every position. I enjoyed working with the associates. The hardest part of the job is when the company decides to downsize and good people are being let go.
good,Started off working at Walmart as a cashier and worked my way up to an Asst.Manager left for better experience and chance to have my own store Did not rush this movement to fast because at time had small children but nice that the opportunity in the company to grow was there Gave me all the skills I needed to a store manager that I needed training was a 6 month program located in a different location.
good,"I was a co-op student when i did this, i love baking that  is what  im goign to college for is to be a pastry  chef and this was s good place to  work and get  exerpeice in what i love."
good,"This was a good and steady job that definitely helped to cover the bills. The job itself really wasn't that difficult, and the people were pretty friendly as well."
good,Walmart was a great first job to have./ I had fun and learned a lot working at Walmart. If I had the chance to work at walmart again as a temporary job I would definitely work here again.
good,I have been treated fairly at the company. What to do for one hour at lunch is a problem as you wind up spending money. Some things get monotonus but dealing with the customers makes you fell pretty good about everything.
good,occasionally fast paceyou can normally expect about 25-30 hours a week even as a part time associate. I workered at a neighborhood walmart nothing like a super walmart better to me.
good,"As all the other retailer, the work load per person or for the department was assigned in such a way that could comply the objectives or satisfy the goal for the day."
good,"If you are into big corporations that see you as a number then this is the place for you.  Go in, do your job, go home. Was hard to move up in the company if you weren't part of the ""group"".  Hard work with minimal help."
good,Was great during the first few years as part time. Doesn't pay enough anymore to make it a career without going into salaried positions. Yearly raises no longer based on performance and everyone gets the same %.
good,"I took the job in my last year of college so I could make and save a little bit of cash. The pay was not terrible compared to other jobs in my area. The down fall, they hated that I was in school. They really have a hard time with employees that do not have a wide open schedule. It is a really stressful environment at times but you learn how to hone in on your customer services skill. I don't think there is another company, maybe amazon, that deals with such a wide range of consumers."
good,"The experience at the Walmart I worked at was pretty normal for retail. The only Major detrimental things I can remember is how disorganized the management structure was and how obtuse the security practices were. Other than that I had good quality co-workers and customers, individual management members were good and the experience was worthwhile."
good,"A typical day at Wall-Mart was never boring. I've learned great customer service. Management was awesome. Workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job, there was no hard part. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different people you meet."
good,"I come from New England. I never experienced racial divide. It was rather strong and I felt it was uncomfortable as there were several persons who were very vocal about a Yankee and my ethnicity. I worked mostly with African Americans, Hispanics and Indian(Hindu)"
good,"High level stress. Poor working conditions at times due to lack of associates or hours allotted. Great benefits. 401K, life insurance, medical, dental, PTO, stock options and competitive wage."
good,It was a learning experience as far as working with civilians and interacting with the public. Definitely alot of room for growth and opportunity with the company.
good,"The team was the best to work with, with smiles on their faces and there always being a joke to tell. The overnight team were the best to work with. =-)"
good,This was a very interesting place to work. It does provide you with the ability to go as far as you wanted to go if you put in the hard work to get there.
good,Walmart was good to me for 17 years.  I worked in high school and through college.  I was an assistant manager for 6 years before promoting to co manager.  Ended employment due to co manager restructure.
good,"My fellow employees gave great support in all areas, this of course included the Managers. Everyone is a a team player. The Management team is always encouraging growth and willing to help employees achieve their goal."
good,I had way too many problems with managers with my clock in for lunch time and I had proof that I went to lunch but they did not believe my proof. Was not appreciate how I was showing them the proof and telling me that I wasn't telling the truth.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because it was one of the jobs I desired to work at. However, one of the managers bullied different coworkers which made me uncomfortable to continue there."
good,mostly stocking its alright. depending on what position you do different things but mostly stock ensure inventory is correct. clean store and work around people and other workers daily.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y en equipo logrando metas de productividad. La empresa si promueve su cultura, la parte más difícil es que la empresa labora los 365 del año y hay que rolar los 3 turnos de trabajo."
good,"Management is always changing therefore hard to follow different expectations, most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and sometimes not flexible with your schedule"
good,good job for someone that is young. opportunity endless pay is not so great. as much as they invest in Training which is very extent that they would pay more.

good,"help customers in person and telephonically"
good,Walmart is a very fast paced company with innovations happening continuously. The benefits are great. The hours for salary are a lot which cuts into family time.
good,Walmart offers opportunities if you are interested in advancement. Diverse teams. Flexible shifts available to help support your everyday busy lifestyle.
good,Great job at distribution center. Amazing pay. Long hours. But you can choose to work 3 days or 4 days. Night shift gives the best pay. Sometimes the automated system is hard to understand.
good,I worked as a cashier and customer service representative. I learned how to assist at the photo lab. I answered customers questions and if i did not know the answer i would try to find someone who did.
good,Walmart is a Grwat place to work.I worked there for 5 years and the hire from within the company. I’m looking for a  career change but I love my experience at Walmart it taught me a lot.
good,nice place to work and shop. possible the right environment and the correct workgroup would make this the ideal job for just about anyone. However for those things to align means a person would have to be in the right place and time.
good,"great place for part time job. if you let them, they will control your life with crazy work hours. use the system, don't let the system use you! easy to move up in company, but its a lot of politics involved."
good,This job requires a lot of work. It can become overwhelming to anyone that is not organized or self-motivated. Each person is assigned a section and has to complete their section within a set time limit. Your work has to meet all the required standards which are inspected by the supervisor each shift.
good,I received a lot of customer service experience. and how to deal with different types of people. the atmosphere was great. the hours were flexible. great co workers
good,Working as an overnight stocker I learned that Wal-Mart is unorganized with tasks handed to each shift. Other shifts are having to pick up for other shifts due to communication issues as well as being unorganized.
good,"I was lucky to have an amazing manager during my time at Walmart. If I knew all stores had a direct manager like her, I would rate them higher, but they don't. It seems any more managment doesn't care about anything out side of their next bonus, and how to make as many people below them do all the work possible. Very rarely do you find a manger that is willing to work beside you and encourage you to go above and beyond."
good,"All things considered it wasn't too bad, they had many expectations that I couldn't always fulfill, however I worked with some good people and friends that I won't soon forget."
good,"I walk my areas for cleanliness, incorrect signage, low in stock, as well as opportunities that may occur throughout the day in the fresh areas at my store."
good,Was a fun job.  management was unhelpful.not enough training to understand hand held units. Was told when hired I would be trained for a week. Got trained for two days.
good,Great company if you have the right people working with you. The managers can be rude and sometimes to busy to talk. Some employees slack off m. Overall it’s an okay company pays okay for doing what your soung
good,fast paced job with no room for error. I don't know why I have to do this review. I would never go back to work at Walmart again. I would flip burgers first.
good,Biggest issue as with most just still doesn't pay enough to allow you to be able to afford your own place without need of a roommate and most of the time your not allowed overtime
good,"Working at Walmart was a challenge, physically. It is very easy, and not uncommon for workers to injure themselves due to the extreme physical demands of the job."
good,Started off working at Walmart as a cashier and worked my way up to an Asst.Manager left for better experience and chance to have my own store Did not rush this movement to fast because at time had small children but nice that the opportunity in the company to grow was there Gave me all the skills I needed to a store manager that I needed training was a 6 month program located in a different location.

Other than that I had good quality co-workers and customers, individual management members were good and the experience was worthwhile."
good,"Very easy job. Either you zone, flow merchandise, or run registers. They definitely take advantage of their employees and will cross train you without extra compensation. Busy work is always done."
good,The job I had to start was unloading tractor trailers. Alot of the younger employees were lazy and it put a strain on the other unloaders. Then I started working in another area and it was much better.
good,"It was becoming more and more competitive and demanding, longer hours at work, resulting in strong work/life imbalance.  Lack of experience and talent in management ranks."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working as an ASM for Walmart. Although I am no longer in that role, the particular store I was assigned was the toughest in our market. As a new hire, I was trained in a very thorough 5 week course that focused on compliance, the Open Door Policy, and the day to day roles of an ASM in a perfect Walmart world."
good,Low compensation and poor job culture is a staple of the WalMart experience. I worked there as a teenager and was by far my least favorite job. I would recommend several other retail stores over Walmart.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you have the mindset of not wanting to make any changes or have your own ideas. If you want to just go to work and keep your head down, this will work for you."
good,You get to interact wide a wide range of people on a daily basis. You learn all sorts of skills dealing with people and handling a fast paced environment while keeping your customers happy.
good,"Assisting customer with returns policies, drawer audits, cash handing, oversaw 20+ employees with lunch breaks. Good communication skills and customer services."
good,"Most shift consist of maintaining  store appearance and cleanliness, stocking, FIFO, baking. Management i would say they treat all employees equally, most of the employees are East Indian  they give more favor them. workplace environment was a good experience because you meet new, different customers. The hardest part  of the was dealing with rude and impatient customers. the most enjoyable part of the job the management always give free lunch or dinner to all employees overtime we have a high profits."
good,Very fast paced. Standard Operating Procedures are constantly being revised. Tends to be understaffed for the procedures to work smoothly. Constant change.
good,"-Responsible to engage with customers and assisting in sales, to continually provide outstanding customer assistance. "
good,Walmart is a cool place to work it is a lot of politics and gossip going on it felt like high school some daysbut as long as u know your job and complete your task the managers give you leeway.
good,There are multiple positions depending on experiences.  There is training available for every position.  You must have flexible hours and be willing to work evening and weekends. The benefits are great.
good,"Wal-Mart is a very  fast paced environment. "
good,Don’t  have a review at all I stop working there because coworkers was stealing  and then managers was being rude and disrespectful  and didn’t care about there employees
good,"There are many good people working for Walmart Global Business Services. I love working on my team but am frequently frustrated by the lack of planning and organization from the top down."
good,Walmart was a very productive place of work but it was very fast paced. Everything that was asked was timed and orderly. The staffing was cool and energetic .
good,Being able to have a good relationship with my co-workers was nice. Was able to make work go by a lot faster with ease and make the work environment very relaxed.
good,stressful quick pace slow pace relaxed laid back chill atmosphere hour lunch 2 15 minute breaks discounts great food great benefits dental and health plans
good,They need to treat their employees more better and the people in charge need to read about integrity. I felt as if it was a very cut throat place. People will smile in your face and stab in the back with a snap
good,Walmart is a very fast paced company with innovations happening continuously. The benefits are great. The hours for salary are a lot which cuts into family time.

good,Was a fun job.  management was unhelpful.not enough training to understand hand held units. Was told when hired I would be trained for a week. Got trained for two days.
good,Great company if you have the right people working with you. The managers can be rude and sometimes to busy to talk. Some employees slack off m. Overall it’s an okay company pays okay for doing what your soung
good,fast paced job with no room for error. I don't know why I have to do this review. I would never go back to work at Walmart again. I would flip burgers first.
good,Biggest issue as with most just still doesn't pay enough to allow you to be able to afford your own place without need of a roommate and most of the time your not allowed overtime
good,"Working at Walmart was a challenge, physically. It is very easy, and not uncommon for workers to injure themselves due to the extreme physical demands of the job."
good,It was a okay job hard-working had to be on time deal with people at all times good for someone to start off with their career and make something with the company at a young age
good,the way they ran things just  wasn't to  my satisfaction. i would have done things a hole lot  different. the communication just wasnt were is should have been.
good,"Walmart was a great company at one time.  Every year that goes by they continue to expect you to do more with less.  Yes, the company has streamlined many processes to make jobs more efficient, but you can only squeeze so much juice out of a lemon.  The culture is spiraling downward as the past couple years hourly associates were given crumbs for raises.  Everyone received the same amount, so associates who worked harder than others saw no extra reward.  Every time minimum wage is increased, it only affects associates that are brand new to the company.  So associates that have been with the company 3 years end up making the same as someone off the streets.  Walmart never wants to talk about all of these inequalities and they expect store management to not talk about it either.  Sam Walton cared about making money AND taking care of his associates.  Those times have come and gone."
good,The job was easy but the management is rude because there is no union. My manager was very over the top and yelled at associates during our group meetings.
good,"Well i would go into work about 4 after i got out of school at 3:30 and we would stock and we would help customers if it was needed and it was a little different because you had to find out what was wrong with there phone or computer, answer as many questions. Member of management was helpful when you need it."
good,Walmart taught me that Its possible to work you way from the bottom to the top. But management was really pore and we where under paid for our efforts to make the store look great.
good,I started out at Walmart right out of high school and it has been a great place to work I’ve met some wonderful people and have gained so many skills.
good,"The management role at walmart is complex. You have to wear many different hats and have to address problems daily. We are compensated well, but this does not take these actions into account. Working days off, working alot of hours weekly and not paid for them, not being able to take your pto time that you have rightfully have acheived, job cutts to jobs that you think is safe. I have had my job eliminated three times since being with the company for 19 years."
good,Wal-mart is a good place to work. Good pay and benefits. Must be willing to work nights and weekends as a manager. My current position as a co-manager was eliminated.
good,The hardest part of the job was doing everything that you did not apply for meaning sometimes i would stock or even push carts outside.When it would get really busy some of the mangers would not help  out and cash out customers.My hours were all over the place never had a set schedule as well as never had the chance to get a raise because they would always make excuses saying its too busy and what not.Felt like i was way under paid for what i had to do at such a stressful environment.
good,this store especially was one of favoritism. If you worked hard they would give you and expect you to do more which run a lot of good workers off to other employers. While the ones that did not work hard they are still there to this day.
good,working at walmart it wasnt a bad company. it just the people that work that management team have very bad attitudes they dont treat you how they want to be treated its all about respect
good,Ok company to work for. I don't agree with Thier point system. Its not conveient for employees that travel from the city to suburb locations. Transferring is not a option unless its a hardship
good,Needs better management. You hace nice coworkers. The discounts should be better. You should get more than a 50 cent raise every 6 months. It should be a dollar raise.
good,"The management is almost 100% closeted. They are oppressing and uncaring to any situation, nut they do pay really nice, and the ability to move up is slow and the management isnt willing to do position trades."
good,"I miss working for this company it's been years , The team at Walmart was awesome , when I first started there I was a cashier upfront then I worked my way up to electronics."
good,"A typical day consisted of ringing up customers and cleaning my workstation. When I was not busy, I would help coworkers with their stations and assist customers with finding items in the store."
good,"I worked 7am to 3:30 pm stocked produce on sail floor, unloaded produce , rotated stock in cooler, nice work environment, friendly people, learned all the names of the fruits and vegetable."
good,I worked in produce for 10 months and I actually enjoyed the job.  The problem was that I couldn't support myself and I needed to get a second job.  This job was ok for me when I really needed work.
good,"I have not worked there since 2012, so 6 years ago, so do not really remember much from working there in the short time that I worked there. However, I do remember the hours being good"
good,my day to day activities included stocking shelves and making sure the store was ready for business every day.  The hours were 10 om to 7 am.  We also unloaded trucks occasionally on this shift
good,"As one might expect, working here isn't particularly difficult, just a bit frustrating. Sometimes given one task by one manager, only to be overridden an hour later by another, etc. Coworkers make the job much more bearable."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. they are competitive and fast paced. i enjoyed helping customers everyday. they have decent pay and its mostly a fun place to work.
good,The people at wal mart are good to work for the hours of work are competive really enjoyed assembling and different training . The work place is really enjoyable
good,"It was ok working there, i just felt that i should have been paid more for the work i did that was not in my job prescription. but over all its a job."
good,a typical day at work is when you are making sure the customers meet their needs by greeting with a smile and ringing up their items they are wanting too purchase
good,The management takes not much care of those employees who don't miss work or call in and their pay sucks for all the hard work you have to do and no manger will help you... I guess they forgot where they started from
good,"neat and clean environment , good staff ,employees were respected and very one had a caring nature toward each other more over each staff member was given chance to enhance or showcase their skill which were not related to their profession ."
good,"Walmart is a high demand, high stress job that promises to take care of hourly associates only. If looking for a long term salaried manager career, Walmart is no longer the company that you want to work for."
good,"Customer service top priority, job advancement  very fast paced , not enough employees to run and stock the store, POI never kept proper inventory,  worked slot if hours when the company had a deadline,  no social life"
good,"i started off with overnight maintenance cleaning toilets and scrubbing floors then after a wile moved to asset protection catching thieves, pretty fun and good pay. now i am a stocker."
good,This is a great starter job.  There is little room for advancement.  The pay is not good but the benefits are ok.  Long hours and consistently working with very little breaks.
good,too many managers asked for things to be done at the same time. During the summer you were not allowed in the store except at lunch and breaks. other employees were great to work with.
good,"i learned how to stock the shelves at kmart. this was not a very difficult job to do. i was a casheir most of the time, but i also did cleaning up as well."
good,They get the job done at whatever cost. They are very busy management and can not get to every employee that they need to. Company is great but each store is different.
good,"Like everything, could have been better, could have been worst. I didn't mind the work load or any of the people! I learned how to work with others well and what it was like to be in the work force."
good,"not very flexible with their hours. At some point while attending school I spoke to the manager about school, said I needed to find another job. However working there was somewhat fun."
good,"Nice place to work, was done through a temp agency and was somewhat satisfied. Manager was not the best but regardless the experience was fulfilling with good pay"
good,This wasn't the worst company or the best. Mostly depends on who your manager is and how they deal with stress. Would consider going back if the position was right
good,I only worked there for the Christmas season and after that when I tried to apply for permanent at their request they never hired me. This was even after they told me they were very impressed with my work.
good,"The work environment is friendly with customers. Management is professional "
good,you have lots of room to grow in the work place many different job opportunities there. i had fun working there and i liked most of my co-workers. like any other job it will have it's ups and downs just have to make the best of each work day.
good,Good job for what it was alot of work never complained management was kind of bias but stayed in my own lane. Alot of traffic as far as customers during the day.
good,"Giving great customer service every day, cashing people out, handling the register, fronting all products, etc. Try my best to make sure every customer feels special. Most importantly, making sure the customer leaves satisfied and with a smile on their face"
good,"I have to wait too much for the CSM for helping the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart it was too far from where I moved.  They were pretty good with me when I had to go on medical leave, ut fired me soon after."
good,Leader in retail eCommerce and logistics; fast paced high expectations; great company. Growth opportunities. Company is making many changes which are needed and appropriate. These changes have created uncertainty in the workforce so it is tense for Home Office associates. Field locations are also experiencing changes but very much sheltered from most company changes.
good,Wal-Mart was A ok company to work for they really don't give u hours but besides that great opportunity I would refer my friends or family member to work for this company
good,"its a good job for a first timer or to get yourself on your feet and start, you can make a career out of it if you choose too and be a manager somewhere else"
good,"Satisfactory job environment; able to advance when desired.  Coworker staff is helpful and project team player environment."
good,"Walmart was not too bad, though the feeling of advancement was not really apparent, and workers were more about self-growth than collaboration. Depending on co-workers, work at Walmart is either fun and enjoyable or just a bore."
good,"Everyone has their own opinion,but working there was very overwhelming. Paid so little for those kind of jobs. 13-16 DOLLARS AN HR WOULD SOOTHE THE TENSION."
good,"Walmart is an ok, part time job while you are in college. It is not a great job if you are trying to find a career to advance in. Most employees do not feel valued, they are just a body to fill a space until the next person."
good,"extremely fun productive staffing was amazing very negotiable with scheduling neat and cleen  staffing was very helpful pay was exceeding, well worth the experience"
good,"Very faced paced environment. Some advancement opportunities. In Management, expect long hours and high expectations. Employee training programs available"
good,"Inconsistent on everything. One manager tells you to do things one way, and a different manager tells you to do things a different way. The schedule was all over the place. Everyone was more worried about drama and gossip."
good,I enjoyed my job.. as a stockman. If i could find another job like it id be set.. just couldn't handle the manager being rude in unprofessional to all of us..
good,management was very rude to its employees. they do not tell you everything in orientation and then will write you up for things they never told you. customers were usually very nice.
good,"The fresh foods department decided to use employees as guinea pigs for a new system wherein every fresh department employee suddenly had to learn and be capable of working in all the fresh departments (produce, deli, bakery, and meats). No attempt to compensate the added stress was made. There were no pay raises. Also, previously dangled carrots of certification were offered, insisting it would guarantee a graduation into higher pay, but once hired, no one was given the opportunity to complete the extra training, and thus all employees were left to stagnate with no hope of increased pay. This company values their own profitability even at the expense of recognizing experience."
good,Stressful and hard working it oknplace to work sometimes unfair and don't like to pay overtime but sometimes  fair and don't like to pay when you get hurt on the job
good,"Too many tasks assigned with little support. Management at times looked after themselves. Few other workers, and getting stuck with double duty. Benefits were the better part of the job."
good,"I work as a cashier, you are on your feet most of the time. You do get breaks just depends on how many hours you work, and you do get a lunch depends on the hours. You get paid time off but you have to work for them. Insurance and vacation time comes up when you are there for an year."
good,"Set and Remodel New and Current stores. Decommission old stores."
good,"I worked at Walmart , because it was about 2.5 miles from my home. I didn't like the changes of work schedule each week & I didn't like having to start at part time & it takes a while before coming full time."
good,"it want too terrible, i enjoyed most days but some weren't the best and that's mostly on me. the people there were generally nice but on the rare occasion my managers would keep me stressed out. all in all though? not a bad job"
good,"Slicing meat and cheese for customers "
good,I only worked for the company a little over a year. I moved very quickly from checker to customer service manager. I left the company for a higher paying job.
good,"Wal-Mart is a humongous company with a lot of resources and good reputation."
good,Management had a severe problem in the communication department and having directions properly relayed down the chain of employees. There was also quite a bit of favoritism between upper management and certain employees.
good,A tribal operational culture coupled with no senior leader accountability and zero objective performance measures for new  leaders from outside the company make success a challenge.
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company"
good,Working in the stores is tough and you need to be the right kind of person for a management position.  Lots of hours are needed to get the job completed and required.
good,A great place to begin a career.  Ever changing environment starting to making you feel slightly insecure.  Fantastic people and new experiences make work fun.
good,"I loved working for Walmart, from coworkers to my actual job description. The only issue I had was with management. I can't judge every establishment off of one crew but it was an unfortunate situation."
good,Wal mart is a bg company not too great of benifits basically u can find the lowest quality of full time work here but they hire all the time easy to get in too and stay
good,"Work days are stressful, management isn't the best. Never enough registers open when rush hour hits. Managers have favorite employees and will move them up in the system quickly."
good,"Very average work environment. Management snobby, but co-workers are great and very helpful. Customers are often impatient and rude. Very difficult to thrive in the work environment because management does not care."
good,"My experience at Walmart overall was a good one. Very fast paced environment, many hours available, lots of room to grow and learn. Overall friendly and helpful management team. Biggest concern would be the lack of schedule flexibility."
good,"not as bad as some of the other chains, but the hours are long especially if you have children. overall not a bad place to work vs walgreens or cvs. would rather work here than elsewhere"
good,"Great for housewifes who need a little extra income. Not bad for 'Corperate Climbers' with a college education. Being ex-military or having a military background is almost a requirement. If you don't have that for your resume, don't expect much from this company. You  will be passed over for almost everything in favor of those who do have a military background. Period."
good,Working at Walmart was dealing with people and getting what they need and then go home. It was stressful because you had make sure that the customer's needs are taken care of and that you make it through the job without getting mad at someone.
good,"I work in the deli at Walmart and I do not think it is Walmart that I dislike, I think it is the deli, to be honest. "
good,"é uma empresa que te me deu varias oportunidades de crescer e conhecer o ambiente,era bem dinamica,"
good,It was really fun working for Walmart get people training me on cakes. N how to decorate them n how to take labels and put them on the cakes and when to decorate cakes on time really fun time!
good,"Ok work environment...... Daily work flow was normal, sometimes stocking freight could be a little overwhelming depending on how many  associates are available. Really appreciated the team work."
good,"Maintain freight integrity by inspecting freight for damage and misplacement "
good,"Enjoyed working there, learned alot and love the people I worked with. I really don't have the time for this ----I wish this type of questionaire wasn't manatory."
good,Workers are expected to do jobs of multiple people and some that goof around are not dealt with. Some sections are left almost empty due to the demand for people at cash.
good,They never give opportunities for advancement. Very strict with attendance. They would train you to do something else but not pay you for it. I was stuck working with kids and hearing all the Wal-Mart drama. Not something I enjoyed. This job is great for teens and someone who knows someone in management to help you advance. However I would still not have any of my kids work there. The pay is terrible with no benefits and they keep you from being full time.
good,"If your supervisor doesn't like you, your doomed! Walmart when I was there I had started at 8.25/hour. It was a new store so it wasn't easy to get along with the staff at that time. I was at the store on 44th Harlan."
good,"At Walmart it was long hours and hard work sometimes there was no time for a break the staff was amazing, but management needed work. the mangers needed to be trained better because I had to teach most of them the front where I worked which was customer service."
good,Very easy laid back job. You do have to stand on your feet the entire shift but that work day goes by pretty fast especially if you work as a front end cashier
good,It's a job. Don't expect anything fancy. You get a check every week and people are phased out every ne season. Unless you're management there isn't much room to grow here.
good,"I do not have anything I want to share about Walmart as an employer. It is a place to work if you need a job, just like any other place a person would work."
good,"It is a productive job, it can be stressful a lot of times. The pay is okay for a person who does not have a lot of bills. The most enjoyable part of the job, are the people!"
good,"*Very fast-paced office with tightly scheduled appointments, as well as assisting walk-in customers needing adjustments, repairs, cleanings, scheduling appointments, etc."
good,Absolutely loved the job although in the end they were trying to cut hours and making it so that even part time people couldn't get a second job.  unsure of walmarts thinking on that.
good,a typical day at Walmart will be depending on the section you were located at. I learn how to communicated with customers and learn how to solve problems. management is always on point the associates and there is conflicts. The hardest part of Walmart is nothing really. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates.
good,This was an ok job but the pay wasnt great. Tje staff and mangement wete fine but the hours scheduled werent very many. I would work here again if I had to though
good,I worked in the garden center it was a chill environment it’s kinda outside so it was a little hot back there. But it was an easy job just gotta be fast especially like mid afternoon when it gets busy.
good,Worked there for a few years and it was fine. Would like to find something new that would be better pay and schedule. Really would like to get out of the holiday stress
good,Enjoyed working with the public.  Enjoyed working with the people that were under me.  Had benefits and enjoyed very much the growth opportunities.  Variety of people to work with.
good,My first job was at Walmart. It was stressful to begin with. The atmosphere isnt good. Nasty employees. Management is poor. I got paid 10.50 for being a dept manager and i thought it was nice cuz i bought my first car using the money i saved from working at walmart. Gracias walmart
good,"It is ok. You need money Walmart the place to go!"
good,I liked some of the management and my position. I liked the pay. I did not like the lack of holiday pay. I did not like the part time positions. Wal-Mart does not hire any full time employees at this time unless you can jump in at a management position. I do not like how hard it is to advance within the company.
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. If you just need a job to carry you for a while, it'll suite your needs. They have good benefits, and they pay okay, but unless you're willing to keep working your way to the top, you won't be able to sustain your self."
good,Overall its a job and makes for a good stepping stone for other opportunities. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Customers and interacting with them throughout a days work. I have learned that when people are desperate.... they will go to any length to get the items they so desire even if it is to steal them. Theft is running rampid in our retail stores....its very sad.
good,They had terrible scheduling. Not enough people on at a time and breaks were hard to get because they where always short handed out front. If I was to recommend anything I'd say to try to get inside you don't get paid enough to work outside.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad company when youre fresh out of school and just looking for something to take up time. Staying there, youll see all of the behind the scenes attitudes and irritations that occur. Although these things happen wherever you go, Walmart isn't paying anyone enough to deal with what we deal with"
good,My typical work day would consist of me clocking in and looking at what i can do right away. For example if there is medications to be filled i would right away engage in that. Once i am done i find what else i can do just to keep my self busy and that everything goes smooth. The hardest part of the job for me would be the calculations of dosages and strengths. The workplace culture/environment is very down to earth and hard working which i like. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you can come into work and just have fun with your co-workers and at what you're doing. I think that is a big plus in a job place or environment.
good,"Pasa el tiempo rápido."
good,Did a good job moved from area to area for the first 6-8 months then given a semi permanent position stocking dairy dept. Breaks were consistent benifits were good.
good,The job was just not for me. I think that it was a good job at first but after a while it got boring and that is why I am looking for something different that would be more enjoyable for me.
good,I opened with this store qhen it first open the managers were great ... Everything was hands on training whiched i loved customers were great and our grand opening was wonderful
good,"Buenas personas, buen ambiente laboral, equipo unido"
good,"i am a cashier working 16 hours a week on tuesday and thursday nights and sundays, it helps suppliment my income and is really hard work but it helps so i stick with it"
good,Unloading and loading up trailers.pack up the products and send them out. Scanned every page before sending out. But overall it's a good but also eazy job to do.
good,The co-worker and customers are fun to work with at any point of the day management can sometime be harsh when it come to projects but mostly a good experience
good,"Life at this job was very different on a daily basis.  Since the passing of the originator of this place, the focus from being a family store, to being a big box store, became more evident.  This was a physically demanding job."
good,Checked out customers merchandise and handled all monetary transactions.  Repetitive and consist of standing your whole shift.  Management were there to assist you.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I like working with people and that gave me the chance to"
good,"I enjoyed all my coworker and serving the customers. However, I did not enjoy some of the management. They were being rude, I felt my managers discriminated me based on my skin color."
good,I worked with a lot of people. We unloaded trucks and stocked items. We worked together to get everything taken care of. There was a scheduled rotating working time which was every 3 weeks.
good,"Management was bad, never really treat you nice. Will task you with ridiculous things to do. Never really seem to care at all. Wouldn't recommend this place."
good,the environment is fast paced but the hours provided are great and a minimum of 20 hours is provided to everyone. management is not very approachable.
good,I had move out of Chicago so Walmart wouldn't let me relocate I wasn't there at time long enough to relocate I had lot of fun with work at Walmart the customer was very friendly
good,"Walmart is a great place to get into the big box retail and advance. Once you get into salary positions it gets a little more challenging. As I was told by a store manager three years ago, ""Get used to hearing more with less."". They have reduced manpower and hours in the store but the expectations have not lowered but increased. My advise would be to grow to a salary member of management and get a couple of years of experience and then apply elsewhere."
good,"I would walk the floor for 8 hours a day. Working there I learned about safety management, theft prevention, and how bad people dress on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job was the people I dealt with daily, and who I apprehended."
good,It was a pretty good company to work for in the fifteen years that I was there.  I was given the opportunity to advance during my tenure at the company.
good,"Overall work atmosphere was good, management was nice and helped you when you needed it. I did not like working there simply because $9 an hour isn't much to survive off of. Plus they only allowed me to work 34 hours a week, no benefits for the first year.  Good company, just not enough for me"
good,That about sums Walmart up . There is almost no training needed to stock shelves. The problems are the nightly meeting which may have originally been started as inspirational but had devolved into nightly acusations of bad children. After a while you felt like you were working at grade school.
good,Not enough associates to do job
good,"I loved working at Walmart because, not only my co workers were fun to work with, the people you interact with day by day makes it even more comforted.  Also, helping customers and meeting new people everyday was great.  It was always busy, so it made my day go by fast, and going to work was exciting everyday."
good,"fast pace, fun to work, sometimes a lot of work, managers are down to earth, also sometimes there wasn't enough work and would make you do something else, at times the truck would get there super late"
good,"When I work at Walmart I was really happy first "
good,It was the first time at a job that I was lost.  However my coworkers took good care to help me out. The mangers did not give me much directions so I had to figure things out with little help.
good,wasn't a bad job just not for me and the career path i would to take. some of the management wasn't supportive towards the employees. it was just a high school job to learn how to manage money.
good,"Wal-Mart has its own reputation.  Some days were great there.  People could be awesome, customer and associates alike.  Other days were terrible to put it lightly.  A lot of times you just had to find a way to keep yourself sane and keep pushing through."
good,I don't agree with some of the company policies when they claim to care so much about their employees. Feel that the absentee policy needs reviewed. Dr.notices not being acceptable form of proof for example.
good,can learn a lot
good,"Its a decent job, face paced. the workers are lound and ghetto. its like being back in i high school when you go on back and go into the lunch room. and the people who shop their our needy annoying A-holes."
good,"You really need to be a people person when you work here. You need to make nice with the right people to get promoted at this particular store. If you make any trouble with the wrong people, they will make you miserable. I have seen people get grandfathered in and i have seen people get bullied until they left."
good,They are terrible with   Communication you dony know how many personal day sick days r anything but its a good job to take care of you and your family
good,working for that company was okay doest give enough training on the cashier.plus the cashiering test took too long to do. plus working there was okay.
good,Company is a good company to work . Management are ok to work for . Work culture is good . Days are different every day there is always something new to learn
good,Every day was pretty much the same. Would mostly end up working alone.  Every one was pretty nice and helpful.  Management was nice  and kind of hands off.
good,"i had worked every department multiple time and had the store memorized every night would start with a team meeting with all the managers and staff for 3rd shift and then you'd be told what areas you had to work in for the night such as grocery, or general merchandise. then after the meeting you would scan your card at one of the kiosks to see what aisles you were given and a time frame for each aisle which made work a bit of a rush and made time fly usually."
good,I worked there for 3-4 years. It was a good place to start I started building a Walmart off of Texas and culbra. It was store 4131. We went thru 3 different managers there.
good,I work in the deli i served the customers. I learned how to use he meat cutter and other machine in the department. The manger was okay the work environment was okay. cleaning the machine was the hardest. i enjoyed when i got paid.
good,"The work was easy to do but, everything was timed. The times wouldn't match up to all the work you had to do. A typical work day would be helping out customers, stocking the shelves, cleaning up all the boxes and plastic, and taking the left over products to the back room to be put in the bins. The management was good they cared about our feed back on our jobs and things that would make it easier for us to do our jobs properly. There wasn't anything hard for us to do other then finding help for lifting thing over 40lbs. The thing I enjoyed most about the job was working third shift."
good,My overall experience with this company was rewarding. I learned many things there and felt with many situations that allowed me to grow in responsibility and properly manage any situation.
good,Walmart was an ok place to work for they do not appreciate there workers. Over worked and under paid. I ran 3 departments with one person very hard. Will never work for Walmart again.
good,sometime can be relax job sometimes stressfull you have to perfprm diferent jobs everyday schudele change all the time  break change time all the time
good,"typically, overnight stocking, freezer stocking end cap filling"
good,"nice coworkers, mostly easy job, managers are nice. work is very repetitive and you meet lots of different people. if there is ever any problems management is good about fixing it"
good,"Working at Walmart means that you must be fast, follow the rules, and make sure you finish your task on time. I personally liked working at Walmart, but the managers were very rude to me and also to other employees."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work. Or at least it wasn't when I worked there. Enjoyed working with people I worked with. Didn't have too many complaints other than the pay and was an every two week paycheck.
good,"If the stores would work on bettering their management, the store would make for a great place to work. once that is fixed it will be a million times better for work experience."
good,"Fast paced"
good,Wal-Mart is everything that you read about. I get there and people can't do their jobs.  The manager is horrible and is over paid.  They are so caught up in policy and procedures that stupidity gets rewarded.
good,"Working at Walmart I meet great people it was a good first job and learning what to do and not to do was a easy experience."
good,"We were able to work at our own pace as long as we got the job done. We had a basketball goal, horse shoes, and a washers game that we could use during our break."
good,"I enjoyed working there when there was a large group of staff, but things got hectic towards seasonal and people quit which mad things more difficult."
good,It's a nice place to work meet different people but not a career place recommended for younger groups to get their foot in a career establishment starter employment I do recommend it to get experience for future employment walmart does need a little more experience in customer service and employee acknowledgement and appreciation.
good,"A typical day at work included stalking shelves, organizing, and helping customers. I learned a lot about customer service. The management is reasonable and friendly."
good,"Like the sign says...Walmart. If you're working retail and have not worked Walmart, then you haven't worked retail. This store has a high turn over and poor management. But as I have seen it's typical Walmart."
good,"Employees were awesome and fun to work with, including the managers but the job was very unpredictable. I had not known I was under contract. Very poor communication"
good,Fast pace working environment all ways short hand for work load.  Management lacks supervision skills.  Don't schedule enough help for busy days making customers wait longer due to being short handed.
good,it a ok job competitive worked days ok management walmart is a decent store for most could be paid better and better staffed dont know what else to say
good,Walmart is a quick fast paced job if your working in the back they like to have all the trucks unloaded at a certain time. They like you to work in all areas.
good,I do not recommend working for Walmart.  I needed a job and may go back if acceptable work is found.  There is a chance for advancement however for those that really seek it.
good,Walmart is a productive workplace with a fairly clean environment. Most positions require team work. Being a cashier required working at fast pace and being friendly.
good,"Electronic sales associate"
good,they were big about people not getting overtime.  it had to be approved my management or you could get in alot of trouble. you had to keep track of your own hours.
good,"its a fast pace job , when a customer comes through your line make sure your doing what ever you have too do to get them in and out , get to work on time , do your job right & have excellent customer service"
good,"Learned how to be strong"
good,I enjoy the job the costumer was fairly nice for the most part. Some of the employees are very helpful and would help you get your job done after their work was done.
good,"Customer service is never the same day to do. The day to day of what needs to be done in a department is basically the same, but the contact with the customers is what keeps the job rewarding."
good,I think Walmart was a pretty good place to work.  It has been many years since I was an employee but my experience was good.  They made it easier on me when pregnant and holding a full time job.
good,Es divertido tiene un buen ambiente laboral la mayoría de los días
good,"On a typical work day would start with unloading a truck and then putting the freight out on the sales floor. I learned a few things like, how to read where a item is located do to the department."
good,Walmart seems that due to having a mass amount of employees that employees are treated less on a personal relationship as in my manager could not even remember my name.
good,"At Walmart the starting pay is $9.00 an hour and a dollar raise after 6 months. You can only receive the raise if your complete modules on the computer and as a cashier, there is rarely time to go do the modules."
good,"It wasn't the worst place to work.Honestly I would have liked to see better management. Better quality of staff, it feels like anyone can get a job here."
good,You must be on top of your game at all times.. People friendly customer service must be excellent .. Constant organizing .. Stay focused quick understanding and knowledgable
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. The best part of the job in my opinion were the many many customers that came in. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well.
good,"The employees and management were very helpful and welcoming. They helped to make me as comfortable as possible. The pay was very fair and acceptable. I didn't experience hard parts of the job, as I was not there long enough. However, it definitely required effort and was not a slacking job."
good,"I lead over 75 cashiers through out my day. I was over the whole font end of the store daily, I did customer service transactions, money orders, returns, exchanges, deposits, evaluations, interviews and daily paperwork."
good,"Last two years of employment I was full time and given first shift."
good,i learned how to use certain equipment to better train my abilities while loading and unloading boxes. The days were busy and always a lot of work to be done. i interacted with other employees and some customers.
good,"Worked 12p-9p shifts, or 1p-10p shift.  Learned how to reset various sales modules when requires, Learned how to help customers when customers could not find their desired products.Learned to use walker-stackers and electric pallet jacks.Performed various duties as related to quality control of products."
good,You definitely had to stay on top of things.. A lot of money came through the cash office(its walmart). So a lot to count and go through. Had to make sure all cashiers had change.
good,"Customers were rude, had to always beg management for hours so stressful to be unsure of how you were going to pay your bills next. a typical day would be stressful to a point where you didn't even want to come in to work anymore."
good,I enjoyed working with the public while working with Walmart.  The pay wasn't all that good but it was a job and it paid the bills and took care of my family
good,the job was tough hard work for little to no recognition for all your hard work. the manager was often not around and being paid to take a break all night while all other employess picked up the slack .
good,"A typical day is very fast paced. This job allowed me to build customer service and management skills. The workplace culture is ok, management is typical. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interactions."
good,The hiring process was quick but the training took hours to get through. After the I honestly loved the night shift since it let you go through your tasks quickly.
good,Wal-Mart is not a bad company to work for.  I have been employed there for 15 years. I'm just looking for a change in jobs because of my disability. I need more of a sit down job.
good,It was very easy to get a job there. they treat you with respect and care for there workers and give good benefits. I see workers happy and they know what they are doing.
good,Aclararia bien los carteles de las ofertas muchas veces los carteles quedan ahi muchos dias y la gente lleva y a la hora de cobrar dice otro precio la gente se queja y produce perdida de tiempo y mala reputacion para elllos
good,"It's been years since I've worked at Walmart but when i did i enjoyed it. The customers were fun to deal with, the management staff i had to deal with was great and available to help with any issues you had"
good,"Through my experience at Walmart, I learned a lot about quick efficient Customer Service.  The Company is developing flaws that I am not interested in continuing working with.  Very little communication between the shifts."
good,"On your feet the whole time.  Most days were trouble free.  Quite busy the entire day.  Good things are benefits, discounts, mandatory breaks and lunchtimes.  Hard to believe but in NM this is not required by law, I found this out after leaving.   Walmart just follows their own guidelines."
good,"the job is an ok job, i liked it there. i would have not left if it hadnt been for low hours and haveing personal problems at the time. i learned how to deal with customers and cashier and how to put up stock, unload trucks."
good,"It's pretty much routine every day. Holidays are the worst. You can make many friends, but sometimes it's challenging because you may have to compete with them to get to the next level of management. Just do a good job and get your work done."
good,all i have to say it was ok working for walmart i was preg and they kinda was easy on my being 8 months i went into early labor  and wasput into hospital so i rally dont know wha to say i was temp for christmas
good,Its was a real friendly place to work i liked it but it was to hard stocking because of my back and neck and i wanted a security job and the boss was great.
good,"Good co-workers, hours are flexible.  Customer service can be very busy and frustrating, and management is often busy.  Store was understaffed, so work not always able to get finished.  More overnight employees would help."
good,"It was hot, dirty, loud and the work load was in constant state of change.  Bottom of the barrel kind of  job. The pay was ok for the amount of work required."
good,Walmart is a good job to a certain point. if you are not a fulltime employee they do not offer you benefits. the hours are not flexible. they do not accept doctor notes.
good,worked hard to get full time but got it some management great some not so great do not like how they handle misunderstandings. they should handle things differently sometimes
good,The tire shop was a fun place to work. i loved showing up to my job everyday knowing that the people i worked with was fun to be around. there was never a day i dread goig to work.
good,"I really enjoy meeting and being around lots of people so this was good.  I didn't mind the register work, but I very much enjoyed the pharmacy.  Good supervisor, great pleasure."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but it is retail which is constantly in competition to stay the low price leader which required a lot from its employees.
good,"the job positions i was given were fairly easy to perform, the management was very busy, the workplace was quick-paced but fun."
good,i worked as a overnight stocker for a year i didnt really learn nothing i didnt already know but i stocked shelves and organized....i also made those fancy displays in the store
good,"Low  camaraderie with coworkers , but amazing customers. Helping customers made my day by assisting them with their shopping and locating products that they were searching for."
good,"stocking fresh vegetables, putting up freight in cooler, first in/first out rotating, fast moving, cleaning shelves, cleaning work area sweeping & mopping floors as needed, preparing for inventory, setting up displays, stayed busy all day, talking to customers & giving the best possible customer service makes a great day"
good,"Walmart is a place where you can either have a great day or bad day just depending on what manger is there. I've had mangers tell me that a plastic safety chain is more important then my safety glasses. On the bright side, I've had great mangers that want you to succeed and grow. The company is hit and miss."
good,Wal-Mart is a great job! I have learned so many new things about inventory and stocking for my manager and co-workers. management is very cooperative!
good,Management is designed to accommodate the diversity and improving employee/customer relations. Workflow is often dispersed among several managers and levels of associates to improve overall care for the customer.
good,Walmart is a place to work if you are fresh out of high school. But long term i would not recommend it. But if your are in a hard situation in your life u can Pay h bills with it .
good,"This was my first job and it taught me to have pride in where you work, great customer service and always improving. The hardest part was management being disrespectful, and rude customers."
good,"I haven't worked there in almost 12 years"
good,"It is a good place to work with good management.They got lot of benefit and the employees are so friendly to each other."
good,Good calm place to work with easygoing customers and understanding (for the most part) managers. Problems arose when my schedule became one day a week and i was barely making enough money to pay for the gas to get out there.
good,"It all comes down to the managers that you get. Some managers are clearly better than others. you will quickly find your preferred ones to talk to."
good,"Walmart is a retail discount department store. It has its flaws. I worked for several years and have had no problems for the those years. The management has changed and as it is, most of the new managers are not educated in college or have people skills. ie. with cellphone, they don't know how to talk to customers or associates correctly. I mean this in a major way. So with that, it is time for me, I believe to find some other venue to work. I love working, and I do a good job I know, but it is difficult to make supervisors satisfied if they don't make their focus clear on what they actually want! When there are too many chiefs involved, it makes it confusing to say the least. "
good,"face paced eniviroment , met a lot of new people  .part time job only thing I didn't like was the work hours/short shifts.managment was pretty smooth."
good,At the time being at walmart I was able to advance in the company.  I enjoyed helping people. When inventory came it was stressful due to my dept I took over. Overall it was a good experience.
good,I worked in the pharmacy as a cashier and technician in training. I enjoyed the responsibilities that I had working both positions. The people were great to work with. It was stressful at times.
good,"I worked night shift. It was very fast paced, hard work. It's not the worst job but it's not the best either. For how hard and long you work it sucks how many vacations days they give you. I've known people to work there for years and not get rewarded for their hard work."
good,"In my time that I was there, the pace was great. If you knew the right people and spoke up, you could get ahead.  Ample amount of breaks the pay is worth it."
good,This is a retail environment where you need to work hard and it can work in your benefit. They like to promote from within which really helps all of their associates and they really look at for the veterans.
good,"The job was not bad at all. I simply had to leave due to health issues that were out of my control. Overall, if you need a job and can do the work, WalMart is not a bad place to work."
good,Walmart as if I need to say more so instead I am going to type gibberish until the required minimum with this explantion included. Though I would say that about did it so I guess no gibberish sorry.
good,It was a nice place to work. They people I worked with were nice and were willing to help they customers as well as other employees. During the holidays it could get hectic at times but managers and co-workers were willing to help in any way they could to make things a lot smoother running.
good,"Since I worked 3rd shift, I did not see many people.  I was in the back room most of the time unpacking shoes.  There was no place to advance, and they cut my hours."
good,It is a great company but the only thing is that you get hired and get part time even if you sign up for full time so you get to work less than 40 hours for every week
good,"Customer service focused environment. Inclusive workforce and management. Stressful and fast paced workplace culture. Walmart encourages employees to train, develop and advance within the company."
good,It was fun to work with customers daily. It was a fun place to work and you were able to work hard and still enjoy your job. If you had concerns you were able to talk to some of the managers.
good,"While I worked there, the atmosphere was competitive, cut-throat, and stressful. We were forced to upsell even when people were on Medicaid. Walmart wanted their money from everyone, even if they couldn't afford the options."
good,"You have to be a people friendly personality  to work at Walmart. I met a lot of People and friends at Walmart. learned a lot working at Walmart. You have to be willing to work as a team, such as covering for each others break when needed. able to delegate your time to complete your duties."
good,"There were opportunities for growth, but rarely any employee recognition or incentive to do better. You could be working at your absolute best but being paid less than someone who does very little and just happens to be employed there longer. It's fine as a job to tie you over between jobs, but I wouldn't stay longer than a few years at most. Good profit sharing and stocks."
good,Great atmosphere and great employees.  Work was never boring and always room for improvement.  Management was very helpful and respectful to their employees.  Differ from store to store
good,After I retired in 2014  and moved to Madison Ms  in order to be closer to my wife family.I felt it to be only fair to any future employer to be 100% focussed on the job at hand and not be concentrating on yard and home maintenance.Once the domestic side of things was settled I had the urge to get back to what I enjoyed for 30 years.ie.Automobile Sales and Finance Management should the opportunity arise .Sams gave me the opportunity to get back to meeting and greeting customers for the short term
good,"working for walmart was a waste of time .They work you very hard for little pay . They the managers were very poorly trained and lacked workmen skills ,"
good,"Always busy fast paced environment makes the day go by quicker."
good,"some days were slower than others, my breaks were an hours, i advanced my multitasking skills."
good,"An average day tends to be fast paced and intense. Morning shifts keep you busy with follow up on people and taking care of customers of all types. Afternoons and evening vary from day to day, with unloading trucks and service call happening. The great thing is you end up be very good at time management and coming up with quick answers/ solutions to situations. The atmosphere of any given store depends on the current management team. They can make a stressful store and still have fun and be caring. However on the flip side a poor team can make every day difficult, long and nerve racking."
good,"excellent, nice area to work,  the most enjoyable was the free meals,"
good,"If you do your work, you'll be fine. Paid vacations and sick leave were available when I worked there. It was easy for the most part to get the benefits. 401k and decent medical insurance."
good,"I really wasn’t a big fan of working here, they really didn’t care about the employees. The managers where unprofessional and showed favoritism to certain employees."
good,"When I first started our schedules were set with 2days off in a row. Now that there is a new manager at that store no hours are safe and days off are split. I went from morning shifts to almost every other day morning to night to mid to night to morning. With lack of sleep and days off I ended up falling asleep at the wheel with my child in the vehicle with me. Tried to change my schedule to set hours so this doesn't happen again and lost hours because of it. I am the soul provider, I needed to leave in order to make sure my family is safe. Tried transferring stores and was promised set hours, upon transfer everything was screwed up and there was no knowledge of me. I am currently without a job because of their mistakes!"
good,"This company is very secure and wanted to advance me to management, but the starting wage was so low at first, it was impossible to make a living. i chose not to stay."
good,The pay is good and it’s good benefits but it’s like one big high school. It’s easy money but the manger there show a lot of favoritism. The breaks our short and if you go over your 15 they’re going to try to write you up
good,"Worked at Walmart for 16 years and saw lots of changes, some good, some bad. It was a good experience for my management skills. I would recommend the learning experience for a young person just out of school."
good,"It's a pretty slow-paced environment, for those looking for something entry level to get their feet wet in the world of employment in a retail setting, you really can't beat walmart."
good,"Wal-Mart SuperCenter was a good place to work"
good,this job was decent not to much that can be controlled by any one in the store as far a customers go but as far as fairness on a job this one at least made effort to do so
good,"My typical work day wood start out slow depending on the customer's "
good,"Big business is never great to work for. Management was terrible, coworkers were lazy. Pretty bad when an expecting mother was the hardest working employee"
good,a typical day at work is going in and down stocktaking all of the fright and put it out on the shelf. I learned leadership. Management there is working fright and mking sure we get our jobs done on time in a timely manner
good,it was always busy i learned alot of great customer service skills learned how to deal with all different kinds of problems and how to handle them the best way possible the best part was getting to know the ways of the company and how to do my job and get the hang of it.
good,"Not a horrible place to work,can be tough on scheduling and requesting time off. Sometimes problem with rude customers in which you must treat them with respect"
good,Wal-mart is a place I would recommend as short term deal. The place itself is not bad but when it comes to management it could do some improvement. My area of work is in the automotive side ringing up customers and helping them with other needs. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with my fellow associates in my area.
good,"walmart is a standard grocery store job, semi fast paced environment and need the ability to deal with all sorts of people with all different needs and emotions."
good,"We had good timed breaks. There was always a good opportunity to learn about an open position that may better fit your persona; needs or desires. The discounts for employees is the worst,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job while I was stocking shelves at Walmart, was simply the feeling of accomplishing something. Even though stocking shelves isn't the most glamorous position, I found great pride in knowing that I put in a good days work and completed the tasks I was given."
good,I was thrown into the Department Manager position without any training at all. It was okay to work there. Good discounts. The pay was not great for what we were supposed to do.
good,"I worked at the Walmart Dist.Center in Loveland and it was an ok place to work.I really do think so .If you want full time and longterm work, this will be the place for you to work at."
good,"Good place to work and high pace, that's what I like to be very busy that makes the day go by fast, to bad they don't allowed doctors note or sick days."
good,it was cool I liked the locations in salt lake city a lot more then in cedar there are just not very professional people working at the cedar city location.
good,"Very busy, consistent work. The hardest job to do it prep the chickens for the day. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with. The manager for the deli was OK."
good,"It has been some time since i have worked for Walmart, so i am not sure how much as changed. But when I was there the management was poor which seemed to roll down hill and effect everyone. Created a lot of bad vibes."
good,Unload your truck split every I'd up in to one group to be scanned in to the system so it can be loaded on the right truck .It was fast past and very challenging
good,"otima empresa, so ficou devendo na parte de oportunidades e promoções"
good,"Responsible for sorting products in backroom for overstock and binning. Setting up and stocking merchandize area. Stock products on designated shelves. Ensure aisles and areas are neat and clean and zoned before end of day. Engaging vendors, drivers and customers with a positive attitude. Greet customers and assist them when needed."
