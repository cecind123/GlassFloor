rating,review
bad,"Should step up training, and do something to assist supervisors with more time so when they read something they have time to comprehend what they are reading rather than just a cursory glance."
bad,"As a contractor thru two layers of employment agencies, this was my worst experience to date.  I worked on my own equipment, and my own server, and my own devices, and my own licenses.  I got push back when I worked extra hours.  Management started a new innovation department with no idea how to manage it.  Hopefully, this will improve.  The main issue is the company culture.  They are optimized for large scale stores, not innovation.  Responsibility and authority is given only to employees.  So, if you want a good experience there, and don't mind treating those below you like they are below you, then this is a good place."
bad,"This company is customer driven to the point where they could care less about their employees. There is high organizational turnover. Supervisors and Managers don’t care to foster positive relationships or help with employee deveolpment. HR doesn’t care to facilitate resolve regarding any issue. There’s a lot more I could say, but this review would be entirely too long. As my title indicates, work at your own risk."
bad,"I was discriminated, mistreated and neglected. It’s the worse company to work for. They diminish your hours with no prior notice. Injured my back while trying to carry a heavy machine down the stairs when the elevator was out. With no help. Asked for help once but none was provided. I  felt my back burning and my bone popped out of place. Worse company ever. Disabled for life. Thanks WS"
bad,"The company is very set in their old fashioned ways.  Working remote is not allowed, flexible work schedule is frowned upon, they still split vacation time and sick time.  Their systems are archaic and the CFO micro manages all the teams, especially merchandising.  She has been known to cancel entire assortment of merchandise after orders have been placed, forcing the teams to scramble with liability in materials and causing chaos to the factories who have already started manufacturing the goods."
bad,"I've worked in call center and remote positions before so I thought this would be a great fit for me. This company just can't deliver from customers purchases (and much of their customer base is insufferable, petulant , make litigious threats and vindictive but waiting months for items you expected in weeks is upsetting) to the so called benefits that you can't actually use. "
bad,"I'm a former employee who resigned. The initial training was laughably inadequate, and rushed. Trainers had the habit of never fully explaining concepts and directions. They constantly reminded you how little time they have to train. They're all more concerned with making sure they cover all of their curriculum as opposed to TEACHING and making sure their class understands the material. You're isolated, in a sense, because you're expected to watch numerous videos and modules, without the interaction of the trainer. If you have questions about the modules, they either don't respond to your questions, or they say things like ""we'll get to that in class""; then they never do. Their tone of voice is often short and abrupt if you ""dare"" to question them. My trainer made several mistakes, and when the class tried to correct her, she said there was too much typing going on in the chat! How absurd! "
bad,"William Sonoma is the worst work from home job ever! You got supervisors who don't answer their phone. Leave you hang with an irate customers, and they have the worst avaya program ever oh and one more thing YOU CAN'T BE SICK OR THEY'LL FIRE YOU"
bad,"This place has high turn over !"
bad,"Talk about unorganized. Incredibly annoying listening to the trainer yell at people over and over again, day after day, to ""stop typing in the chat"". Waisted more time listening to them try to round people up then we did on product knowledge. It is no wonder more then half the class was ""behind"". "
bad,I worked for WS Customer Care for 5 years and am happy to no longer be there. They do not care about their employees and create policies to sabotage them with no recourse.
bad,"All of the negative things posted about this company are unfortunately true. There is a lack of caring, understanding, and, general rudeness with every leader I have encountered. They also don't care about their customers who spend an overwhelming amount of money with them. If you need something to hold you over until you find something else this is the place."
bad,"I trained every manager that came in for peek peak season, came up with most of the strategic planning, all to be told when I apply for a management position that I didn't have a degree, however I was good enough to train the non-experience managers they hired during our peak seasons that had no experience "
bad,"Where do I start? They hire anyone for this position! The training is absolutely HORRIBLE!! They do not teach you anything and then they throw you out on the phones by yourself and you are a complete idiot because you were not trained properly! It's horrible because a customer can call about one order and speak to 10 different people and get 10 different answers from those people, that's how bad people are trained! The programs they use SUCK! They are constantly running SUPER Slow or they just glitch out all the time for no reason. It's horrible because you are trying to help the customers but you can't because the programs don't work! Then they send out a Survey to the customer and they are supposed to rate you, but most of the time you get bad ratings not because you did anything wrong, but because of an issue the Company caused and there is nothing you can do to fix the issue. Terrible job, Terrible Company! I sell all day long but I do not get any commission for any of my sales. They do if you work in the store though! Totally unfair! DO NOT WORK FOR WSI EVER!!!!!"
bad,Would not work for them if I knew then what I know now. They make you work hours that you don't even get to pick. They don't take anything into consideration. If you try to request time off good luck!
bad,"Although I enjoyed working from home,William Sonoms is the worse place to work and have no respect for employees growth with company."
bad,"Was fired after working there for 3 years because I couldn't reach their survey score requirements that were set way to high and unreachable.  The first two years you could dispute surveys that didn't belong to you, then they set their requirement to 4.60 out of 5 and you could no longer dispute them. I was suspended for 3 days and was told they will review to see if I still have my job or not. I thought surely they wouldn't fire someone with my experience.  They didn't even let me know I was terminated. I had to call on the 4th day to find out. I'm a great employee and have never been fired from a position before. The most stressful job I have ever had and all the poor reviews are true. My supervisor even quit because the company is so messed up. A lot of customers who have shopped with them for years would ask what has happened to the company.  They have items that ship from vendors that never ship, but nobody ever does anything about it and it is never resolved. They ship out returned, damaged items back out to customers.  They sale out of stock items that will never come back in stock. I could go on and on. Run Forest run!!!"
bad,When you are axed thats it they have want you to sell stuff they dont have and lie to people which is unfair they flex your schedule on now and you can accumulate attendance points which is not fair their job quality rating is not fair either
bad,"Don’t take the job.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Forget them this company is very unorganized they don't have adequate Staffing. The building isn't control temperature that do not train under pay less than the state minimum wage
bad,"If you do not meet your metrics. They will tell you are suspended, and then you will get a call from human resources saying you are terminated. Also, the feedback you get from customers is based on stars. With one being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Your goal is 4.6, If you ever  receive a 1 or 2 star as a result of a customer service being upset about something that has nothing to do with you or they didn't like the way you responded. There is no way to have the rating overturned. It goes against you anyway. It will take you 10 to 15, 5 star ratings to meet goal. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.  In order to meet goal you can never get a star rating less than 4. Do the math, it will never average out in your favor."
bad,"Unfortunately, I will not be able to write a detailed and accurate review in only 150 characters for less. So the bottom line is, management has no clue how to treat their employees."
bad,"The management is uneducated,  ignorant and racist. The mentality is racist and they do not promote people if color unless you are a booth luckier. Find somewhere else to work.  Thus place is backwoods racist and the management is arrogant and don't care if you know it. Especially the Olive Branch MS location.  It is ran by racist managers. I had to run away from this place. It really was a backwood plantation."
bad,I appreciate having the job but not enough training or help from management when needed. They don't want to take the calls from angry customers who only insist on talking to a manager. I'm not sure what's going on in the warehouse but customers are always getting the wrong or damaged item. Sometimes they get nothing at all.
bad,"The current CEO has cut so many benefits for employees no one can even count on a consistent paycheck.  It’s a pathetic place to work and from now on I will never spend another cent there  "
bad,I started working in 2014 making $12 hr. I was terminated for being 3 mins late from lunch. When I left in May 2019 I was only making $13.20 hr. Stressful job. No room for growth.
bad,Training Sucked......Couldn't learn anything because they rushed you to finish mods.  Gave me points I never earned and wouldn't remove them. Couldn't talk to anyone. Supervisor answered when she felt like it. Lie after lie. Customers were always angry. Escalation don't want to take calls and try to leave you with the angry customer so I just transfer....Everything SUCKED!!! ABOUT TO QUIT!!!!
bad,"Worst company to work for! Low pay, stressful, culture at the store is not what it used to be. Customers do not like to be pressured to buy or open a credit card."
bad,Constantly having to apologize to customers for poor shipping conditions set in place by the company customer not receiving their packages for months after they've ordered them items always going on back orders customer receiving misleading ads regarding discounts and then we would have to tell the customers that they were not eligible to receive the discount customer constantly complaining that the ads were misleading
bad,SPH sales per hour and if you can't commit to that then it's over and you have to push credit cards no matter what emails and key rewards which is not as bad!!! Employees fight over sales like it commission based stealing sales and setting others up for failure. You can't call human resources to file a complaint they claim it's confidential but trust they don't care and if sales are down and traffic is slow you will be blamed for why you didn't have a plan inset to gain business!!! Honestly the truth!
bad,"Hr sucks, favoritisms all around, drama, no type of organization, dangerous place to work wirh no type of forklift safety but your horn! Leads lazy af"
bad,"Terrible company!!!!!STAY FAR AWAY!!!!! Even with 0 experience,  you can do better than this place.  Inconsistent policies, terrible management,  HR, payroll, supervisors.  Run!!!"
bad,This company was vote the most 100 worst companies to work for but I still like working for the company.I deal with a lot of craziness I enjoy the people and came in contact with some good people .But for the company it’s self it was the worst company I ever work for in my life . They didn’t value their associate or manager.Throughout my 4 years on being with company it was craziness all the time but I work at other companies. But this company was the worst of all. They show no remorse to associate or manager which I thought wasn’t cool.
bad,Employees do not work together. Manager does not set the tone for teamwork.  Always seems to be very disorganized and getting help is a nightmare. Where I worked it took alot of energy and care. Never appreciated.
bad,"There point system and attendance policies contradict each other, With the point system saying you can x amount of points and still be in the clear of keeping your job but the attendance policies telling you your at risk if not already at the termination point."
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't value their employees then this place is for you. Worked there 5 yrs. Started @ 12 hr...left making only $13.20
bad,"The directives from the corporate office are unrealistic and come multiple times a day. “Change this, change that” before the store opens. Make 6 different food samplings. “Sell, sell, sell”, but learn on your own time because there is SO LITTLE training. Williams-Sonoma talks a good game about work-life balance, but in reality that’s only for the manager who gets to set his/her own schedule. Everyone else is hung out to dry. One night you’re working until 10pm and then you’re scheduled to be back at 7 or 8 the next morning. Other associates will take your sales, and the managers will do nothing about it because they don’t like confrontation. They are spineless and not very good leaders or managers. This company cares more about badgering customers about credit cards and emails than they do about training and taking care of their associates. They string seasonal associates along just so they have them around to work inventory in early February and then cut them loose. Williams-Sonoma is a complete farce. Target pays better than Williams-Sonoma. Most places pay better."
bad,"I worked here as a contractor for 1.5 years and I can't begin to describe how toxic it was working there. Just to name of few of the negatives: High stress, no work-life balance, no proper training, lack of direction, and poor management."
bad,"Constant complaints from customers regarding delivery.  Outdated IT systems made it worse.  Bottom line, the place was a joke.  Management was embarrassingly incompetent."
bad,"Pros"
bad,If you don’t mind your hours being cut or changed   Managers know nothing. 2 week training sucks. Customers suffer for errors that’s company fault. They mistreat over charge customers. Deliver/ resale returned items at full price. false advertise promos
bad,Nothing with this company will change until it goes out of business  believe me I was a Team Leader out there. Horrible experience with this company I recommend nobody working for this company ever
bad,"This company is a mess. The apathy here is deeply engrained, and a part of their “culture”. Even the supervisors seem resigned to the fact that, although many processes are flawed, that’s just how it’s always been done. There are no clear SOP’s, and misinformation is a regular part of your day. Important information that you need to do your job will often times be poorly or incorrectly communicated, which often times makes the job a lot more than just helping the customer. "
bad,"Poor management!! you don't get paid enough to listen to or to get treated horribly for not knowing where a customers furniture order is. Change is slow in this company, training is below standard."
bad,"Horrible, Degrading, Unethical,  -Very Successful management !  I found Management total poison and an incredibly stressfull. Negative work environment!  They tell you they’ ll train you and show you  what you. Need to no.   But In Fact They Don’t. They show you in a blur ..... you don’t even no what they did ? In the end or thyEy’ll do it for you.and make you do a lesser task."
bad,I rate william sonoma as very poor. They do not care about the well being and way of living of their enployees. You are guaranteed 40 hours and some day you only work 4 hour a day on a 10 hour shift
bad,"Typical company, in this day and age, they say they are customer driven, yet the people that work there don't feel like they are important.  Upper management and lower level are never on the same page, then complain when there is confusion.  There is minimal room for advancement, although you are told otherwise.  The standards that made this company popular when they first got started have fallen by the wayside due to their poor hiring skills and ability to execute consistently from store to store."
bad,"I worked at the call center north of Dallas for training then at home in a customer service role.  I have nothing good to say about William Sonoma.  Nothing.  The training is totally inadequate for the job you are expected to do.  The pay is a joke.  The benefits might satisfy the government's requirement but you don't want to get sick with the insurance they offer.  You can't live on the pay but really can't work another job easily because they can add hours to the start or end of your shift at the last minute.  Their attendance point system is a disaster..  if you are working from home and a storm comes through and the electricity goes out it is your fault and you get points.  I understand they are running a business but it's a two way street.  They charge $75 for a candle or $250 for a  Thanksgiving Turkey but will not pay their employees an adequate wage.  Terrible terrible company and borderline ghetto environment.  Lastly, no technical support for work at home employees."
bad,"The training was terrible. If you are hired as a ""universal"" customer service employee, you will be handling calls for 3 different departments and get paid for 1.  "
bad,Supervisors were never available to help or take escalations. Outdated system makes performing simple/basic functions absurdly difficult. 10/10 would not recommend.
bad,I am a former work from home associate. Poor training and communication from management. I had a different supervisor 4 times in 9 months. They only worried about the times you were out not how you were doing with the angry customers calling for delayed orders and lack of notification from the company. All I can say is good luck to anyone who has morals because most of the time is spent just appeasing customers by giving compensation for ongoing mishaps. I don't know how they stay in business with the poor business practices and the number of disgruntled customers and employees.
bad,I love gift wrapping picking and packing potty barns good job to work at relaxing fun good managers good team work good pay extra pay on gift wrapping
bad,Stay far away from this company.  Upper management changes have caused a constant state chaos and very high turnover rates.  So many long-term employees have left in the past month and upper management absolutely does not care.
bad,This job does not care at all about thier employees dont be fooled very stressful and supervisor wont have you back dont be fooled most ridiculous job I have been too and they cant even get customers orders together and fire their employees for thier mistakes
bad,"I've worked for this company for 4 1/2 years now and it has become increasingly worse the last 2 years. I started as an ERT associate and continue to do ERT. However, one of the perks to ERT that drew me to this position was NOT having to work phones. Strictly email response. Now, ERT is basically emails, phones, or helping whatever department needs it. They keep changing the systems. Half of this department is trained in furniture, half in OMS. The other half have it easy and don't have to do the ""hard"" emails or phone calls. The expectations are unreasonable and cannot be met by the most skilled in this department. Management is horrible. You really are just a number. They don't care about you as a person, they just want you to meet those #s or you're gone. The constant changes within the company are problematic and management doesn't care. They don't listen to you as the person doing the job and DESCRIBING the issues. The only perk to this job is working from home, and that is absolutely the ONLY thing that keeps me doing this dead end job. Oh, btw, after 4 1/2 years, I've gotten a total of 98 cents in raises. So, if it's money you're looking for, or a laid back environment, this is not the place. You need help from a supervisor, you're gonna be waiting forever."
bad,"I have to be honest - I have worked in some awful places by this place takes the cake . I have had the worst trainers ever . One of my coworkers actually called her out yesterday . We are still in the process of training . We watch videos then we are expected to do worksheets on their system and they don’t teach us. If you ask a question , they tell you to figure it out . They aren’t allowed to give you answers . They also get an attitude with you if you can’t figure something out . They are in private rooms with us while we work on certain things but they never help us out . This is for the work at home position in Las Vegas . Go find a better position . This place is horrible . They set you up to fail . They expect you to be on live calls with people when coworkers can’t figure out how to transfer customers- it’s awful. Anywhere but here. Bad trainers and mean customers . It’s just an all around negative experience ."
bad,"Horrible company! Massive amounts of micromanagement, poor training and complete professional incompetence. Not worth the effort. They will never acknowledge their poor business practices and shady dealings."
bad,"They do not train you properly. You take a ton of computer courses, the ""trainer"" gives about 2 demonstrations, then boom they put you on the phones. Once you go home you have to chat in skype instant messaging and hope that someone helps to answer your questions, while the customer is yelling at you because you have no idea of what you are doing. Even if you tell the trainers that you are not comfortable and don't know what you are doing, they say ""we believe in you, you can do it"". This job is not what I thought it would be."
bad,Managers and supervisors don't know how to help.  Won't help and they don't care about you individually.  You are a number and if your numbers aren't right you are gone.
bad,"In a typical workday, you started off by being briefed on how much money needed to be made in order to make goal.  The general manager would whisper into your earpiece on how much money we still needed to make; this occurred approximately once an hour.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of patrons that you got to meet and the stories you could exchange about cooking.  The most difficult part of the job was having a general manager who didn't trust anyone, micromanaged everyone, and thought that nobody could do anything better than she. Happy employees produce a great work environment and feel empowered; somehow, this mindset was not instilled in the general manager. Empowerment and happy employees is no longer the goal; it is all about how much money can be made and how we can beat the other stores so the general manager can reep the benefits."
bad,No real training. They don't seem to care about employees nor customers. It's basically a swim or drown type of job. Wouldn't really recommend as a long time job.
bad,"This is a very stressful environment with a very high turnover rate. Management does not care about employees and work/life balance is not a factor they consider. Also, expect to be vastly underpaid for the work you perform."
bad,Was promised 36 hours a week and never got them. was always sent home early and couldn't come in to make up the  hours i missed.meet great people just not a company for me.
bad,"I thought it would be fun to work here, but it was anything but that. With an ear-piece blabbing in your ear all day and managers screaming to sell stuff to people who don't need it, who can enjoy that?"
bad,"I had a horrible experience working here. I take pride in my appearance regradless of where I go, that’s just how I was raised.  The insecurity of some of the females that work here is very sad!!!  I was constantly mean mugged and was given stank face looks by females.  I was belittled by 2 female managers for no reason at all. They were very immature and unprofessional.  Black people need to do better. I was there to get a paycheck, not to socialize.   It felt like high school all over again. As far as the work goes ,it was pretty simple."
bad,"Old, extremely outdated database systems.  Impatient trainers, they actually yelled at people during training.  No flexibility with schedule, schedule can change without notice."
bad,"Change the computer system for the training modules.  Way too long.  Too many steps just to process a catalog order.  Desperately needs to be simplified. to be more logical and user-friendly,  "
bad,They keep changing the polices and the managers are no help at all. Too many chiefs type situation. The discount which was the best part has now been cut and only full price items are discounted not sale items.
bad,Prison canp. No advancements no respect no security. If you want a job it can be a temporary job but I would not make the mistake of thinking if staying Human Resources was horrendous
bad,"Hours are to unstable, not enough hours worked to survive. Need more stability. Managers are very rude and unconcerned with their employees. Not a team environment. Pay however was ok but some long hours during peek months."
bad,Every one at this place was snotty and very unprofessional. From the sub -par trainers to the aborhertently cold HR folks. If you can find better please do so.
bad,"•This job is simply the worst job ever,  as a temp I was treated poorly and anyone with a sense of mind who values family-oriented jobs would leave this job In a heartbeat. The leaders attitudes are poor and they explain to us that we need to make a goal at a timely manner which is stressful because there is a lot of systematical errors that contradict my purpose of driving the equipment. The schedules change every week it seems which makes planning difficult. They take better care of there equipment then there employees (especially temps). Some items I need to lift are clearly impossibily positioned on the racks and I explain to the supervisors here about all the errors I come across and they sit down drinking coffee monitoring a bunch of tasks that don't even exist. I was handed a paper to complete 20 tasks and litteraly there was only 1 that was available to complete. No one here knows or has the determination to know how there system works for there employees. I would strongly avoid going to work here unless u want to be a security guard. As an order picker it's stressful. This system that we use allows us to create/modify skus...explain to me why me as a picker needs to have that responsibility. So not am I only doing these tasks, im also in charge of inventory control, what sense does this make. Nothing gets controlled or balanced here. What's the point in handing in papers for full pallets, wrong sku's, invalid lpn's, when my leaders do absolutely nothing. I have worked at other distribution centers and I have noticed how slow and irresponsible the management team is"
bad,I was an Inventory Audit my job was to insure all items were accounted for and packaged correctly before leaving out the warehouse doors also I had to print the labels and insure the labels matched the package being sent out
bad,Williams-Sonoma does not pay enough for the amount of work which is required in an eight hour work day. Managers just sit in their office all day and create more problems than solutions. Truly a very toxic environment to work.
bad,"I was hired on as a seasonal Manager and told I would work four days on and then four off.  Quickly this became seven days a week 13 hours a day.  So they paid salary and no ot for this seasonal job.  When you break down the hourly pay its minimum wage.  If you are considering the seasonal manager's job, DON'T!  "
bad,No flexibility and supervisors don't help or answer questions. Mandatory overtime with very short notice or none at all.  I was a loyal Williams-Sonoma customer and after working in their Customer Care center I will never buy from any of their brands.
bad,It was only seasonal they use you then cut you. But keep you coming with hopes of becoming permanent.  It was ok money but it wasn’t great. It’s really hard labor.
bad,"Unorganized and unethical business practices."
bad,this place was awful 10 sales person on floor per day but one warehouse associate? what the heck> heavy stuff. store is dirty and rundown. managers and others bullied you
bad,"Management promised me 30 hours a week, then hired someone new and gave them the hours instead. I have not even worked in the last month even though I still have a job there."
bad,Customers are horrible and the rest of the staff is too. The hours suck and the pay is horrible too. Do not work here you will hate yourself. The place is cold.
bad,"Being remote and so large.  Management doesn't know what people they have in their staff.  Hard to suggest improvements to the system.  Management keeps improving non essential programs.  It takes 6 weeks to move items from 1 coast to the other.  To go from 1 state to another can take 2 weeks.  The vendors run the company, as far as time of delivery.  Lots of items get lost.  The company is more proud of the 6 million phones calls that they get instead of the lowest amount in the industry.  The saying 'work smarter not harder' doesn't apply to this operation."
bad,"Culture of finger-pointing and blaming. Sweatshop for developers and testers. Management is inept. "
bad,"WS had one asset, its employees who were sadly not treated well."
bad,"This place sucked,,, it has sorry management and the fat, chubby or rather obese HR rep is the worst I have ever encountered."
bad,The job is okay. It was a huge waste of tine since the seasonal position did not last through the season. We spent 2 weeks in training and was laid off by the 3rd week. 2 weeks before Christmas. I believe we were used for cyber Monday. Again the job was ok i just wish it lasted more than 3 weeks.
bad,Cheap labor don't be fooled!!!!! They advertise for management position but when you go in for the interview it's minimum wage and they offer seasonal because they want you to prove yourself! And probably lay you off after Christmas I can't believe they pay so little! I also went to pottery barn then realized this is owned by William Sonoma so I ran fast lol
bad,I went through the training process for this position and the supervisors were horrible and unprofessional. I ended up quitting before training ended.
bad,"do yourself a favor and apply elsewhere. This store is a mess. So stressful and unhappy, with a rude and ungrateful, high maintenance staff and management team."
bad,"trained to accommodate customers with full satisfaction"
bad,Well to be honest in my opinion I think this job sucks it was the worst job I have ever had. I would ever in my life come back to work here.
bad,Williams-Sonoma is a horrible place to work. They treat employees like slaves or as if they are in prison. The management is bossy and extremely careless.
bad,"The hours were very unpredictable. During the Christmas season you practically live in the store, however the rest of the year you can go weeks without working a shift. The manager was horrible to work with however people have told me that she is no longer with the company."
bad,i would pick order using the order picker machine and alsoi use the rf scanner with microsoft excell very heavy lifting not a well organized enviroment
bad,This place by far is the worse place I have ever worked at. There is no leadership and management staff is horrible. Forcing us to work 10h hr days while management sits down and watch us work all day was my biggest pet peeve. If you didn't work the mandatory 10 hrs then you will get reprimanded. As far as safety goes...OSHA would shut the place down. There was trash all over the place blocking entrances and exits. I've brought this up to management and they seem to not have a problem with it. And to top it all off...I've only been here for 4 weeks!!
bad,there is nothing good to say about this place.do-do on the restroom floor.just nasty.no growth.no development.no benefits.no ntn.
bad,"Williams-Sonoma,Inc. was a difficult company to work for. I did not feel as though we were trained well before they put us on the phones. I witnessed supervisors/leads belittling other associates in the company instant message system. I was hired to work from home but 24 hrs before I was supposed to start, they changed it and stated those of us hired needed to be working in the center. Customers were extremely rude and demeaning to us which made the job very unbearable."
bad,"The workload on a manager in this company is the worst I have ever experienced. The expectations are so high and the amount of hours given is so low. God forbid you should have a GM who is a little disorganized because your work life balance will be non existent. I was the Visual Manager at my store. My typical day was coming in seeing a store that was not closed properly the night before and having to push back all the tasks I had ready for my staff to do, iso that I could get the store ready for opening. While helping my crew recover the store, I had to stop about 20-25 min before opening to race through opening procedures reading emails and scanning through any recent price changes that might have occurred without warning. During the week there is a promo sheet in which you are supposed to not only change the prices on many items but also disassemble some displays to build new ones on the same payroll you would have during a normal opening. Twice sometimes three times a year you are required to repaint walls in the store with no added payroll. Here is the part about the GM being organized. The GM has to play with the regular hrs he is given to run the store to give you your floor set hrs. No extra hours are given for floor sets. Floor sets are to be done throughout maybe a week and a little before store opening and a little while the store is open so that the visual team can also help customers to save on payroll. The visual team most time includes just the Visual Manager and 2 visual team members. The visual manager is usually the opening manager when it comes to floor sets"
bad,"Learned to operated machine"
bad,"Had fun, not enough breaks for the long hours. Lay off season as soon as you get used to working there"
bad,"Like so many companies I couldn't get hired , so went in threw a temp service. They told me it would be 12 hr days. It was when ever the work was done! Which was 14 to 16 hr days. Didn't care about your life long as you did your work and dint go home. Bullied you into working and at times was threatening. Taking advantage of people lack of knowledge in the work place, Let you go, no longer need you threw an email  when you get home."
bad,"If you are an older applicant think twice about working here.  Don't know if it was the two trainers our team had but horrible training for the caliber of this company.  Several of us older workers had trouble keeping up the first few days so asked for handouts to read in evening to try and catch up.  Was totally blown off.  I caught one trainer rolling her eyes when she had to get up and help me when I had a question.  Both trainers very impatient and unprofessional.  Well, William Sonoma lost four people who ended up frustrated and quit.  Don't know if the other call centers are as bad as Las Vegas. "
bad,the hardest part of this job is there was no air . other than that it was ok.
bad,basically all the staff an management are stubborn. Needs a lot of improvement everywhere. No job security because other staff members try to terminate you for doing a better job than them. Also in house agency Randstad need improvement especially the senior account manager.
bad,Phone agent no support for you from anyone in the company unless you happen to make friends with some who been there longer and will help  management and leads don’t want to help make you be the bad guy and most of the time you are just telling your customer no can’t do that and getting yelled at for up old ong very old outdated policy that are not what you expect from Williams Sonoma  you also take all for all there brands
bad,"Rushed, too short of training. Impossible to get an answer to a question, no support once on the floor, management tries not to take transfer calls for customers requesting to speak to management. Every call was customer had spoke to 3/4 other reps and didn't get problem solved. This company does not care about its employees and even worse its customers. There is not customer service provided because the company makes it impossible for you to do it. Horrible, horrible, horrible place to work. I quit!"
bad,"Poor training, fixed hours, inconsistent hours, they make you work 2 hours before or 2 hours after schedule and they don’t tell you it changes it daily, insensitive to my personal situation, hr is not so nice either"
bad,"Managers are incredibly rude, lazy and racist. "
bad,"The best thing I ever did in my life is leave this place. When you’re hired, management and HR (They’re HeRe for you! When in all reality, they’re not.) make it seem like a glorious place to work for, and we should feel blessed we work for them. "
bad,"Best thing about WS is the discount, and that’s not even consistent  The company is going under so the lowest on the totem pole are the ones suffering for it. I started out making 5 cents less than someone that had been there 7 years. Raises are far and few in between. The people there are either old timers hoping it’ll pick up again or new people who haven’t figured it out yet. But like me they leave when they figure it out. I went through 6 managers in my short time there cause corporate is so hard on them. If your sales aren’t what they want you get chastised  then humiliated when they hang your weekly sales up for everyone to see after they highlight them.  The managers talk down to you which is funny because there’s nothing difficult about the job they just thought we were all morons."
bad,Worked here for 5 years and was terminated for an infraction that they said I did and refused to let me dispute. The training they give you has nothing to do with what it is really like. They do not care about their employees they only care about call volume and you are accountable for how your customer's react to your service. Worst company I had ever worked for. if you request a day off 90% of the time it is denied and they will not work with you at all managers are terrible they will ignore you and blow you off more often then not there a few managers that are good but very few.
bad,"Training was too quick for what all you need to learn , leads dont help unless they like you , there  point  system is so messed up you get point for being sick going to funerals, if you ask question it like they never answer you and tell you monthly review where you mess up but do NOT help with training or extra training (throw to wolves) and you customer ratings ..... That a whole book of messed up .... i would NOT recommend this company to my worst enemy let a lone my friends >>>  JOKE OF A COMPANY!!!!!!"
bad,Don’t drink the koolaid. This is such a  misogynistic company. Men have a lot more freeway when it comes to being able to express themselves than women do. They operate in a manipulative manner and will do whatever it takes to get their desired outcome.
bad,"On your own, supervisors don’t take escalated calls, they make you handle it even after customer requests to speak to management. They rarely answer your questions or concerns when on a call. Callafter call after call, very stressful. They micromanage big time!"
bad,"clock in, go to selling floor and sell, required to meet their goals, also credit cards, and  email captures. learning is on your own, workplace culture competitive, hardest part of the job was keeping your attitude up. most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow coworkers."
bad,"It was seasonal work so CSR's weren't regarded as valuable enough to offer anything but small discounts.However, I was never spoken to by a superior with disregard. Some customers were harshly frantic but that's expected with last minute shopping. Working from home was great. I already had a good computer and internet speed so I only had to add a second telephone line. I rated Management one-star because I was never assigned a team or manager. Overall, I think it would have been a very different experience if I'd been working as a full-time permanent employee. The training was very good and paid. The company had a great origin story."
bad,"I started as a at home Sales associate for Holiday help. You do a 2 week training which isn't terrible. Management does like to talk down to you as if you are a child, that was rough. Once out of training we were thrown into a ""chat room"" with other employees, while taking calls. You were on your own if you needed guidance. The supervisor you have is never available to talk with you or help.  Once on our own we realized we were not trained in the proper software and we were not sales but customer service. Like I said earlier, We were not trained in CS. The customers will call you every curse word you can think of because they spent 100.00 on a stocking with was screwed up. You can't blame them but at the same time its heartbreaking. Williams Sonoma is a joke. I wouldn't work there even if they paid me 80.00 a hour."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work before it came a buddy buddy system with the management team. They would fire people just to hire their buddies. Employees treated bad by new management. They are all about pointing fingers to blame someone else, then writing that person up, when that person was not at fault. You also don't know your work schedule. From day to day. Suppose to work 8 hours, but that hardly ever happens. They come around at time to go home and tell you that you have to work over, and if you dont, they would give you points even though you worked your normal 8 hours. So many points, then your fired."
bad,"When you need help with something you are told to ask your supervisor.... then they tell you its not something they can help with. You get paid vacation days but you cannot use them. When you put in for time off you get ""denied company need"". In other words your personal life does not matter only the company. The turn over rate at this company is obscene!"
bad,"1. Training was horrible. I would ask a question and would get no response from the trainers. When they put us on calls and when I had Tech issues, I informed the trainers and they proceeded to tell me, ""continue to take calls"""
bad,"It’s a company where they put people over you that’s scared to show you how to do anything because they know how cut throat it is with that company. The company don’t care about how cold or hot it is if you’re not on the correct shift. If you leave out on a stretcher guess what, you still get a pointed. They don’t give you above and beyond even if you’ve earned it so that’s a joke. You won’t get noticed no matter how hard you work. To be noticed you’ll have to kiss a lot of a**."
bad,"IT is worst offender. Senior management leads by fear. If you're apart of the ""click"" then things appear easier/better. If not, then do not expect any support or anyone in leadership having your back. Certainly don't expect any growth potential."
bad,"Its hot. The workers are rude. The managers are unprofessional. When I started my work schedule was from 5pm to 5am for three days on, two days off. Within A WEEK the schedule went from 1 mandatory day to 7 days mandatory. That's a mandatory 84 hours a week. Needless to say people were coming into work zombified, and half way able to do their jobs which gave Williams-Sonoma the greenlight to fire a lot of people. They also fired people for calling into work although requiring their workers to work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. I survive off of the good graces of coffee alone. The company only provides a few fans, and half the time you'd have to get there extremely early to snag one, or be prepared to fight someone for it. People are passing out every few days in there. You also hear a lot of gossip and dirty talk around the warehouse, even by the leads. MOSTLY by the leads. There is no sitting. The floors are concrete, so be prepared for all of the issues that come along with joint shock."
bad,"They had rushed training and put us on the phone after 3 weeks. The schedules they had for the workers made you work 3 to 4 hours before you receive your first break. They will pay you for your tech time and the will pay for medical leave. They have 40% discounts and items that are not on Sale. William Sonoma is not truthful to the customer in informing them that an item was not available. Not only that but some items that the customers ordered arrived to them damaged. Agents were subjected to the customer's abuse because of this. If I were the customer, I would feel the same way too. Supervisors didn't want to take over the calls and it got worse once they started using chat because then, they can just disconnect while you're talking to them. You are pretty much out there on your own. It can really do something to your emotional state. It's like they set up to fail."
bad,"Still currently employed here . I have over 15 years of experience in customer service and management . I've been with WS since August 2019, training was terrible I pretty much taught myself . We started off with 80 trainees and by the end of two weeks there were 24 including myself. "
bad,I quit after 2 weeks Training was a joke they kept saying hurry with your modules then you get pulled for a class and the trainner says your behind. Of course you kept pulling me for class. Don't give in stay away
bad,"Reason for my Resignation"
bad,"I was excited to work for the company when I received an email that I was being moved forward in the interview process. The interview went well and all! The issue came during the training for the position. The class environment consisted of 65-67 participants to 1 trainer who wasn't a through trainer at all. The training consisted of ""book work"" and no hands on. Worst training ever."
bad,Not enough pay not enough employees to get job done on a daily base no set time as to when you will give off work that day sometimes would be send home no work
bad,"This was absolutely the worst career experience of my life.  They turn through employees with not thought of retention and growth.  I worked for a bully in inventory management who had no idea what she was doing and was constantly making mistakes.  Her solution?  Bully me into correcting her errors and move on.  The culture was horrible too:  no on says good morning, grumpy faces and misery.  "
bad,"Only work here, if you cannot find another job.  The pay is too low for the work you have to do.  No help at all and my supervisor sucks.  They did a mandatory work day on Holidays Mondays, but did not send me the information, until I was off on my schedule shift, so I did not get the memo, and was dock 3 points for it.  If you get so many points your fired.  The supervisors never gets on the phone, or call the customer's back, and the team line is so rude. They will go back and forth with you about how you helped the customer, while the customer is still on hold.  "
bad,I mean it’s a call center work from home job I get it! But man this place has no structure at all! I was in training and by the 4th day they expected me to have all these mods done and there’s just no way you can retain all that information!! And then the trainers don’t want to help you and it really annoyed me off how they ignore you when you have a question. I say don’t bother it’s a waste of time!!!
bad,Petty immature country folks who arent used to anything and the moral is terrible! Not to mention the warehouse is hot af!!! Low pay long hours and the attendance policy is worst than slavery
bad,Williams Sonoma has no loyalty to workers who have worked a lot of years with them. New hires get all the hours while people who have been there get their hours cut down to 8hrs a week!!!   Management sucks at least the store i was at. Never enough time to get shipment done when they want it. Unrealistic time management and tasks wanted by General Manager. Worst GM i have ever worked for!! Do not work here! Very stressful!!!
bad,They let me go because my father was dying. They assured me that I would be fine caring for my father. Then when I did they let me go. And refuse to approve my unemployment. They are horrible inhumane people and they care nothing for their employees.
bad,Unrealistic goals. Management doesn’t respect subordinates. Discounts aren’t worth it. Often times better promotions for customers. Moody and unprofessional manager.
bad,W.S won't allow you to use any of your accrued time off.  They always deny you based on business needs. You get points of you take time off and its not vacay.
bad,"Poor management, no opportunity for advancement, poor morale.  Your customers reviews will determine if you keep your job.  Very low morale. Stay far, far, away from this place!!!"
bad,"West elm is a very competitive work place, and for what you are required to do on a day to day basis, the pay is no where near worth it. Scheduling also is an issue because management never listens. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"
bad,The company cheats you out of money and doesn't pay what they should. Pay is drastically under what is needed to sustain any lifestyle wether you have children or not.
bad,my manager never hear a word a said but use my idea's as her own. If you go to HR for help you are looked at as a problem. Keep to yourself. to stay happy
bad,"I worked at the williams sonoma in lancaster, pa. My experience working there was terrible. I barely had any hours, Couldnt get a decent schedule, the drama was out of control. Associates were doing the assistant managers jobs because 2 of the assistant managers didnt do anything except sit in the office. They were also rude to customers. My general manager was great! It was just the assistants. It is a very stressful place to work, especially when you work with people who do not work or enforce the rules. Or when the assistant manager leaves the store to go get herself some pretzels and a soda which took a half hour (already took her lunch break). Left me in the store myself with 12 customers which i was trying to help them all."
bad,This was the worse job I have ever worked at. There was no help in training and we were sent home and thrown i the phones after 4 days of computer training. Customers were complaining and yelling at us for not having training. I am very disappointed with this company.
bad,its extremely wild. shipping and delivery has the most issues in any given day. all day you  take callers from housewives and Single dads asking to help them shop and if anything goes wrong they then have someone to blame. retail is the same everywhere
bad,"Never have I worked for a more unprofessional Management team than the Washington Square store in Tigard, OR. MODs continually berated associates in front of customers. Questions were met with irritation and instead of using the question as a teachable moment they would push you aside and take over. "
bad,"Lack of coverage in a high theft store. Very poor training system in place. Lack of guidance from upper management. The employees only worked there for a discount, so we unmotivated to perform general tasks. Store manager rarely present."
bad,"IT department has a very high turn over."
bad,"typical days are slow"
bad,Williams-Sonoma doesn't have many job advancements. There is no accountibility or incentive to work hard. The raises are not based on performance but on popularity. They lost many good employees due to poor management.
bad,"Training is a month long, They don't teach you anything in that course except how to use the system. The trainer is very sarcastic and rude. The customers that call are rude and always upset about little things. I was a work from home agent and could never get in touch with management or a lead when I needed one for help. The pay is great for a Work from home agent, but you put up with a lot of Stuff so it is deserved. No insurance."
bad,If you like to take complaints then by all means work at Williams-Sonoma.  You will work from home and take very few orders but lots and lots of complaints.  The management is very hard to reach if you have a problem and I found simply calling another work at home agent the best solution for any problem.  Asking for days off is like requesting a pot of gold be delivered to your door.  It was a very bad experience and I am glad I do not work for them anymore.  Their computer is also antiquated and hard to work.
bad,Keeping all sewers busy with very little to give them. Work is slow. How to deal with poor management. No team work. Love my Co-workers. Very stressful. Too much drama. Love what I do.  I came from very high end furniture and struggle daily with the quality. Worst quality in a piece of furniture that I have ever experienced.
bad,Too heavy work and micro-management with very little resources. Store management finds themselves working in more a key holder or lead cashier role due lack of resources.
bad,Horrible moral. TERRIBLE management. I missed 4 days while in the hospital and got fired for it
bad,did not learn much as it was a temporary job during Christmas time
bad,If you're not a buyer or on the store side in corporate IT your treated like dirt.
bad,"I have been a retail manager for years and had only worked for Canadian companies until I joined WS and had the worst experience of my life. My first experience was at the conference in Arizona and I left there feeling like I had joined some crazy cult. The employees at my store were for the most part horrible people who believed they were of the same economic status of the customers, where my opinion is that it doesn't matter what kind of retail environment you work in you are still just a retail employee. They reminded me of the two women in Pretty woman who ended up getting schooled by Julia Roberts. The company likes to say that they have a people first culture which is a total lie. Staff members had won prizes for corporate contests and yet had not received them six months later. Work life balance is terrible and my DM had no clue what she was doing. My training was about 4 days of being a greeter at a store and getting a bunch of information crammed in my head and then told....go, cut staff hours but still make these ludicrous budgets. also if you don't work in the States don't expect to make any sense of the visual set up packages or actually get any of your benefits.Enjoy conference calls?, well you had better because you will be on them for hours every day. Hands down the worst experience of my life."
bad,"learned alot about mgmnt skills n shipping n receiving.coworkers ,some were enjoyable to wrk with n helpful."
bad,"The place has change, management is a joke doesn’t care about the employees . Quantity over quality if you want to have no life this is the place for you"
bad,"Was not supported with many ethic violations in the company."
bad,"Doesn't pay enough for all the info and systems you have to know.  Supervisor does not have your back on the misinformation that pops up on your calls or emails.  Your evaluation is based on customer reviews, but most of the issues are not with the CSA.  It was ridiculous after all the training they end up firing almost all they hire."
bad,"Over 60% attrition rating, and they act proud of it. "
bad,The job is easy but the management's lack of skills and personality make it hard. The new managers coming in are kids straight out of college with no experience on how to manage a department or people. The HR manager is a joke.
bad,"It’s been five weeks since I left west elm, Oak brook store. I was there two weeks and the manager still hadn’t set up the computerised time card log in for me and now I have Not been paid for the time she didn’t manually enter. Horrible!!!"
bad,"Training class is a waste of time. My trainer was good but she wasn't in her position long before she found another job. She told me inaccurate information and i was later coached on it. Break times are extremely short. When trying to transfer a customer to the escalation line, you could be on hold waiting for up to an hour, which then kills your hold time and your employee id is flagged. If you are just looking to make extra money, then apply but it is definitely seasonal for a reason. After working for this company and how they can never seem to find customer's orders or cancel them, ill never buy anything from them again!!!!"
bad,"The culture was very much like a clique and if you weren't in then life in the office was made difficult. Certain people could make their own schedules, but the rest of the department had to adhere to a 9:00 - 5:00 schedule."
bad,They work you to death one week then send you home early every day the next.  Very high turn over.  They expect you to be at their beck and call.  None of the managers know what is going on or how to do it and the big bosses all just sit in the office and bark orders out.  System is old and outdated.  Other than the benefits there is not much good that can be said.
bad,The training did not prepare you for everything the job asked you to do on every call. They were making you learn things they didn't tell you had anything to do with your job.
bad,I was a temporary worker. It wasn't fulfilling working the position that I had. The temp company that I worked with was unprofessional. I recommend applying directly with the company.
bad,"No understanding. If it snowed and you couldn't get to work, they gave you a point. If you were sick, the first day you got a point. If you were even 1 minute late, you got a point. If you thought it was going to be treacherous weather, you better take the day off for that day. If it didn't get bad, you couldn't  go in and work.  I was passed over jobs I was qualified for to people who were the ""pets"""
bad,"Unpredictable schedules, changes not communicated and priorities inconsistent mark the Williams Sonoma experience. The company does not provide the materials and technology required to even train new people, order systems are archaic i.e. ""DOS screens"" and ""F-keys"" and training facilities are not equipped with enough working computers to accommodate headcount in training classes.  "
bad,"I think WSI could be a great company to work for if they hired more qualified and conscience people for upper management, respected their employees more and identified and exercised their values in giving."
bad,"great co workers,"
bad,Work at the Williams Sonoma Call Center in Las Vegas (Primarily dealt with the Pottery Barn Side) ... The company as a whole is like any other retail only care about the bottom line making $$$$!
bad,I've been out of work over a week because HR couldn't fix my login information. They never followed up with me due to my points when my son was in the hospital.
bad,"They had in so many different departments. It was extremely stressful and then they complained that my metrics weren't good enough. I  tried to use one of my days off. I put in for it 6 months ahead of time, it was still denied!! So why did they give them if you cant use them? Ill let you  figure that out."
bad,Work life balance leans heavy toward work.  They have absolutely no regard for their employees.  All that matters is the all might dollar.  Let me make it clear.  This is the furniture mfg plant.  Can't speak on any other branch.  They promise the world but deliver little.  You have to work other shifts besides your own. Mandatory
bad,WSI was a great company to work for when chuck williams was a live. Now everything is about saving money for investors. They forgot about employees. They have cut the benefits and they are trying to run the company with part time schedules but as a full time. No one makes a living at 28-32 hours every week. Trying to push a month work in a few weeks. Advancement within the company only if you are related to a manager or white .
bad,worse place ever to work they don’t care about you or your welfare very deceitful very big liars and abuse in workplace where as they totally brush it under the Rug #karma
bad,"FRUSTRATED CURRENT EMPLOYEE."
bad,Training was fun in the beginning until I realized that they didn’t want us to learn but to memorize to pass the Modules with 100. There’s like 87 mods you have to complete in a week. I was late finishing so I didn’t get much actually training done but the next week I started and my supervisor was unavailable. Any questions I had on how to assist my customer went ignored. The customers deserve better than half trained csa. I was very optimistic about this job but now I regret wasting my time. I’m very disappointed with the training and management. Their system is extremely hard to navigate and requires proper training!
bad,"Super low pay, no career advancement and inconsistent scheduling. There are too many stores and the budget isn't big enough for how many part time people they employ."
bad,"horrible place to work. poor management .  unorganized, & unsafe.  pay does not match the workload. not for any skilled worker, may be fine for children fresh out of high school"
bad,Managers are rude and disrespectful to their employees. There is no room for advancements. They have in house bidding for jobs and when you apply they may or may not even give you an interview.
bad,Managers put themselves before the employees who actually does the work and the customer who pays good money for the product.
bad,Management did not know how to maintain quality employees. They used their positions only to bark orders not to get positive feedback from the employees.
bad,Went through an agency they made me wait  4 hours in the cafeteria before I started  I complained about it  2hrs later was told go also witnessed an accident about to happen on my way out very unprofessional
bad,"Like most retail places, it is not pleasant to work when numbers are down. Unreasonable amount of deadlines and project goals. Lacks support from management."
bad,"If you live at work and complet your shift every day, youll walk out with about 400 a week. They expect long days and hard work but only pay 12 an hour."
bad,"There's a couple of things that I've had an issue with William Sonoma. I was working for William Sonoma in December of 2018, and I was told that my drug test was lost in transit and I had to go back and take another test. The problem that I have is when I took another drug test I was no longer needed to work at home for William Sonoma. Ever since then I have applied for the work at home and have not been rehired ever since. Could someone please explain this to me."
bad,"this job is, by far the worst job i ever had in my life.  they are not open to new ideas. they are not family oriented. the hours and pay combination is not good at all, due to your work load. Very unorganized. they treat temps like they dont even work there. night shift management are all against each other."
bad,"No support from management at all. It felt as though we were given a binder and slapped on the butt to get to work. Told how to handle situations differently all the time, never consistent, never received any praise on a job well done. Customers request were hardly ever met. We were given only so many resources and when a customer absolute wanted to speak to a supervisor we were frowned upon if we actually sought out leadership help. Quality department seemed to only rate your bad calls. Felt like management was wanting you to fail as the end of the season approached. Worst part of the job, constantly having to apologize for not meeting expectations, for delayed products,  cheap products,  broken products, pushed back arrival dates, poor customer experiences. I hated working here, absolutely hated it, and stressed out every time I logged in. At the end of the day, I felt like I was physically thrown around and mentally demeaned.  I would never work there again.  I'm surprised if this company lasts another year."
bad,I worked here for 3 months and the worst part of the job is dealing with irrational customers. Even when you try to offer appeasements they want more or they find some way to make the phone call longer than it has to be. There is no micro management going on here so you are free to make lot’s of mistakes and be prepared to do that because you will not be trained properly. Training is 3 weeks with modules  with about 50 to 60 employees trying to learn and ask questions at the same time but don’t worry if you have any they won’t get answered and you will be constantly warmed that you are behind and if you are not caught up they will let you go for not passing training. They work with 2 out of date systems that is very ridiculous and the trainers agree. If you ask your supervisor anything regarding a call they will direct you to a chat system where you have to type everything out. So don’t think when a customer is upset and they need to speak with  a supervisor that you can transfer. You will have to chat with a lead and the lead can refuse to get on the phone even if the customer is irate. So you are forced to provide bad customer service. The plus is a lot of overtime I was doing about 60 hours a week. The downside is no communication or at all from supervisor. I literally forgot i had a direct supervisor because we didn’t chat or talk for 2 months straight. I realized she was not a resource at all. Nobody is trained and they are constantly losing people or people is constantly getting fired so they are constantly hiring. I had so many calls where no notes were left and the customer
bad,"The culture within their supply chain group is one of fear and intimidation. Constant backstabbing, toxic politics, inappropriate comments, clueless and ill informed restructuring are all standard operating procedure. Good luck getting long term goals and direction from your superiors. They have the strategic and visionary mindset of a wet Williams-Sonoma branded kitchen towel . Their idea of strategy is to throw as many bodies as they can towards a problem and keep yelling at them until the problem is swept under the rug. To make matters worse, you are working towards an ever shifting target. The level of politics was like something out of a House of Cards season, except this is not national politics, this is a medium sized, niche retailer destined for obsolescence. You would be wise to stay away from this place."
bad,"Despised the job, not because of the people but upper management. If you had an emergency you got points and it never mattered what the problem was...out of your control or not. Out of control, poor management, HR was never there for you. Adults working in a Kindergarten rule environment. Have not worked there for sometime now and understand that nothing has changed."
bad,"I literally lasted only 6 months in this position because the store in Philadelphia is so poorly managed. You have to make unattainable goals on your shift or the company with start cutting your hours down to nothing. They barely have anyone working on any given day, so you have to do everything that normally requires a larger staff. The pay salary is ridiculous. I've been in retail for many years and have a lot of solid experience, yet Williams-Sonoma is not willing to pay for seasoned employees. They would rather hire college students who will work for peanuts. My biggest complaint about this company is that they simply don't care about anything but themselves. "
bad,"When first contacted about the position I was very excited and wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself but the company promised training that was never offered. My supervisor wasn't trained either so the both of us were in a situation that wasn't fair to either of us fortunately for her, she had prior experience in her position. My position was new to me so I didn't have any information to lean on and it was quite difficult!"
bad,"I would say that working from home is great. You don;t get to pick your hours, You work 40 hours so it is a real job. You don't get much time to do anything just because you work from home. I did enjoy it."
bad,Full time employees schedules could be reduced to as low as 30 hours without notice. Co-workers & leads are pretty great. They don't pay enough for anyone really to live. Low paying Customers are the craziest.
bad,"If you are ok with taking over 100 back to back call per day from snobby "" I deserve the world' types of people than this is for you. Worst job I have ever had. No time to take a breath after a call due to 'productivity' 8 hours felt like a 23 hour shift. I guess if you have thick skin and dont mind sitting on your butt for 8 hours straight getting ordered by someone over the phone than this might be for you. The pros is that due to a high turnover rate there is room for advancement. They also gave me the option to work from home which was great, Dont expect the company to give you much, you supply your own computer, landline and might need to beg for a headset."
bad,Dealing with multiple customer sales issues. Management was very lackadaisical. Good for p/t work.
bad,"I am flabbergasted at how poor the management was.  Everybody passes the buck and nobody actually wants to help you help the customers.  The complaints I've heard from some of the customers are beyond horrible, and if you think getting a supervisor involved is going to help in some way, think again.  They are more interested in figuring out how they can get out of taking responsibility, and then blaming you for not using your ""resources"" to solve the problems."
bad,At Williams Sonoma I was one of the packagers who printed out a cover for the furniture and after they were sprayed off I pushed them into a line so they could go through a machine and another process.
bad,Just horrble working with people there. Assistant manager would always take advantage. Main manager was fine but the we he does not help his assistants manage well was terrible.
bad,There`s nice people there they also have nice leaders in I worked there for a while in the benefits is great. sometimes its hot but its all worth it at the end of the year when u get those big bonus.
bad,"Working for William Sonoma made me feel like I was working in a sweat shop, very bad management, lack of equipment for employees to use, over staffed, and little work"
bad,"Need better training tools, training needs to be broken down into smaller groups so that everyone can be trained on the same level, I believe their 3 week training is set for failure to continue looking for people thatknows how to deal with the rich. I enjoyed the opportunity but hated how they operated as as an well known company."
bad,"The store manager called me to make an appointment for an interview at the Monterey, CA store and she didn't show up. The workers there were all stressed out and in disarray. What a waste of time, and very disappointing. I wanted to apply for seasonal work."
bad,"They rush you through training & then expect you to know it all when training is done. Trainers get irritated when you ask for help and make it known on camera by heavy sighing. Seems like all they care about is your ratings from customers. You’ll get calls for EVERYTHING & you have to sit there for 8 hours a day listening to customers complain about things that are clearly warehouse & delivery problems. Barely ever got sales calls, all the calls I got was complaints, damaged items, etc. NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"This job is fairly easy and laid back however, it can be very stressful due to the supervisors not helping out and getting on your case about stupid things. Your stats can go down based on customer reviews, even when it has nothing to do with you as the representative but with the company. If you need help after training, forget about getting any. Supervisors leave you on your own and dont respond or let you know about company updates. Then they ask ""why didn't you ask for help?"" Even though you email, skype message, and call them they get upset at you and state you never did.They harrass you about your number of calls because their faulty 1980s system doesnt keep track of them, and accuse you of not actually working and time fraud even when you have reviews from customers which is proof that you work. Overall its cool if you need money but I wouldn't plan to work there forever. Prepare to get screamed at by customers everyday for Williams Sonoma's shady company policies that rip the customers off :)"
bad,"Not a place you would want to work. Point system that is only used arbitrarily to remove certain employees, if you are a good worker you will end up carrying the load for others who are only there to socialize and play on their cellphones"
bad,"I was offered a position to work from home ,completed all paperwork never heard back from them .Tried to email them no answer unable to call very unprofessional ."
bad,"•They only pay $12hr"
bad,I like William Sonoma very laid back it could be a lil better with the heat but I will go back and work there very great experience yes I would recommended anyone to work there good environment yes I liked it
bad,They require you to deceive your customers and has a system set up to terminate its employees for matters out of their control. The training and pay is below industry standards.
bad,"This is a job if you need one. You do get to work from home. They have what they call flex schedule which will require you to automatically work 10 plus hours a day. You will get one short day per week, not your choice which. The training is poor. They basically give you an online book to read each day for two weeks. On the third week boom you will take back to back calls everyday. They claim you will have chat for assistance, but you will not. Those are mostly new people that have no more knowledge than you. Supervisors will not take escalation calls. Must be self sufficient and be able to work with little to no assistance. High turnover.Extremely high call volume."
bad,I wouldn't recommended this job for any females. The guys up there think they can just touch you whenever and wherever they want to. Some managers was okay and some of them where just butt holes.
bad,"William Sonoma was the worst company I ever worked for, I just worked there because I was working from home. I was always getting no supervisors. I was always lost never had anyone to speak to when I had problems. Always got cussed out by customers because William Sonoma took their money and never made the delivery date on time. Worked that for    years only got a 0.70 cent raise.So only making 12.75 a hour which really sucked at the time, That's the reason why I quit and you can only get 10 point for the whole years and they only roll off with in the next year.Thats job really sucks and can pay the workers for much more."
bad,"Job listing is misleading.  Prior to receiving an official offer letter, I was told Work from home positions are limited and filled on a first come first service basis.  However, the job listing DID NOT state first come first service.  The title of the job listing is Customer Service Associate-WORK FROM HOME.  That is very bad representation and misleading.  I was disappointed."
bad,"I worked there back in October of this year and never got paid.  Additionally, no one from Human Resources will return my call.  Go elsewhere for employment."
bad,"WORST COMPANY EVER! seasonal position sucks, the leadership team is super rude the company thinks angry customers are a joke. they talk down to everyone"
bad,Hated working for this company. They move u around too much within departments. Prep tables are first come first serve basis. Have to find supplies every morning. Constant schedule changes. Upper management and Leads don't want to help you or listen if you have problems with orders. Leads holler thru the warehouse like there children in the building. They need to re staff there management team. Warehouse is dirty most of the time. There are no pros to this job i do not plan on ever going back to this job!!!!!
bad,"Very good relationship with management, always uplifting, always positive in overwhelming days. Co-workers are a good team of people to work with. The hardest part of the job is last minute schedule changes(less than 24hr notice), no time with family, very unorganized,and no advancement in career. The good part is working with co-workers and management. I learned that team work is strongly needed in everyday life and should be appreciated."
bad,This store is not a good place to work. They have like 5 managers and 3 part-time sales associates. I was lied to by the store manager who told me that I had to work as a stock boy as well. I didn't sign up for that. Management is cliquey and shady. It's a nice store though and a couple of the managers are cool but not the top guy. Avoid at all costs.
bad,I achieved a lot of analytical and leadership experience here. Great company.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone! You get nasty rude customers calling in all day long, upset about mistakes they have made or upset because they order can’t be cancelled. Then when things don’t go they way they demand a supervisor! You have to go through a chat system to get to a supervisor and most of the time a supervisor don’t even get on the phone and the supervisors be having an attitude also! They expect you to give 5 star customer service to customers that call in yelling at you. "
bad,24 hrs operation and 7 days a week.Tight guidelines during holidays and mandatory overtime.Very strict attendance policy with few or in between room for time off.Communication with management is very lacking.
bad,Good general manager she understand us but I got hourly she said she paid the same to designer not higher but I heared she got the same pisition as me and paied her more than me she told me lie and the other thing mist of the time they told us to clean the store wich is so annoying and I hired as designer.
bad,"Over worked and underpaid. People are just so rude and when you don’t know an answer to something and reach out to your supervisor, they don’t respond. When I had a family emergency and reached out to my supervisor, he didn’t respond."
bad,Management was not good at all. Atmosphere was hot the company did not provide enough fans for the employees. This company was very rude to the employees
bad,"Seasonal workers are thrown into the fire without proper training. Management expects you to know everything when all the bases have not yet been covered. Management gets angry when you make mistakes but you're only trained for about 3 hours. The most ridiculous and busy place."
bad,"i'll start by saying I was seasonal employment, you dont get proper training they blame you for not being properly trained your tossed into the warzone, apparently i didn't realize you could type more . . I saw these reviews before I jumped into this company myself but I thought I'm good with computers I've went to school for this how hard could it be? I questioned why all these people were so hurt and drained and why they sounded like this job stole their soul . . I remember them tossing me into a group of 100+ users with 3 trainers we had to all introduce ourselves to each other either on webcam/mic they then thursted us into these test 82 test more or less and you really have to get these done within 3-4 days because on the 4th day you will be taking calls . .you won't be prepared the customers will treat you like bad the supervisors will bad on you, also you won't have access to all the proper tools so be prepared to get talked to rudely for them not preparing you . .oh also you won't be able to do this job and another one they'll tell you they'll work with you but will give you a time you requested to not have . .they'll force overtime on you take away your off days . .you'll go to sleep thinking you had to be in at 930 only to see at some point over the night you got changed to 730 and you'll get a point for that . .you'll pray that they fire you themselves to end the torture . you'll give them all your time or you won't be there at all . .sure it's at home but enjoy being in home that whole day because by the time you get off its time to take a bath/shower eat a snack"
bad,A typical day at William Sonoma Is a minimum of 10 calls from a customer inquiring about a online item & It's where about.  can say I learned and gained patience you must have patience when assisting a customer
bad,"Never received sufficient hours for the entire store to operate properly.  Notorious with use of on-calls and shift cancellations just to make payroll hours.  A veteran associate would be schedule 3 hours per week for many weeks and then all of a sudden be asked to work 30 hours in one week, because of preparations for a corporate visit and all were to pretend everything was just superb.  This happened in all locations and at least once every quarter."
bad,"Large turn over in Management. Employees value to the company is based on statistics not performance or customer feedback, even if positive customer ratings are received. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
bad,"The call center is fine other employees are good. My issues are with management,  they set unrealistic expectations of it's employees. They pay is horrible for getting yelled at all day. New employees get paid more then employees who have been here for years."
bad,"Busy, fast paced call center environment. "
bad,"I wouldn't make this a career but a great second job... This job caters to production and if you don't make production, you will be soon looking for another job.."
bad,"This place has so many ""policies and procedures"" it'll drive you mad. Lack of communication is prevalent and your supervisor/leadership can't be trusted to LEAD. They will completely disregard your request for assistance with a disgruntled customer either because they don't know how to resolve it or they don't WANT to help you. They will advise you inappropriately or won't assist at all and you're left to ""figure it out"".   "
bad,"When new managers came in they didn’t know exactly how things were running, no one was on the same page. A lot of favoritism in the company, false accusations"
bad,"In my personal opinion, during training, it was fun and exciting to learn about the different brands and products. But after training, you’re basically thrown into the phones, you have a lot of questions and when seeking answers from your supervisor or team lead, it takes hours to get a response and by then you’ve been called every name on the book by the customer over the phone (who by the way are the worse I’ve ever dealt with because most of them think they’re entitled to free stuff when it doesn’t apply to them). We had other “resources” to look for answers, but many times, these wouldn’t provide any help either. "
bad,I would never work for Williams Sonoma again. Hours were limited to four hour shifts and training- learn yourself. I really dont want to go any further into talking about a company that I wasnt happy with. Its uncomfortable.
bad,"You won't be promoted from within, nor will your sales numbers or loyalty be rewarded.  They should build up the talent they already have, and not be looking outside before promoting the sales people they already have."
bad,"Worked there as a forklift operator, got laid off my 11 day, without even gettn a chance to drive a forklift, had me doing maintenance instead.  Called me b4 my shift started an laid me off!"
bad,"The one positive about working for Williams Sonoma was flexibility. The pay was very minimal, and the expectation was to work long hours and holidays / weekends."
bad,"I start my day off normally in the morning. We learn how to sandblast and monogram different items. The management is ok there. I do feel they treat temporary people a little different, because they do not expect you to stay. I'm an artsy person, designing is one of favorite things to do."
bad,"Very unorganized job, paychecks never added up correctly, and supervisors were not very helpful when I was there."
bad,a typical day at work is not what it's cracked up to be. The other co-workers there really dont help as much as they should. There was omly one other lady that would come help me and thats the one that trained me . The only way I really made my day go by was to listen to my phone while Im there. The best part of the day was when it was time to clock out. Sad to say but its true.
bad,This job requires you to lie to the customers about there order. This company only wants money and does not care about the customer nor the employee's. All customers are lied to when it comes to delivery dates and what is in stock. This company does not want you to be honest with thee customer if something is in stock or not. It is also terrible about shipping food to customers. They get it later than the day is is to be delivered.There were a lot of customers that ordered turkey's for Thanksgiving and did not get till after the holiday and the same for Christmas.  They are quick to hire and even quicker to fire.
bad,"It is like they do not want you to succeed. They give you a point for every little things and once you reach a certain amount then you get fired. Now I just received a half of a point for clocking in 5 min late; which it was not my fault. the system wouldn't log me in. When you call the center to report your problem they do not answer and the you get a point even still. "
bad,"The most mismanaged environment I’ve ever worked in. Laziness is rewarded with bonuses and promotions. If you’re an honest hard worker who completes your work in a timely fashion, you’re passed over by others who don’t. Only “work horses” are held accountable, no one else is. Policy is mandated by managements opinion or “love” (or lack thereof) of you. If you’re a man, definitely the place for you."
bad,Supervisors act superior. There’s not enough supervisors. Supervisors never do callbacks to customers that are upset. New system constantly crashes. Can’t put customers on hold- get written up. Call transfer into queue is call avoidance. Arguing with customer can be cause for termination. Hanging up on customer is automatic termination. Customers are rude and argumentative since they always get either what they want or comps.
bad,"if they treated there employees the same way they treated the customers , and they don't hold the same responsibilities between the shifts so while one shift is a cake walk the other is constantly picking up the slack for the other. They also don't reward hard work; Or give out raises unless your on the right shift . They also do complimentary/ appreciation meals for one shift more than the other. Pretty much if you get on 1st shift it's a cake walk any other shifts is batting clean up. While 1st has a multitude of workers the other shifts are short handed and they aren't looking to fix the problem but don't shoot the messenger."
bad,It was a job. Nothing really beneficial. It was part-time so didn't get anything out of. I paid more for gas than make in an hour. I left because no advancement
bad,"The training is absolutely terrible, they throw so much information at you in such little time that you can't remember it all and when you get on the phone most of the info is irrelevant. During training they have you do worksheets but they never tell you if you did it right or not. One of the softwares used for this job is so old that you have to use ""codes"" to enter info. The supervisors flip flop a lot when it comes to policy's, one will tell you to do something and another will tell you not to. Then you get in trouble for not being able to help a customer even though you asked several supervisors for help and none assisted. If you can take customer's cursing at you call after call then you would do fine. The only good thing about the job was that I was able to work in my PJ's and the benefits were good. I tried taking days off so I could go to the doctor and my requests were always denied due to company needs, I even missed my parent's anniversary dinner because I couldn't get the time off. If you don't have a life outside of work this job would work for you. After working in customer service for over 15 years this was by far the worst job I've ever had. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"Typical day at work meant praying that when you try to log into Citrix , that it would actually load and not take you 10, 20, or 30 minutes to get in and that you wouldn't have to call support for the 18th time. If you are able to log into Citrix, you have to make sure you  aren't late punching in because if you are, you will get a half point and good luck getting any of your points removed for technical issues because your supervisor will more than likely ignore your plea to get any points removed so you end up racking up several points which, once you reach the 11th point, you are terminated....So once you punch in, you have to try opening Avaya and praying that another employee isn't logged in using your extension (which would require another call to support)..So once you are logged into Avaya and ready to take calls, if its during peak season, strap in because the calls will be coming in back to back. The type of calls you get are mainly from women who have orders to place, or have problems with their orders, or who are trying to get a discount on their order, or who have problems with the website."
bad,"I worked at this company for 5 years. Within the first month and a half of working there I moved to a specialty team. I absolutely loved it, my supervisor was awesome, my coworkers were awesome; I was happy to show up every day. Once 3 key leaders left and the call center Director was replaced everything went downhill. "
bad,"Working for this company is definitely a place I would not come back to. It is very unprofessional and there is no growth in this career field. The management team is very rude and disrespectful, and is all for themselves!"
bad,"Profitability and shareholders are, of course, the #1 priority.  There is little regard or support for the logistics/transportation teams, customer care and quality of products offered. If the company valued lower end employees and truly put 'PEOPLE FIRST', the effort would benefit overall profitability and customer satisfaction in the long run. "
bad,A typical day would be to come in clean the floors throw away the trash then after that we would run the pieces to the door for delivery the next day and then we would off load roughly 4 trucks a day with at least 200 pieces of furniture.
bad,"First day we (associates) came into an empty warehouse and were given Tee shirts to ""open"" the store. Mind you this is after 3 interviews and them saying they were looking for ""top notch"" associates. Putting on the suits is not necessary this is a very casual company and very diluted with it's creativity and room for growth. "
bad,Great place to learn Customer Service. Very fast paced work environment.Learning AS400 system takes patience. Technology needs to be upgraded
bad,"It's a job. I'm looking for something better that will fulfill my skill set, makes me look forward to coming to work."
bad,"A typical day at work included lack of direction with an extremely heavy workload. The unspoken rule was that you could not leave unless all the work was done, no matter how long it took...hence no union was allowed on the property. No paid holidays, mandatory overtime and very poor employee morale. Calling out sick resulted in points and once you reached a certain number of points, you were terminated no matter what the sickness/issue. No room for advancement unless you were a management favorite (rather than being based on hard work) and you could count the minorities in the building on one hand. Only pro was that you were forced to learn to work quickly, accurately and how to deal with extreme pressure because if not, you risked losing your job. "
bad,"Managment was rude and very unfriendly, Customers were very friendly, Learned Nothing,Dealing with the staff,Going home."
bad,"Advancement opportunity was not equal or logical. Individuals with poor performance, communication skills and operational understanding are promoted and very few good employees were compensated, recognized or promoted. The time off and the benefits were really great- compensating for the very strict attendance policy and lack of flexibility in schedules."
bad,"Management is pleasant and at times helpful. Each department worked  from sales/service, furniture customer service and support rushed the training process. Length of training needs improvement. Seasonal process needs tweaking as far as communication. Looking to work in diverse departments in a short period of time. Good place. Although you maybe asked if you’re interested in a permanent position. As well as completing steps for permanent position. Keep looking for a job once hired. Seasonal is seasonal here few make it through if any."
bad,This job is stable but you are drained you have to lie constantly to customers.. Customers are always upset and often mislead about when they are expecting there items.. Items delayed for over 6 months..
bad,"With me had just given birth and not wanting to return back into the real world , I told myself i wanted to work from home and still be able to raise my two kids. Now that I work for William Sonoma I see why a lot of people complain about them . My training class started out with almost 80 people (virtually training class) when we ended , we ended with close to 30. The trainers are horrible at their job. The trainer I had teach my class wants s always rude and had an attitude. Luckily there was one of the coaches who was willing to help anyone through anything and I appreciated her. They tell you to search anything the the knowledge center when that thing doesn’t have all the answers , I literally had to basically teach myself all what I’m doing now which sucks . When people decide to work from home they expect some type of balance but with WS they make you choose between spending time with your family or having to work the scheduled times you have because not only do they flex schedule your hours which means at any given time you can either be on the phones from 2 hours before your shift or stay on longer 2 hours after or have the choice of picking one of your days off to work 🙄🤷🏽‍♀️ Just don’t understand that one but like I said it’s foehilnmr it lasts"
bad,"Ok so here it goes started as a seasonal then got hired full time awesome. Then after that it was crazy I have had 7 supervisors since Nov lol  The CPH,Stella score, etc is ridiculous. The PTO is ridiculous I have put in numerous times and have gotten business need constantly BUT they tell you to use VTO so they won’t have to pay you then you have this point system 12 and your out I have moved to different departments and have had to deal with all the brands William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, PBTeen, PBKids,West Elm,  and Registry for (PBK PB WS WE) Retail line I think I have worked my schedule time so far 13 times since being hired because I work 10hr days  We CSR get so much crazy answers from everyone in the higher ups rules change from person to person then when things go wrong it’s your fault period  So Stressful on all levels so just some info for you. There is more but my fingers hurt lol. Just keeping it real."
bad,Poor management with lack of clarity to move business forward. Created a toxic work environment that push competitive nature and over-stresses work force.
bad,"This seasonal position trained you online, then set you free with hardly any guidance. Our manager for the online training portion was really great, but then wasn't available much once we started taking calls. The training system is just highly flawed."
bad,"I was hired to be a temporary Work from home Customer Service Representative with ""potential"" for permanent employment after January 2019. Let me just say that the hiring process is clearly a joke aswell as the training.... There are only 10 days of training and I spent 5 of those days sitting around my house listening to the trainer and coaches help people, who obviously have very little technical skills, log into different systems. Outside of cutting on a computer, getting on the internet, and maybe checking Facebook those people did not know what they were doing even with the most basic instructions, so because of the large group of technically-challenged individuals in my class, I was forced to do no real learning of the job I was hired to do. "
bad,"A management shake-up shortly after I was hired threw the store into chaos, so I did not see it at its best.  The position that I was hired for never really materialized, as the manager who set it up was one of the people to be let go, and training was cursory, at best.  No training regimen seemed to exist.  For instance, it was over two week before I was register trained.  Every time I brought it up, I was told, ""Oh, we'll try to do that today.""  Finally, another employee took it on herself to teach me to ring.  Register procedures are very complicated with Williams-Sonoma, balancing the store with their on-line presence.  The store struggled through the holidays with an on-line reservation program that no one seemed prepared for.  The register system does allow access to on-line orders for the purposes of returns or exchanges, so a lot of responsibility is placed on the sales people to manage these situations.  More experienced staff was very generous with their help and their time, but I do not feel that I ever truly ""learned"" the system.  I was not terribly disappointed when my seasonal-hire status was invoked, although I would have appreciated a sit-down with the manager to discuss what was happening."
bad,"Beware..."
bad,"Hate I wasted 4 years working for this company. A bunch of wolves in sheep's clothing. Say one thing and do another. Their one and only concern is making the ""company"" rich and do not care at all for those who make it happen."
bad,"Job was extremely stressful, constantly yelled at by callers and no help in work chat for anything. Training did NOT train you on the important things for the job and the trainers only talked to you a few times during training since the training classes were over sized and they had so few trainers. They change your schedule without notice and expect you to take call after call with no time in between to reset."
bad,This place is unprofessional in how they train at home workers. The system is ancient. You will wait on a paycheck forever. Hours disappear from your check when you have worked those hours. All I can do is (smh)!!
bad,"Worked through a temp agency and it was not good at all, worked 12 hours a day made pretty good money but they wanted to much from there employees. No paid break or lunch, and if a person was not working in the front of the building no hot food. None of the managers would listen to an employee when needed something to complete a job duty."
bad,The hours of 7:30pm - 6am just wasn't healthy for me. I couldn't keep a steady life/work balance with this schedule. I tried for a few months but decided to chase down another path.
bad,"New store, lots of activities and people. I developed the tabletop room and made it very successful. There was no opportunity for salary increases or benefits or growth. I did well, was very reliable and attended any trainings, etc. I was appalled at the lack of care for the merchandise and the stock room and the terrible attitude of some of the managers."
bad,go in clock in find your work area and start working. the lead would move you if the work was more in another area. you would follow the work until you got done
bad,Would not recommend - at least on the supply chain LOB. No leadership and management.
bad,SET UP SHIFT ACCORDING TO WORK LOAD/PEOPLE ETC. manage work flow and system to accomplish company goals. take care of conveyor lines to keep work flow moving.
bad,Not a very professional company Im looking for new employment due to this.
bad,"this used to be a great company to work for but they seem to have lost sight of one important factor, employee moral and having a life outside of the job."
bad,Normal call center environment. Good disount and benefits.
bad,"This store sold a lot of different products, from machinery to food to aprons to cookware, and each had its own story. The problem was there were too many employees and not enough information to tell the new people. "
bad,"WS call center is a terrible place to work. They put you through two weeks of training, but don't cover everything you need to know. Supervisors and managers were the worst part of working there because they want nothing to do with the employees. If you have a question or an angry customer DEMANDING to speak with a supervisor or manager they are no where to be found. If you do find them they talk to you as if you're an idiot even if you have a reasonable question and they will REFUSE to talk to the customer. Supervisors and managers at the call center think that they are above you and that regardless of what the customer wants, it's your problem and not theirs. If not for the attitude I received from supervisors and managers I probably would've rated this job a 3/5 because it wasn't bad except for that MAJOR issue. Supervisors and managers are meant to boost morale, not treat their employees like trash."
bad,"The pro is you're able to work from, which means you're in a comfortable working environment and you don't have to worry about commute. The Cons is the system shuts down a lot. Communication between supervisor and employee is not the best. Also, the communication between departments is horrible."
bad,"First of all, you will be working 10 hours a day. They have something called “flex schedule”, so be prepared for different shifts. "
bad,They wont tell you that you don't get paid for each piece if you deliver to a store that is opening for the first time but their activity base pay is by miles stops and peices which is their pay scale for a delivery driver.
bad,"Great products/brands, interesting challenges/learning opportunities, enjoyed working with some amazing colleagues.  Lack of leadership involvement/support."
bad,Work from home was great. Training was quick an not organized. Bad management . Hours are great meet your needs. Seasonal position they will just drop u without warning.
bad,"Worked here with a contract company WS treats temps in a unbalanced manner. Be advised if you need to work 8 hrs a day this is not the place if you are a temp company employees stay temps will be dismissed for the day. The manager at william sonoma targets temps. The permanent employees will secretly blame temps for their mistakes, leads and managers gladly target and fire the temps to protect themselves from getting fired. Met ''nice'' co workers. I would change management and the company from being selfish give temps hrs and opinions without being targeted. I was fired for someone from WS mistake there was no way winning with the young greedy adolf hitler manager. Management reflects on employees."
bad,Loved the call center but clients were rude . I didn't like the fact that itsaid full time seasonal but it was only 6 weeks and 3 weeks were training.
bad,"Disorganized and out of touch management.  "
bad,"I enjoyed working for this company, but the pay was not great for the amount of work they wanted you to put out. They also almost never promote from within. It becomes discouraging when you cannot promote and do not want to stay on the phone forever"
bad,"I would like to work for a company in where i can advance and grow with. My skills and knowledge of warehouses will be greatly be appreciated, and helpful."
bad,"For a temp. job, it was acceptable. The people I worked with were mostly polite and professional.  It was almost always busy, but also almost never stressful."
bad,They're very unprofessional. they offer Direct deposit but check never gets deposit to your account. they barely train you and expect you to know everything once you get on the phones. the customers are rude and it takes forever to get in touch with a supervisor.
bad,Would be a great place to work if it was better trainers that knows what going on. And manager and Lead on 2nd shift need training and needs work on their attitudes.
bad,"More emphasis is put on the employees getting ws credit cards than customer care.  "
bad,"I have been working for Williams Sonoma for 5 years and overall I do enjoy the culinary part of the job.  However, that is where it stops.  The company has lost touch with both its clients and its store teams.  We spend way to much time on how we could have treated the customer differently, than treating them the way we should.  Day to day, Williams Sonoma still knocks it out of the park when it comes to all things culinary.  Where the company fails is furniture sales and dealing with customer issues around those furniture sales.  We have also gotten very sku heavy at the store level and spend way to much time attempting to figure out weather or not we may or may not have a particular item.  Finally, there is a severe disconnect at the corporate level, for example, announcing classes to the public, before  the stores know that they are being scheduled.  If I could just go there and cook, and teach people how to do that better, it would be a great place to work."
bad,Very poor culture for the good employees who had to work twice as hard to cover for the ones that did not do anything nor management making them do anything. I don't like workplace politics so I don't get involved with them. That also means I was treated unfairly sometimes and the structure was and atmosphere was toxic at times.
bad,"Many changes in the managerial profile of the  company, not all good, could probably work out in the end but right now the roads are really bumpy. A typical day would be preparing my team for the nights activities knowing I'm short 3 to 5 associates short and still getting the job done. The hardest part of the job is coming in each day knowing you have to over perform to get the bare minimum done for the next shift to get started. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
bad,"unorganized, no stability, too many managers buddy with workers (buddy system) never know how many hrs your going to work. they do not recognize you as a person when you do good."
bad,"Worked as sales associate. Learned some good things about retail and how a cash register works. Developed decent skills in communicating and serving customers. Management was ok, no one was payed very well. It was a mall job, not much more to say than that."
bad,Need better management and organization they close down to much lack of work and people have to use they personal time just to make a check that's not fair to employees
bad,Overall negative environment. No room for advancement and had no positive communication with any level of the company. If you had an opinion you were considered a potential problem. .
bad,"Always was a low paying chaotic place to work. People who you worked with were friendly and helpful. This all changed the beginning of this year, after instituting new quality tool and imposing draconian requirements on call center associates. The company met it's quality goal, but at the expense of the associates. Call efficiency went up, so they cut our hours and started writing people up for the most minor of things, sadly for some of us leading to dismissal. This is a company in a cut and slash period on it's call centers. They are moving everybody to work from home, which is good, but it is a sign of putting your employee last. This is pretty sad since they haven't valued their employees all that highly anyway. Steer clear, better places to work"
bad,"Some are nice a lot just there to have a secure income basis. After a month training at the center, I work from home, it was convenient but after a month you will feel how the stress and pressure gets in to your own home, absolutely on your own, no help from they're so called help line, if you can't make calls Call in is they're motto. I am somewhat thankful and regretting. 2.5 stars I would review. The 40% off employee discount is not completely accomplished due to before taxes plus item ineligibility, not all items. No insurance coverage and 401k if you are not knowledgeable Charles Schwab including their Williams-Sonoma stock will take your paycheck. Rate of $11 an hour isn't worth for a lot of responsibility, you work for Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. Majority of calls are Complaints, Return, Replacements, Refunds most from Pottery Barn. Their attendance system is a mess and injustice. Games are for kids not for adults. Giveaways are from old stocks of the company. Coffee is the only free at their EDR. Anxiety and Stress is what you will get later on."
bad,"I had no supervisor lead to work with on my shift, and I had only 3 days of training. The other people working on 2nd shift had only 2 weeks of employment"
bad,"Constant turnover in management, unrealistic job exceptions that fluctuate on a daily basis, constant fluctuating schedules within the workweek even day,  a week or less notice for the following week, and poor pay."
bad,It is an okay place to work and as with most jobs there are ups and downs and you have to roll with it. The director of the facility is great and I just wish that his energy was spread throughout the facility.
bad,"It was a work place that kept me busy. I loved taking to different people on the phone, helping pick furniture out for their homes. nice work environment. "
bad,The typical day at William-sonoma was trying to gift-wrap 40 gifts or more per night. My job position taught me how to properly wrap gifts and how to read read orders.
bad,"Got new management, they were very judgmental, and unprofessional. We worked the worst hours up to 75 to 80 a week. The store had multiple   floods and made management clean it up with mold in the location, made us sick multiple times"
bad,"I was here for about 3 years. Most of what I learned was from my own experience & fellow co-workers. "
bad,A typical day was long and overbearing. I did not really learn much working there. The workplace tried to establish workplace culture but the employees did not by into it well.
bad,"I briefly worked here as a work from home agent  . I made it through training (3 weeks) but quit a week or 2 after being in production. The training I feel like was rushed. I didn’t feel as though we got all the materials and knowledge needed to be successful on calls. The helpers after training didn’t really answer questions instead you are directed to read such and such article. That’s fine In all but sometimes you need more hands on help I.E a explanation as to why you are doing  x,y,z. There was like 50 people in my training class and only 4 people answering questions.  Questions are being over looked because it’s so many questions without enough coverage. I felt as though it should’ve been maybe 12 people to each helper. I would sit on a call 30 mins + waiting for help. You work independently be prepared to sit and wait for help while you are on a call. Nobody really fully explain things , you just gotta try and figure it out. Good luck !"
bad,If they could make up their minds on what they want to do! The call center can't figure out where they want to go and do! Forget on having help because the only thing they want you to do is schedule!! Forget it  if you're getting cussed out!
bad,"They make it all cute, but it’s not a good company. The managers are babysitters, the district and executive managers are not present, the drama never ends."
bad,Changes needed with leadership and management to help improve culture for the sake of retention. Groupthink culture among leadership with heavy bullying undertone.
bad,"Way to few hours, uppermanagement wants more production with less hours.  Scheduling was iffy at best.  Store was having sales problems..............."
bad,"Was a friendly place to work"
bad,Some workers are been discriminated against on the regular basis. Unequal opportunity and unequal pay. Lack of hours. You only work 30-40 hours a week. No overtime until peak season.
bad,"ok temporary place to work, there is no reward for a job well done, no incentives at all for anything, management is ok, there is a very high turn over rate, not a place to work if you are looking for a stable long term place, they cut hours ALL the time 10 hours 1 week 25 the next and will send you home if it's not busy, lack of respect for employees time"
bad,"Too many kids working there not taking job serious the training was not very good to prepare you on the floor. "
bad,"No real solid selection of people upon hiring... if you live and breath you got the job.  "
bad,Good company to grow with but lack the leadership to obtain its maximum potential. Company continues to by-pass practical logistical procedures to only resolve certain functions.
bad,"face paced fun, friendly customer oriented well based company in the heart of my community. Provided excellent customer service and conveyed empathy when needed"
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is coming in and finding out that today is going to be a full eight hour shift! the work aries from week to week at W&S
bad,"do this, we will do that next week but does not get done. too many temporary employees that only care about wasting time to get a pay check instead of doing the job correctly. if everyone was direct hire with experience WSI would be an excellent place to work."
bad,high turn-over which leads to poor planning and execution.  Long hours.  For the right person this job could be a good fit.  Parking is not the best.  Commuting takes for ever
bad,All about business needs. You have associates dedicated to helping customers but with lack of knowledge and tools from management down hiss is the only way they are going
bad,"While working for Williams Sonoma, you can rest assured that you will encounter receiving late paychecks, lack of communication, and lack of dependability."
bad,"I was happy working there for the most part. However, the hardest part of the job was working extended hours and not have any vacation days and it was very hard to get a day off."
bad,"I applied for an online CSR position. I went through all the training and had less than a week left to finish. Prior to being hired, I had let the hiring manager know that I needed 1 specific day off during training as she had asked me if I had any prior engagements. When the time came and after jumping through many hoops to get the day off, I came back to work after the weekend and was put on suspension. Suspension in their world means terminated. Very unfair and completely misleading company."
bad,Everyone thinks they're boss and the manager never comes to you himself he sends other people to relay messages. You're better off staying to yourself and just focusing on you.
bad,"Management level and up could use a makeover. There is a tendency to belittle and micromanage employees. "
bad,A typical work day was going in and standing in a long line and waiting to be assigned to a seat. The hardest part was going. I enjoyed doing my job I just did not like the poor management of the company.
bad,"Very high-stress job.  Emails come in non-stop - expect 200+ emails per day.  Very poor processes from top to bottom. Employees are not empowered at all - approvals are needed for nearly everything and if you don't have the proper approvals the process stops - even if it is an emergency.  Co-workers are great but executives either have no idea of how bad things are or don't care. Terrible corporate culture that produces high anxiety, resulting in very high turnover. The best part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,"Company call center for customers that have problems with"
bad,The company as a whole cared about customers but when it came to employees we were not taken care of. We were cut hours as from week to week I was knocked down to as little as 4 hours. The benefits alone did not compensate for work life. The hardest part of the job was wondering if I would be able to work the following week or be looked after by the company even though I am giving them 110% effort on my part.
bad,"A typical day at work is to clock in and process any unfinished items/boxes that hasn't been stocked on the shelves.  Then the UPS guy comes and unloads the shipment for the day.  We have to scan in every box that came in and put the the items on the shelves of the stockroom (which is usually 40 or more boxes per day).  There is either one or two stockers."
bad,"While Williams-Sonoma is a large corporation, they need more attention on retaining good employees and hiring the best possible talent.  Staff turnover is more than rampant."
bad,"They cut hours severely. Only full time employees are the managers. Everyone else gets anything from 0-15 hours. Only employees who get the most hours, do not need the job or have a second, while the others are left twisting. Management is just worried about you clocking out on time so payroll is not wasted, otherwise they are not there to groom you for any sort of advancement."
bad,"No growth opportunities and nasty culture. Don’t work there!!!!!The management doesn’t care about the employees. They don’t consider the work life of an individual. They also don’t recognize days off. Poor benefits. I learnt that if you want to  grow, don’t be stuck in one company especially if there are no growth opportunities."
bad,"If you want a seasonal job for a good discount, this could work. If you want a job you'll keep, find other work. Management is poor, departments shuffle constantly, pay is not competitive either."
bad,Don’t work for this company unless you positively have to. Customers are rude and always get their way. Can never reach a Supervisor. Supervisors never call customer back.
bad,Great discount but the hours are crazy. Never allow time off especially if advised in advanced they say it's ok but change it after hired. Overall good job for people who need to work from home.
bad,Most incoming calls were complaints. People screaming in your ear. Management did not have your back except in the most extreme cases. The company is giving away the house trying to maintain it's customers.
bad,"Work from home training was poor. Expected to learn a command-line interface in a matter of two weeks and to complete training modules sooner than told, or else be removed. Calls were non-stop, but you still learn very little. Management didn't have much of a presence.There was an overall lack of integrity there. Seems like customers could be happier if workers were knowledgeable and honest. That could be resolved with proper training. Work from home has it's benefits, but I'm happier driving everyday to a job an hour away where people actually respect me. They didn't even notice I was gone till a month later."
bad,"Not my best Retail experience, but not the worst. Fellow employees were great, if not a bit catty (older women with eight hour/week jobs can get like that). Manager was less than impressive, training was nil, the expectations for the position do not align with the pay nor the ability to rise within the company. Managers, Store Managers, and district managers appear to have disconnect, no clear cut vision for the company. Could be better, but again, not the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"Get everything in writing. "
bad,"I never have been so excited for a job to be let down so bad.  The modules are out dated, so many steps to get to an order to help a customer and don't have trouble with your internet, you will be taking VTO.  The WFH training was suppose to be at your own pace but don't believe it.  You have to have so many done and ready to go on the phone in 5 days.  "
bad,"I was a work at home employee & it was a terrible experience. The job was very boring & it was really hard to get an answer to a question in the chat room when there was a customer on your line. Training wasn’t very helpful because a lot of ppl aren’t comfortable with the systems at the end. Maybe it’s different in the actual call center. It was a relaxed, slow paced environment. There were times when the calls were busy but not often. That’s the only thing I liked about it."
bad,"Williams and Sonoma could be a great company to work for if they were consistent with their policy, and if they paid their employees better wages. Nice work from home position."
bad,"it could be a better place to work if we had mangagement that actually knew there job, and if everyone was prone to advancement. Compensation is fair other than very small raises we receive once a year."
bad,At first it was ok. But then my hours started getting changed. Employees where being punished for others mistakes. Not fun at all. And i worked 3rd shift.
bad,"The company was average. With their reputation, you would think they would have more up to date computer system. They were using a DOS program that was used back in the 80s and 90s. Customers couldn't understand that updates had to go through a batch and couldn't always be seen until the next day."
bad,"this job is very easy and you get paid every week as long as you stay to your self and do you job everything should be just fine"
bad,"The training portion on this job was adequate at best.  The job itself is pretty easy, until it is not.  Meaning, as long as the customers questions are something  you know.... things are good.  However, the minute you need any assistance from a team lead, supervisor, etc...  things go downhill pretty quickly.  As you can imagine, when working at home, when you do need assistance it is pretty important.  I would be very hesitant in recommending any of my friends to apply for a job with Williams-Sonoma.  The employees, including team leads and supervisors, are all very nice.  There's just a lack of support when it is truly needed."
bad,"packing and material handling jobs are easy. As far as a typical day at work goes, its nice and fast paced. Once you get the hang of your duties, its not hard at all."
bad,This job shows favor to certain people. Did not have a great experience. Would only recommend this job to someone that is just looking for a part time.
bad,"Due to a massive profit loss as of 2011, Pottery Barn, Williams-Sonoma Inc, etc have cut a load of jobs. More than 60% profit loss doesn't mean you should treat your employees like dirt."
bad,"I feel like seasonal employees are mislead to believe they will be hired after peak season is over.  We were told multiple times that there is a great chance of permanent hire at the end of the season.   Then you end up scheduled for a ""meeting"" and without notice your employment has ended and told to clock out after meeting is over.  I understand the need for additional employees to help out during high volume time periods, but to be mislead in to thinking you will have a position at the end is just wrong.  Also, when you need help from a lead there is often not one available.  When you are lucky enough to be able to type in a chat environment about your issue, they will more often than not just end the chat with no guidance at all which results in you taking the hit with a bad rating.  The training is very reading intensive.  About 60 modules to complete that includes most of your 8 hour day reading material online.  When you experience tech problems, which are always an issue, you fall behind and are made to feel like it is your fault."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend the one in Colorado Springs. They have a thief problem, overly competitive, cut throat, back stabbing, During the holidays they hire a bunch of holiday workers. The GM is very faithful to her ""girls"", and if you're the new guy. Good luck. Surprisingly with the older crew there is just a lot of drama and judgement. The GM is nice, but has very high expectations of management."
bad,"The job was ok, but management wasn’t all that great. More training needs to be done before just throwing people on the phones. There were a lot of customer complaints about the company."
bad,"It's ok, don't expect to stay for a long period of time. Work gets very slow and coworkers  will not help you. Will not share good information with you either."
bad,People in charge have bad and lazy attitudes and it translates down to the perpetuation of this attitude throughout the employee culture. Business benefits and perks have dropped off sharply as well as positive culture and involvement in the community. It has definitely gone downhill.
bad,"Little to no standard training for all associates especially managers. "
bad,"Store competition became very unfriendly. Managers were not in sync, bad overall experience. You can advance if you're willing to follow the cutthroat culture created my area management."
bad,Job is too easy and too redundant  because of just placing orders and calls not really lasting that long. Difficult part of the job is using the antiquated system that they have.
bad,"Huge contractor force that is used to keep financials attractive.   IT projects are frustrating as there is a freeze during ""peak"" retail period of mid Oct- mid Feb.  Managers are over-whelmed and do not use project managers appropriately."
bad,"Williams Sonoma in Memphis/Olive Branch is a very difficult company to work for.  They are in the middle of changing upper management and the new regime is very young and inexperienced.  They are leading by threats and intimidation and always seeking to blame someone lower on any issues.  The moral is very low.  Williams Sonoma volume is 20% - 30% down in 2016, which will likely create more negativity in the coming year."
bad,"When you work at Williams-Sonoma, your typical work day includes answering phones during a certain time period and tracking orders."
bad,The work load is variable and can go up an down weekly.  Holidays are not guaranteed time off.  It can be a place where advancement is based on politics and not always on what you know.  It is a place where you can find some great people to work with.
bad,This is a seasonal job and hard for advancement. The job is very easy but it requires you to work 12 hour shifts and 7 days a week. The pay is decent but the job does not provide security or stability. It is hard to get hired in.
bad,"The worst job I have ever had.  This company does not care about  their employees.  They make it harder and harder.  Very stressful because the company does not know what they are doing.  Lots of mistakes made other departments, not to mention over priced product with lots of flaws.  Under paid and overworked!!"
bad,"I really liked working at Williams Sonoma, but there was a big downside to it. You don't get paid commission on the products you sell. There were not enough hours going around, the pay was minimum wage but not worth it for the amount of work you have to do. The staff is friendly and always willing to help out. I learned a lot of things like the different products and how they worked. We would usually just float around asking customers if they needed any help. The hardest part of the job would have to be standing the whole entire time. What I did enjoy was everyone got along perfectly if you had a problem or needed help someone was always there to the rescue."
bad,"I was a seasonal hire and I was horribly disappointed. Employees are not cared about, the manager is far from approachable, and it is a fend-for-yourself environment. Because of the need for full-time workers to meet sales for ""benefits,"" employees will often ""steal"" sales or use part time workers to meet their sales goals. I feel very uncomfortable reaching out to my manager and it greatly bothers me. Hopefully Williams Sonoma will take action to ensure that not just the customers are taken care of, but employees as well."
bad,I really don't recommend here we'll at least the UPS department it just sucks management and leads are so rude they can careless about you and the pay is horrible to what they expect from you I don't recommend UPS
bad,"The best and only good thing about this job was being able to work from home. Management within the International "
bad,"Direction comes from multiple places and they don't complement each other.  One has you going in one direction while another goes opposite.  Communication is poor and errors are made often."
bad,"management is very poor. they care a lot about race. if you're hispanic they will get rid of you fast. nothing good from this job, too much drama not enough hours."
bad,"When people have been at the company for 10-20 years, change is slow to happen. The slowness to change pulsates through all branches of the organization and it's tough for promotion or movement. It's a great place for job security - but the push for any growth could not be found at WSI."
bad,William-Sonoma is a good startup company for anyone to start that really wants to learn the warehouse business all in all it pays weekly and has room for advancement some of the managers there are wonderful to work for.
bad,They want you to work like you're getting paid production instead of hourly. The people are very stuck up and will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat.
bad,"This is a typical call center. Ok for the time being but not something you want to make a life out of. During training, the room was freezing cold, thee information provided was ""ok"" and covered the basics of what you needed to know. Once you were on the floor - it was never like what the trainers explained it would be. The shifts started at 6 am and customers would call in cussing and screaming as soon as you answered the call. Again - this job is ok to have when you are in a pinch but not something you want to make a career out of. The only good thing is they did not expect you to stay past the end of you shift. Once it was time to go home - you could leave."
bad,"The job is easy with very light work mostly. But this is not a job you want if you're looking for something long-term. Before they hire you, they'll promise you 40 hours a week plus overtime; however, for the first mouth I was there we would only work 5-7 hours a day, 4 days a week."
bad,I stopped working there because it was also to far out and my ride had broke down so I had to call in and tell them after months of being there that I wasn't able to continue with the job due to no transportation
bad,I didn't enjoy this job but it was a job. They don't pay well. Management changes things too often. If you have problems with pay or anything personal it take them to long to fix it.
bad,The customer are extremely trying. High call volume and not time to complete the call notes.  Management is lacking at times.  Not enough money to make the job worth all the stress.
bad,"fast paced, steady, hardest part was unloading, most enjoyable was being able to wear what i wanted,management was pretty chill, typical day was 6-5 unloading and wrapping pallets"
bad,Management isn't compassionate enough to the employees and they are always changing dress codes and rules and letting people go over somethings after they have worked for them for 10 plus years
bad,"We are hired to work remotely in Customer Service. As a Lead, we handle escalated calls when an associate is asked to speak with a Supervisor. Our biggest complaints are things that can be changed but the company seems to rather lose money by issuing credits rather than implementing the necessary changes. These changes are what any other company is able to do so it's frustrating when you want to assist the customers but are limited because WSI can't seem to get with the times."
bad,If you are a full time employee you will never work the hours you are designated. Mandatory overtime is almost a constant so be prepared to work from 4 or 5 in the morning until 5 to 6 at night. If you work night shift be prepared to work close to 77 hours a week.
bad,William sonoma taught me to be a great truck loader. And learned how to use a Electric Pallet Jack.
bad,"There is no point in trying to gain experience or working in this environment unless you plan to expand and grow with the company. You will feel stuck and not paid well for the job, if you stay stagnant."
bad,They work you crazy hours for like a weeek. So you can have a schedule for 10:00-9:00 for a week. Within the next schedule you might get one day that you don’t have to work so many hours. The schedule would be like 6:00-10:00.
bad,I started as a seasonal employee during the busy christmas season. It was difficult standing so many hours. In those days the pay was way below minimum wage.
bad,"The Chicago area is so mismanaged. It's a shame to let such talented, passionate people who want to work for you fall through the cracks because upper management can't figure out how to treat people to keep them around. Management is petty, short sited, and places blame on others instead of taking responsibility for corporate decisions. What a shame."
bad,"A lot of hours, a lot of work, not a lot of pay. Decent part time job though. Management was okay. Security was a pest but if you want work they have work for you"
bad,It Was A Good Workplace When I First Started Working There But When I started getting comfortable some people were so disrespectful. They Paid Us Good But They Messed Up Your Hours To.
bad,It was fun and the people were great in the call center I worked in.  There was a real team and community feel brought about by the employees.  All the employees were great.
bad,I really didnt like this job i had at william but it paid the bills so i was happy with that so so so so so sos so so so so sos kkk and  i always thoug
bad,Great company to work for because the day goes by fast when there's plenty of work. Most people here are helpful and friendly and willing to teach you new things everyday so you can grow within the company.
bad,"A typical day would be fast pace, customer driven and what I learned was to be very open to do different tasks and be able to multitask. Management wanted you to be self reliant so most of my experience learning my job was thru a trainers and other employees but as I did learn my job management helped when really needed. "
bad,"need a better system to teach company policies, company is obviously unorganized nothing but angry customers and most mistakes are by the company....stressful. Good if you're really needing a position."
bad,I was excited to have a work from home job but the system they use needs more work and the management needs to not get mad when you have to keep working with IT.
bad,"William-Sonoma is not for everyone. It can be a tough place to work if you are not flexible. Working in a store is a very demanding job which provides little monetary benefit. All in all, I enjoyed my experience with the company."
bad,"Nice place to work, but does need schedule changes and better communication skills from management. If they didn't change my schedule every 6 months, I probably wouldn't be looking to replace them."
good,The hardest part this job was being disrespected! a day at work was great.Coworkers was great
good,"Good environment, temp job with no benefits,"
good,this is a great place to work if you enjoy learning new products.
good,"Training was extremely fast-paced and there was a loss of support when triaining was over.  I was very impressed with the online training system, though!"
good,working here was stressful.  when a customer would take a survey for you it wasn't always something that would actually apply to the service given to the person.  You were not able to defend your self to have it to any good.
good,"Job was ok, very stressful at times. No work life balance because of mandatory overtime. I enjoyed working at home, not having to fight daily traffic."
good,"I worked a swing shift,so it didn't leave a lot of time for social life or time for my children.I was able to learn how to be in charge of people of all age groups,taking on tthe responsibilty of doing head counts,keeping up with hourly production,entering data for the night,feeling out damage reports for reshipments,etc...It was very challenging for the simple fact,there were individuals who had been there for a longer time period than me who didn't feel i deserved the position,and just having to tell other adults what to do.i enjoyed getting to know and work with other older individuals who had been in management for years and didn't mind helping me."
good,Just it’s very low pay and very draining. There’s so many people wanting to move up to an online chat specialist because the phone are just so stressful
good,"As a company they do not pay enough unless you demand it, then still not guaranteed. This locations management team has the worst communication, and company wide has communication issues. Expect more and more from associates with no appreciation or raises."
good,Not strong company culture or inclusiveness. Did not go beyond simple measures to build teams that would work well together. Did not work with respectful people.
good,"Too many distractions, could not do your work due to constant interruptions, which management allowed, and promoted groups to call us directly, no levels of support, everyone needed to jump all the time.   Fighting fire all the time, night/days and weekends."
good,Stable jobs but no opportunities for advancement. Management could be better but company does strive to be better for both employee and employer. Good benefits
good,hot environment.  I learn to count order. the management to strict to thing is not important. packing boxes was the hardest cause it was a lot of item we had to pack. i enjoy my co worker they were hard worker
good,"A typical day at work was fun, I learned many new things.  Management left us alone for the most part.  Worked well with other employees."
good,Retail is never a good mix of work and personal life. The staff was very difficult to get along with and it could have a better team atmosphere.
good,"Joined the company with a 5 minute interview. The I-9 process was a hassle but good HR people helped out; they were special. Customer Service could mean assistance, sales, or other titles so be prepared in case you do not like sales! Training is your typical at home job training: overcrowded, days of technical issues and not enough support. You will be rushed to absorb as much information as possible before being thrown on the phones with no virtual walk through of the systems that they use. The companies values and core statements promote care and quality and people first but it is not apparent in the training nor the first month, it is all about your production and metrics. Management seems angry or tentative at the training/ beginning level. Not all of them but some are unwelcoming especially if you are having a difficult time with the systems or the knowledge They expect you to know what they know within a 3 week period and it is unrealistic. The culture is female dominant. The hardest part of the job is the beginning, over-crowded training. If you do not get cut before you teach yourself how to navigate through 8 different platforms, yeah I said 8...You will be fine.  A strong suggestion is to make sure you have dual monitors,because 3/8 platforms are your go-to's for answers.(Including a robot), make sure you have more than enough ISP Speed. The broadband width they test will shock you Training does not provide time for real life examples where you can practice using the systems for a day or two.There are over 60 modules to complete in training and if you take your time"
good,Working from home was easy but when a csr needed real help from a supervisor no help was given.  Take  a message is all you can do.  Meeting goals and good customer service aren't really what they want. Meeting goals is all they want.
good,"Do not pay competitive wages. Do not do anything for employees. No Christmas party, birthday gift, Thanksgiving turkey gift card, nothing. "
good,You could work as long as you wanted as long as it was approved. Many breaks throughout the day. You could wear comfortable clothes as long as you had on your vest.
good,"It was a work from home job, but you had to take constant calls. Almost all the calls were from angry customers because their item hasn’t arrived yet but every single order was late because of the holidays, and they’ll blame you for it. There were announcements everyday to not do too many refunds but refunds were 80% of our job because many customers needed one/multiple.  Store associates have no clue what they’re doing so they’ll call you to fix their mess. Never take a call center job or a work from home job from this place. It is the worst."
good,"Great products, discounts and training but due to the corporate mentality, I feel that the regional manager perpetuated a lot of problems that made it an unpleasurable work environment.  A lot of whose her favorites, backstabbing and other things that I don't engage in.  Also due to the store manager I worked with, I didn't receive proper training with the hopes of career advancement.  He was more worried about being the teachers pet.  It was one of the worst example of corporate politics I have ever seen in my life and made the work environment really bad."
good,"I like working hear"
good,"Enjoy working with a variety of clients seeking knowledge with purchasing high end cooking equipment or helping them learn how to cook a particular dish or just in general. Pleasant multiethic staff. Enjoy teaching cooking classes. First time working in retail and find that part of the job frustrating, hours cut when daily or weekly financial targets not met. Limited growth and compensation. Nice place just for me, retail is not the place."
good,It was a good place to work. Very impersonal. Management was almost non-existent. Didn't teach you enough about the job to do it efficiently. Culturally indifferent.
good,"I.  Enjoy working at the store great products and great customer ina great location the problem is the training is basically NONE. which makes it hard to be a productive Employee .training on the register which is the most important was done in 5 mn during opening of The store upon my request."
good,The requirements that they wanted of you were very un natural and I'm sure that they were there to just get rid of people after the holidays...I also was told at one point that I would get holiday pay for Christmas and thanksgiving but when the check came I didn't get paid at all for those days... when speaking to the manager about this she said that I was misinformed and only non seasonal people get paid holiday pay!
good,"Williams-Somona has wonderful products and a great discount for employees. Its it a very stressful and complex  place to work, until I was able to work from home. Working  from home made it alot easier but wasn't  worth the pay grade"
good,"The job of cashier at Williams-Sonoma is easily the next toughest after stock. You are dealing with mostly well off entitled older customers who treat you like an idiot. The management is unorganized at times, but there is a strong sense of teamwork at the store I worked at and I have even made strong friendships through the position."
good,"easy job, opportunity to work from home although you had to buy certain phone($50+)  and other tools needed to provide work from home services. only 30 minute lunches"
good,"high volume of inbound/outbound calls."
good,I don't have anything to say about the company but it's alot of things that can be done better about the management but other than that I have nothing to say.
good,"Bien connaître les produits, faire goûter à la clientèle, assister les chefs lors des cours et atteindre les chiffres de vente."
good,Typical day is long and physical. I learned that it is important to pace yourself and eat a big meal. Management was lenient. Co-workers are focused on selves. Hardest part of job is enduring physical long hours.
good,"I enjoyed the work from home position, it allowed me to stay on top of in home duties and gave more time to interact with the school age students. on the other hand management is not the best when it comes to attendance there was no consideration for the allotment of time given for personal matters."
good,"Hours were very long, often doing busy work just to fill the 12 hour shift. Lunch break is short, less than an hour with only one 15 min break partway through. Management was hardly ever actually there, just rode by on a golf cart saying ""you good?""."
good,"10 Columbus Circle Flagship Store"
good,Just unloading trucks with merchandise and using scanner guns to tag with prices. The coworkers were fun and outgoing. Was their only part time.
good,"It is most often a pleasure to serve customers by understanding their needs, listening, and having the knowledge to add value to their shopping experience."
good,"retail experience, consumer culture/ sales driven, minimal compensation and resources allocated to non-sales areas of coorperation"
good,"The class was hired to take furniture calls.  Training was sub par. The trainer was not trained for the nuances of the department. This was the trainers first class. It was overall the blind leading the blind."
good,You’ll meet a lot of people who’s willing to help you if you do not know what your doing. Another good thing about working at this job is you have the ability to work by yourself if you can handle whatever task there is that need to be complete or you can pick and choose who you’ll like to work with you.
good,"The job wasn't hard. The poor management and lack of compensation was unimaginable. Your experience and educational background isn't taken into consideration, but you ability to politic is what's important. The lack of opportunity based on performance is a huge slap in face along with the compensation. The HR department is rude and unprofessional."
good,"hard work no benefits easisly employed because of turnover.It is hard to retain workers because most are hired throgh temporary service and lack the motivation to remain and make a career of working at this company,"
good,"Hectic day , everyday is a fire drill. People  come really early like 7 am everyday and expect others to do the same . Teams just work like robot and go home and repeat every day. No one eats lunch with each other everyone eats at their desk. Poor pay."
good,New management came in I never got to know them so therefore I really can't say wet or what I can about William-Sonoma I did not like their pay rate they could have did a better job at that there is a lot of that lot of work that goes on into the activities and stuff so I really don't care for William Sonoma I mean the people
good,"They are a growing company. they never really seemed to be concerned with the employees well being, They had their pick of people to treat well and others were left in the cold."
good,"Nice environment to work in, many great associates. Just little room for advancement based upon corporate culture. Management was more concerned with resets rather than an active sales training program for both full and part time employees. High end products take a special communication sales approach to close sales."
good,A typical day of work includes running around trying to meet all your sales goals but then always come short. The management never says thank you or good job. They push you by saying how much your store is sucking. would not recommend for anyone who does well by positive reinforcement.
good,"During holiday season, call volume is high, customers are rude, training not long enough. Schedules are silly. Attendence system is the only good thing about this company."
good,"Not very loyal to employees, points system not fair, cut hours in off season, not good for employees that are self supporting. Not made to feel appreciated"
good,This is a colorful part time job.  If a person is interested about learning home items and visuals this is a great place to begin.  The co-workers are typically easy to work with and interesting.
good,"To be honest, the customers were a pain, even with the tools available, you still aren't prepared for people screaming at you. It's high end so they expect to be treated like gods for spending a lot of $$$. The availability to work from home is what drew me in, but supervisors do not stay in contact with you like they should and you're made to feel bad when you need help from leads/management. The pay was wonderful and definitely helped during the holidays, but there's always a looming fear of it all being taken away if you don't always have great stats that day (and some favoritism)."
good,"typical day consisted of impossible goals to reach,, unbearable work conditions, and mismanagement. co workers were typically ok, but mainly a younger class of employees. Hardest part was attempting to follow the directives of more than one person, and the extreme heat."
good,"good work place to work during peak season. "
good,"I felt I could've used more training, especially since our training was cut, and there was lots of times when help was scarce, I would tell the customer when I get the answer I would call them back, but alot of times there was no one available with the answer. Alot of calls were escalations, and we were forced to try and calm them, even the line for escalated calls would refuse to speak with a mad customer, so it was stressful around Christmas when the customer's Christmas presents didn't arrive, we had to do all the explaining.Also if you had 11 occurrences you were suppose to be let go, but I was kept on till after Christmas rush, even though I'd been had eleven occurrences(though some I didn't deserve and tried to dispute them with no success). So I was suspended then released 3 days later."
good,The most memorable part of the job was having the opportunity to meet and have my picture taken with Chuck Williams on my 10 work anniversary!
good,"A stressful working environment with very high expectations, with little assistance to obtain needed tools to maintain service levels.  Management seems less will address issues before service levels drop, and more on stressful clean up after services levels have severely impacted the consumer and external partners."
good,"I enjoyed working at williams sonoma,the supervisors showed me what needed to be done and I did what I was told.I learned a lot,just hate the assignment ended"
good,"The job is pretty straightforward, wish i had the opportunity to move up...."
good,"Overall the product are great, and this was a seasonal job. They team I worked with were helpful and nice. The management could be better."
good,"It was alright, the management needs some work. communication was bad, and they don't help you when you're trying to inform a customer of the product."
good,"Great Company to work for. its just the management is never on the same page, you ask question and give 52 different answers."
good,Stressful job. Compensation is not worth the verbal abuse withstood by associates. Supervisors are disinterested in helping associates.
good,stock room. office operations. learned about kitchen utensils. fun place to work seasonally
good,I had a great experience turn sour over the years.I learned many things when it came to kitchen products and management. Then the Store Manager was promoted to District Manager and the store was dealt a major blow.
good,"Williams-Sonoma offers the ability to work from home which is excellent. However, you are working a fixed 8 he shift and will be penalized if you clock in/out late or early. So it is not ideal for someone needing the flexibility of a remote job. "
good,"Corporation mentality with high sales pressure, Daily achievement and sale goals with annoying walkie-talkie pep talks throughout the day.  "
good,"The pay is decent if you’re near 30 hours a week. Other than that no major benefits. Company definitely pays a toll on the environment and in some settings, employee health."
good,The training does not adequately prepare you for what you have have to face when you go to the phones. Customers are demanding and there is little help. If you have a supervisor who is helpful then count yourself lucky there are a few otherwise your only option is a bot with one lead to answer any questions. This can prolong wait time for answers to complex issues when you're placed in a queue and can impact your metric scores and further irate an angry customer ever further. Definitely not worth the stress.
good,"I liked the job. The staff was rude. They constantly tried to correct my southern accent, and equated my accent with having a low IQ.  Location closed"
good,The supervisor had a poor attitude and didn't communicate well. The employees were reslly nice there we would joke around and still get our work done and if we ran out of things to do we would all help other people out
good,Williams sonoma is all about politics. The managers like to brain wash people. Theyre always pushing employees to do more than theyre supposed to. So stressful.
good,I was a machine operator. I monogrammed the orders that was picked to be shipped out to the customers in a timely manner. It was a very fast pace work area.
good,"It's a retail job -- some days it's easy, some days it's hard labor.  Associates compete for sales and revenue, for which there is no monetary reward."
good,"Employees are nice and developed good relationships."
good,"The training was horrible. It should have been longer. They didn't go over half the stuff they should have. My monthly income is about $1500 after taxes and before any overtime. They want you to WORK and dont really care about much else. Its one of those things where you take the good with the bad because you need a job for the holidays. H I G H C A L L V O L U M E during the holidays, which is expected BUT MAN. It gets stressful."
good,This company has been like a yo-yo. You aren't able to stabilize your personal life because your schedule changes every other month. When concerns are brought to management it is over looked unless it directly involves them. There is no union so they make their own rules to run with and you have no say so about it. You are underpaid for the amount of work that is piled on you on a daily basis.
good,This was a temp position for the busy holiday season. Very fun to work there but no long term employment. They only hired for the holiday season. But it was fun
good,"I had the opportunity to learn about the difference in cookware and the importance of what the cookware was made of and how the different metals affected the cooking time. Sometimes we would receive 300 packages a day, and other days it would only be 30. So time management was a very important factor in completing the shipment. The hardest part of the job is when 2 or more people on the sales floor wanted product ASAP. Management, when I was first hired, communicated in a very professional manner, however, there was a change of management the last 6 months I was there. The new manager set unrealistic goals for the warehouse. She was difficult to deal with because of her lack of communication. I enjoyed the sales floor people, they had a real desire to work as a team."
good,This job is faced pace and managers are not helpful. Pay is low and agents work with no help. helpdesk give different answers and you are not allowed to call them for assistance.
good,"I feel like it’s a waste of my time. This place is great for summer work, if your a student, or if you’re trying to jump back in to the daily grind. This isn’t somewhere to try to make a career at."
good,"It is hard to keep up with the work demand on an hourly basis. They kept making it harder and harder to reach our hourly goals. Their motto is ""people first"" however when my mother passed away, I received no support from my company."
good,If you have bills to pay don't work here. You only get like 15 hours a week even tho you availability is completely open. And if you're interested in growing in this company forget it. You could been working here for years and they'll never promote you to a higher position. Other than that is a good employer.
good,"If you are in dying need of a job, this is a good starting point, however if you are needing time off right off the bat reconsider employment here. When hired on you will NOT get 40 hours of vacation you will accrue it as time goes on at a low rate. You get 2 personal days, but you get most holidays off. If you miss days even if you are sick and bring a doctors note it is held against you. this point system is set up for you to fail. if you get a point, it does not fall off until the following year to the date. There is lack of communication between upper management and workers on the floor. I love the people (regular employees) here. you will meet some of the nicest people working here, they make it enjoyable."
good,Not the best but not the worst. It was okay working there. I was temporary and I got let go for doing something they instructed me to do. It was kinda hard to meet their requirements. Was sort of like walking on eggshells.
good,Hours was from 6 am - 4:30 pm . Made sure that all working orders was complete by the end of the day. Learn how to make sure all orders are process and ready to go.
good,the employees there made you feel like family. No matter what the job was we knew that as long as we worked together the job would be completed. Family
good,"Learned a lot about cookware,knives,and electrics. Some of management have been there for years and full of knowledge. worked with great people and bad.Wish it had healthcare and better pay.Not much follow threw with keeping employees in order."
good,Although it was seasonal job the experience at William Sonoma was wonderful and I enjoyed the atmosphere of all they gave us gifts and money prizes I worked seasonal there before so it was nice
good,Very tiring. Need to know what you are talking about. Clientele is pretentious and demanding. Sales are nice with expensive purchases and often times large purchases. Management was roughly ran and a little unorganized. Corporate does not care about the need of individual establishments.
good,This was a starting job for me as I came to end with my first 4 years of college. The team i worked with was a good team but the work environment was not for me. I was looking for a place to grow and advance in life.
good,"Work can start anywhere between 7am or noon for full time.  On an average day we can receive about 100 units to be organized and processed.  It is a fast-paced job where you need to be able to multi-task to best fit the customers needs. The hardest part of the job, other than the heavy lifting of furniture, would be to anticipate what the business needs would be next(staying ahead of the curve)."
good,"Usually 9-12 hour days with high focus on production. Very little interaction with management, usually at the beginning of the day to express production goals. About a 2 week training period after which they expect close to if not total knowledge of the position."
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible to go through emails to make sure there are any updates on system issues the night before, credits cards not being able to process, orders not being filled because of a glitch in the system. Also any emails pertaining to any website issues. After the emails I begin to take calls from the associate and answer any questions they may have for the customer. I will also take calls from the associate if the customer has escalated.  Later in the afternoon I will go through the my emails answer any question the customer has sent me and and check my voicemail and do call backs."
good,management was poor. work hours are ridiculous. pay is over rated. not a place i would want to go back to. In there i learned that rotating shifts are nothing but a headache. for such slow progress shift hours should not be on such a ridiculous rotation cycle.
good,"If Williams-Sonoma, Inc. paid their employees a better salary range and enforced equal opportunity for all employees they would not suffer the attrition rate that they are dealing with. They need to ""clean house"" and get rid of these managers that have unethical work habits with some clear labor violation issues. These changes would make this company the best place to work in Las Vegas."
good,"parent company to several brands. i.e pottery barn, pottery barn kids, pottery barn teen, west elm. and several online brand such as pottery barn dorm & williams-sonoma home. covering all home design needs."
good,"Would go to work after school, some of my friends also worked there so we made work fun.  I learned the framework of business and how to use a cash register and how to stock shelves and handle inventory.  My co-workers all got along.  The hardest part of the job was carrying heavy furniture out to customers cars, the most enjoyable was working with my friends"
good,"Retail calling center for william"
good,"I have worked for Williams Sonoma off and on for years, in the call center and the store itself. In the call center I was on the Pottery Barn furniture team, and more recently for the holidays I worked on the wedding registry internet team. I have also in the past worked in the Store, which was a lot of fun. The call center has changed and not for the good, in the beginning 8-10 years ago it was a fun, challenging and upbeat place to work, I looked forward to work and the customers I dealt with (store managers). My most recent experience, was not pleasant. Once holiday training was over and you were placed on a team to take calls you were abandoned, I couldn't get over the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the current management, if I hadn't experienced it myself I would have defended Williams Sonoma to my grave. Unfortunately, times have changed in the call center and not for the better. My co-workers were the best as well as the customers I assisted. I would say they were the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned that times and management change and it's not always in the best interest of the company, and it's sad. I will always love Williams Sonoma the brand and of course Pottery Barn, I still shop there. I had the pleasure years back of meeting Chuck Williams, the owner, when he came out for a holiday party, that was and is my highlight."
good,"The daly duties for the sales staff are all directed to engage with customers and drive sales."
good,There is no room for advancement & growth with the company. The employees are not congratulated on a job well done. Sometimes it doesn't seem to be a good work environment at times it's very hostile & depressing.
good,Lot of opportunities to learn but career growth is limited.  If someone wants to learn and develop new skills then this is a great place to start your career.
good,"Poor Training, very rude customers, stressful, but pay is decent, pushed to the limit with absurd demands and rich people problems. PTO from the start tho"
good,Decent place to work.   Very fast paced and stressful at times.   Mandatory overtime most weekends.   Room for advancement.  They do promote from outside as well.
good,"This is a great place to work, and there is plenty of incentives to have fun.  However the pay scales are very off for the industry, and they take great advantage of their employees."
good,"Won’t let me complete entry without something in this section, and there is a minimum character limit, so there is that. Ok place to work but management could be improved."
good,"never new when you were going home. could work a full day to half a day, we didn't know until you got to work. nice environment and the staff was pleasant."
good,"i have not worked for william sonoma for more than 7 years."
good,This was a seasonal position that I was blessed to have. It is very past paced and you have to pay attention to everything. I did learn more than I knew going in and it was a good job at the time
good,"Supervisors and managers change frequently, within a days notice and I am not comfortable with this situation. "
good,"company did not hold their vendors responsible for the products the customers bought from them thru Williams Sonoma or their other brands."
good,"The typical work day lasted 11.5 hours. I learned to properly check the quality of items that were being shipped to the customers of Williams-Sonoma, Inc."
good,Work from home agents are on their own. If you have any type of mistakes that need correcting or any type of payroll explanations your screwed. Management is very incompetent and they take advantage of the fact everything is done via chat. It's rare they will get back to you if you ever have any personal issues that's not customer related.
good,"During Peak Season your schedule is flexed to increase your hours as they see fit.  During non peak they reduce your schedule as they want to. You can work from home, but you must have a good computer to accommodate all the software you need.  Customers rate you after every call, so if the furniture is late from the warehouse, the customer is upset with you.  You can offer discounts or free shipping, but they are mad because their items are late and the customers blame you."
good,"Although the job was very stressful for me, it was a good seasonal job for the most part. I got to work from home, which was a plus. Management was decent. Hardest part was the very difficult customers, but couldn't blame them to much. WS is very complicated to navigate through."
good,The hardest part of the job was the consistency of the rules.  They will tell to you follow certain guidelines and to forward all calls that are not within those boundaries to a supervisor.  The supervisor can take a 5 or more minutes to get on the line and then the outcome is something that you could've easily handled and not have your customer waiting unnecessarily.
good,Everyday I open up the HR office with no supervision. I get the opportunity to set the tone for most associates who come into the building by greeting them with a warm smile and good morning. I spend most of my day working on new recruiting techniques or processing employee changes in the companies systems. I also aide in employee conflict resolution when the issue arises. I set up interview and offer new positions to candidates who have successfully passed the interview stage of the hiring process. It is my job to put the employees and associates first when making company decisions I am their voice.
good,A typical work day we have no work even during the holidays. Management lazy they just there to get a pay check. Work place culture Is not safe at all.
good,Job is for someone starting in the workforce wanting to gain experience in customer service in a call center environment. Pay is 11.00 hr. can move to furniture department and make a dollar more. Lots more work and responsibilities for additional dollar.
good,Working the seasonal position for Williams-Sonoma was very fun and productive. They have great refreshments. However trying to get more hours was very challenging.
good,"The fitness center was the place for us to go to anytime day or night. But when upper management moved to our location, the fitness center was taken and replaced with fancy offices for them. Peak season can sometimes be overwhelming. However, I loved the challenges and the overtime pay. My lead is the best! She's caring and shows us compassion."
good,Service quality suffers due to over appeasement of investors. Lack of communication within each branch of management.
good,"Always be on time. By been a temporary you fair your self by not showing up on time "
good,"Supervisors switch teams regularly, and they each have very different procedures and personalities which makes it very difficult to follow company policies."
good,"I myself didn't see William Sonoma how other might of because the time I was there it was a mess as in the Company was deciding if it was going to go Union or stay as is."
good,"Everyday you are expected to log onto phones right when you clock in and stay on the phones for the entire day excluding breaks and lunches. You have no time to make any outbound calls or finish up work on old orders. Every other call is an upset customer. The procedures you have to follow make your job more difficult and it upsets the customer. During ""peak season"" Thanksgiving - Christmas   you have to work ten hours a day or else it will be counted against you. It's hard and exhausting."
good,"A typical day of work consist of taking multiple inbound and some out bound calls, assisting customers with : orders, returns, billing issues, retention and escalated customers. I learned at Williams Sonoma that the on line retail world is not for everyone and there is no reasoning with some people when they are upsets things didn't go as they planned. I also learned that my skin has  grown very tuff and thick during my time at Williams Sonoma. Management is great everyone is friendly and really puts forth an effort to make sure everyone is on the same page and comfortable in there job position. My co-workers are awesome everyone speaks to one another and are always willing to help out a fellow team member. The hardest part of the job is listening to a customer scream and curse in your ear about something completely out of your control, and not having access to the information or resources they desperately need  or want at the time to resolve the issue at hand with out a supervisor or manager approval, when none of them are available or all are in a meeting at the same time it can make the job pretty frustrating at times self control is a must have in situations like those. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to work from the comfort of my home."
good,"The job wasn't so bad, but you got little to no support from the"
good,"Even on your best days they didn't want to see you succeed. An occasional pat on the back, and congrats was given, but beteween the ridiculous point system they had in place for attendance and the lack of support during the most important times of the year, this cmpany is not set to work with it's employees. I did however learn plenty of ways to NOT treat a customer with my own company, and how to properly give love and concern to those who really did need help. I also learned how to determine when people were trying to get over on a company , which happened often."
good,"Williams-Sonoma is a wonderful company that goes more than a few extra steps to make its customers happy. My favorite part of the job is the data entry. The hardest is dealing with customers who are hard    pressed to squeeze a drop of water from a rock, in essence disturbing the flow of calls of genuine customer service calls on a hunt to find a way to receive maximum discounts or credits. My co workers are quite diverse. I enjoy what they provide to my work life. Management works hard to always assist in any and every way possible."
good,"I am awaiting to experience the Work from Home program that is offered through the company. A typical day at work Is comedy which is healthy for the soul while working under stressful circumstances. I do appreciate how the management team try's to keep the atmosphere in a very humble, calm and enjoyable peaceful attitude that is professional towards everyone in the building and out of the building including over the phone lines. The hardest part of the job is transitioning to the system that has been selected of choice by the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the management that conduct their selves as a professional team that cares about how others are feeling and doing. What I've learned is that I have more patience than I thought I had to transition into the system of choice that the company has to use."
good,"Unknown hours going in. Could be ten or four. Work varied, the job we trained on was not always the one we did."
good,"Specially skilled in providing assistance to both internal and external customers regarding inquires and issues with upscale furniture items. Apply analytical and troubleshooting skills."
good,"Williams-Sonoma pays great, and has some very loyal employees.  The hours are extremely demanding, as is upper-management.  They are very aware that the employees are overwhelmed - they don't care.  At the end of the day, it is a numbers game.  The company as a whole doesn't think twice about being loyal to the employees that have been so loyal to them.  What they do not realize is that these loyal employees that they threw away with the trash were also once loyal customers. I guess they don't care about them either."
good,"Would begin with the a brief meditation period and recital of my personal inspirational testimony for success to prepare myself mentally for customers who are unsatisfied or have issues that demand"
good,"While I like the company's high standards and committment to excellence, I think that much work needs to be done regarding diversity.  As the only regular (opposed to seasonal) staff member of color, I was bullied, undermined, and there was a flat-out plot to physically hurt me when I began to excel and began receiving favor from the district manager.  it didn't help that my baking and cooking skills suprassed all other cooks and bakers by miles.  They couldn't handle that a woman of color is as gifted as I am...from nursing to cooking...to baking.  They flat-out couldn't handle that a woman, from a race of people they have always deemed as inferior, made them look bad and feel like dog poo.  I did everything non-managerial including planning and teaching cooking/technique classes but I was paid less than everyone else on staff...even PT casual people who only performed customer service on the selling floor.  Like I said in the summary line...excellent products but VERY racist culture.    "
good,Patience was a necessary requirement when dealing with some of the technology and people. Accrued points for being late/early by only 1 min which was terrible.
good,This is probably the worst job I have ever had. No one was organized everyone had bad attitudes and no one ever came into work when they were supposed to. Pay was very low. Lifiting of heavy palates. Very strenuious work.
good,"Product line and fellow employees were great.  General Manager lacked ability to hire and retain enough staff!  Without appropriate staffing, store was violating many HR regulations."
good,"This job is ideal for those seeking a seasonal position. Several shifts are available; however, if you are looking for something steady, be aware they usually hire for temporary seasonal positions so you run the risk of being let go or drastically having your hours reduced once the season is over"
good,I have worked there for three months and I have learned good people skills and experience I have also like the manager of the store and the assistant manager the hardest part of working is the co workers they don't treat you with any respect
good,"Working with Williams Sonoma is fun and productive during a typical work day.  It can also be a struggle due to not having management when needed.  You also have to take into consideration that Williams Sonoma is the parent company to 6 more companies.  Overall it was an amazing experience, but I would not want to work for this company ever again in the future."
good,There are a lot of nice people. There is a large lunchroom with food to purchase and large refrigerator/freezers. They offer free deluxe coffee machines and a sparkling water fountain.
good,The job it self was easy but the multiple jobs I had to do. It tired me out and not enough hours I was working 2 to 3 days a week. Doing other people's jobs I did not like it and some of the employees where lazy.
good,Fast paced environment that has grown from a basic call center to a multi department support center.  Not as much focus on proper training as operating systems have changed.
good,It was a very professional and very interesting meeting with the HR Manager as she make sure I felt comfortable and confident during thi the interview
good,"I am glad I had a job, but I am use to working away from home so that got Alitalia under my skin. Got to talked to a lot a different people some very nice and some not so much"
good,"Management not good. not willing to move forward. Allways Stagnant...  Management not willing to work with employees, always late, to much time off. No help when needed..."
good,This is a good company to work for with decent benefits. Hourly associates are at a disadvantage and the difference in treatment is very noticeable. The work life balance is not bad.
good,i liked working at Williams-Sonoma. I hate its only seasonal. The people are nice. their are car drawings. in peak season there will be a lot of overtime.
good,"The job carries and interesting set of views. An employee can work to exceed goals, provide suggest ideas to progress the company, and volunteer overtime to try to be the best employee and get little recognition for their effort. When an employee do not meet expectations, they are met with ridicule and not given the proper training nor guidance to become better. Over all the company can be a delightful work environment if you only focus on doing your job and nothing more. "
good,"I work with a great team which has made it hard to leave. It would be a great idea for everyone at corporate to work at a store level during slow and busy times, not just come in for 2 hours to giftwarp at holiday. They think they are being progressive but have put so many restrictions on us it is new impossible to give the ""World Class Service"" they claim. The pay is ridiculous for the bay area and with minimum wage increase only people making that get raises. Now they make the same as managers because mangers don't get more money when minimum wage goes up."
good,"WS is a face paced competitive sales environment that can get a little cut throat. PT employees must get sales in order to be scheduled. "
good,"If you've never worked a call center job before or a work from home job before, you're in for a treat. "
good,Upper management seems to be fine lower management is not very good at all the health insurance and benefits are great it seems to be a growing company and is very large already
good,"This is an OK place to gain call center experience, but in regards to long term, i would suggest going somewhere else.  The discount is nice, but you would have to order everything online."
good,Read the summary. Poor Management causes lots of drama to enter the work place. No advancement and sometimes unrealistic expectations.
good,They are ok to work for but don't get sick because you get a point even work a doctor's note.  They try to tell you when you can take vacation and use personal time.
good,"Once peak season hits, you can make a decent check if you are highly motivated. Downside is that there's isn't a strong sense of management leaving a lot of people clueless about there position causing a high turn over and damaged items."
good,The company is a great place to work for if you do not have a family.  I must admit the pay can be great at times such as peak but overall there is not any consistency.  This is not a company geared toward worklife balance.
good,Great place to work a lot of responsibility and fun while doing so .the furniture is very well made so you expect the delivery to be the same . Just not that much down time at home w friends and family
good,"William-Sonoma is a great company, there are very little advancements in this job. Once you are in one position for ten years it seems your stuck there ten more."
good,We was use to having fun but staying on track when it came down to us working. We always cane together and made sure every worker was ok and was always on positivd things
good,"Very fun enviroment. Its very fast paced. The management team is great, I enjoy working as a team. I learn how to pack boxes the right way. My co-workers are great and easy to work with."
good,"The people who work with a fun amazing people. Throughout the company provides food trucks, sample sales, blood drives and healthcare screenings on the job."
good,"Job can be super fun in the face pace environment, with major lulls in production. Laid back atmosphere, with great coworkers. Communication between management and teams could be better. There seems to be a large amount of turnover."
good,Great company to work for if you are in the clique. They operate on a strict system of  promoting friends. Not a good work life balance as the company has yet to manage capacity and workloads and staffing issues.
good,"Far from organized and co workers are competitive and misleading. Its like you enter a race when clocking into work at Williams-Sonoma. Efficiency is mandatory, but not guaranteed due to the lack of thorough training and team work. Being a prep is nothing but selecting a collate and matching the item, pin product in specified spot so that machine operator knows where to monogram. A machine operator collects order items and collate from prep and fetch the color(s) for each monogram. Scan collate into machine system and set up machine with appropriate colors and fonts. You then place the item on the machine and start it. Monitor the progress of the machine as it completes the monogram. As a finisher you inspect finished products from machine operators to ensure the product is perfect."
good,"Lots of work for the compensation. Loved the customers though they made it everything fun. Cooking classes were stressful =, but had a lot of fun with clients."
good,too much walking just to clean clean clean. slow days sucked.
good,The work place was wonderful but the sales goals were across the board and did not take in to account things like hours where associates were unable to make sales due to responsibilities.
good,"This would be an awesome place to work if the in-house and district manager would be more people-centric. They refuse to hire you if you do not have full time open availability, but then only schedule you for an average of ten hours per week making it almost impossible to secure other employment."
good,This is a good place to work for high school age people. The pay and schedule is not convenient for a family oriented worker.
good,"Usually a high-volume of calls per minute in queue. Learned company policies in order to help solve customer's issues with orders. Placed online orders for customers, tracked orders, issued pickups and replacements for customers. Best part of job was drawings for prizes for various company contests."
good,"I just started a part-time job at Williams Sonoma about a month ago,  The job was supposed to be 20 hours a week, but since I started I have had just 10 hours a week.  The training is awful - the little they provide for their complex systems and rules is either standing over your shoulder, barking corrections, or listening to your sales conversations and then evaluating what you said. There is no written guide to doing the ringing up, and they have three different web sites to find product information: one tells you the sku, another tells you how many of any item is in the store, and the third provides you with a product picture,"
good,"Call Center Associate, William Sonoma, San-Francisco, CA"
good,"Stay at home mom wanted part time job thinking with all the wonderful gadgets at 40% off, it would be so much fun. Boy was I wrong! During slow times of the day you would think you could relax a bit, but oh no. Lets polish all the copper pots or mop the floor or clean the toilets. Don't even think about having a conversation with a co-worker when no one is in the store. Cant have that. Crack the whip! When working 8 hour shifts on my feet, I had to insist that I be given my lunch or my break which angered management. I felt like reporting them. Unbelievable at a bare minimum wage at that!"
good,The job is a good one. Simple customer service in a friendly environment. The merchandise is exciting! Atmosphere is good. So all in all its a good place to work. There are just no hours to give. You make almost no money.
good,Corporate feel. Not very interesting. Learn about consumers' trends. Dealt with high classy people = very demanding but very satisfactory at the end of the day. Learn a lot about customers' relations.
good,"This company offers little room for independent thought or an entrepreneurial spirit. However, the best retail training I have ever received from any place I've worked came from Williams-Sonoma."
good,"Work life balance is not an option.  High demand of overtime is required."
good,"Training was 3 weeks, in that 3 week time period you are pushed through modular learning and then put on phones with customers who expect you to know how to handle their orders. Lack of training leads to a long hard adjustment period. The pay is good but the hours are long 10+ hours a day with 1, 30 break a day. Since it work from home the commute is great."
good,"I enjoyed my time I was employed at Wsi. Inc. The managers were very concerned about the employees including me. When my father past away, they was there at the funeral with flowers. I met co-workers that ended up being close friends. I was saddened when I had to leave the WSI. Inc. The reason for me leaving was because my transportation I have rear-end went out. So I had no transportation to get to work"
good,"Starting is pay is somewhat better than some work from home companies but considering we provide support for all 7 brands it should reflect as such. Training is not helpful at all. Pretty much you're in a adobe connect room with the trainer but instead of actual engaging activities with the class you will pretty much do nothing but modules for the first 2 weeks, do a couple of tedious worksheets, followed by a week of nesting then you're off on your own. The job itself is not hard and the customers are fairly nice compared to other customer service jobs I've had in the past. Its the policies that the company has that is frustrating not only to the customer but also to agents as we have to explain over and over again to a customer that's unable to cancel an order or dealing with a purchase that hasn't arrived several months after a purchase. As far as floor support there is a automated system where you type questions but its not that helpful. You can find the answer but the way to find it is not efficient while interacting with customers. You will rarely here from your supervisor as they have over 50+ employees under supervision which is ridiculous in my opinion. Other than that if you are a self starter and know how to work on your own with little to no help then this job is for you."
good,The Job Is Easy But The Management Team Is Very Unprofessional And They Are Unorganized You Dont Have A Set Time To Go In Or To Get Off They Dont Deal With Issues The Right Way And They Dont Know How To Talk To People
good,"WS is very nice at making schedules that work with our personal life, i learned about many kitchen gadgets i never knew excisted before. Management was the main reason I left, for the most part were micro managers just becuase we did have to meet a sales goal set upon corporate. My co workers were the best, and we always helped each other and played as a team. The hardest part about working at WS was working with different managers, some that did not have the heart to lead a team or wanted the recognition without actually giving the respect, I cant base this on everyone because 2-3 of them were very nice and helpful. I can honestly say that the best part of my job was being surrounded by co workers who were so kind and welcoming from day 1."
good,Working at Williams-Sonoma was fun.  It’s a high paced environment during the holidays and a bit competitive.  Overall it was a good experience and employees get good discounts.
good,"It’s been a while since I worked there, so many things could have fundamentally changed. Different brands also attract different personality types and as a result, that can make a huge difference in your work experience here."
good,Don’t like this place they would rush me to hurry up and pick some pretty heavy boxes I didn’t like it in my opinion.. the leads were cool but some weren’t they would try and get u in trouble but I mean it was pretty cool sometimes
good,"this is a reasonable, typical retail experience...kind of slow throughout the year and absolutely insane during the holidays.  went through 3 managers in one year, each worse than the last"
good,Job was pretty decent. No complaints. At times OT was given as well. Job culture was relaxed and fast paced. Fair lunch hours and breaks.  Most Leads were helpful and friendly.
good,"After 22 years and being away for 6, it is hard to look back and describe my tenure with Williams-Sonoma. I started working there at a young age. There were many opportunities for advancement, and I took great advantage of those over the years. I worked in several departments; stocking, shipping receiving, inventory, and quality. I pretty much built my resume there."
good,Ok job  training could have been more effective  with more supervisor to reach out to in time of need other than that the job was ok I could wor their again
good,"Cooperate needs to think about their associates (the ones actually making them money). Possibly firing their current team and hiring a new one, because they always come up with outdated and stupid ideas that do not apply to the real and current world."
good,"Company policy only seemed to be inforced when it had no effect on management or supervisors.  While you were empowered to take charge and make decisions to help the customer, it was often overturned by a review department.  This made our decisions uncertain to the customers."
good,Job gave me a new experiance from what i had been doing for several years. Became certified on several forklifts and learned new computer skills. Alot of bending and lifting involved.
good,"If you work at the Williams Sonoma, it is for the employee discount. It is a wonderful store- although the product quality has been declining over the past years. You get minimum wage and are expected to be available at all times and have knowledge of everything sold. Too much is expected for what they pay."
good,"Not paid enough for the required work, etc. Comfortable surroundings.  It's a job, what your expectations are will be your experience. Beautiful landscape, plenty of free parking, break room with free drinks, marketworks food to buy."
good,The typical day is never typical.  The days are always challenging with new opportunities to make things better in the operation.  With goals set on a daily basis there are rewards to the teams if they are met.
good,I worked with a group of hard working and out going people. The environment is balanced in professionalism and fun. You can learn a bit about goods and services there - the customer service there is great as well.
good,Fast paced Distribution/Home Delivery Hub operations.  Operates by Core Values and Mission Statements. Management can be inconsistent with overall direction.
good,"The culture and store itself is lovely if you are interested in cooking and entertaining. There is a lot to learn and for the most part the customers, though demanding, are interesting and nice."
good,"long hours for less pay, I think some departments are recognized more than some.  There is not as much of an opportunity to move up, there are picks and chooses."
good,Working here you have to go to work to work and not make any friends. Wouldn't end well if you're in a click .work is easy but I must add work place could get a little crowded
good,The typical work day @ William Sonoma was just that. We were always busy due to the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays. I management team work professional and always made sure you knew and understood your role as an employee.
good,"Lets just say starting off at this job, I loved it. Trainers were very nice and the hours were great. My first week of talking to customers they lost my drug test and I was advised to clock out and take another drug test. I did this rapidly so that I could get back to working. I emailed HR and waited forever to get my results back. Finally I got a message saying that I could have already been working and that they just needed record of me TAKING the test. This made no sense to me since you cant work without passing the test yet they let me work for 2 weeks already. "
good,A typical day at work is fast and very stressful. I learned how to do sort packages and work at a fast pace enviroment with coworkers. The management was good and always positive about getting the work done.
good,"I'd say their heart is in the right place, but as a large company that has been around for decades, they seem stuck in the 50's and a bit behind the times."
good,"Over stress about little things. Gets repetitive at times."
good,Williams Sonoma call center can be loud and sometimes the management is rude to you.  I think what kept me at williams sonoma was that I only had to go into the center once a month so for majority of the time I was in the comforts of my own home.
good,"My daily task at Williams Sonoma was operating two monogram machines as well as picking ,packing ,and working at a productive speed for ten or twelve hours day."
good,loved working at home and being with my kids and loved my sup and also thought that the overtime was good as well and also had great co workers how made work great
good,"I enjoyed working at Williams Sonoma. For the most part, our managers were friendly and helpful but scheduling was always a nightmare. You never knew what your schedule was going to be for the following week so it made it impossible to plan things in advance."
good,Not a typical warehouse job.  Lots of associate engagement but also a lot of email communication follow up.  Must have good attention to detail and follow up.
good,"Everyone there was lovely, with the exception of my manager. How she continues to be manager there, I don't know. Scheduling me days I couldn't work, overworking the employees, rude to guests, the whole nine yards. I was just happy I was Seasonal."
good,"Loved the people and the photo crews. Company culture is pretty laid back, business casual. Spent most of my time on location."
good,"There are so many leads on 1 shift.  1 lead may tell you one thing and another lead may tell you another, which can make completing an assigned task difficult."
good,"I did heavy lifting everyday, and while doing so I learned to work very well with other co-workers. Some co-workers knit picked a lot and that's hard to deal with knowing that the manager won't put an end to it, but overall I enjoyed my job and the people I met."
good,"Williams-Sonoma is fast paced."
good,a typical day would be busy never a supervisor there when really need one. Didnt get enough time to call customers back as promised or if you did you would be talked to. Other then that it was a great place to work just to take advice from employees on there supervisors and where they would be  and why there call back time was so long of a wait time.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of hearing a lot of customers complain about their orders and trying to resolve the issue. I've learned how to use their system. It was an order system but that also caused issues. Management was not up to par. Most of the managers were either not there or did not want to be bothered. I only went to one particular manager that helped me the most. My co-workers were great. We had discussions about the company and what needed to be changed. I did not have any hard days at the job, the job was pretty easy. I didn't really enjoy anything about the job, I just wanted to help the customers the best way I could without involving a supervisor."
good,The hardest thing about this job was dealing with the transition from a temp employee to full time
good,"No real room for improvement, great for students or people looking for holiday or part time work"
good,cleaning washing dishes preparing food. food service bring them to the patient.best part when u help the patient an thesmile on there face.
good,"Taking Calls, Placing orders for customers Out of  catalogs ,  Notate each individual call"
good,"Williams-Sonoma tens years ago was top of its game ... now, it has fallen from grace.  The products you find at WS can now be found in stores such as Home Goods, World Market, etc.  The management does not care about you as an indivdual, but as someone who can ""open credit cards"" and make the hourly sales goals."
good,"A typical day at Williams-Sonama was answering phones and taking orders from the customers.  I also did trouble-shooting on some of the company products.  If we couldn't figure it out, we would just schedule a pick-up and replace the item at no cost to the customer. "
good,Great place to learn technologies and partner with multiple teams.
good,Took inbound calls for customer who either placed orders or wants to place a order.Management was far and between but when they were around(during my shift) they were very helpful.The co-workers were very helpful if no one else was around and had a family oriented type atmosphere.The hardest part was the lack of help we would have if we had a decision to make unless a supervisor was there.The best thing was when the place was full of other people so that we were not bombarded with calls and management was there to help
good,"I love my job. I have been working for Williams Sonoma since 2003. The only reason why I want to leave this job is because now I have a college degree and want to get out of being a warehouse worker. I have way to many office skills to be working in a warehouse. I have a great relationship with my managers and coworkers, but I feel as if I didnt go to school to continue to work in a warehouse. Looking for something where I can excel"
good,I work for United agency not a full time or permanent worker. Is a good place to work but is slow production and not to many hours. Good benefits and management.
good,This Company Is Very Diverse ! I Enjoy Working And Being Able To Learn Different Things Almost At Any Pace And They Have Different Hours You Are Allowed To Work
good,Liked the job and management staff two many chatty women for my taste. Very knowledgeable but I was seasonal so I moved around to different departments.
good,The company paid well and goals were reasonable however there was toxic politics dividing the location while I was there. If those individuals have left it may well be a good location to work at.
good,"thats all. coworkers were great. the bosses who came to visit during the holidays did not keep the promise to get us another computer, and the computer system is very slow"
good,Very fast pace. Learning oppurtunities. A good diverse place to work. Friendly smiling employees. The only thing I have to say negative is there is no room to move up in the company.
good,It is a nice place to work if you like exercising. They have some really helpful and nice employees but a few are very hot tempered. Overall it's an okay place to work.
good,It wasn’t the best of jobs but it paid the bills. It was easy work nothing hard to do. Very laidback environment. Manager was not great people managers.
good,"This company was very disorganized. I had 4 different managers in less than a year. The training was also poor. I had furniture training twice, and both time the training software wasn't working."
good,Working for this company contributed to my growth and learning experience in the work force.  I learned quite a few things that I was able to implement and take forward to my current job.
good,Not a bad place to work. there is a point system so you are expected to be at work on time. The biggest reason for the high turnaround is attendance. It's a pretty easy going place to work depending on what your job is. The warehouse is NOT climate controlled so it is either very hot or very cold depending on the season. As far as management goes it's a little unorganized. When there's alot of work it gets swamped and there's alot of room for overtime if wanted.
good,"supervisors need to be more mature and prof. much friend and biased environment.   "
good,"At first, the company was ""do whatever it takes to please the customer"".  After 2 years of working, the policy was changed to ""it's too bad"" and associates were not able to help the customers. Therefore receive negative surveys that stay on your record, which you had no control over, since it was a company policy that you could not help the customer. Unfair policy!!"
good,"Its unfortunate that see that all the reasons that you were attracted to a company are slowly getting shifted to lower costs and offshore resources.  When a company is founded and preaches morals that are not followed, and you  become nothing but a number on a ledger sheet... it is disheartening to see what you worked so hard to build/establish get thrown by the wayside to support financial savings at the cost of quality and tenured employees.  When you literally walk up to the door and ask yourself "
good,it was a very well organized warehouse it would just be hectic on their peak seasons because that would require us to stay longer hours and they sell furniture so it was a lot of ware and tare on my body because some of their items could be heavy.
good,Worked as store manager with multiple employees.  Enjoyed the stores regular sales goal competitions which resulted in free cookware when met!  Great place to learn about cooking and the tools needed to go with it!
good,Harder than realized when first hired. Commission based selling is not for everyone and not everyone is good/great at up selling a lifestyle they personally do not participate in.
good,I enjoyed my time at williams sonoma. I gained alot of experiencej there. the conditions were ok and I gained alot of skills and assets that I can take elsewhere.
good,"Everyone has a different idea of how things should be done. The workplace isn't exempt. I do not agree with some of corporate's ideas of how they arrive at delegating work hours, or pushing credit cards, extracting emails, etc, from customers...but, there is most likely a reason for needing these items too. There are no clear cut training guidelines, however there is a ""Nordstrom's quality of salesmanship"" they would like us to uphold, which I find interesting.  Regional management can be very difficult on our store managers if the ""numbers aren't met"", which seems to not make any difference to him even if we only had 16 people in the store. In other words, not listening to the facts of the situation isn't helping to understand our particular store's dynamics. Aside from all of that, I do work with some wonderful people locally. We cover shifts for each other. We cook samples for the customers...and interact with them which is always fun and interesting. Explaining various tools of the trade is a great introduction and wonderful when you see a lightbulb go off in someone's eyes...and they ""get it""...and the next thing you know you are ""ringing them up"". The satisfaction of a return customer who asks for you personally, is golden. This brings such joy. What I have learned over the years, in all fairness, is to roll with the punches... and try not to take things too personally. Keep your cool and find the answers. The customer comes first. I've driven a receipt for a customer to Cayucos...and paid for a table runner for another customer, out of my own pocket for another, as our"
good,Williams-Sonoma has opportunities in many different fields.  I managed the business to business department in the call center.  I enjoyed my career with the company.
good,My job was to receive and access claims from Pottery Barn stores throughout the US  Sometimes the web sites has the incorrect information leading the sales person to order the wrong piece of furniture.  The workplace was difficult as there were too many crammed into a small work space.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly faces.
good,I moved a lot of furniture I learned how to drive a reach truck and cherry picker the management was nice and friendly the hardest part was lifting rugs  the thing I liked most was the people
good,"Pick up the different orders every day"
good,"slow pace, not enough work to keep everyone busy. When we came in sometimes we had to clean up unil work was ready. Not enough work sometimes peopl went home early."
good,It’s a job that pays the bills. I don’t really have nothing bad to say about this job just need to pay a little more money and a bigger raises and more vacation time
good,Great place to work for stability. Great benefits. Since I was only viewed as being in one position I felt unchallenged in my position which motivated me to leave. Travel was great early on. Management was mediocre and salary was not competitive with industry standards.
good,"comfortable but stressful at the same time. some managers are good some need improvement don't give enough raise for your job, but still recommended as good company worked there for 11 years."
good,"good work pace, pay is excellent. they take your hard work into consideration. discounts, vacation time, sick pay, management is nice, work pace is always changing"
good,good place but not good mangemet fast place to work and lots of work hurrys this plasce need a little bit more safty  and needs to where still toe boots and more saftyand
good,It is a good experience to work here but dont expect to advance. You will receive a lot on your plate at once with no assistance from anyone.  You will be expected to do more than you signed on for. The turn around rate here is crazy.
good,"I worked here for a few months, didn't get along with the management of the store, I felt that they didn't care about me. I worked there seasonally so perhaps they just didn't feel like getting to know me."
good,"I worked from home sometimes it was very difficult to get assistance when I needed it as I had to call the lead line or use Skype for help. I learned how to be a better customer service representative from the one on one coaching I received from my supervisor, I learned how to be an active listener as to make sure I can fully assist the customer to make sure I could meet the needs on the customer. Management was available when we needed them. Although I worked from home the company keep us included in all activities ans events. The hardest part about working for this company was not being able to get assistance fast enough. The most enjoyable part was the fact that they had VTO( volunteer time off ).and the fact that the work from home employees still had events so that we would still get to know each other."
good,"This was a work from home position which was a very good opportunity.  However, the job was a seasonal position.   I would recommend this job if someone is looking for seasonal work."
good,It was a great job fresh out of high school and would only recommend it to high school graduates entering college. It pays well and would be a nice lump of cash for spending or paying for bills and tuition.
good,"I only work there during the holidays, so I can't say what it would be like working as a full time, or part time job. Over all, I enjoyed working there."
good,Williams Sonoma was an easy but face pace job.I appreciated the fact that I didnt have my bossalways watching me..they trusted that I knew what i was doing
good,"Overall, I’ve enjoyed my time with company. I joined the team for holiday season and decided to stay on. The job is physically demanding, compensation is much too low for work performed."
good,"Not enough hours, not enough pay. Too many temps. You arrive at work and they have so many pallets a day and after that you get sent home. UI barely come home with 30 hours a week and cannot pay my bills. Good for a temp job but nothing full time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Williams-Sonoma because of the people I worked with, but I feel like the company is not run well and I often found myself questioning the decisions made by those in charge"
good,"When I was there, it was a fun place to work!  Great products!   Things have changed, and now its all about hitting numbers and store goals.  More concerned about that, than working with the guests."
good,"I never intended for the job to be permanent; I just needed to make some money for awhile. The pay was not great, but it was something and I needed a job. I found one more suited to what I was looking for and moved on. They sometimes sold sample products at really crazy low prices at the corporate office where I worked, so that was cool. Christmas was cool too; they would put names in drawings for merchandise."
good,The people I work with are great and you can’t beat the discount. You must be able to multi talk and be multi talented as this job can’t start with sales and end with stocking and dishes.
good,"Given the opportunity to be able to move and bid to other departments which helped with knowledge gain. Quick paced environment, and many hours. Good place to learn many skills."
good,"It is on the job training with no prior job training period.  You have to think on your feet, however,  It was a repetitive job so the more you did it the more  solidified you became."
good,"When I was originally hired at this position, I went in ready to work and make some holiday money.  My hours were cut almost all the time and the experience was not fun at all."
good,A typical day included processing quotes and merchandise orders. I learned how to use new systems. Management was excellent and kind. Workplace was relaxed with good coworkers. Nothing of the job was really hard. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers.
good,"Average Call Center Job "
good,"Upper management making poor decisions led to a stressful environment. Software used for work very old, as it is dos. Peak times had mandatory overtime."
good,"The management was fun to work for. It was fast paced, and seemed competitive. I enjoyed my time there, and learned some things in retail. I would recommend the to anyone seeking a retail job."
good,I really did enjoy working at Williams-Sonoma. Enjoyed talking to the clients and helping with their orders. People were friendly to work with and wished that it was more than a temporary job.
good,"I have learned a lot of thing in this workplace as for as machine work, photoshop, and adobe art."
good,"would like sufficient hours to maintain fully functioning stockroom.Typical retail establishment;when sales are down associate hours are down."
good,"I learned a lot from this company as being a leader and not a follower. It helped my lead skills in a lot of areas as, great production skills. And also helped me advance in my career."
good,You arrive and clock in on your computer and then log on to take customer service calls and sometime sale calls.  You were responsible to solve the problem or get help to solve the problem for the customer.
good,Was good work environment just was really a lack of training and the management isn't really on there job it's a good summer job to get some extra cash
good,"I have been at WS for almost 3 years and have been blessed with great management and growth opportunity. In terms of career development, I am very grateful for experience so far."
good,"A typical day at work involved me running interval checks on different products. I learned how to check for defects and make sure that they are corrected, document all incoming and outgoing materials and inventory. The management was good with communication and keeping a safe and fair work environment. The culture seemed pretty laid back but getting the job done as well. The hardest part of the job was standing in a stationary spot for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the other employees working like a well oiled machine."
good,"a normal day at Williams Sonoma was coming in and going straight to work. I knew it was serious when the leads never went a minute over in the morning meetings. the meetings consisted of information I needed to know to begin my tasks for the day .Once I got the information I needed from the leads I would then log into the computer and see what I should expect to come in and go out. after I consumed the numbers for the day I can start verifying and keeping records on incoming and outgoing shipments, prepare items for shipment, compare identifying information and counts, weighs, or measures items of incoming and outgoing shipments to verify information against bills of lading, invoices, orders, or other records."
good,work day and work place are balanced. Pay is good for the type of work required. Managers are nice and fair. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. Sales goals are fair.
good,This is a very tough and demanding job. You have to be able to work fast and lift heavy boxes. I feel that the workers should make more money for what they do.
good,"Wages are good.   "
good,"During holiday season, call volume is high, customers are rude, training not long enough. Schedules are silly. Attendence system is the only good thing about this company"
good,"Good place to work at flexible hours, great management, willing to train employees on everything in the warehouse. I learned how to drive the forklift and RF scanner here."
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company but in retrospect they are behind on a few key areas. "
good,"Williams Sonoma Inc is a good company to work for, although many locations have managers that don't hold true to the companies' thoughts and ideals.  kk"
good,usually the day start off knowing your daily tasks start up meetings and then you begin to hit the floor perform your job duties with your coworkers to get the job done
good,Company focuses on numbers of calls handled per hour with lip service in regards to actual customer service. Middle management is over-worked and under-paid - they drive away good workers and retain  low performers who do the bare minimum.
good,Management was inconsistently involved in operations which allowed  for divisions and groups of favoritism. Associates worked hard not often recognized.
good,Some management issues.  Pay increase needed.  Work schedules to include some weekends off.  More hourly wage increase for better employees.    Most enjoyable part of job was dealing with the customers.  Supervisors need training on treating staff members.  I learned a lot about customer service and sales and effectively communicating with clients.
good,Williams Sonoma is a good company that has good compensation and benefits.  Sometimes there is a lot of follow up required after hours and weekends but it is worth it.
good,"My job is one of the most important Jobs and with the help of Management it also makes my job easy to get the job done and great"
good,For the most part it was a great place to be. My job was fairly easy and management was easy to get along with. The hardest part was figuring out breaks.
good,Cool job but rhe hours was long 12 hour shifts 7days a week but the checks was nice and the work wasnt too hard but you have to be accustomed to working 12 hours
good,William Sonoma was a decent job. they gave out a lot of hours and the employees are amazing. i didn't like how during the holiday season we were required to work overtime every week. we either had to work on one of our days off or we had to work an additional 2 hours everyday.
good,Or was ok but the hours seemed long . it made the day very boring... I guess its an ok job to have though.breaks were short and we had quite a few off days.
good,production and fun working place...i work at the shipping receiving area..where trucks park at the dock...but recently the working hours have been short...not meeting the 40 hrs weekly requirement
good,"lack of hours, Over work in pick season. its a place full of people that act like they want to be your friend but really looking out for there self. If your new and they place you beside a person whos been there longer, its like they get a attitude cause they feel like there so called ""baby sitting"". I have herd many times that the employees and employers are very rude, and i found out first hand its true"
good,"Long, unorganized, working with others. Staying on task. Management isn't on one accord everything is last minute. The salary is good"
good,"very fun place to work and be productive, also creativity must be apply, must be organize and good work ethic is important to have."
good,fast pace warehouse. was working on the line and working with machines also. working with Christmas ornaments stamping letters on them with a print press.
good,"This is a company that I already reviewed on Indeed.com. Check out the other reviews."
good,"A typical day at work is opening the building for the employees and ensuring that all systems are properly working for a productive day at work.  I have learned to resolve customer and employee concerns.  In management, I have learned all aspects of managing supervisors and associates.  There is nothing hard about the job when you give 110% of effort in completing all tasks and willing to learn other duties.  I truly enjoy working with the people while establishing a trustworthy relationship as this enhances their willingness to perform at a high level."
good,Co-workers are eager to help and assist with onboarding in a friendly manner. Managers are open to conversation. Customers can be trying at times but also have customers who are so polite and kind they make your day.
good,"Warehouse, non- climate controlled environment. Therefore, when it's hot outside it's hot inside vice versa with cold. Extremely easy job. You will be standing the entire time so wear comfortable shoes."
good,A typical day at work was coming to work fully prepared ready to work. I have learned you have to work at a good paste and get a certain amount of thing done in a specific timing. Also my co-workers were very helping and caring.
good,Better left expressed in person to gauge a personal degree of this experience. My experience has not been unpleasant - yet not ideal.
good,"Great job however it was extremely hot during the summer months. The mangers and co-workers were very professional. Other than that I enjoyed working there, the hours were great and fit my personal life"
good,"However maintaining the store can be hard during the holidays, due to the amount of volume coming into the store. If you are looking for comparable pay, its ok for part-time, but can't live on it to maintain a home.  I love the store and the product, its great for part-time work and discount."
good,Fun atmosphere and lots of great added benefits.  Only con would be the hesitation to promote from within the company. Would've loved to have gone further up in the company if cutbacks weren't necessary.
good,Inbound call center. Just like any other call center. Management is fine. My co-workers are pretty nice. Hardest part of the job is getting fussed at by a customer over something you cannot control. Most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work from home.
good,Pottery Barn Kids has given me the opportunity to meet to new people and learn a new side of retail that I had not had as much experience before joining the organization.
good,"Very fast pace, but critical detailing is required. Co workers were very confident in their work. Manager was very involved. All repairs were easy instead of needle installation."
good,not able to talk how to talking to customers system not around when u need them coworkers ok sitting going home. it was not a good place to work management was not there to help when merchandise was late
good,"Surrounded by good, genuine people. Normal ills of a publicly traded retail company. What you would expect for size and industry."
good,"A day at work is undesirable, everyday is something new in customer service, you learn to keep a positive attitude no matter what the situation is,   the hardest part of the job is telling customers there order was not coming until after Christmas, my co-workers where so much help when i didn't know certain information, the most enjoyable part of the job is the environment i worked in, such positive and  outstanding customers i got to help."
good,A typical day for me is helping the customer place their orders and trying to track down their orders. I also check UPS delivery dates and if in home delivery when a customer should expect a call for delivery.
good,"The job was not the best and not the worst either. It was simple and laid back, but many of my co-workers were difficult to work with. I found the whole experience to be we rather depressing, as I prefer a more dynamic working environment."
good,"Once you get through training, you can forget about ever being coached effectively again.  If you do manage to get someone to help you, a tally is kept of how many times you seek assistance.  They claim they value customers, but all they really care about are stats."
good,fun place to work with supportive management. not all about the number but how personally grown and development. decent amount of  red tape but this is expected of a big company.
good,"The District manager was great, helped me get a position closer to my home.  The product was high class.  The Westchester is a very  very high end shopping experience."
good,not a constant hourly job. bad communication skills through out the company. however during peak if all you care bout is money and you have no kids this would be a great job for you. however; they careless about your outside life. they want they number and that's that.
good,"I worked for Williams-Sonoma for 10 years. A typical day would include answering calls from customers both domestically and internationally in regards to their orders, or placing an order for a customer."
good,Williams-Sonoma is a great company to work for. If you have a passion for the culinary arts or even just enjoy retail work this is the place for you.
good,"start-up meeting to inform everyone of the night ahead, then exercise to loosen up before the shift starts; associates were easy to  get along with, the hardest part about the job was  getting out of bed."
good,Managers and company was very understanding when it came to personal matters and for that I am very appreciative and worked even harder at my job. I learned what a team is working there after clocking in and doing warm up before a hard day at work. When work starts it was all about the customer/business and then we went home.
good,"Typical day started with production support tickets and then understanding the issue and fixing "
good,come in and clock in. then go to morning meetings which was given by the manager of what department you were in that day. then you would usually train several ppl while trying to reach your quota. i learned how to deal with hardship on the job. i learned how to deal with different types of ppl and attitudes and how not to let taht affect your work. i enjoyed meeting some of the ppl i did meet.
good,Managed new products sales for four separate catalogs in a busy call center environment.
good,"I enjoyed working down in the city."
good,"You work long hours but the pay is not worth the hard labor."
good,"Okay job for Warehouse work. Plenty of overtime. As far as Warehouse work the pay is a little above the norm, but the raises are far in between and not good at all. There also biased on who they give the higher raises too. You have to stand out and connect with the ""right people"" in order for them to notice you. If you're a quiet person, but do great work, you may still go un-noticed for your accomplishments. Also, they have there ""cliques"" if your in the right one you get away with a whole lot. And for some reason management turns a blind-eye to some of them (because the leads are in cliques too) That's a major downfall of this work environment. But overall its okay, because it paid the bills with all that OT."
good,Would assist customers in product selection and stock when needed.
good,I enjoyed my work. I learned pickin packing how to gift wrap. shipping and receiving. Management was good. Everybody was helpful to each other. The hardest part was the walking from one end of the warehouse to the other. It was a friendly place to work
good,did application over the phone for woman and children. pointing the client in the right direction for health insurance if they could not afford it
good,Answer phones; conduct customer service functions throughout the day. Management and co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job are when escalated customers call in. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with co-workers
good,At william Sonoma it was very simple and straight to the point i come in be greeted by staff and go and start my job. The co-workers were very nice and funny always made me laugh. The hardest about the job was putting the sales items in boxes because it had to be done in a certain way. Suffice to say the most enjoyable part was talking and laughing with the co-workers during closing time.
good,"pack christmas orders for shipping all over the U.S. we had to pick product on the line an pack"
good,It's was ok i really didn't like how they did things the people was ok i guess the management was fair.
good,Nice Atmosphere no drama. Only problem is that often the right hand NEVER knows what the left hand is doing. During the holiday season you can expect to deal with a lot of angry upset customers. Supervisors are seasonal so you really have to make sure you cover your bases if you are looking for permanent employment
good,A typical day with them is busy. There was never a day went by that you didnt enjoy yourself. the managers made sure you felt comfortable during the 10 or 12 hour shifts you did daily.
good,Very typical day. I learned how to properly pack boxes. The manager of the day did not allow us to stop working at our schedule times to get off after working twelve hour shifts.
good,The hardest part of this job is being there every morning at 5am and because it is not a climate controlled warehouse making sure you know what to wear to keep you comfortable. On a typical day the line is moving normally and everything needs to scanned in and placed in the correct location. Management is very understanding and easy to go to with problems.
good,"A typical day at work is balancing many aspects of the customer store experience. We cook everyday for customer sampling and demonstrations. You must have a love of cooking and food to be able to communicate effectively to customers. We also receive product daily and restock the floors. We also reorganize visual displays daily based on corporate direction and sell through. To balance a customer's store experience you must manage food sampling, inventory, and visual direction daily."
good,Not a bad firm to work for. Management is fairly reasonable in areas they are responsible for. They like to hire women so they don't have to pay them as much. I've become friends with some of my co-workers.
good,"This was another busy call center environment. It was a catalog call center. Time management was a must. I took sales calls as well as customer service calls on previous placed orders.The hardest part was that it was open 24/7 and it was very hard to balance school, my daughter and work."
good,Very busy during holiday season. Not very much training. You are on your own to learn as you go.  Discount was the only thing that was worth working there.
good,great to work from home.  Must be able to make decisions with little supervision.  Supervisors had too much work to really be of help. International customers felt like there problems were falling on deaf ears.
good,"Nice group of people, if you love food and get excited by pots and pans, then its the place for you. The manager was flexible and nice, but there weren't enough hours to go around. Nice environment"
good,"Help with unloading merchandise and putting them where they belong in a timely manner. A typical day at work for me is literally unloading boxes, putting the items in their marked spaces, and breaking down the boxes to throw away."
good,"It’s a great place to work at but the mandatory overtime and swapping the working schedule it’s a killer for some employees."
good,I really enjoyed the environment as well as the diversity of all the employees and managers. Williams Sonoma motivated me to strive for discipline and engaging people of all works of life
good,"Great company to work for, the employees are friendly smd helpful. My peers were helpful and friendly. Managers and Human Resource had an Open Door Policy."
good,it was a nice place to work they just didnt acknowledge when u doing your job or go the extra mile that they ask for in the begining also u have to set a appointment just to ask your boss/lead a question
good,It was a temporary and short work so there was not much interraction needed from my part. It was pleasant and friendly company. It was a good temporary job for me.
good,Working at Williams-Sonoma has been a wonderful experience meeting so many nice customers and helping them with their needs.  I was sorry that Williams-Sonoma decided not to renew the lease at Willow Grove.
good,"Very busy during the holidays and the company does its best to accomidate customers. Management tries to work with you if you have to take time off. *(I had a high risk pregnancy happening, so I needed to ask for time off.) They work off the point system that other call centers use so they do their best to work with you but can only do so much."
good,"It was a okay work place on days that we had work.. On night shift we barely finished the week with 20 hours, and once I proved I was a hard worker, they moved me to first shift where we worked more hours, but the pay rate dropped from 11.50 to 11.00 a hour."
good,This company challenges you as a person as well as the skills and characterizes you bring to the job. My manager was great and he was very fair to all of the associates. The company is not competitive to other companies in the area when it comes to compensation.
good,"needs more communication with associates and understanding better training,better management skills,better interaction with associates more pay more motivation"
good,Always remember to work your best. Have accurate friendly service . Customers are friendly . The store is pet friendly. The scenery around the store is beautiful. When you take your lunch break you can just let your mind at ease for the 30mins
good,"The job and atmosphere overall was great. I had no issues out of customers ever. All of the employees treated me very well and we're open and friendly. It was more so of the management that I had a problem with. They weren't so organized and they didn't really treat me with much respect. Although I kept it professional at all times, it was hard to work with a management that wasn't so easy to work with."
good,"Poor ability to give notice of information. Though it was stated employment can be terminated at any moment. Was let go within 5 minutes of notification; was told you are let go and everything was locked out. No room to stay on in the environment even with great metrics. Overall easy job, great customers and good direct leadership. Poor management by corporate side which leads to bad relations with employees. Decent pay and no benefits if your not lucky enough to be full-time."
good,"Williams-Sonoma is a great place to work if already have a job, and you are looking for a side gig. The pay is nice, but if you are looking for a full time 8 hours a day position this isnt the job for you."
good,"The people at the Call Center at The Colony, Tx, are really nice and helpful. Due to poor servicing the customers are mostly angry and unsatisfied. The idea of 'flex' schedule only means that the management can decide when or when not we will be working and it is not too flexible for the employee leaving no work/life balance."
good,"This was the first job I ever had working in a call center.  I looked forward to finishing the training and beginning to actually work.  The training was very good.  It lasted 5 weeks.  My instructor knew the system inside and out and was very good in helping those of us who were a bit slower than the others in the training class.  The training software had a number of glitches.  It did not always reflect the real results of searches and other order checking issues.  The software used in the call centers is about 30 years old.. an antiquated DOS based program.  Very cryptic, very unforgiving and not very much in the way of help.  That said, the Williams-Sonoma Knowledge Base is quite good although it takes time to find the information you really need unless you have been working with the system for months."
good,"Your coworkers and managers are great! But you simply do not get paid enough and feels more like a place to pass time. They are constantly trying to cut pay roll while constantly hiring more people.  Which means you'll never get full time benefits. There are sales goals, but no commission."
good,"While this is a good place for career advancement and to put on your resume, the day to day is overwhelming. Benefits are not competitive and work-life balance is not considered."
good,Great Shift. Low Pay. No Job Security. Day Shift. Off on weekends
good,"Williams Sonoma is large enough to have plenty of opportunities, but since the headquarters and the other corporate offices are not located in the same place, the disconnect can really create a strain on your job. The benefits are very good, and the best part about the job is the people you work with."
good,"-High paced call center"
good,I learned to pack boxes the correct way. The hardest part about it was it being really cold.
good,You receive 1 short break and a lunch for a 10-12 hr shift. Management and security is rude and not understanding. Pay is bad for the type of work that one must do and everything is very disorganized and not well structured. They keep you over your shift without asking or warning.
good,"The product is fantastic, which makes helping guests really easy... the product speaks pretty much for itself. The Store's Management inspires you to come to work. Everyone is super helpful and most people are great teachers. The hardest part of the job is standing for 8+ hours. I learned about space planning, in home consultations, interior design basics, color and texture compatibility."
good,"It's competive but fun and interesting "
good,"I was really excited to come work for Williams-Sonoma @ Washington Square Mall in Portland. When I meet the Management team I thought they were friendly people and I could learn a lot from them. I was hoping they were going to give me trainning and show me the ropes. However I was wrong, I was hired to be a culinary specilist and as soon as they hired me they put me on the floor as a sales rep. I wanted to learn more about the culinary side of Williiams-Sonoma instead I felt push to cell their products. Also Management was too busy GOSSIPING about their staff rather then being professional managers. The staff were nice ladies and I got along fine with them. But the Mangement people need to reread the manual on being professional and understand how to run there store!"
good,Picker
good,My Co-workers was the best we are always working together as a team.
good,"Great job for the discount. You are asked to reach for unattainable goals. Otherwise, great talking with the customers."
good,"Working at this company was an excellent opportunity unfortunately I had to leave due to transportation issues and scheduled work hours, but if I could I would love to have another opportunity to work for them."
good,Life and work balance. Hiring process is fairly simple and like any other company. Management and colleagues help each other out as a team. Training is provided.
good,"It was cool . Managers was great .. it’s a very neat building work was easy , we where on production productivity was fine , lots of hrs . Extra money ... pretty decent place to work .."
good,"I was seasonal. They had options to stay after the season if they liked you. Customers were sometimes a little crazy when things were scratched or ""priced too high""."
good,Good environment good work site everyone got alone it great to work at Clean around kind people lots of love that was shown the few months I were there
good,"Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities."
good,"I liked working there the atmosphere was nice and a lot of the work peers were nice and helpful too, but some of the leaders were clickish...only helped those they felt close to.  The managers were nice."
good,Was alot of people there the company do not care about good workers they will replace you. Its very limited parking unless u hoing ti walk 20mins. And very bad mouth people work there
good,"It would be strongly recommended that anyone considering working for this company ensure that they get the most thorough training possible.   "
good,"Laidback environment. Job responsibilities are not delegated equally among team members, which may cause work politics. I would say this company is good for those who have just graduated and looking for experience but not for long-term."
good,"You will deal with plenty of different situations working a William Sonoma. This is a very fast paced working environment. Management is decent, and overal, I rarely had any issues."
good,Loved working here but thought the communication. With customers regarding back order was horrible as customers weren't notified.   Getting help with a problem from a lead worker was awful as they ignore you.   Their monthly measurements are tough as customers refuse to leave the line if there is a problem until they receive their refund or replacement.   Backed up in email so much and are extremely picky a about numbers.   Most international orders are a mess.   Horrible way to do business.
good,"William Sonoma will always be hiring.  Peak is really busy, but after peak there are no hours.  Paid time off was good.  Opportunities for advancement if you knew the right people, but even then they don't want to pay well."
good,I loved the job ....but....the hours they wanted to hire me on permanently was the worst ever! There is no time for family/friends & some kind of life outside of work....
good,"I started out part-time at the sister company, West Elm, and loved the people to worked with.  "
good,It was a temp job and the assignment ended after peak season was over. It was only a few jobs that needed workers to stay. Over all it was an okay place to work.
good,"Good company to work for. Good company culture and co-workers."
good,"Excellent company. I felt I had corporate support when I needed it. I not only had a visual team, but had the right people in place who were happy and excelled at their jobs."
good,"There is little to no room to move up, not a lot of positions and every position is temporary. The people who work there are good, and the environment is great. The supervisors seem to be underqualified as some do not know work policies."
good,best job i have ever had it was easy and busy but i always had something to do i got hired thru an agency but if it was a more secure job i would still be there.
good,The job was usually a 10 hour work day with coworkers that were usually older than me and of a different race. The work day was pretty fast pace and time consuming because there were numerous orders to ship out daily.
good,"The position was seasonal, the job wasn't challenging or physically stressful. The hardest part was standing in one spot for 12 or more hours. The highlight for me was the ability to cross-train."
good,the typical day at work. I would have to say it pretty much the same as pottery barn. There actually the same company. Its just different items.the co-workers I had in William Sonoma . They were very good and hard workers as well as pottery barn. I like to know that I'm working with a strong team.
good,"Merchandise Processor  (QA) Quality Audit)  "
good,They send people to very good locations and the people who you work for are very helpful in terms of finding you a job that is temp to hire..
good,"a very fast paced environment. Enjoyed putting away merchandise."
good,"good job to work,easy, good pay,just hated the hours work temp. 5-4:30am slept all day till work but check was lovely"
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for. It needs better communication between the management and employees. Also there are very strict rules they say are for safety such as no music or cell phones because you cant hear the forklifts but they provide us with noise cancelling headphones to drown out machinery noise, so they can be contradictory. Also since the headquarters are in San Francisco you can feel out of touch with the upper management and your immediate supervisor can get away with not treating employees right"
good,"It is the good place to work with such a good management, my manager and other team members. I got to learn about the open source Selenium and Ruby."
good,"I liked working for this company, but the pay was low and the hours were unflexible."
good,muy buena empresa un excelente ambiente de trabajo
good,"I was able to work for this company and it provided some good job skills such as learning to inspect, work at a steady and fast pace when needed. the people I worked with made it a good environment."
good,"I just feel that they need to be more concerned about their employees  when it comes to emergencies, as people have emergencies that are beyond their control.  I was advised by the HR Director, that I should have waited to get the permission to move.  However I had to move when I did, and had to stay in a hotel for two weeks until the new house was ready to move in.  Smh, all about the company, but without your employees where would the company be, need to be more understanding of certain issues that are beyond the control."
good,If you want a job where they do not give you the necessary tools to do your job and don't care about you as human work for them. Great supervisors and staff though.
good,"Worked there, probably averaged out anywhere between 50-70 hours a week, the management there didnt allow for anything outside the guidelines coming to work, or dealing with outside problems outside of work. Never had any time outside of work to deal with any of them, i ended up leaving because i asked and asked the manager for time off but it was end of the quarter so i never recieved it for weeks, i was going through alot with a split up and getting stuff moved out of my home, i tried to take a day or two off to get everything handled that i was going through for acouple weeks and kept getting pushed to the side, so i left."
good,I loved working for Williams Sonoma. I was a seasonal employee....they wanted to hire me on but the hours offered were very unacceptable! The schedule they offered was:  Wednesday thru Sunday...11:00 am till 7:30 pm...gave no work/life balance!
good,It was a laid back atmosphere and a lot of fun. People I work with help each other out when there was situation came to be. The lunch breaks where an hour and that's awesome.
good,I enjoyed my job at Williams Spnoma and the people that I worked with.. There are people you have worked there for 35 years or more so it is a good place to work.
good,William Sonoma is a great company. Some days are more stressful than others but my manager is very caring and keeps us informed on whats going on and where we stand in the company.
good,the job was good the environment was safe and you could work well around others.I liked that you could bring idea's to the table and management would listen and consider employees ideas
good,"Fast paced, customer service oriented environment. Ongoing tasks lists including, visual changes, merchandising, return to vendor lists, mark out of stock lists, culinary activities classes, Working with customers to provide solutions to their in home decor, culinary, and appliance needs. Placement of orders, and follow-up regarding online orders and deliveries. In home consultations, demonstrations, and return to learn opportunities. Banking duties, preparing deposits, closing registers, change orders, night drops at the bank. Filing, supervising the associates in their daily tasks. Attending teleconferences, ongoing development classes, and on-boarding new hires. Acquired prioritization, and time management skills. Ability to delegate tasks successfully, and navigate through a wide variety of customer service issues. Worked with a long list of general managers, turn over rate was very high. talent was transferred out of our location rather rapidly. Resulting in a culture of discontent, uncertainty, and unrest among seasoned associates. The most challenging part of the job was juggling some of the daily tasks versus the payroll and work load within the allotted time provided. This often required some very creative solutions in order to achieve successful results. The customers themselves were the most enjoyable part of the job, and this was closely followed by some of the individuals that I worked with, their experiences and points of view were instructive in my success at this location. I also love kitchen appliances and tools, so exposure to new ways of preparing meals, and"
good,The scdules are different and the machines are very easy to operate.The trainers are friendly and helpful.The insurance is great.The paid vacation and PTO time is wonderful when you first start.

good,Over the years Its have been a fun place to work learning new skills that will allow me to use elsewhere.However there  not a lot of room for advance.
good,"Whatever was asked me, I did it in an efficient manner. Every task that was thrown my way, I accomplished it. I was very optimistic about learning new things."
good,"Having a position with Williams-Sonoma is just a retail job, simply put.  You'll stock shelves, run a cash register, work with customers, etc.  You won't be finding a career, but the workplace culture is welcoming and you'll never do quite the same thing every shift."
good,"Very fun company to work for! It can sometimes be a little fast pace. shoppers are friendly , and the companies products are amazing."

good,I worked at William Sonoma during peak season for extra money and it was just what I needed. They had nice lunches and it’s very laid back with a variety of schedules you could work.
good,"fast paced, lots of stocking and cleaning."
good,"I was hired to answer angry customer service calls, and it just wasn't meant for me. I lagged behind everyone else in training and was on the verge of tears the first day we were put on the phones. I'd love to work for the company again because the benefits and staff were great, but maybe just for corporate instead."
good,"They work hard building furniture that we need to be shipped out the next day to those who have purchased furniture, either in the store at William Sonoma, or on the website."
good,"Management needs to care more about their employees. Just don't plan on being sick, points add up if you stay out of work & don't have a doctor's note."
good,"Great until I got terminated ...my supervisor  was unfair, but i'm not stressing it was just warehouse job.  >>> NOT like I planned on being there my whole life anyways."
good,"Williams-Sonoma was a great place to work, It didn't really have any benefits. It was a great environment. You meet new people and the job was simple and easy."
good,"Plentiful positions available and opportunities for advancement.  I enjoyed the work I did; however, the hours were long and crucial during peak season.  They have alternating shifts and have plenty of overtime during peak season."
good,"A Typical day at Williams Sonoma included working with a lot of other employees packing and shipping Williams Sonoma products, The hardest part of my job was standing on the hard ground all day long"

good,"Its a great place to work, great team, management is okay "
good,Williams-Sonoma is a very success company that treats all their employees with respect. They care about each customer. The most enjoyable part of my eday is knowing that I made all the customers happy and I did my very best. The hardest part would be working the long hours. My co-workers are hard working individuals taht also have the work goals that I have.
good,"A typical day at work was answering call after call and entering things into the system to help customers return, exchange, and/or buy product from a catalog or website. I learned I am very good at talking down escalated people and can let any bad things said roll off my back so I can help the customers to the best of my abilities."
good,Williams Sonoma is a very organized and well structured company to work for. Management addresses problems in a timely fashion and has a very strict safety program.
good,"This was a good place to work and you meet a lot of people.  This company allowed me to meet an array of people of all cultures, we cooked and had different cooking classes often.  The company is no longer in business here."
good,"fun work environment, supervisors would have contest for free gifts. we went on field trips and had pot luck days with our team every month. ......................"

good,"Assisted customers, answered questions , wrapped gifts for customers, answered telephone and straightened up"
good,"This job is great job for a warehouse , team player , team meeting, shift you want to work and growing team player, goals you want to achieve you can working with Williams Sonoma."
good,"The warehouse was very hot. I would recommend bringing water and a fan. The hours can be very long and hard to endure, especially if you're night shift. I would recommend comfortable shoes you wouldn't mind standing 12 hours in."
good,It was great for the first job for me and I actually liked it. There's nothing more than it was an okay job but I wouldn't return their because that's behind me now.
good,Come in too work ready too push your line and make your production for that day .. I also scanned items that was boxed before they got shipped out too the customer
good,"management does not communicate with coordinators "
good,"I stock shelves, help people find what they are looking for, and clean the store. I have learned how to interact properly in a professional environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with tough people. I really enjoy meeting new people and learning how to deal with tough customers."
good,"Although I'm a temp, for simos I get high praises from their client williams sonoma.It's a fun place to work and I enjoy my assignment I'm one of the few people they ask for during their peak season. And I enjoy the bonuses they include the temps, in. I am respected by the managers I work with."
good,it was not equal...love my job their...hard work...helping other out..end of quarter rush time...going to work and meeting people..
good,"They, the supervisors, strive to make it a fun workplace as well. Holds an annual employee's rally, sponsored by the Company which includes a presentation by different vendors and their products. Prizes are given away, and food samples."
good,william sonoma it was a good place to work all managers were nice and helpful.
good,"This was a seasonal opportunity. This is a job not a career. A typical day at work is like any customer service job. I learned that major issues regarding your request on your behalf may go unanswered, which is uneasy especially when you provide them with proper information. The most enjoyable thing is  you work from home."
good,Overall a great place to work. Discount on products.  A very nice Luxury brand and love their products.  Enjoyed teaching classes there & the clients.
good,"It’s a company that will provide a solid structure for people just out of school or new to the country. However it does not provide much room for growth, hence it is very difficult for an employee to improve his/her living conditions."
good,William - Sonoma is a great part time job for students and house wives but due to the company being seasonal it does not provide a steady flow of income during the slow seasons.
good,"I loved this company always threw parties. They also have us snacks during the Christmas season. It's a great company to work for , just has a high turnover rate."
good,Working at Williams Sonoma was great. I learned how to work as a team and with less supervison. Our management was not the best best. My co-workers were fun to work with we always got along and got whatever job we needed to get done. The hardest part of the job was staying over time after having a very long day at work. The most emjoable part of the job accoplishing work goals and finishing the jobs that needed to be done.
good,It was a great place to work at in the beginning.  I had many good-great years there.  Then the founder passed away after celebrating his 100th Birthday.
good,"Management should be better, they have low communication skills. They feed you every now and then. Some dats we have work and some day we don’t have.."
good,I love the people I work with and I love the products. It is quite competitive with a few of the workers since we have hourly quotas that we need to hit. Our current management is where the toxicity lies in our store but our GM just quit for another opportunity and I am hopeful that our next GM will be much more professional than our current manager.
good,"Inbound calls from Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, and Pottery Barn Kids. "
good,Helping customers out with any questions they may have for the items in the store. First time operating a register. Co workers were nice and cheerful.
good,"Great products.  Solid and beautiful concepts. Store is lovely and well laid out. Bad follow through. High level seems fine, execution in actual stores is lacking.  Every day has a different goal. Long term strategy isn't communicated to front line employees.  Culture of fear leads to super high turn over."
good,Its a good company to work for. I was able to move to different departments within the company and learn many new skills
good,"This job is unlike any other retailer I know. This isn't for someone who likes to stand behind the cash register. Instead, you are required to lift heavy things and move them around the store. Other than that, it can be a fun place to work."
good,"Agressive merchandising for the distritct, travel, DIY approach to visual elements."
good,I really enjoy teaching the classes. Wish I was valued more.
good,was a seasonal job wood have liked to become permant. would have liked to be in managment but the company did not realize what a great employee they had in me and my experience in managment.
good,"Working the second shift of a distribution center isn't as bad as it might sound. There are many perks to it, such as a free daytime, a change of weekend, and an easier schedule. The problem isn't so much the job but the management that oversees it. Once upon a time we had managers that would actively seek to see how they could help you, would actually join you shoulder to shoulder doing the work that needed to be done, and would be all around great people to work with. Now, it's quite the opposite. Numerous times the people on second shift have been assaulted with thinly-veiled threats of termination. Current management is simply incompetent. To top it off, there really isn't room to move up in the company. All managers are outside hires, none coming from the floor grunts. More often than not our motivation to do better is not so much for our benefit but more because we have to keep our jobs, even though our production levels are over 100% across the board."
good,"A typical day at work went by smooth an fun. I learned alot of new things everyday. The management was very understanding. My co-workers were very easy going an great team work,very competitive. There really wasnt any hard part, i am a fast learner. The most enjoyable part was getting work done on time an getting thingsd done."
good,Working at William Sonoma is very rewarding if your a people’s person.  I love the interaction of the employees as well as the customers.  The manager is awesome and it’s just a nice place to work at.
good,"I loved working for WSI because of the products and the type of customers  "
good,"The company name speaks for itself  it is a great and reliable brand. But the lack of structure within the individual stores themselves is something that needs improvement and it all falls on the lack of management in the stores. Time after time employees have had to take charge over the current management just to keep progress moving. A company that promises to higher within and build growth within the company  seems to be lacking on just that. They like to higher from outside to bring ""New ideas in""  But over all it is a good company to work for as you try to find a reliable career"
good,"Wish the pay were higher. It could always be worse, so I am grateful. There is room for advancement. I have to admit that they show appreciation toward employees."
good,"I learned so much about different cooking tools and their uses, I also learned how to properly wrap gifts by williams-sonoma method. which can also be used in everyday life"
good,their a great company and under paid for the amount of work you do managers never around so other than that it is a good company with benefits and discounts. Managers never available had at stay home job no help made calls on my own doing managers job and customer service you can never get a manager on the phone assist but even though that was an obstacle I made sure my customers we happy at the end of the call Management needs to be change with new people and positive at that.
good,It had a great atmosphere. Family based managers. Very understanding staff. Great pay with the option to get overtime when extra worker is available..
good,"The pace was too high for the amount of pay they offered, and while having a newborn child and family, I needed more pay and flexibility with my hours."
good,"The job was busy, long hours, a lot of overtime. The company allows you to learn new task, because the work load is very heavy. Great place to work doing peak season. Other employees say that is is not busy when peak season ends"
good,"fun place to work"
good,Williams Sonoma has amazing employees and vendors with a great heritage. It is a fast-paced environment that can mean low work life balance. Generous discount and competitive perks.
good,The AS400 system was a little outdated. Great company to work for. I worked from home for about 4 months but i received a better job offer in Feb 2016.
good,"In the beginning Williams Sonoma was the place to work we had a amazing manager who made sure that we was the best in some many ways its crazy. Present time I don't think the current manager n"
good,Everyone gets along here. The management could be a little more lively but other than that its a great environment to work in as a part-time associate
good,Great job for entry level phone reps seeking to be told what to think and do. You either fit in or you don't and they will let you know if you do not.
good,"during the peak season, there is so much to do that it makes the day go by fast. I love all the things they carry in the store, something new comes in all the time. There's a great sense of team work with everyone."
good,OK place to work they only hire temporary people no job security only if you are permanent. The company could do better with their training; you have to learn as you go along. No formal training is provided
good,"Bland building with desk that you could not do anything at. Never had enough or correct seating. Some of the co-workers were friendly while others were rude. Customers called and yelled because of things the previous representative has said or done. The managers do absolutely nothing, they can be sitting at there at their desk and a customer can ask for one and they would say no even if they aren't doing anything but running their mouths."
good,"Training, running reports, pulling numbers, quality assurance, coaching, assigning workloads, holding meetings, creating manuals, assist with escalted calls."
good,"Working with people on a daily basis and enjoying the company of my co-workers, the pay is not the best but the benefits are ok. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are very escalated, and not being able to make them happy."
good,"When I first got to Williams sonoma they didn't show me the ropes of anything and I was constantly confused and needed to learn everything on my own. While in the process of learning all the new things around me and how I get around I would get yelled at a lot by the managers on the floor, even if I was helping out a customer."
good,Williams-Sonoma is an excellent company to work for that cares about their customers and associates. I would prefer to discuss in person my previous work experiences.
good,"A typical day at work was usually busy with lots of tasks to be done. I learned how to use the cash register, use a PDT, work my way in the back of the house to look for items for customers, do send sales, mark sale items down, etc. "
good,"I created a wonderful place in the community for friends to gather, learn and cook together. We incorporated products and recipes to enhance people's lives a home. Providing exemplary service was a priority and no one was refused a return for unsatisfaction."
good,"Helping the customers answer any questions about an certain product or if they are looking for anything specific. I learned a lot about all the different types of kitchen utensils. The hardest part of this job was, well not really th hardest, but something I had difficult with is trying to gift wrap, I could never get that right."
good,"The training was very helpful and detailed . The system that is used caused delayed , as long has you have the right rebooting techniques everything thing will be easy."
good,Williams Sonoma is a furniture and appliance manufacturer and distributor. The warehouse I worked in was over a million square feet. It also paid for employees to be healthy. If you lose at least one pound a month you keep getting the bonus. Pretty sweet incentive...
good,This is a production work place where you have to work in a timely manner (fast pace).  The job requires long hours a day and usually require a person work with others.
good,I enjoyed working here for the holiday season. I enjoyed my coworkers and helping the customers. Only down fall is that I wasn't really trained on the job. So I didn't know a lot about some of the products and sales I had to continuously ask questions. The job could get a little stressful with all the customers coming in at once buying holiday gifts. And also sometimes restocking the store could take forever.
good,Williams Sonoma is a great company but working from home for the company was very stressful with long hours.  The management team were not direct and nonexistent to the staff.  The training courses did not teach you much about what to do when a customer calls and how to further help the customer.  Speaking to your supervisor was limited to none and was very annoyed when you were trying to answering just a simple question.The most enjoyable part of the William Sonoma job was being able to be home while working and helping out customers.
good,the place is a nice place to work.  Work / Life is kinda stressful the first couple of month but other that work is really nice.   My supervisors have all been pretty great I am on my second one.
good,"This was a seasonal position, during the holidays, which can be a fast-paced environment for sure. There was plenty of work to do, and also at this location, you had to take heavy items (on a cart) out to the customer's car (there was valet close to the store)."
good,"I worked 12 hours a day, in a noisy warehouse environment, trying to train new-hires. HR failed at every turn. Who was supposed to be here? We don't know. Do they have ID badges? We are not sure. It was a cluster from the start."
good,very easy job trained very well pays wonderful less stressful the most enjoyable part at william sonoma is winning gifts and helping families/ childeren get their gifts on time
good,"I enjoyed my time at Williams Sonoma. I worked in the back stockroom so it was labor intense work. The other employees were knowledgeable and fun. If they compensation was fair to the type of work I did, I would have stayed"
good,William Sonoma is a great company that sells great products. The staff in management are fair and understanding. Pretty much all jobs there are dead end with no where to progress after hitting management.
good,"My experience with this company was ok. It was very busy, mentally demanding and stressful at times, but there were plenty of hours. Also the pay wasn't all that bad, so when the paycheck came it seemed to kinda even out."
good,A typical day at work wasn't too busy and not too slow. Something to keep a nice pace going with steady customers coming in to buy goods. The hardest part of the job is going up and down stairs and the most enjoyable part of the job was water breaks and management bringing in food for the employees.
good,"A day at work consist of taking call after call helping customers with resolving complaints or placing an order."
good,Its a big company that has good ideas but do to poor management it isnt always executed properly. Also your not always given what you need to do your job
good,I started off as an operator and ended as a damage clerk .A damage clerk watch over every piece that was distributing in and out of the warehousing. And also did customer service.
good,They are a great company to work and start with. I learned a lot of new skills while working here before becoming an on site.  Id say the best thing was the ppl and benefits.  Lovely company
good,Customer reviews mean everything even though the employee must follow company policies that aren’t popular with customers.  The employee gets rated based on how the customer feels about the policy instead of the employee’s service provided..
good,Easy paste job Easy to multitask hard part is getting up!I like the work environment and the workers are very helpful!If I could I would like to return there
good,The Sutter Street facility is currently going through significant changes.  The facility has new leadership at the EVP level and major changes are being implemented.
good,"If your into call center environment it’s ok.  They do not pay well enough to get a one bedroom apartment in Vegas though, while the 40% discount is nice, still unaffordable"
good,"Working at this company was a mostly positive experience. The varying types of staff was a positive aspect of this workplace, from local mothers to international students."
good,"Is a good place to have a sales experience."
good,William sonoma is a warehouse. It has different section of job where you apply from a office or directly from the company. No control weather. Alot of hours but not enough breaks
good,"The management when I arrived was wonderful, i fit right in immediately. My tasks where to receive and stock the back room. organizational skills are needed to to this job."
good,"Friendly atmosphere "
good,My manger was great at explaining my job duties and fully explained what needed to be done when any questions I may have had. I felt very comfortable with my co-workers and enjoyed the overall work experience.
good,"Very busy during the holiday seasons. Has its ups and downs. The stock room is very cluttered so it is hard to find things sometimes when you are in a hurry or a customer is in a hurry but the floor is very organized and easy for customers to find things. You need a good bit of knowledge to work there because of all the kitchen electronics, pots/pans and the knives. Customers ask alot of questions about them products. It is an overall good place to work if you like fast paced"
good,"A typical day at work includes running reports in the morning.  Then I have to attend a few meetings throughout the day.  I love the people I work with, they're all great.  The hardest part of my job is multi tasking.  I'm basically doing about 4 to 5 roles in this one position.  I have too much work to do because things are not automated and I don't feel like the management team listens to their technical experts on technical advise.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I do like being the only person people turn to for expertise in the area I do work in.  I'm the guru in my area.  I don't like that I'm not compensated enough for the work I do."
good,I enjoyed working at William sonoma it was a very good we organized warehouse didn’t have to work long hard hours we worked out 8 hours sometimes over and got the job done
good,I moved around a lot. I learned how to program the scan gun.  Learned to scan boxes and print labels. I learned to change the priority of the boxes. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"not a bad company to work for, some bad experiences with the management but that changes from store to store, the company as a whole is a great one to work for!"
good,"They have gone away from caring about their employee' and has focused more on numbers and the bottom line, profits...............no complaints from me."
good,williams sonama is a great place to work especially for the seasonal time to earn more money for the holidays. the hours are long but the one hour break they give you really helps with getting throughthe work load.
good,"rWilliams-Sonoma’s IT department is constantly being challenged to improve the customer experience on its e-commerce sites and retail stores, fulfilling orders quicker, streamline supply chain processes and optimize inventory."
good,Tough environment to work in due to demographics in the area. With having to control payroll in a structured company the daily tasks of the job remain difficult.
good,"I consider lucky to work with the company, providing exceptional opportunity to learn new technologies. The managers have the flawless operation of where want the company to go. Definitely would recommend for starters looking to make a career in IT."
good,It is what it is. I was working as a holiday hire and I knew I'm just there is sell and be as productive as I can be. Luckily the Manager was great and he was very flexible as long as I did my job and I liked that. I'd recommend it.
good,"A typical day at Wlliams Sonoma was fast paced as usual. It was hard work but only if you made it hard. In some areas it can require team work but normally, its usual something simple like working a machine. Management was great. Hardest thing is finding a pallet jack but besides that it's n enjoyable job."
good,"The company needs t put more thought & money into its stores for an easier,smoother & more efficient work environment. Also note the changes in the company's policy for many things makes it hard to achieve good customer service while protecting the policy of the company."
good,WS is a great company to work for if you want to purchase items for  have beautiful things and the discounts are great.  it is also a good way to meet new people.
good,"for the most part working there was very productive and fast paste, this job required skills that may mean quick learning or to catch on quick but other then that i enjoyed my work there"
good,"ALot of movement "
good,"The upper management in that call center has gone through drastic changes over the last 2 years creating a much more stressful work culture and environment. The job parameters also seemed to undergo changes from time to time, usually to add more responsibility for the same rate of pay."
good,"It was fun and easy we did fitness and provided excellent customer service.                                                                                                                                    "
good,"The work was interesting and fast paced."
good,"I've enjoyed working in this company and creating visually appealing spaces for our clients. I would recommend working at Pottery Barn, except there is no room for advancement. The employees at my particular store and the management are great."
good,"They had fun competitions to win money witch made work fun!!! They  also gave me all the hours I wanted. Although it was seasonal, I really wish i was full time."
good,WS Inc is a very people first company with great incentives to excel. They do expect and extreme amount of work from their managers leaving little time for Work life balance. The management structure is shrinking which cause smaller stores to operate on less hours with more to do. Be prepared to work 60 plus hours per week.
good,The environment was amazing and my coworkers and store manager were the best! Learned a lot and worked with some talented people. Working at the store until the end of its physical store days was emotional.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity: I was able to sell, manage and lead in areas that were specific to my job title. I learned how to better be a manager through encouraging others to sell. My managers were hands-on and very willing to teach what I didn't know or understand. A typical day at work was spent checking to be sure the daily in house audit was performed."
good,"Hours are getting cut 10 hours per week. I used to enjoy walking in the office and now its so blah, uninviting. The moral is low and with the company cutting hours it is not getting any better."
good,Great place to work if you like to cook and share cooking ideas with others. Management and employees were all great to work with and friendly. The hardest part of the job was saving all the food samples for the guests which was also the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,It was always fun to go to work with others. I learn that my job was very important to the pickers. the management was great there. the work culture was great to work inside and not outdoors. the hardest part of the job was not going to work. I get to show others how easy they can make their job.
good,"work place is good but the store is a low revenue store and I am looking to expand."
good,I helped customer select kitchen gadgets and appliances for their house. I also assisted the chef in the cooking classes. We had special classes for guests to come in and try new recipes. We would draw a crowd and make it an experience that every guest could appreciate.
good,Simple work. I enjoyed each interaction that I shared with the customers. Even the unpleasant interactions. And the simplicity of the work was an extra push to get you in and going.
good,Great outstanding job with great benefits.I learned how to use an RF scan gun at a fast paced. The management was great always respectful.The most great part I enjoyed on the job is getting played every week for it to be a full time position.
good,"It's just like any warehouse, show up do your job and everything will be fine. Put in hard work and get your projects done in a timely manner and management is satisfied."
good,"William -Sonoma is a great cs job. I enjoy working there it's productive and fun. The people I work with are good people to work with, with a friendly environment"
good,"Lots Of Drawings, Give Aways, Everyone Around Is Very Helpful. Seems Really Hard In Training. But Its Definitely Much Easier Once You Get On The Floor."
good,I liked it untill new management came in and made a lot of changes. The work was very easy. Management made work harder than what it had to be. so i had to leave.
good,It was fun while it lasted! I enjoyed the coworkers and the work atmosphere. I wish it was a permanent position. Most days were very busy because of the holiday season
good,Williams Sonoma Inc has a rich history and a reputation for good quality. The thing that keeps me attached are the people I work with and the team that has stuck through many hardships over the past few years. An incredible group of people all with many talents and skills help make my career with William Sonoma what it is.
good,"Let's start with this - I hate capitalism and the ""customer is always right"" social expectation we have. The customers are terrible - most of them being the very special type of over-privledged a-holes I really don't like. So there was that. Management wasn't the kindest to my department - they would go on the normal ""we appreciate you and your hard work"" shindigs, and then do things like juggle my team around 4 different supervisors in 3 months. It was terrible, and I could never rely on what was expected of me due to the constant change in supervisors. So there was that as well. Overall... Too stressful, and management did more to make things harder than actually helping us with doing out jobs. "
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with thoroughly. Met some wonderful people and learned so much about sales and merchandising.  The dicount was great too.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and delelop. Decent amount of red tape and politics
good,"Unfortunately, after several changes in corporate leadership the company is beginning to take on water.  Stores are finding it almost impossible to complete daily tasks with the number of hours they are given.  Store management team tries desperately to pick up the slack but can only juggle the balls for so long."
good,"Valued employees. The only downfall were the constant layoffs. After my 3rd layoff, I decided to apply for another job."
good,Great Company and fast paced work environment. Staff is customer service oriented and always full of great product knowledge.
good,"Too much concern about making the days figures and not enough attention to training the sales force. Can be stressful. Employees have to do stock work as well as sales. Lots of going up and down stairs to get merchandise for customers. "
good,lots of people gave support and directed me to the write position to further my career .  Great team work friendly people They give good raises..
good,Versant is very compliant when it comes to job placement. I have been working for them consistently for over three years now. They are great when it comes to job placements and assignment.
good,"Working for Williams-Sonma, Inc. provided the perfect experience for fast paced customer service training.  Working one holiday season alone is enough to teach you how to keep a calm head when all around you seems like chaos. You are given the tools to learn and expand your expertise at every turn."
good,"Strong customer service and sales focused leadership teams.  The executive team is committed to strengthening share holder value in all that we do.  "
good,This company strongly abide by their culture. Lacks in management with overall employees. The benefits package is excellent. They do try to seek above and beyond employees.
good,"Very professional place to work. I worked from home, so it made everything Flexible. It was a seasonal position."
good,"Answering phones constantly listening to customers whether happy or not. Worked on a DOS system"
good,"The job description is simple. Help customers with any concerns they may have, regarding returns, purchases, related questions, etc. The problem is maybe a blessing and a curse. After 4 weeks of excellent training, I was on the call center floor for a month or so before I ever met a boss. I felt as though I was coming to some weird, hated prison for a month straight before I finally got my turn to meet my supposed ""floor supervisor"". "
good,Its a pretty good place to work for and the job is easy its good for a first job.
good,"Wonderful company to work for, flexible hours, good pay, great employee discount and just plain fun.  Also having great confidence in the products you are selling to your customers."
good,I love during inventory and Quality control because it very excited knowing that am the work have to make sure all item are correct in the computer and making all item are meet the quotas for daily and we all work as a team player.
good,the job was only seasonal but it was a good experience. management encourage you to do good work.
good,A lot of work. Learned negotiating is part of corporate world. Management have a lot on their plate. Co-workers friendly. Hardest- navigating gray areas in policies. Enjoyable- saving company money and helping customers.
good,sales during the holiday is stressful and busy. William Sonoma does a good job at trying to keep the work place a fun place although putting a lot of pressure on the employees behind the scenes.
good,"Come in get your stack of work(depending on area), Place your sheets in the bin, and use the rollers to move bin to bin. I've learned to use bumblebee guns, and the importance of helping. Management was friendly and strict at the same time. Everyone was friendly and easy going. There wasn't a hard part to me, and I enjoyed going to work each day cause of my peers."
good,I enjoyed working in both buildings. We had three breaks. We finish our work on time. We had to do mandatory overtime.
good,we work hard and long hour but i love working there wouldnt mind going back
good,"Exciting new work place, nice managers and co-workers. Not a hard job in my description."
good,"A company where people who want to learn and grow, work together to create an atmosphere that lends itself to learning, growing and having fun."
good,The hours were perfect and the people were great to work with
good,"Every day brings something new. A wide variety of customers from someone who is just setting up their first home to the experienced cook looking to upgrade their kitchens. "
good,"typical day at williams and sonoma started at 6 as we move carpets and boxes into designated trucks for delivery. A normal day we would move 10,000 units at minimum. Our supervisors were easy to get along with, as long as work gets done. There werent any hard parts about the job, just went in and did the job."
good,Worked with many great people and learned a lot about e-commerce.
good,Good work environment. Temperature was a problem at times. Great co-workers. Everyone got alone.
good,"I pride myself on having superior communication skills, and thoroughly enjoy a client service-based work environment. Williams-Sonoma provides this opportunity and is a great company to work for."
good,Shift started at pm to 2 am giving the option to stay until 4 am to receive overtime was a plus. Learning new training skill to be able to complete different task.
good,"The work environment at WS depends on the store manager. Metrics are a high priority, and meeting sales goals influences how many hours you get scheduled. There's a steep initial learning curve because there are so many types of products that require extensive knowledge to sell correctly, and you have to push the store credit card hard. The employee discount is okay, but products are still priced too high for employees to afford on hourly pay except on clearance. It's a high-end store, and customers often behave accordingly. Making sales goals depends on the ability to learn all the products and developing rapport and trust with customers."
good,"The job was ok if you’re not afraid of heights and raccoons. Great benefits!! It’s really hard to get fired, they really work with you. If you like working in a warehouse it’s cool."
good,"Great company if you're looking for a part-time job and get your feet wet in retail.  I love their discount, and the people I work with.  Sometimes it can get a bit busy but not bad."
good,Warehousing wasnt my thing.  But I enjoyed and begin to like it pretty well.  Something i would love to try again.  But the environment was mutual just like amy other.
good,This job was a wonderful experience. Here I learned valuable lessons about integrity and responsibility. I was able to see a substantial number of currency.
good,Williams and Sonoma was a very nice place to work. although I was only working their through a temp agency I enjoyed working in the warehouse environment.
good,By taking people from there schedule job and placing them in other by not scheduling enough employee to work in all areas superviser do not no how to talk to management about problem so it could ge easyer to work together
good,"Starting off as a temp at Williams-Sonoma the plan was not long term to begin with.  After two years as a temp I became permanent. I made that decision because of benefits, experience, and I was seeking for a job at the time. This was an opportunity for me. I am searching for something less stressful and a job with the opportunity for promotion."
good,The typical day at work involves organization and communication with the photo team to get the plan of action for the days photoshoot. I learned many photo terms along with working with multiple people and different attitudes in a harmonious way. The hardest part of the job has to be the tracking down of samples. Multiple people touch photo samples so things get damaged or put away incorrectly so it us up to you the merch. coordinator to problem solve as in find it or fix it before the team needs item on set. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Great attitudes many faces and the ability to make great friendships with people that have many stories to tell.
good,I am assuming because of the holiday rush we were all put through fast training. Unfortunately that left us without a lot of communication with supervisor & or management.
good,I was an work from home agent we provided our on equipment to perform work duties they should at least provide headset and cell phone management could be more on employee window for help
good,"I learned how to read the SKU numbers and how to operate in a stockroom environment."
good,Williams Sonoma is a cool job to work and sometimes fun. A lot of flirtatious people here ! The work extremely easy but boring . I usually work here only during peak season .
good,a typical day of work consisted of selling of products and ringing up customers. Knowledge of the products was a must and suggestive selling was required. I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with.
good,"Overall working here was nice. Most days weren't too stressful and for the most part management was good. some days you might get bored and some days are high traffic and stressful. My negatives of working here included being underpaid/not getting a fair raise, management tried to get me to skip college classes, and you're scolded if you don't get enough emails/credit cards."
good,"I only worked here for 4 months and left for a full time job elsewhere."
good,Shipping and receiving. Unboxing and new and products. Assisting with customer sales and answering phone calls. The hardest part was lifting the furniture for visual floor resets.
good,I was only a seasonal employee but while I was there the coworkers were awesome and the relaxed atmosphere was very nice. Also the discount was very nice if you are into cooking.
good,Working at williams sonoma has been a great opportunity  for me. I have learned to be self motivated and set a great standard for myself which has helped me to be  better person in the customer service industry
good,this is a good company to work for also had work from home only thing is they don't pay enough for what  is expected they do provide a lot of over time around holidays  not great management only out for themselves is a dead end job not alogt of advancement as mngmnt is there for like 15 yrs plus they never leave
good,"The job last only six weeks but it was the most fun I've had on a job in years. We stood on our feet for 12 plus hours but we laughed the entire time, as log as we go our orders monogramed. They often had drawings and I won a beautiful dutch oven my first 2 weeks working there."
good,"Home furnishings and decor merchandising. A great company to work for, i just needed a better work life balance, with two small kids the retail hours were overwhelming. Allowed to use my own creativity to ensure a great customer experience from the visual standpoint."
good,"Work on reports, cycle count, send and receive emails, reconcile inventory discrepancies.  Check locations, make inventory adjustments, search and locate lost inventory.  Cross train other departments on correct processes."
good,I really enjoyed working in that work place..Everyone was nice and so helpful and very good trainees. I really enjoyed working there I really hate that it was seasonal.
good,"A typical day at William Sonoma was taking inbound calls from customers with questions on the delivery status. Customers call in to cancel their order. If customer called in with a billing problem would transfer to billing . I would help customer with placing an order, take credit card payment for the order. Noted every acct ."
good,Not a bad company at all. I enjoyed my seasonal employment with this company. The culture was relaxed and pleasant. Holiday season was busy but flexible hours eased the tension of the employees.
good,Williams Sonoma is a very inviting company to work for. I love that they embrace and welcome all cultures. There is unfortunately not a lot of growth opportunities and just recently a lot of positions have been cut.
good,"Great people and nice pay. I would recommend this company to many people I am aquianted with throughout my life. The hours are nice as well, they have a 1st and 2nd shift available."
good,"The environment is wearhouse scenery "
good,Its really not a bad place to work at. Alot of inbound calls and customers to take care of. Track shipping details and update orders
good,"Williams-Sonoma Inc is a great company for high school graduates and those looking for a great work life balance.  The atmosphere is very laid back and inviting.   The pay for customer service is considerably below the industry standard for a global company that doesn't offer any bonus structure or sales incentive.   "
good,"Always loved the job, Supervisors were awesome, they actually came out to work along with their employees, very good attitude everywhere"
good,"I was only a seasonal associate, but in my short time there, it was stressful but rewarding. A great place to work part time if need be."
good,"set hours, always had someone willing to help you, the hardest part was being hot and standing for long hours. not enough breaks. ship and scan postal packages"
good,"William Sonoma was my first luxury company I worked for. I learned what luxury retail was, great customer service skills, how to resolved difficult CSI and so much more.  The most difficult part of working for William Sonoma was not knowing if there was a long term future there for me."
good,Fun workplace and nice environment. If you like to do different things every workday this is the place. Everything has to be done in a timely manner which I didn't mind because the hours would pass by fast.
good,"Very productive workplace where management demanded that if you were on the clock you need to be working."
good,"Working for Williams Sonoma I had great management. They were flexible with me as I worked towards my Bachelor's degree. Many may not see the advantage working a part time retail job, but I believe WS gave me a great advantage. I was given opportunities to with customers in advising them on products to purchase based on their needs. This opportunity taught me how to read my customer, which benefit me in other positions. I was then given the opportunity to run our shipping and receiving department of the store. I knew the needs of the store and organized our stock room for better efficiency. I also was able to train and manage seasonal employees in our stock room. I worked with a great management team and almost every part of this position was enjoyable. The hardest was not having benefits, and due to my school schedule, I had no opportunity to advance to management."
good,inspect the orders to ensure it was packed correct. record information down on data sheets.
good,"As this is my first and only call center experience, I must say it has been a great place to learn and grow. Friendly atmosphere."
good,"When working from the contact center, a typical day consisted of taking incoming calls regarding customer furniture orders. Checking order status, sending to scheduling, resolving issues with delayed deliveries, material damage or defects, issuing replacements and compensation within company guidelines. Now I work from home, it is the same process but with out physically going to the office. "
good,I was cashier collecting money. some times I attended shelving.
good,Temporary job. I was a picker and a stocker. I would pull and pick the different material that the customer selected for the design and put all the orders on a hummer so all of the orders can be processed. and stock and throw boxes and notify if any material need was out so they can be stocked back up to be picked later on in the day.
good,"A typical day at work included tending to my customers and making sure all of their needs were met with their previous purchases. A big part of that job was to stay in touch with customers just on the off chance something went wrong with their order. "
good,"Data entry and filing into the city's database. The work was tedious. Very comfortable environment. Stress free. Government benefits. Very enjoyable job. My co workers worked together as a team to finish projects together. Learned 10 key, the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Arrive at work in uniform with a positive attitude great atmosphere and co-worker. I don't think no part of my job was difficult or hard. I added to my interpersonal skills by dealing with all types of personalities.
good,A typical day at wok is exciting. I've learned how to use different fabrics. The management was everywhere but rarely easy to find. My co-workers were independent. the hardest part of the job was to work with the small parts of fabrics. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rates at the beginning and end of the shift.
good,I hate that this job was only seasonal because I would love to continue working there
good,Keep you moving.  Great team to be apart of.  Knowledgeable associates willing to help everyone.
good,"Well run company, good leadership team and support. Seek solutions from within, allowing for creative and innovation."
good,I worked hard and learned the manufacturing and warehouse aspect of the business.
good,"Williams-Sonoma is a high volume, often high stress, call center during the holiday season.  Customers are often unhappy with the product offerings vs price and availability,.  Although the vast majority of orders deliver on time and in good quality, those that don't require a high degree of maintenance and communication with the customer.  The CSR is judged on timeliness, percent of time available for calls, and customer feedback scores. These can be at odds when customers demand a different solution than the one they are getting.  Overall, it was hard to stay upbeat in this situation."
good,Williams Sonoma has a huge focus on diversity and inclusion.  In my last position I had a fantastic management team that was very supportive however when I worked through the DC the actions of management didn’t  always align with the thoughts presented by the company
good,"Quisiera mejorar laboralmente ,,, me siento que estoy estancado ,,,, y las horas de trabajo no compensa el salario que pagan como ayudante o driver ,,,, en mi opinion es muy poco para vivir"
good,Decent place to work. Everyone is extremely smart and talented are their job. There are some obstacles with leadership and politics as with any company that can make career growth challenging.
good,"I had an amazing time here I worked everyday was never late , was always on time , stayed after worked on weekends , worked with awesome people learn a lot , worked there for a while and it was good !"
good,"It’s an ok company to work for. Getting in contact with HR is somewhat impossible. Everything is done by email. Drug test is very short notice. If you miss your deadline, they will not extend it and you have to reapply all over again."
good,Start with receiving shipment and make sure all are accurate. You learn to be fast paced and physically tested. Will be tougher during peak season and must be continuously bending and lifting heavy equipment.
good,Be ready to handle escalated calls and good calls. I worked there for four years and I loved being able to work from home and be around for my children.
good,The Customer we work with are very Demanding and we are required to answer and resolve 5 calls per hour and they have you sign an agreement to work flexed hours if they need you they reschedule you to fit their needs
good,The hours were good also the staff. Their willing to help if you have any concerns about job positions. Very easy hands on. Good pay. Everyone got alone and helpful if you had any concerns.
good,Nice work environment. Great training and helpful associates. Must be able to handle customers that feel they are entitled. Very busy at holidays and overtime available.
good,"doing daily shipments using ups and other shipping methods. also receiving daily deliveries and shipments for stocking and floor replenishment.my managers are very accommodating to us with schedule changes, vacation requests and any other time off requested"
good,Stocked and sold merchandise. Customers in that area are dumb because they are all old so you must have patience. The managers and coworkers are cool but it is long busy hours everyday.
good,it was a fun place to work I learned that everything has a time on it my management was ok long as everything was done right only hard thing there was is noting.
good,"The group is very compatible,  everyone is extremely helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant to work with. Not really any downsides as most of the staff has been there almost twenty years. Hours come from Corporate and get cut last minute,  which is frustrating.  However, all employees are part-time except General Manager.  This is a fun supplemental job if you love the culinary arts and culture."
good,"Assisting customers with their online and catalog orders.  Locating missing furniture, schedueling deliveries, fabric guides, process and procedure.  Fun enviroment to work in."
good,"I have learned a great deal over the past 2 1/2 years.  Policies and procedures constantly change and are difficult at best to keep up with. There are several concepts under the Williams-Sonoma Inc. umbrella plus there are 2 divisions.  Retail (stores) and E-commerce (online and catalog sales).  "
good,Overall this job was an great experience. You have to have patience and listening skills to deal with all the customers that are calling in. The hardest part of this job is when customers are escalated and you have to quickly problem solve. Pros of the work environment is that everybody works together and is very helpful. I learned different task throughout the office like scanning PODs and filing. I recommend this job for people who can handle pressure.
good,The company as a whole is very traditional but overall solid. More reactive in nature than begin proactive from what I'm used to. Management in each individual department is what sets apart those who truly enjoy their jobs and those areas with high turn over. BUT that's at ALL companies right?!
good,Williams-Sonoma is a decent company to work for. There are challenges and opportunities that need attention badly. The company is not very diverse within leadership.
good,"It's impressive that the company has been around for so long and is so successful, but I think they could stand to invest more in their lower-level employees. The office interior design leaves something to be desired for a brand built on beautiful products."
good,"Typically, a fast paced environment that challenges leadership skills and wit.  Management has very good open door policy and is fair. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are many different daily challenges."
good,some of the management was very strong others not so.  Some would call people out in a group without the facts.  Too many people do not understand retail in the support areas of the company
good,"Starting perks for William Sonoma are really good, pay could def be at least 15.00 starting due to the heavy product that we handle on a daily. The training process when you start could be a little more professional and associates should receive SOPs. Overall decent place to work, bt not enough money for duties preformed."
good,A typical day would be ok leaned how to use different equipment the management was pretty decent the work place culture was nice @ the hardest part of the job would be getting threw security when getting off
good,"Very fast paced during holiday seasons such as Christmas, Easter, Mother's Day and so on, but then it slows down considerably.  I have learned a lot at Williams Sonoma in all the years that I worked there.  I learned the corporate way of setting the floor, doing all the paperwork and teaching other sales associates all about Williams Sonoma.   Over the years we have had to add on duties such as getting emails and credit cards.  Getting the emails was good but trying to get people to apply for credit cards when I don't have one was very difficult."
good,I worked as a packer at Williams-Sonoma and all you really have to do is match the similar products with each other. Whether it's the SKU number or the PO box it's going to everything had to match. Employees got two breaks and one lunch break. It wasn't stressful and working there felt like a nice workout actually
good,You have to be ready to work as soon as you walk in the door. Is fast paced you can't slow down if you do you have to pick up the past or get reported.
good,Its alright. Just don't have an emergency. A point is a point and you have to wait a year to get it off. Some managers really help you and then there are some that clearly have too much on their plates and therefore getting to you is pretty much out the question if you need assistance in a timely manner.
good,"WS is a good company which allow you to work from home, once you learn the job-it become easier.  Most challenge part is trying to please the customer and make sure they are taken care."
good,"Most days, the work environment was positive and helpful to teach me the ropes of a retail store. At times, the management staff was stressed and unhelpful, but I soon learned that retail work is fast-paced and requires workers to be on top of their responsibilities at all times to insure a good experience for the customers."
good,"Lots of tasking, hard to accomplish and drive sales"
good,"I helped to support the HR recruiting efforts. It was fun, team oriented and constantly on the move. It was my first year helping the team and I was excited to see and hear that so many of the seasonal support  members return each year. It was obviously not a bad place to work, if the same seasonal support team return each year. I left at the end of the season, optimistic about returning next season even if I am not given the chance to be hired full-time."
good,"Nice people with friendly working environment. Good seasonal job. Free lunch occasionaly, and managers always available to help with any concerns. Enjoyed employee discounts."
good,a day at working at williams-sonoma is a bit hectic but organized. the culture there is mostly hispanic and many good personalities there. hardest part of the job is at the end of the night when saying goodnight to everyone.
good,"This is a great job to be, if you are a stay at home parent. Or if you like working from home. The employees are nice but the management is a little off to me. Overall if you like helping people even when they are really upset sign up."
good,Very fast passed environment.  You must have extensive knowledge of the products you sale.  Allot of pressure for good customer service as there are secret shoppers.
good,Helping people from all over the United States design their homes with our products.  The hardest part was getting in touch with people because of time zones.
good,"A typical day a work would be pretty normal. I would get a RF gun and all my UPC codes that I would need to get started with. I've learned what the UPC codes are for, how to use the RF gun and how to ensure that the cart is scanned into computer system also."
good,"I enjoyed the training I received.  The training center and staff were very professional. I worked from home, but I could have worked in the center.  The company is very generous to their employees. I learned a lot about working at home."
good,"Whilst a great place to work at, communications skills are better required between stores, management and employees. Better organization in the storage areas and more."
good,"A day in the life of customer service in a call center is quite busy at times or can be somewhat slow; its always changing.  I learn everyday to not take personally comments from customers who aren't unhappy with me just unhappy with a situation."
good,"I love working to this company, I work 10 or 12 hours a day. The break time is not short. Stressful but I will still apply in here if they're still hire me."
good,"I loved working at west elm , it was a different feel there , I loved the hours I was getting , my co workers were great , management could have been a little bit better though ."
good,"William Sonoma is an expensive home decor store. With that being said it is necessary to know how to speak with the clients that come in the store.  At any given time you could be dealing with someone that was about to spend $10,000 or more.  So always dealing with each person with respect was essential."
good,My typical day would be to prepare the store for high volume sales for the day. Including preparing the stock room with the most high end products ran to show room for sale to desired customers.
good,Its was a great company to work for.  The team and processes behind the company are what makes the company a successful one.  It was a joy to be apart of Williams Sonoma Inc.
good,"Great work environment and selling/learning techniques and experiences. Corporate could utilize consulting in order to improve processes and run operations more efficiently for customers, internally and externally."
good,"I enjoyed cooking and preparing food for customers, as well as leading them to the proper items they were looking for. The store had a very friendly warm environment, especially during the Holidays"
good,"Long hrs during peak season with 40+ hrs "
good,"Really easy job. Good pay, great overtime. really good products. I worked here two summers in a row, wouldn't mind going back. Helped me save money for school."
good,You always have to work in a fast manner in order to meet the goal or the target of the product the you are packaging. You must arrive early to let your Supervisor instruct you on which line that you might be working that day. Not all days you will stay in one spot.
good,this is a big company and some of the best managers and employees. when we reach our goals we get prizes and pizza. the hardest part of the job is the long hours and trying to become a lead requires a bachelor's degree which doesn't make sense
good,"West Elm or WSI was the baby of all of the brands. It came backed by the established support of the William Sonoma brand. "
good,A typical day at work was cool. I learned some important skills that i can take on to my next job. My co-workers were very respectful and always came prepared to work. The hardest part of the job was the long days where it was a lot of work to put out.
good,Good place to work at good co workers my job is not hard at all  the most enjoyble part of the job is  when time to lunch comes I've learned how to drive forklifts
good,"A typical work day for me is usually about ten hours. While working here i have learned a few things. i have learned how to be more of a peoples person from dealing with all of the different races. i also learned how to be autonomous. i had a team of guys that i had to micro manage from time to time. Usually if i give clear directions, they follow them accordingly. The hardest part sometimes, is for me is to have to drive so far to get to work.The part i enjoy the most is getting the job done correctly the first time."
good,"A typical day at work involve completing and making all sales goals while guaranteeing your customer satisfaction. Originally taking this PBK position as a part time job it has turned into a full time position. Along with sales and customer service I have also been trained how to monogram and personalized different items in the store.The management team needs a lot of organization and all around re-working of responsibilities. Our store has just received a new GM after the last one transferred and our Assistant Manager never works more then 30 hrs/wk. In the past year I have had to negotiate with the management team for my scheduling even though I was offered a different position and pay then what was stated upon my hire. All of the managers are on completely different pages and most of them are really out for what works best for them in hours, but cut the staffs hours to accommodate their needs. You could have, maybe 27 hrs on week and then they will doc you down to 12 or 8 hours the next because they didn't manage their payroll properly.Most of the people I work with are amazing, awesome people that really go far and beyond the call for each and every customer, but the other half cause drama and undermine authority without cause all the time. It is rather disappointing given the culture of Williams Sonoma. The greatest part about my job is the Visual Marketing floor plans I get to assist with. It is where most of my experience is and I love it. When customers are coming in and wondering what is going on I love to let them know that they are shopping at the flagship store and"
good,love my job just in need of job work/life balance . where i work customer are very needy and as me and my manager we alway  do what's in are power to make them very happy  like that they will always come back .As my store manager always tells us you want your  customer to alway leave wanted to come back  leaving with unforgotten  memory .
good,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. has a rich heritage dating back to 1956 when Chuck Williams opened the first store in Sonoma. The portfolio of Brands is unrivaled in retail. Creativity and entrepreneurship are highly valued."
good,Unload Semi truck with store shelving and new merchandise. Set up all the placement of shelving to begin stocking shelves. Make sure every shelf is made to look visually stimulating. Create visual displays. Sort overstock and stock into respective location in stockroom.
good,"Nice seanonal job for anyone with good pay friendly people, learnd how to multitask"
good,"I have truly enjoyed working at Williams-Sonoma/Pottery Barn Kids.  The fast pace, variety of clients, and the ever changing products definitely makes the job interesting and fun.  I have had the privilege of being not just a Sales Associate but also the Lead Design Coordinator.  This has meant that my primary focus has been to serve my customers in their homes by helping them design nurseries, bedrooms, playrooms, etc.  Those of us that work at this particular store are a very close knit group and the support, both personal and business, that we have for each other is quite amazing.  I also love working with the variety of people that come into the store: Expectant families, grandparents, children, and gift buyers. Each are unique and I love serving them!  When my customer is happy, or when I have solved an issue for them, I am very satisfied and those customers remain faithful to me and usually ask for me the next time they come to the store.  The most difficult part of the job is having enough time to complete a design project due to insufficient hours.  Designing a room, placing the orders, and follow up appointments all take time that sometimes management has not been willing to schedule."
good,"I wish I was working there full time.  I have a great Managment team that I am able to work with on my many projects .  There are so many elements working there.  For example, Sales, Visual, Shipments, Clienteling, Techniques classes, Product Knowledge, etc... It takes the right person to work there and I have been lucky to be part of a great team."
good,"Days where okay, wish i would have had more hours."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. The job was a little unorganized.
good,"It was long days at work. It's usually an 8 hour job, starting from anytime between 6-8 in the morning, up until 5 pm. You carry boxes and load them into a conveyor belt. The boxes can range from 10-100 pounds."
good,"Decent opportunity, I started seasonal full time ended permanent part time (I chose part time in stead of full time) I worked with customers that ordered furniture items, mostly very upset and frustrated with delays in delivery time or possible damaged items. Quite naturally these types of customers would be upset but it was our job to fix the issue & kinda give them some happiness (it just didn't always work out that way)"
good,"I picked this job up for some extra income over the holidays. For 12 an hour I was optimistic, yet slightly worried. The training was supposed to be two weeks, which was really a week and half with all the at-home trouble shooting and setting up of systems. The company sends you off to read/complete modules for hours a day and then you are thrown into calls at the end of the second week.

The employees were friendly and management was simple. Not too much stress with enough working hours.
good,"They do not train you for this place in school nor on a certification. Customer service is key for any role and every role player matters at this company. You do not get enough thank you's or good jobs from your leadership because we are all working for the same goal often times so the load is shared equally. Its some times feels a little stressful and you can get overly consumed by the work. "
good,"Great job, I enjoyed working for the company and the people were great all races working together for one goal.long hours but great pay once a week pay."
good,"Worked temporarily from home. It was a great position. I either placed orders, checked on orders, or helped a customer look for a particular item. Occasionally someone would call asking for a discount. In the three months that I was there I would say I only had 1 call that I couldn't handle. The job was pleasant but it was temp job."
good,Working at William-Sonoma was a great experience and Challenge when I have first started working there. Training was very fun and the people were very friendly I worked for WS for 13 years and I enjoyed every minute I was there.
good,"Enjoyed the experience there taking inbound calls, resolving customer problems with orders,assisted with Bridal Registry, assures with backorders and customer complaints"

good,Was a good place to work.  It was fun demoing new items to customers and I enjoyed the sales aspect of the job.  Stock room was difficult to manage because it was so small
good,"I worked as a Temp Work from Home Associate for 1 month. I left due to the phone system dropping calls constantly as it got to the point of annoyance for me. The job itself is okay, I enjoyed helping customers track their orders, processing refund requests and such. Manager or Team Lead was okay. He was friendly and always asked how everyone was and came off very friendly."
good,This was a very hard workplace for me. It allowed me to really test my skills. I didn't really like working at night but I did manage to make it thru the season.
good,"Pretty chill environment to work in."
good,"i was constantly walking back and forth all day unloading and loading shipment trucks which was fun for me due to it was a good exercise. "
good,"on a regular day at work as a employee its a fast pace type of job and its mandatory to make production with great quality work to the product,they also pay enough for it to be done the way its asked of you.the company offers 3 break two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break everything is perfect  except racism but money is money"
good,It was very laid back  I engraved tin cups etc I worked 10 to 12 hour shifts  sometimes I'll help build pallets when I was done with my work I know how to operate machines
good,"After a few months on the job, I had learned the PKMS system associated with my work and became team leader over 8 employees, excelling to different accomplishments recognized by the company. The system work which utilized my clerical skills was the main key to getting any task done daily. I also learned to utilize my critical thinking skills by having to implement ways to get different assignments done daily."
good,"Company focused on ways to train you in all aspects of different jobs to give you opportunity for advancement. They are a company who takes the time to publicly recognize your efforts with rewards, etc."
good,"Overall the company is fun to work at/for.  Management position doesn't allow for much work/life balance...there is constant communication - needing responses immediately, conference calls scheduled... on days off, including vacations.  It's an environment where it's never ""convenient"" for management to take much needed time off when it's a benefit provided by the company.  Micromanaged days from upper management limits teams to think outside the box to sell, provide service.  The products are incredible!  Holidays are crazy busy, but fun!  Cooking and sampling food for customers - super fun!  It's like hosting parties in your own home."
good,Started out 40hr to 20 hr was msking 15 starting but you go on mornings its 11.44 just couldnt live off that sorry then the point system was ok you can get 11 points before warning
good,Good base level experience for planners to learn and develop strategy positioning and collaborate with the Buyers on financial strategies.  Lacks in-season mgmt capabilities and empowerment.
good,A great experience working and making upholstered furniture on a production line. As the lead upholsterer I'm responsible for making a quality product efficiently . Teamwork is key all members are important.
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with staff members who have been there awhile and don't know how to take criticism about their work. Hiring to many young people who don't care about the work that they do only about the money.
good,"La franquicia tiene poco en México, sí, entonces hay aun incongruencias en el sistema laboral, horarios, políticas de comisiones. Sin embargo, es un buen ambiente laboral, aunque comienza a verse afectado por enfocarse en números y ventas."
good,Great Management! Nice entry level call center. Comfort of you own home! Customer can be a hassle due to no callbacks or thinks on backorder. this is were the company really lacks. But other than that great company.

good,"I loved this store, working with the people - both employees and customers.  Besides regular sales, I was a Design Services Coordinator which allowed me to use my creative side.  The heart of this store is to meet the customers' needs.  I loved being a part of  that!  Working here was also good because of the flexible hours.  I was able to modify my schedule according to personal needs I had at that time.  So though the pay wasn't great, the compensation of that flexibility was good.  I also thoroughly enjoyed working with customers to help them design their children's rooms, family rooms, etc.  Understanding a client's need and helping them fulfill it was very rewarding."
good,Great work place. Wish it was not a temp job. Would have loved a career working for Williams Sonoma. Great employees and managers. Everything was well in order.
good,"A typical at work, we load the delivery truck on Monday morning and we leave the same day to start making deliveries to customers and to the stores."
good,"Day to day there is a lot to do and not enough time to do it. Most stores are short staffed because we have high expectations of who we want to hire. This job has taught me a lot and I know have a much better business acumen and a better understanding of the business overall. "
good,I Enjoy Working At William Sonoma And The People Around Me And Its A Nice And Clean Environment. And The Hardest Part Of This Job Is Working In The Mods On The Third Level In Extreme Heat Conditions

good,"I learned so much while working as a team or individually. Co-workers are eager to work together and we all manage to get things done quickly and efficiently, always impressive to management. At cases there were only 3 of us receiving shipment of around 1,400 pieces."
good,your day goes by quick and everyone you work with is cool but tons of phone calls a day and learning all the systems to work in otherwise  great job for what it pays
good,This place was a very fun place to work lots of fun interactions with people and customers. Lots of help from other coworkers and supervisors.
good,"typically a busy day at work"
good,"A typical day at work began with logging into your computer and preparing for the day's calls.  This particular call center dealt with inbound calls concerning both sales and customer service.  The training lasted 5 weeks and was invaluable in learning about the Williams-Sonoma family (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Mark & Graham, and Restoration).  The computer programs were also explained in detail.  Once training ended, both management and co-workers helped in explaining more difficult calls to new employees.  Since it was peak season, the calls for sales and customer service were at high volume.  We were reminded to do the best we could for our customers while following Williams-Sonoma guidelines.  I enjoyed my experience at the Williams-Sonoma call and being able to help people during the holiday season."
good,Not a bad place at all.  Plenty of projects to get involved in.  Lots of good opportunities to learn from.  Shuttle to and from BART provided. Managers tend to give their employees the benefit of the doubt.

good,"The environment there was very relaxed. management was very hands on. The full time employees were very helpful to the temporary staff. I  really enjoyed my time with this company. I think the pay rates could have been more for the temporary staff, ex. $13.50 per hour."
good,"The Technical Solutions division is lead by leaders, not managers  Vision is clear and the culture has changed to a business outcome focused."
good,Working at William Sonoma is a very fast job but they pay good and they let you work how many days you want and u get 3 breaks it's a ok place to work if u love standing on your feet
good,"Working at the Williams Sonoma has been very nice. I enjoy going to work with my kind and helpful coworkers. Though it can get very busy at times, it is a wonderful job that I feel many people would feel comfortable at."
good,"WSI is a good company with good senior leaders, opportunity at all the brands Pottery Barn Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Teen West Elm William Sonoma"
good,Could have used better benefits for new workers . The company runs fast paced . If you don’t catch the ya g if it then more than likely you’ll get handed another position. Great opportunities for overtime.
good,During my work experience with William Sonoma/ Pottery Barn. I found that my needs were always met in a positive and constructive manner. There were many corporate changes within the company at times which allowed associates to further there skills in design as well as human resourses. There were many advantages to these changes to excel within the company.
good,"The job was great I loved it. A typical day was busy and sometimes slow, depending on the time of year. I learned more about having patience with customers. Also how to smile through the phone."
good,"The company was very flexible in trying to find a work schedule to fit what was good for me. HR was very helpful when applying in person, sadly i found no one from HR would answer when calling during the week with a question. "
good,"I really like that they offer work from home. It is this feature that has kept me working for Williams- Sonoma Inc. As with any ""Customer Service"" related position, there is an element of stress."
good,William Sonoma is  fast paced.  The job was a remote work from home with paid training provided.  It started part-time during the holiday season then I got promoted to full time after the busy season.
good,"Similar to most retail positions hours, salary, and stress commiserate with the season. The particular company is focused on customer service and following Chuck William`s standards. Overall, the other staff make the experience great."
good,It was a high paced job with high expectations. the best part of working with this company was the great friendships made with the employees. You have to have extreme product knowledge to be able to truly help customers. It seemed like they go through management people often. I did enjoy working for the company overall
good,"Typical day is fairly simple, just unloading deliveries to the floor and/or storing them for the most part. If you like stacking boxes and know how to use a dolly you should be fine here."
good,muy divertido y dinamico muy bonito haber laborado ahi

good,I worked in a retail store part time for many years and enjoyed. I took a new position as a work-from-home customer service associate until I left the company.
good,Worked an eight hour day Supervising employees on loading trucks daily. Learned about co-employment and how it works. Enjoyed working with the temporary employees and helping them as well as rewarding them for great work ethics.
good,"A typical day goes like this: Sign into your computer systems and phone and Start taking customer calls for 8-10 hours. Most calls are customers needing help with an order they already placed. Some are to place new orders over the phone. But most calls are going to be servicing customer accounts by helping them apply promo codes, explaining exclusions, shipping, returns, replacements, refunds, credits ect. Half or more of your customers will be angry when they call so that can get exhausting and wear on  you throughout the day. Especially when most of the time, it's the customer who made the mistake but wants us to fix it and honor prices and discounts."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I received plenty of hours at the time. My checks were looking very nice. I enjoyed the manager i worked under.
good,Typically worked a normal 40 hour work week.  Seasonal work load was 50 to 60 hour work week - 10 hours a day 7 days a week from the end of October until after Christmas.
good,Good work at home job. Typical day lasts 8 hours + 30 minute lunch. Learned a lot about special circumstances customers bring. Hardest part would be pre escalated customers who are uncooperative. Helping out sweet older ladies is the best part of the day. Management is solid and very reasonable with expectations.
good,I enjoyed the job very much so the pay was pretty decent and the work was pretty easy it was just the hours and the location was extremely hot. The management team was ok
good,Challenging workplace with a great chance for upward movement. Fun place to be while always meeting someone new.Many different personalities which proved to be a good thing when meeting with the many new clients.
good,"The company had some fun events for the staff on occasion, but other wise it was a basic call center.  There was no silly quota's  to meet and the only demand was to be nice to the customers and take responsibility for the call."
good,"Williams Sonoma is a great place to work, as they have very good training programs and you learn some great skills as they focus on product knowledge and customer service. There are not really advancement opportunities in Canada as the company is US based. The discounts are very generous, even if you are temp. seasonal help."
good,"go in and work and do you job but if you are temporary they will not give you the proper notice and will lay you off regardless of how hard you work. "
good,It is a good place to start working a pay the bills has good benefits and environment nice people and the pay is not bad. I will recommend it if u need job.
good,It is a very laid back kind of work place with room for growth. For a person getting out of High School it would be a very good place to start a career.
good,Customer service center is a busy environment can be hectic at times but that is the nature. If you like talking with customers and taking customer complaints it can be fun.
good,I worked from home. Went through the longest training ever for Sales/Furn. Good pay for working at home. I had a lot of work from home problems. Their policies are horrible and you will get fired for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING.
good,Description of my day to day activities are outlined in my resume. Williams Sonoma is a world renowned culinary retail outlet.
good,good place to work just honestly was not enough pay. It was a simple job of unloading and loading trucks.Everyone was friendly.

good,The work environment was great. Management wasn't good at all. You will have overtime at the end of the month. I love my co workers there.

good,It was intriguing to learn about how the despatch/recieval dock worked. My co-workers were polite and that made it a good team work enviroment.

good,Very professional and organized establishment. I learned the true meaning of teamwork here. My experience there sharpened my teamwork and work ethics.
good,A typical day would be assisting customers with product info or an eta of the customers merchandise. The management had an open door policy if you were in need of anything you could always speak with someone in the management team.My co-workers were all friendly and there to help whenever there not busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an irate customer when you have done everything in your power to please them and its not enough. The most enjoyable part of the job were the everyday interactions because everyday something different would happen.
good,"If you're one who loves to cook, this place is definitely a good start. I enjoyed working around all of the cooking supplies and bake ware. I found myself inspired often, whenever it came to just working within the relaxed and very homely atmosphere. It was a comfortable environment with friendly faces."
good,"With high-end cooking appliances and a somewhat knowledgeable cooking clientele, you need to make sure your facts are straight when talking to the customers but the rest staff is more than helpful in showing you the ropes"
good,"As a sales associate, I interact with the costumers explaining various products to them, handle the registers, bring items up from the stock room, keep the store clean, pass out the free samples, and, depending on shift, open and close the store. During non-holiday season, I work once a week for about four hours, though this can vary. During the holiday season this builds slowly from mid-October to December, where I will admit, the job is a lot more involved. The environment is friendly, my coworkers are great, and while the schedule is very fluid, it's easy to work with."
good,"great support from management, fun people to work with, good customers to speak with and assist, loved working wedding registry"
good,Fast paced environment with emphasis on engaging with the customer at many sensory levels. Steep learning curve to become familiar with the myriad of product but a strong focus on associate development. Good work ethic and enthusiasm is recognized and rewarded. Cooking or foodie background is a huge asset and makes customer interaction much more fun - selling a great product AND helping to make someone a great cook...or at least spark a new passion.
good,Loved working for William Sonoma it was a very nice work place.
good,"A great  place if you are looking for part time work, after four years working and learning great product information and great customer service to my clients. "

I worked closely with the general and assistant managers to make sure that both the sales and stock room areas were up to the corporate issued standards for merchandising, and easy of finding products. I managed approximately ten people as part of my position, which included writing & presenting performance reviews. My favorite part of working for Pottery Barn was working with the customers in the Design Studio area, which allowed me to exercise my interior design skills."
good,Focused work environment with everyone pulling to together to meet deadlines and to celebrate promotions and strong sales.
good,"A great place to work, the management and coworkers are fun to be with, especially on busy weekend days!"
good,Its a great company for the moment but starting from the top down communication is none existance! If you like stucure dont look for it here! If your seasonal you are just that no matter what they say and how many times they tell you. You staying dont entertain just wait on paperwork
good,The people in the work place was very friendly. And i waz comfortable with working with everyone in the workplace and that made me want to be there everyday. The pay was good and the people were good and thats why i enjoyed working at Williams sonoma.

good,Time goes by real fast because you are busy answering calls.  You must be able to multitask.  Hardest part of the job is the outdated software.  The best part is working from home and the discount!
good,"I like working as a Inventory Control Analyst. I have a Lead and a manager but,  knowing my job like I do, I just do my job like I was trained with little or no supervision. When I first get there I sign out a RF gun then proceed to my desk. I sign on Windows to  run my shortages and negatives.  I also print my less than tens. Lost in warehouse merchandise etc."
good,A typical work day was fast pace which is to be excepted working inside of a work house. Some days if work was light they would send people home early.
good,I enjoyed my time there. The relationships that I built with my co-workers and repeat customers were valuable and made working fun. The holidays are the best.
good,Good company to work for but management can use some classes on employee confidentiality. Other than that it has great benefits and good scheduling. But again management does have favoritism on employees.
good,"While working at William & Sonoma it was a very good experience, although it was a seasonal position. I was able to help and train individuals while helping myself."

Overall a good learning experience, but a little stressful."

good,This employer is a nice place to work. I would definitely recommend this job for a friend even if its seasonal through out the year mostly but over all a cool place to be.
good,It was ok the only thing wrong with this place is that they show favoritism towards certain people. And half of the people work there dont do nothing but walk around.
good,"Williams Sonoma call center seemed pretty good. It was the only call center I ever worked in long term so at the time it seemed pretty good.  It was comfortable, they followed the rules, made sure everyone knew when they had to take their time off and their breaks.  I was promoted quickly to Customer Service and then to a Lead and a supervisor.  My manager was great and very friendly.  He had me monitor our team and I was given the responsibility to create a new training manual and also to coach some members of our team who I thought had promise.  It was a pretty simple job but I enjoyed it."
good,Productive and a good work place. Got alone with everyone. Lack of work (seasonal). My job consisted of making sure everyone had the materials they needed to complete their job ( Material handler)

They responded well to suggestions and were generally very easy to deal with. They were happy and many were returning customers who were satisfied with the quality of the product offered for sale.  That's why they returned. They appreciated my linking them up on line to stores who had the product that we had run out of.

good,"Williams-Sonoma was my first job as a sales associate. It taught me how to communicate with costumers, handle inventory, work well with others, and it overall helped me gain confidence. The hardest part of the job was waiting for costumers to show up. It was pretty slow-paced. The most enjoyable part was working with great people."
good,A great place to work part time!  Also a good place to learn about different kitchen tools.  The store also sells food items and cookbooks. They train you and it is a relaxed environment. Lots of emphasis on selling up to a certain number so it can getba bit competitive.
good,"Its good place to work you'll get a lot of hours, but its hard to get a day off. You usually find things out at the last min. But other than that great place to work."
good,"Working for Williams-Sonoma was for me very gratifying both dealing with customer and the knowledge you obtain of the vast items you need to know about. And the management is great, supportive and educators."
good,Company has great products and employee benefits. Management empowers their workers to take action and there is a lot of open dialogue between departments.
good,Some of the managers were not the best. Employees were the goto people in most scenarios. I did like a couple of the management team. While I was there I enjoyed it.
good,"Management was exceptional.  Very friendly and supportive staff. Very busy during seasonal time. The hourly wage was low and no commission for sales, even though each member had a sales quota to meet.  Great for high school or young college kids."
good,"Although I only worked for this company for a few months, I genuinely enjoyed working with everyone.  All of my coworkers were extremely hard working and very valuable team players."
good,"They all moved very fast so, I had to learn to adjust to their speed. They didn't have mats for us to stand on so, it was pretty hard on my feet and my back. My manager was nice and so were my coworkers."
good,As I got hired I got hired as a seasonal cashier so I wasn't there very long but it was the first little bit of expedite I had. It was a good source of experience for me in the retail field which I enjoyed.
good,From the first day the staff and other employees were a delight.  Supervisors made sure the atmosphere was light and energetic.  Wages were great for my demographic area.
good,Good company to work for. Lots of work available. Good people to work with. Lots of knowledge of the product in the warehouse. Great discounts if you purchase something.
good,Not really ever bored. Fun people to work with. Hardest thing was climbing very tall ladders to get merchandise from the top shelves. Management  was awesome!
good,"Very good place to work environment is positive and lots of support,  lots of encouragement, people working well with others.  Outstanding environment."
good,"Other than the old system they have, the work is great. Work load is not bad and customers are typically in a good mood if they are ordering. Awesome work environment."
good,"This job, was very demanding but yet very rewarding. There were long work days and you got paid weekly. it was a great experience for me. it helped me get a car"
good,The management at William Sonoma is good people to work for and it is a enjoyable to work all you need to do is to be on time for work and do your job and every will be okay
good,William sonoma is a great place to work. The staff is friendly and likes to see everyone succeed. Time off isn't always 100% but the incentives and teamwork is worth it.
good,"working for Williams Sonoma was a learning experience.  First of all I had never heard of the company but learn all the different brands they had was interesting  I learned all about the Skus and the process of the cost adjustment and the different system they used"
good,Overall a secure company to work for.  Great product was offered to customers.  Each store had it's own culture.  Con's for the company would delivery issues that were outside the stores control.
good,"Been here for 7 months and no real complaints about the company itself or the people I work with, as they are great. it's dealing with customers who blame YOU because UPS or DHL has lost their package (and even when you say you are replacing it right away) they still want to shout at you, berate you and most of all BLAME you - and the constant beratement can really wear you down. LOVE working from home though!"
good,"Williams-Sonoma offers high-quality products"
good,I loved working for this company. It was customer oriented as well as caring for their employees. Job security and movement up the ladder very possible and likely.
good,"As a previous employee at a Williams Sonoma call center in Oklahoma, I would have to rate this overall company a 4+, because even though the center was overstaffed during the peak holiday season this past September, the time that I worked for the company was for the most part a great work experience overall, and a great experience in general. The manager that hired me was extremely nice, very humble, understanding and intelligent. Most of my calls were positive, yes there are rude customers from time to time, but I would always try my best to find a solution for them and come to a mutual understanding. Well, I was let go in December, there is the only negative part of the company, which is their attendance point system, which is automatically calculated if you're more than a certain amount late or absent you get 1 point. The maximum number of points I was allowed to keep working there were exceeded, because I was sick and did call I numerous days, which added my points up very quickly. Two months later and I regret some of the times I was late or absent because I'm not having much luck finding a job. Williams Sonoma was probably one of the best companies I've worked for."
good,"loved the environment great people to work with and also great hours ,very busy environment .The managers was very helpful the best thing that I liked about working there was that everyone was very helpful with one another .."
good,"Great hours ..production pay . Flexible work schedules. Work any shift available , two lunch breaks a day employee discounts picking or packing to choose from"
good,"learned many things and started a new things, found the new ways surrounding. the most enjoyable part of the job is managing."
good,"They helpful, they funny and manage our money right they help me learn more things that I wasn't capable of . But they are nice people"
good,"the environment is nice. The employees are grade B. Overall its an okay place to work, however keep to yourself. The hours are good. The peak season hours are wonderful."
good,Williams-Sonoma (Work from Home) has been a great opportunity.  This job provided great training and support.  It provides flexibility in work schedule.
good,Working in this warehouse is a great opportunity if you enjoy working in a big face pacing environment. Working at Williams-Sonoma is a very well long-term job. I really enjoyed working there it would be a great to work there again.
good,I  love this job because clerical duties work on computer put order in for customer when that call in to place a order the hard thing was put order in computer correct once i finish my training i become very good at.
good,"good job could pay more ,better people in leadership positions,they could be more helpful to the people under them.no team concept"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. You receive adequate training, everyone is always willing to help you succeed, and the advancement opportunities are beyond plentiful."
good,I love working at williams sonoma as an administrator assistant it was a very easy job to do as far as making sure all the orders got out in time as well helping in other departments when needed.
good,Communicated with upper management monthly goals and ways to empower employee continuous improvement. Communicated and assisted first level investigations of escalation with diplomacy and accuracy.
good,"williams Sonoma was a fun and great place to work they gave away prizes and gifts along with bonuses for good work performance and attendance  I have work their three years straight and management has been fair consistent no problems, the hardest part of the job was some times the overnight hours because I always worked another job because this was only part time for me and after the holidays we were gone. Williams-Sonoma, Inc in fun again and a great place to work."
good,"- Co-workers were always helpful and very hard working."
good,"Although you spend the majority of your time on your feet, it is a great place to work and you work is appreciated by management"
good,"People there were very nice, you didnt have a supervisor looking over you at all times. They trusted us with decision making and it made my job easier. I enjoyed the customers and solving thier issues. Great discounts, great benefits. The hardest part of the job was sometimes an angry customer but i looked at is as a challenge and I never ended a call badly. Very team oriented and they make work fun."
good,"Learned a lot about the company over my tenure there, moving around to various departments to get the big picture of how and why things are done the way they are.  The more you understand, the better you can do your job.  Great co-workers and team players, especially miss my Business Sales associates and some of the clients I worked with."
good,"Great product, which made it easy to sell. Wonderful co-workers.  Good reputation within the furniture industry.  Beautiful catalogs helped with sales."
good,"I was a work from home representative. When the system worked fine I found it easy to do my job and assist the customers with their requests through email. There were many flaws in the operating system that kept getting me kicked off of the system while in the middle of an email or while researching an answer to the customers question. The moral of the company was usually high spirited, especially around Christmas time. There was lots of encouragement from management to fulfill our customers needs before Christmas. I got along with all of my coworkers as well, and still stay close to a lot of them after leaving Williams-Sonoma."
good,"They don't promise you the world like so many places but do hold to their promises.  You yearly pay increase is directly related to your work ethic. As with any company this big it is easy to imagine getting lost in the race, but if you work hard and show enthusiasm they will reward you.   The benefits package and company discount are excellent."
good,working at a store that has to do with household and cooking equipment has its ups and downs. my co workers were nice to be around and they taught me new things.
good,"Standard retail work environment. the demographic of customers is what sets William-Sonoma apart for regular retail stores. There is a reputation that comes with WS that the staff must uphold. Which is excellent customer service, and the goal is to get the customer feeling like they are the only ones being helped. It taught me how to make a customer feel special. It was trying at times, because most of the time we didn't have enough staff to counter the traffic in the store. So we were being pulled around by other customers. I loved working there though,. the staff was great, the company is great, and the product is great."
good,I learned how to write a effective schedule for all 4 brands.... not easy! The old culture of th Gap was my favorite.... jeans and khakis. The upper managment was grest about work/ life balence
good,"face paced"
good,"My day would start by doing my follow-ups from previous days. This included calling customers about their orders such as back orders, discounts applied to orders, or just making sure everything was to their satisfaction. I answered high call volume from customers from all our sister companies, took care of orders, and technical support. I loved my co-workers, we got along very well. I didn't find anything hard about the job, there were challenges but that's what makes it exciting. My immediate supervisor was great!"
good,"Team player, enjoyed work.  Seasonal, prepping Christmas stockings, festive atmosphere."
good,If you are into cooking this is the place to work.  The store brings demo's of all shorts to their store and demo's many different items.  I learned so much more about cooking and baking.  Have fun!
good,I enjoyed my time here. The pay was good and the hours was also. I would love to work for this company again.
good,"Best Job I worked at so far."
good,stand long times learning new things every single day. Monitored sewing machines as they ran.
good,"A very busy and well managed, organized and fun workplace with great coworkers. We were visited by company Reps who gave us  product knowledge. Time went by fast because of high customer volume. It was hectic but well worth it."
good,"Simply put, the collaborative team efforts toward positive advancement in the industry make all the difference in truly finding such a heightened value of satisfaction within the workplace"
good,This is my first experience working in a call center. I love this job and I do recommend this as a nice start off job. My duties are never to hard I work as a living experience I rate this job a 100%.
good,extensive experienced infrastructure and business sytems
good,I enjoyed working here I learned how to operate a sewing machine go back in the system and change things the management was great they came on the floor to make sure we were okay my coworkers were nice and fun to be around no hardest part the most enjoyable was getting off going home.
good,I provided customer serivce as well as helped with merchandisng and floorsets.
good,"Giving customers excellent customer service, making hourly and monthly goals, making customers happy and making them feel satisfied. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the store technology, not easy or updated. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all different types of people and helping them make their dream homes happen."
good,prodctive work flow
good,"I enjoyed being a seasonal coordinator at Williams Sonoma, would have loved to have been kept on. Do look forward to applying again for another peak season."
good,A Typical Day At Work - Lots Of Smiling Faces.
good,this was a fast past job...helping walk in customers and also helping customers that called the store asking questions...i learned this job very fast i started off working in the stock room but i wanted to learn customers service and exceled at it....the management was okay the pretty much did their jobs. so co workers was easy to work with i made new friends but so co workers was hard to work with so i just had to over look it. the hardest part about the job was when it was lots of customers and also working on the internet to find items in such a fast pace..i enjoyed working with customers and them greeting me with a smile it was fun
good,Fabulous work environment. Busy but fun and motivating. Excellent employee team contests resulting in winning great products. Learned a great deal through their training programs.
good,very nice to work and travel alot so see alot of different things
good,It was a nice experience. I made a lot of friends there and this is where I operated all the different types of forklift. I also learned the inventory aspect of the warehouse. William Sonoma is a great company to work for.
good,Great job opportunities wonderful work environment and also very clean job security and benefits was also very well management was very friendly and encouraging
good,Great team environment which is great for project management teams in a fastpaced and fun environment. Proactive and energetic leadership team that welcomes all feedback.
good,"A company that truly cares about employees, fun, and always accommodating a work life balance. Makes you want to come to work. They also do fun in store events."
good,"I was able to work plenty of hours "
good,It was Ok. The people were helpful and our managers were teaching us every step of the way. I would go back I enjoyed working with them. The peak season was short to me.
good,Very stressful just have to enjoy taking to people who have no idea about where their item is and they always will rate you poorly based on how fraudster they are.
good,"I love cookware and kitchenware, I highly recommend applying if youère into that as well. I had to leave because I changed schools and had to go somewhere else, but I wish I had stayed."
good,I liked the management. They tried their best make sure their employees were satisfied and comfortable with the work environment. I would recommend this job.
good,Nice place to work just so much going on in that big factory.  Security is the very good for things coming in the the building and out. Great place to work!
good,Great workplace great management great work environment very safe to work there and the people are there are excellent and just a great company to move up into
good,"Left a previous employer to pursue a new opportunity"
good,"Working at Williams Sonoma was a fine retail based experience. You do the work you get paid. Employees where always nice and fairly relaxed. "
good,"Good Company to work for , wish that I had been able to stay on but due too family things had to quit. It is a great job to consider and great benefits"
good,Deben mejorar los salarios a los empleados . Los benéficos son buenos .
good,"A great place to work for they actually care about you. "
good,"Responsible for machine set ups"
good,I have no complaints about the job. It was as any other call center is expected to be. I don't have anything that I liked or disliked more than anything else.
good,"I did enjoy working with this company, the values and culture are great. "
good,"You may work a lot of hours , but the money looks great !  The managers are a little rough but that is only because they want to meet the goals they set each night ."
good,Started as a loader and my leads encouraged me to do m9re because they saw potential in me. So i got certifued by OSHA and now i drive the pacer sit down and cherry . Thanks for the leads
good,"Mostly we had to talk on phone to customers, Majority of the time when we need assistance it was provided.  Very nice Supervisors, If you have a positive personality you will get the same respect back.  Its all about who you are and how you respond to negative situations."
good,"Working here is pretty fun. However, if you are bad at organization, things get really hard. Keeping an organized stockroom is really important, anyone who decides to apply for a stockroom job learns that pretty fast. If you cannot lift or move really heavy things (50-300lbs), I don't recommend working in the stockroom. You are going to have to lift boxes that weigh 40 lbs+ and move them up a 8-10' ladder regularly. Its a great way to build muscle, I'll give you that. Managers where I work are very friendly and so are fellow coworkers. Nothing but positive vibes all throughout the day."
good,"Williams-Sonoma is nice place to work at.A productive and fun place to work at. I have learn about monogramming and lasing,picking and packing orders."
good,This is a great job don't get me wrong. If you are a stay to yourself do your job and go home type because their are snakes in the grass so to speak. Mgt included. To rise above everyone else you have to impair the weak.
good,Love the job just wanted to be compensated for my time and efforts...the co wokers was great and the culture just need to that everyone do not have degree but have the work experience
good,although the pay was great at times certain team leaders and management would often show favoritism to those who in my opinion were just brown nosing and looked past the actually hard workers
good,You can work from the center or at home. They have advancement opportunities. Good benefits and positive environment. They give you excellent training and you are in a relaxed work environment
good,I enjoy working for this company. It is a work from home position where you take customer service calls and sales calls. The hardest part of the job is taking back to back calls and learning the AS400 system. Training is long and can be information overload. I really loved my class and co workers.
good,"Very fast pace, time goes by quickly being you're always busy. Management is on point. Co-workers are very helpful and knowledgeable. I've learned the importance of warehouse safety."
good,"I work in Delivery quality, we handles customer issues with wood furniture over $500 arriving damaged as well as upholstered.. I receive a email and enter the customer into our data base uploading photos, and customer input. I handle at least 10 new cases daily. I make a introductory phone call telling the customer the benefits of having the item brought to first quality."
good,"very bussy and nice team for work"
good,"Great Incentives, Laid Back and lots of freedom. Supervisors empowered you."
good,Very customer focused. A fast pace high call volume center.
good,"A typical day at Williams Sonoma was creating an inviting and positive atmosphere for customers. I enjoyed working with staff, and learned by emphasizing the absolute highest customer service, that it pays dividends ultimately. The result of encouraging the staff and providing positive feedback resulted in my receiving ""Best Net Contribution"" nationally. I had an incredible group of co-workers and worked at a wonderful location in Pasadena, CA. I worked very hard at times as I was asked to open new locations in San Francisco, and Beverly Hills. While this was probably the hardest part, what I enjoyed the most was assembling wonderful staffs and together providing an unforgettable shopping experience for customers."
good,"I worked a few holidays seasons. My store had great management, and I was really impressed by the level of knowledge of the full-time and regular part-time employees."
good,"I loved working for this company but when seasonal work slows down, off the schedule you go. They some what make like you'll get hired on part or full-time comfortably looking at weekly scheduling for weeks then tell you thanks have a good life smh!"
good,"Peak season great hours,  lots of work,  cross training is available.  Full-time position are available if you are selected.  Staying safe is a top priority."
good,"WSi is a family oriented company,  management in the PZ department is great.  It's fun fast paced but if you pay attention,  ask for help and stay focused you will do well.  Remember always stay safe."
good,Very fast pace place to work.  Customer driven.  If you love to cook this is the place to work.  They make samples to give to the customers all day long.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced. I often learned about new products and helped convey that to the customer. Management was amazing, easy to communicate with. The hardest part of the job was not being able to receive a speedy response from management since it was a work from home job. I enjoyed having a fast paced job that was constantly changing. I easily adapt to jobs that are fast paced."
good,"The best part of working for Williams Sonoma Inc., is the work from home part. The hardest part would sometimes be the customers. You have to built tough the having irate customers calling and demanding. The most enjoyable part is not letting it get to you and knowing your shift would be ending soon for the day."
good,Different sections all over the warehouse that seamlessly work together to keep the warehouse running at great proficiency almost 24/7. Yearly raises and job advancement opportunities.
good,"Great company to work for with good benefits, hours and support.  Struggles a bit with technology for associates, but does not limit the capability of taking care of the customer."
good,"Very good company with flexible hours and great customer focused environment. the job offers good pay and great discounts. the hardest part of the job is the pay but if you are happy with the management, the fun and exciting culture and the learning experience in the retail world, it makes it all worthwhile."
good,"A typical day at work you would come in and get your gladiator then go to your mod (in the mornings the highest level floor first) Me I always went to MOD 3 LEVEL 4 first thing, each person gets their own section only one person can be on a section at a time."
good,Work from home easy just answer calls and get yelled at by angry customers lol but overall it is like any customer service job but they give you the power to make choices
good,Every one is friendly and don't mind giving out a helping hand to anyone in need. The work environment Is clean and a pleasure to be in. Very relaxed but can get a high tempo when busy.
good,"A typical day at work was a good long tiring one < good days worth of work, Culture was great , Friendly understanding coworkers and managers , great place overall"
good,productive workplace with room for improvement in house  supervisors worked well with you also also cross trained in other areas of the warehouse pretty good place overall and weekly pay period
good,"The job is lovely if you embrace the atmosphere, culture, and the typical products. If you don't care to chat it up for upwards of thirty minutes with a single customer then shy away. Also, if you aren't prepared to study the products on your free time then you will never meet company metrics or daily goals given by management. Otherwise it's a lovely job."
good,"I love working at Williams Sonoma, I was train to do latterly everything in the sewing department. I'm glad Williams train me how to sew thanks to them I'm now a production sewer. I love the benefits they offer and I love the people always so nice and kind."
good,My department was all about production. We had a goal that we were always to meet. We never did meet that goal cause we we didn't have the manpower. We were short staffed.
good,"I came in as a Full Service Associate, (C.S.R.) and in just 2 short months I was at the Command Center. "
good,A large organization with a pleasant work environment. Most employees seem to have achieved a good work/life balance.
good,a typical day at work was being very productive but still being safe working plenty of overtime learning something new daily management was great they kept an open door policy my co-workers were very caring about their jobs and what went on around them the hardest part of my job was the heat in which we had an oven used to bond the finished product the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to travel to different parts of Florida for the company to grand openings to make sure our product was 100% on point
good,"management kept you up to date on everything"
good,My review is based on what I learned and experienced while working at Williams Sonoma Inc.
good,"learned a lot it was agreat place to learn.lots of overtime.leaned new skills,long hours"
good,William-Sonoma is a very well respected company that has several companies in its enter workings. Working for each company you com encounter with all walks of life and get to help handle problems that may accure with someones order. Having helpful co-workers and supportive management ensures any employee that they have the tools to properly help the customers in anyway. The hardest part of this Job is not enjoying the work that you do. The coworkers make the job the most enjoable. 
good,"It was easy to work here. The training programs weren’t big but we had the tools we needed to get the job done."
good,As much fun as you can have at a call center. I loved the people I worked with and the perks of working for WSI. The customers are on a completely different level of rude. The company treats you well.
good,"Azienda corporate, ti addestrano in modo completo, puoi aggiornarti, fare corsi, flessibilità nell'orario di ufficio. Ho lavorato con un bel team!"
good,"The training instructor was excellent and very reliable.  We learned how to deal with problems and how to find solutions.  Management was very approachable and the co-workers were very nice.  The working atmosphere was excellent.  We worked at home but if there was any technical problem with our system, we had the opportunity to go to the center and work from there.  The hardest part of the job was that if we had technical problems, we only had one hour to report to the center.  This was hard for me because I live very far away from the center."
good,"working there was a great experience to me I met great people in a great environment,got to meet good customers on the truck deliveries and got a lot chances to travel out of Memphis."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers. Williams Sonoma customers are friendly, respectful, and wanting to learn more about the products."
good,"My personal preference is to have that person to person contact, so it made it difficult to work from home as I prefer a team environment. It is a wonderfully fast-paced, non-stop day where I was able to experience tremendous growth in my customer service skills, especially with de-escalating angry guests. There isn't any value placed on you as an individual and training is 100% technical focused, going at the speed of the slowest in class."
good,I would refer anyone to work here at anytime. Great place to learn new things that will help you the rest of your life even if you don't retire here.
good,Typical day at work was I got all of my orders when I get in to work and start my day off at work was. I really enjoy my job play as a team-player and and like the company that I work for
good,Almost all of the people were great. There was very little favoritism played. You received weekly reviews. 
good,"During peak seasons, incentives, such as bonuses, are given on an employee's check. Other times, they have given away cars. Overall, I enjoyed working at WSI. I was in the personalization department. I enjoyed watching the colors of thread get monogrammed on the customer's items."
good,"The only real issue is the outdated Software. It's embarrassing. That is probably why turn over, overall is horrible. WSI needs a user friendly interface, nothing like bouncing around 2 to 3 programs, while using Google Chrome. It shouldn't take forever to get through a call. Overall it's not bad. Trainers were nice. The company has amazing products, recipes etc."
good,"It was good work everyone was respectful didn't have any misunderstandings or agreements ,I worked for Williams n Sonoma threw an agency in I no longer work there due to lack of hours received due to agency"
good,Its a fun place to work. The lead people are real cool. U get all your hours. The people are friendly and very helpful.
good,Great learning experience I worked hard and meet a lot of new people  I was a qa for about a month then I transfered  to the supply cage were I helped the sewer with thread and diff supplies
good,I did enjoy working with the company for the time period I did. The company was productive and I learn many skills from the job. I would recommend this employee to anyone.
good,le doy todas esta valoraciona william sonoma porque se lo merece muy buen trabajo en general todo es bueno
good,William Sonoma Is A Excellent Job To Work They All Have Good Personality And They Well Work With You If You Have Any Problems I Love William Sonoma They Pay Is Also Good Plus The Work Is Not Hard At All
good,Very good work area and I like the way they take time to train and how they don’t immediately rush but I’ve decided to find a job with a little bit better pay
good,Coordinate the creation and communication of purchase orders for textile business. Further improved Excel skill as a professional tool. communicated across team in order to make sure decisions were executed in the most time efficient manner.
good,I learned a lot about factory work and a warehouse situation. I liked all my co workers and they were fun to be around.
good,Durning the duration of this job I was taught monogram stenciling and how to do production and work as a team to get a job done. The hardest part for me about the job was having to leave. I feel that for my first warehouse job it was really enjoying and I gained a lot of knowledge.
good,"Its a good place to work at before , everything changed. Management changed and then less work , work is getting boring with barely any days, life is just passing me by waiting on a route"
good,work hours are nice i was able to work from six a.m to 2 p.m. Cool job to have overall.
good,"Liked working at one of my favorite stores. They give you a good discount on purchases, you just have to watch out that you don't spend your whole paycheck."
good,Williams-Sonoma was a good job to have as far as seasonal work. I made a lot of money in a short amount of time there and I enjoyed it. If I had the opportunity to become a full time employee with benefits at the time I probably would have taken the job then but the facility shut down after that season of employment.
good,"No room for advancement or promotion. Fast paced and detail oriented. Mostly just a seasonal job, unless you get into a specialty team. Work with constant supervision, no independent work"
good,"very tiresome, standing in one place for long periods of time handling a sewing machine. then when the peak season hits doing 12 plus hours gets very tired leaving early in the am then having to come back to work again a week straight"
good,For a wfh job is good but the pay is too low and you have to do a lot. It can be very stressful. System is old and needs to be updated. Once you learn the system and position you are in there. There is no job stability. And if you cant deal with rude customers dont checks in the mail dont come on time either.apply.
good,"worked close to holiday.  My fellow employees were fun, knowledgeable and taught me  about the products.  I learned how to widow dress and be proactive."
good,Good job Just looking for some better when you have kids an bills. Good workers good people good place to get the job done an have a good day at work .
good,At first when I started at this job I really didnt like it because of the heavy work load but everyone was willing to help one another so that made it much easier
good,Works with college kids and school kids also.Great company who have managers that really care and wants you to succeed even if you don’t stay after peak season
good,A typical day at work is normally slow more then busy and the management staff is helpful. For the most part the hardest task on the job is nothing. Everything is easy
good,I love my job this. Love the experience here also love the things i've learned. This is another place i can call home. My floor supervisor is the best!
good,"I helped process each order by scanning each product that's in the box ,checking each order making sure everything is in the box before it get shipped out."
good,Great Overall Company. Poor Leadership In Some Areas. Very Large Company But Very Unorganized. One Of The Most Stable Companies To Work For. Benefits Are Great.
good,I Loved William Sonoma It was a team work environment we had supportive managers that helped up work together and actually Co-Work I Will love to participate in another work environment like that

A  typical day is a typical retail day - customer service and guidance, straightening, restocking, etc. The culture of the workplace always involves teamwork, on-the-job training and employee rewards and motivation, when it's earned.

I've received lots of support from coworkers and encouragement from my manager along my journey with this company.
good,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was a good company to work for.  While the supervisors would tell the associates to just handle phone escalations themselves, they had already prepared them to handle these situations through their well planned training sessions.  Advancement in job opportunities with the company could go as fast as you wanted it to.  All that was required is that you go by the company guidelines, and keep the customer satisfied.  The environment was fast paced, and fun to be involved with.  Typically, the start of everyday would be to clock in, situate your desk space, and prepare your computer screen so that when a customer called, you would be ready to assist them at a moments notice.  Throughout the day it was a goal to keep the calls flowing as fast as possible so the maximum amount of customers could be helped on a daily basis.  At the end of the day even being stuck on a call wasn't a terrible experience, you could hang up that phone and log out at the end knowing you helped one more customer be at ease with their orders placed with the company."
good,All about the results. Fun work place to create and dream. Large company but makes you feel like family. Not enough horus for associates.

good,"This was a fun job! I worked here for only the season as that is all they had available at the time for the holidays. I mostly did gift wrap, and shipping and receiving for inventory. Great people to work with, relaxed at home environment."
good,Points given on attendance even when issues arose on their end. If system went down had an hour to fix or take a point. No control over internet or phone company issues. They pay great and the work is awesome. We had teams and your team members are amazing but supervisor support wasn't there.
good,Underpaid for the support staff. The workload doesn't match the pay. There is not much growth potential for staff. Not a lot of training. Understaffed.

good,"At the office that I worked, I was very fortunate to be on one of the few teams that do not take calls: MerchOps. I loved having the freedom to pace myself and really drive at the company's goals. However, the office were I worked like to micromanage between departments. There are lots of seasoned workers who were intimidated by both new hires and temps, so there's a lot of corporate politics are play. Diverse is missing here as well from top management all the way down to hiring. Pay is quite low as well. On the flip side, there are lots of company discount events and company-sponsors charitable work."
good,"Great place to work if you are full time, good hours lots of prizes giving away during peak season. You can move around work and different areas. Employees are nice"
good,William-Sonoma is a good company to work for if you can get a job there. I immensely enjoyed my time there and spent nearly my whole paycheck there as it was my second job. Problems in the store came from corporate as they began drastically cutting payroll to satisfy promises made to shareholders to the point that we went from four to five employees in the store one quarter to just two employees the next.
good,"I don't wish to give a review of William Sonoma Inc at this time, this location was closed in January 2017 with only 1 week notice to the management staff too locate another full time position comparable."

good,"A typical day at work was to analyze orders, credit orders and track shipments (please see resume). I learned many things within holding 3 positions at this company. Management structure needs to improve on directive and communication skills. Work place culture was engaging of its values. The hardest part of the job was deadlines when you did not have the time to work on them while you were having to give full time and energy to daily job tasks. The most enjoyable would be having the ability to help customers in with complex order situations."

good,"William-Sonoma Pottery barn is a great Company to be apart of.I worked there for a little over a year, and never had an issue out of one person.There arent many jobs people can say that about job .At potter barn a normal shift for me would consist of me starting by, walkiong the aisles to be sure they are clear to prevent any injuries or issues. Next would be to check all cash representatives upstairs to see if there is any merchandise that needs to go downstairs to the warehouse, chairs, lamps, beds, duvetes. if the item requires heavy lifting once it reaches the backdooor, its placed on the furniture lift. This transports heavier items from the warehouse to upstairs. it could be for a customer pick up,delivery or for display on the main floor.During these task I would also have to take stock checks, the sales assocites call over a microphone headset to the warehouse searching for variety of items.If the item the customer is interest in is in stock it is transported to the main floor for purchasing or to the back door. At the end of the day closing duties require all trash to be empty, bathrooms to be checked, and floors are cleaned. all doors are to be locked and supplies are to be put back in designated areas.The managment swtched from time to time I had 2 general managers within the time I was Potter Barn. They were both very nice to work for the time I was there. The hardest part of the job sould be working in the cold in the mornings during the ups makes there routine drop off averaging around 300-400 pieces a day as far as ware house associates there were few. the cold"

good,"This place is pretty good to work for full time. If you’re a temp then it might just be another job but if you do put in your work and take it seriously, they will hire you on. I was there only 2 years until I moved up to a lead and was running an operation with 100+ associates with only 3 other leads and I was only 19. I did get fired for a very small mistake that could have been fixed but they take mispunches very seriously. They do have long hours during the holidays and 6 days a week most of the time but hey... when you get a paycheck with $800 in your pocket every week you can’t really complain.

good,I love helping people and considering I had a 5 star rating the whole time I worked there I think the people liked me helping too.  It was only seasonal though so I was one of very many who did not get kept on but even for just a seasonal position it was great!  They start looking in like end of August/September for their busy season (black Friday & Christmas!) so I will DEFINITELY try to do it again.

good,"Slow paced store, enjoyable- bilingual is important in the center of miami. "
good,"Addressed the customer's needs and attempted to find the solutions to their particular problem. I am a people person and received much satisfaction helping each and every customer. "
good,William Sonoma is very flexible in some areas and rigid in others. Overall it is an excellent company. The learning process is extensive and it is daily. There are always new things to learn or new ways to do old things...innovative. The management was very relaxed and open. Most of our interactions were done on Skype. The hardest part of the job was having to tell a customer 'no' when their requests went outside of company policy...you have to say 'no' but at the same time make them feel good about it...takes finesse! What I liked best about WS customer service was all of the many ways they provided to assist a customer in meeting their needs...customers are the only reason businesses exist and with competition as high as it is in today's marketplace it is a necessity to provide great service...for the customer and the company.
good,"This was a seasonal job for me. While I was there I enjoyed it! It was fun, fast paced, supervisor was friendly and understanding. The customers were the best!"
good,"It was a nice office atmosphere and I enjoyed most of the customers, can be very stressful if you cant deal with exclusive customers in their anger in receiving wrong product at Christmas, but you are given a lot of support by the company."
good,"It was a great work place. I hate my assignment ended and I had to relocate, but if I had the chance to move back to Memphis this company would be my first choice!!! Overall I experience a lot working here the staff and employees were awesome😊"
good,"Because I worked in a large call center, and mostly for Corporate customers, the demand for trying for perfection I took very seriously"
good,"Working opening or closing hours can be challenging when there is so much to do. Busy times can be hectic when we are understaffed. Everyone works well together, it's a good staff. Amazing benefits that extend across all the brands. I truly love this company and agree full-heartedly with the new re-branding mission statement. I've learned that I love helping people; engaging in conversation, interested in their interests and views, and mainly making their visit and purchase an enjoyable experience."
good,"Overwhelming at first but has excellent policies that support both customer and employee ie returns, catalog shopping, sanitation. High quality products so no qualms about what one is selling."
good,"My work hours was 4:00 am until 2:30 pm, and sometimes during peak time 4:00 am until 4:00 pm..."
good,"Great atmosphere, teamwork, and employees! Great customers! Continuous learning, growth, and genuinely values customers and employees!"
good,sewing customers merchandise was fun just seeing the machine going. Making the customer satatied with their merchainse.
good,"When you get hired that is the easy part but the hard part about this job is the training not only is it very early in the morning but you can NEVER be late, once your late it goes on  your record and they are very strict about that if you have three late tardy on your record you automatically will have to sit with  your supervisor and talk about resigning or leaving. Other than that there are so many people there to work with you will never remember everyone's name but it is still a great job to work for if you want to work from home and not have to commute."
good,"A typical day at work is smooth sailing, fun and  productive. Coworkers are very down to earth and everyday you learn something new from one of the managers. The hardest part of the job is being able to have thorough knowledge of all merchandise and services. Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining experience and learning about things and having access to a lot of people with great knowledge."
good,My review for this company is that it was an overall great experience. Williiams-sonoma is a great job experience for me and my co-workers were awesome!
good,"a full day of answering inbound calls for rental of automobiles;"
good,"well i answer lots of calls, and i help many people which makes me happy. I do what I have to too, to make our customer s happy,"
good,"I enjoyed working at Williams-Sonoma, Inc"
good,"Great company to work for, opportunities to move up within the company readily available. Great pay for hourly employees as well."
good,"Williams-Sonoma is a great place to work. Where Associates  internally and externally practice giving excellent service. Working for this great company has lots of benefits and prizes. Good Insurance coverage, good pay and flexible hours. I would tell my friends about a great experience at Williams-Sonoma."
good,"long hours, tough work, have to work as fast as possible but without mistakes. good diversity of employees. fun job."
good,"learning about new kitchen tools and supplies. when everything gets checked in, it gets boring in the back so I go out front to help the customers."
good,"I was in charge of all the store fixtures and window displays. Followed plano-grams, monthly and seasonal changes with new merchandise. Example: holiday product and appliances.In charge of keeping shelves well stocked."
good,The management level here is very supportive and encouraging.
good,"it's a great company,  love the fact that one can shop with other people."
good,"Excellent training program with superior staff and managers. Bonus program is lucrative and employee discount is high!"
good,"It was something new for me, I've worked in retail before but not in the kitchen wear department.   It  was a challenge that i took on head first and did well above of what i expected. I feel it sharpened my customer service skills, it made me have to think outside the box."
good,"Great company, great products. Corporate culture is good. will take some time to get promoted."
good,"I am a very proud employee of Williams Sonoma. The management is not only encouraging but they also show their appreciation, I love that you are allowed to show your creative side and it's encouraged when it comes to cooking and design. The team members are all full of energy and smiles. I feel that the only thing that could make this company any better would be if there was better pay. Min wage with no commission is only great if you are not making this your only source of income. I always enjoy going in and some days I don't want my shift to end."
good,easy going job the hardest part of the job is standing 10 hrs everyday most enjoyable part the easy work
good,Cool Job...great managers..great coworkers and work ennvironment..chance to advance were not good!
good,I loved the company it payed we for me to be able to take care of my family I would have loved to gk bacm to that company but I had to come to Kansas to take care of my daughter majority of my time there drove stand up forklifts but I started doing general labor
good,It was a great environment to have fun and do your job and no be bogged down with the pressures of everyday life. They play games and give out prizes and have raffles for their merchandise.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was a seasonal employee so I believe it was the busiest time for retail and I thoroughly enjoyed selling the products.
good,"Everything food related from small appliances to spices and sauces, this job will keep your palet and you mind busy and entertained. The variety of people thatcome thru is refreshing."
good,working here almost 15 years enjoy the people that i work with.  Just hate that it took so long to get a good raise for hourly pay. Some of the people that been there 10 plus years should get compensated more than people there less than 5 years of service.
good,i had some slow and and some fast... in the beginning it was fast but after a few hours started slowing down... the managers are nice and co workers are respectful
good,A typical day at work of answering customer calls. The calls range from helping the customer place an order to helping the customer locate their refund or order. I've learned working from home isn't as easy as expected. I think it's harder working from home then at a store. The hardest part of the job is not having an answer for the customer and they become agitated with you. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the help from the supervisors and other associates.
good,"I really love working at Williams Sonoma.  The staff and the clientele are fabulous and you are selling products that you can stand by. Plus,  you get to learn about new and different foods."
good,"The work area was very relaxing place, it got hectic when the company had to meet a certain budget of getting the furniture out of the warehouse. Overall the company is great."
good,"I would highly recommend WSI seasonal job, I love having the freedom to make decisions and make exception to certain issues, at least I have power to control the calls fully.  I love the fact management sent us an email a couple days  before Christmas to tell us the seasonal positions are coming to end and thank us for our great service. The only thing is some customers can not afford the products and try to live beyond their income and budget and they will call  cry and complain to get discounts and they will literally lied about products never deliver and damaged to get their money back."
good,i am able to help customers with orders daily...helping them to reach satisfaction. you have the power to make decisions to secure customer satisfaction.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my short time working at this company. The work environment was very supportive and interesting. Working hours were perfect and the overall environment was simply a joy!
good,"I worked over the Christmas season and I really enjoyed my time here. It was a customer service call center. They offer full benefits for permanent workers, voluntary time off (which is great if you're running a little late or have a last minute appointment), and you can sign up for as much or as little overtime as you want. The people who work there are laid-back and understanding if you have any issues that need tending to. The environment/atmosphere was very comfortable. In training, they teach you everything you need to know before you get on the phone and then they give you a week of on-the-phone training where there are multiple people there to assist you if you have any questions/problems so you don't go out onto the floor blind. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, was the customers. They (usually) aren't rude and are pretty understanding/patient when you're working on an issue for them."
good,"I only worked seasonally from oct-jan for about yrs and i met great people while working there gained alot of experience that i use to this day."
good,"fast paced environment, great products great management at times. The only thing is their computer system is so slow. that would be my only complaint. More bonuses or a commission of selling not a contest thats yearly."
good,I loved working at Williams-Sonoma for many reasons. It has a good atmosphere to be in and you get great discounts. By far better working experience in retail than some other places.
good,It is a wonderful product line to sell and the 40% discount justifies the part time or seasonal salary. Unfortunately some of the stores do  not provide very little space for employee breaks.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Wonderful people to work with and wonderful customers to help with merchandise and pick the right merchandise for their situation. Everyone is so friendly and does their best to help everyone else. The bad part about it was the management. The General Manager is there everyday and is awful and managing. She curses in front of customers, embarrasses employees in front of customers, and just makes working for her very difficult."
good,I love what I do and that I am able to work from the comfort of my own home. I come to work daily with an attitude that I am going to assist as many customers as I can without them getting upset about an error with an order.
good,"Work days are simple. Selling High end kitchen gadgets was a nice change to my experience. This is a great place to work with great discount. If you love to cook and talk about cooking, you will enjoy this job."
good,Typical day at work includes helping customers and restocking kitchen appliances and gadgets. The work environment is great. The coworkers are very helpful. There weren't many hard days working here. The most enjoyable part of the job was trying all the new products and learning new cooking techniques.
good,William-Sonoma was by far the best call center I work that in my life was daily prizes trips and food how they treat you you will fall in love and as much overtime as you can handle
good,"Williams-Sonoma has some of the nicest people on staff I've ever met. I'd help as much as possible around the back room and on the sales floor when needed, and they never asked too much. Everyone supported one another; my supervisors were out on the floor just as much as I was."
good,Williams - Sonoma was a great job very helpful with the employees and on top of everything they do. It was a great easy job and I was very sad to leave.
good,"Nobody takes a job here for a high salary.  You take it for the benefits and the culture.  I love to cook, I love to teach.  Therefore, I taught cooking classes.  A very family friendly work environment and wonderful staff to work with.  I learned so much at this job and definitely keep them in mind if I need part time employment again."
good,"From day one its all about the customers and bottom line. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Williams-Sonoma on South Lake in Pasadena. I worked with a great team of people who were knowledgeable, fun and spirited. I met some amazing people from all other the world. I learned a great deal about customer service at Williams-Sonoma."
good,I will forever will be grateful for all the achievements I earned there and will be forever grateful for the skills I learned the people and the trainers are AMAZING!!!!!
good,"Apart from some personal turmoil that I was dealing with (nothing to do with WS), my time at Williams-Sonoma was very gratifying and educational."
good,"Williams-Sonoma cares about its employees. They encourage the personal and professional development of their employees. "
good,Had early morning hours that gave me time to take care of my elderly mother's needs. Had time to schedule doctors appointments as well as other needs.
good,"Kept up on emails from the Company for our daily goals."
good,A typical day at work is not bad. You place orders and make returns. I learned how to place different types of orders. Management was good at keeping the employees up to date on changes. Co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job is trying to fix someone else's mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"Everyone there is very friendly and knowledgeable. I believe it is because of that fact that it is hard to advance in the company. No one wants to leave. So, if you are not in the management field, you are part-time."
good,The job and the workers will work with you if you are new coming in. The managers give gifts and show appreciation to workers when they complete their task in an outstanding manner.
good,"Responsible for conceptualization and execution of all in-store visual concepts, marketing strategies, public relations tactics, and personal shopping events; reported directly to Corporate Visual Directors and Regional Manager."
good,The company alone is very few that stand by their products and name.  Life-time warranty.  Rarely were there any unhappy customers.
good,"Typical Day at work you would come in & immediately see your daily spliffs and whatever contest was going on. You would get your desk number and immediately set up and get your day going. I learned a lot during training and felt comfortable on the floor and was able to get going with no hesitation. Management was excellent they were there when you needed help and they were there to encourage you and congratulate you daily on a job well done. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that just calls and screams before you can you thank them for calling and how can I help them. Overall the job was enjoyable, the contests between the reps was something to look forward to because you want to be the best and bring in numbers."
good,"It was important to keep the store organized and neat while following the guide line set by corporate. The things I learned most was about retail and ways to boost sales and profit. Management was always helpful and allowed me to learn all the different areas of working in the store."
good,I loved working at William Sonoma. They had such a silly staff and everyone is so cheery. I wasn't as fond of the New York location because the management tend to use foul language and didn't respect their employees as much but the Lynnwood location was great. The employee discount was also a major plus working here.
good,"Great workplace environment. Professional management team. I learned many new things about display, and merchandising. Friendly and helpful co-workers. Although this was a seasonal part time job. I enjoyed the entire experience while I was employed there."
good,"Williams~Sonoma taught me about the art of providing great customer service. Assisting customers and providing the best product knowledge was important. I learned the more you know, the more you can inform and sell merchandise making sure customers leave feeling great about their purchase. I also learned how to cook by attending cooking sessions held at the store. The challenge was making sure I was ready to provide the best service to our secret shoppers, and of course I overcame this every time."
good,"Team workout. Pack,pick and scan items before monogramming.Spell checknames.Work as a team and help other. When lines are down work is slow.Great gift,rewards company picnic and dinners."
good,This warehouse is a good fast past job. Has good hours and different areas to work and learn new things. I enjoyed working for this company. I enjoyed the work as well as the people.
good,Its pretty much the same thing every day there everyone knows what’s got to be done and how long we have to do it.What I learned from working there is sometimes you can have fun and work at the same time which is a very valuable lesson if you ask me.Managment was amazing honestly they were so cool and understanding.I can’t ever recall a time when the job was ever any more difficult than it needed to be.
good,"I was only seasonal, but the time there was wonderful. Management and coworkers were all friendly. I was happy to come to work and enjoyed being in the gift wrap and stocki"
good,"Great experience working here. I have no negative comments to describe my time working here. The salary was very competitive, the employees were nice and the boss was very flexible."
good,"I loved working there; really wished I wasn't laid off due to lack of work. The team work orientation is what made working there fun, and -with all of the safety training- I felt like I didn't have to worry much about onsite accidents."
good,"Customer service, sales, and furniture rep. Great hours, great training, some very awesome management. Until you are given someone whom does not help you. Makes your job a little hard to do"
good,I loved this opportunity because I was allowed to learn freely. There was not a cap on what we could achieve and we were guided along the way. I feel helped and heard. I also felt like I could achieved what they set before me and I was not abandoned. The days were long but not so difficult that It couldnt be done. My supervisors and trainers were the absolute best and I appreciated all that they did for us.
good,"In at a certain time, count bank and 4 registers."
good,Very fun fast paced company.  Start in sales and work your way up.  Dies have very strict company policies for handling problems.  Many opportunities for overtime and promotion
good,"Sales associate, cashier meeting people ,helping them decide on products and providing great customer service.  You get to meet some interesting people. Great part time job."
good,Worked at William Sonoma when I was in college . It was a fun place to work at . Especially on holidays . You get to test out the new holiday products . Management was great . It is a great job if you need extra income or going to school  or a first time job to start off with . .
good,Its8a very good job very relaxing! There's nothing I did not like about working there!!! I'll recommend anyone to work there!! Everyone is outgoing & easy to get alone with!!
good,"Loading and scanning Stacking a certain type way "
good,"Good working environment, fast paced and friendly people, great give aways and games, the break room is clean and the leads are willing to help with any task"
good,"I have worked in all three buildings William Sonoma has and I must say, I loved each one of them. The system William Sonoma operate on is incredibly will crafted and you also get bonuses with production."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Williams Sonoma. Our work environment was beautiful, I loved coming to work every day just to see the newly decorated tables and shelving. The products that Williams-Sonoma carries are some of the best in the world and it was so much fun to taste, sample, or use the new lines. The management team was amazing."
good,Un ambiente tranquilo  muy amigable personas  decentes  ttabajo en equipo muy bueno
good,Thoroughly enjoy being a member of the management team. Company has been a pleasure to work for. Great benefits and very conducive to home and family life. I have been lucky enough to have great district and general managers that have made my experience great.
good,Williams and Sonoma is a very great company.  I enjoyed all of the employees that I worked with.  My managers were excellent.  They took the time to train each of us new employees individually based on our needs.  The hardest part of the day for me was always gift wrapping.  It's not a skill I will personally ever master and my friends at work noticed that and we worked out a system were I would take over one of their tasks if they would wrap my purchases.   I would recommend this as a place to shop and work to anyone.
good,"I really liked Williams Sonoma. It was a Layed Back job ,Hard at times. But I always got through the day always had help from my supervisor once I got the hang of things I was helping others"
good,"this was fun and enjoyable place to work , I not only had a good work experience , but I also had very helpful mentors to help me if I got stuck or need to find  something"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is you can meet different people from multi-background in a single day. I am a person who like to coordinate with a diverse population. As a cashier, I meet every buyer during my shifts which provides me the opportunity to talk to them. The working environment is great and co-workers are nice."
good,"Started on early shift at 5:00 AM.  This allowed me to have time for life since I was off work at 1:30 pm."
good,"williamsonma was  a great place  to work , we had benefits  , as well  as the team  treated each other as a family . "
good,"Williams-Sonoma Inc. was a great place to work.  It was an inbound and outbound call center with customers calling to place orders, request returns, and receive credits on orders if necessary.  I learned a lot of different things and tools from this company that I was able to apply to my job everyday and that I would also be able to apply to further job opportunities.  I learned to listen to the customer to find out what their needs and wants were to get the job done efficiently with the customer knowing that I would be able to get the job done.  I was very close to my supervisors and always went to them with ideas and questions to better my customer service.  The hardest part of the job was communication.  When a customer would call, as a customer service associate, we would note everything the customer called about and sometimes the information wasn't there.  Even thought the information would be absent, I would use any tools necessary, (calling UPS, speak with other departments in the company) to make sure the customer was being appreciated.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the monthly contests that were held for having the highest sales, or having the most customer compliments.  I am competitive in a good way and it was fun to participate in those activities."
good,A typical day consisted of packing and wrapping the ordered products and aiming to meet the quota of the day. I had a variety in ages for co-workers which was pleasant and management was extremely welcoming! The hardest part of the job was when orders took a plug and people were sent home. The most enjoyable part was my time spent learning from management and the elders on the job.
good,"a typical day at work would be arriving on time for my shift, reporting to the manager to get an update on the duties for the day which typicaly are auditing inventory, receiving inventory, stock checks ect. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of daily inventory, Safety meetings, Driving a fork lift, creating excel spreadsheets for management. I learned how to be a professional in a corporate world and not to be afraid of anything that comes my way. Management would encourage associates to apply for job postings and to be cross trained for every position possible. My co-workers were eager and great to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new and exciting things."
good,Steady pace great working hours awesome environment there were no hard part to everything was easy I learned how load a trailer my co-workers were great
good,A typical day at work was a easy day which involves 25 mistakes for the whole day . I learned how to pack and how to overcome my shyness and talk/help others. The management was great they made sure if we needed help they had enough leads to help anyone who had a question . My co workers were very respectful  and were hard workers. There really wasnt a hard part the only time it got a little stressful was when it was over 35 mistakes in one day . The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others and meeting new people .
good,"One of my hobbies is cooking, and I love it. This store was so much fun! I headed up their cooking classes done on-site. This was the most enjoyable part of my job. Unfortunately the mall they were located in lost several large specialty retailers and closed , as well as this store. Closing the store was the hardest part of this job."
good,Unload trucks.. Work at your own pace.. Everyone helped each other.. Friendly co-workers
good,The atmosphere is very casual. I could come in and leave anytime I wanted and the dress code was casual everyday. Everyone was friendly including management. HR had the most fair rules I have ever witnessed in terms of everybody being treated the same across the board. Every Friday you could leave at 2 pm and still be paid for the entire day and they gave you free apples. If you were working late they would order pizza for everyone and the view was amazing. Hands down the best corporate job I ever had.
good,Very organized company. Provided training to succeed in job performance. Great support from management. Highly recommend this company. I like how the company offered you overtime when hours was available. I also like that they gave you opportunity to exit if call volume was low.
good,"High quality all around....from the goods sold to my co-workers!  I couldn’t have asked for a better work environment!  Plus, the bonus time of the holiday season offered us some tasty treats to sample!"
good,"I like working at Williams-Sonoma I find ways to be innovative, and cater to all people , a fun family orientated loving atmosphere and most of all worldwide customer service that I demonstrated at      Williams-Sonoma . I can see myself working there for many years because this is the place that is absolutely fabulous."
good,I would work here again.  I worked here a short time in 2012. I thought it was a great job. They train you really well. They make sure your are ready for your work.
good,"Great culture, great management,great training and a great place to work. A friendly and safe  originated place to work.Your assignment and goals are of a teamwork nature and everyone truly work together to attain production.I would recommend Williams Sonoma to anyone, who wants to excel in this good economy."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was selling a quality product to a customer excited to learn about and use it."
good,Really  enjoyed  working  there.  They also have or had work at home. The only downfall for working at home is they do not provide the computer. It would be wonderful if they provided the computer and the monitor the phones and they dedicated internet line in order to work from home
good,"Probably the best job ive ever had, the management, workers are really friendly. They willing to go the extra mile just to help you, they even have a gym with showers, and a pool table. Cool place to work"
good,O packed products to be shipped off around the world.put lamps on the boxes stuffed the boxes to male sure nothing would break.and make sure the right label is on the boxes so that it could go to the right place.
good,Williams Sonoma is an excellent job to have but it's seasonal and to budget your money only working about 3 months out of 12; it's a great job to have other than that.
good,I loved working here and was very sad when the season was up. I started as seasonal and was let go after the seasonal time because there just wasn't enough positions open to stay. The customers were happy people and it was an awesome job. Wish I could have stayed.
good,Fun place to work great benefits nice discount my managers and Veteran Associates are very helpful and considerate they're very flexible when it comes to doctor's appointments and emergencies the only catch is you get 11 points before dismissal so you just have to play a smart when it comes to call offs
good,Waking up and going to work in jammies is great. Help with problems were dealt with quickly.Supervisors were very helpful. Loved working for Williams Sonoma.
good,The managers are great depending on the area the job is really easy they make you feel like family very ethnic you get great discounts plenty of vacation days good pay
good,I have greatly enjoyed working for William's Scotsman Inc. The pay is very competitive for the line of work that is accomplished and the benefits are very good. It is a fun and energetic work environment.
good,Super fun company to work for.  Supportive co-workers and Supervisors. The atmosphere was positive and friendly. Training class was informative and helpful.
good,I worked here as a seasonal employee over Christmas. It was a good experience and I learned quite a bit about kitchen gadgets to be able to assist customers in their purchases.
good,"Depends on your motives, I’d work a 40-55 hour week paid for 75+ hours average a $950 paycheck every week. Did overnight runs which are actually sweet! Much easier than running local! I rarely complain it’s a job that has to be done! I felt like I was home here! Just hit 2 years and steady climbing! Pay raise every year! Bonus every month! No CDL."
good,"The company has a neat workshop. "
good,day to day task assisting customers on the phone with confirming orders and canceling orders. replacing damage items or items that wasn't delivered. Document calls and maintain quality goals.
good,I had a great experiance working at Williams Sonoma. It is a very pleasant and friendly work place. I worked for union square store as a seasonal visual merchandiser. I took my first steps as a visual merchandiser there and thats why this place is very special to me. I had very friendly team and loved and enjoyed working there. Only hard part I can think of was that I was working during Christmas period and worked couple of night shift to decorate the store.
good,"I have a little different perspective. I started off in the stock room and worked my way up to management. The early days were tough because pay was not great and there were no benefits. I loved the job, though. Once I advanced to management I thought the pay was fair and I started receiving benefits."
good,"Employee discount at 40%"
good,"It was peak season so it was a very fast paced environment. Overall the managers were understanding, co-workers were very hospitable. I’d likely go back"
good,"Always voted one of the best companies by its employees. I actually got to meet Chuck Williams at my store. Management training program including eeoc, diversity in the workplace, safety and more top notch. The company always strives to better its through bettering its employees."

good,I enjoy coming to work.  Fun environment.  Great employee discounts.  Everyone gets along well.  The company utilizes your strengths and allows  you to shine.
good,It is a good place to work for just looking for something different and closer to home. Very fast pace working environment.
good,"This employer was only for a season.  It was a fun place to work because customer service is easier over the phone.  The location of the call center was awesome (upscale neighborhood), the pay was good, hours were very flexible, and breaks/lunches were very fair."
good,"The Williams Sonoma workplace was very relaxed and easy. While working there I learned a great deal about planning parties and providing tools for specific occasions. The management was always willing to take timeout of their day to help employees learn about new sales and products, and how to prepare for holidays. My co-workers, even though many of them were much older than me, were always friendly and helped whenever I didn't understand or if I needed someone with a more experienced point of view. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with seasonal products. They often were sent in several months before, and we didn't have storage for them, and they then went on sale the day after the holiday, and we had to keep them on the floor until they were sold. "
