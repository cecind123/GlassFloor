rating,review
bad,"You get paid half as much as the other employees while you do their job,managers treat you horribly and cuss at you and blame you for everything even when it isnt your fault."
bad,They really need to get it together their they are so desperate for workers they will hire anyone. The machine constantly break or doesn't work well at all.
bad,It's all about how much you brown nose the Plant Manager then how well you do your job.  Controller is useless and will be one of the reasons why the Plant closes.
bad,Good place to work just hard to get hired on friendly people and fast pace work you get short breaks and short lunches and they work you overtime a lot
bad,This is the worst company to work for. The environment is horrible and the management is horrible as well. They work you like slaves and will fire you for anything. I would prefer anyone to look past this job because there is no future in it!
bad,"This company steadily reduced employee benefits with each buyout, and now have the worst culture of anywhere I've worked.  There is no such thing as job security or advancement, and they prefer to get rid of long-time workers to hire college grads for much less. The hardest part of this job was knowing that whatever work I did would be undervalued even while credit would be taken for the work by those above me.  Management operates on whim and mood, intentionally keeping relevant information (like what time you'll get off on supposed early days) from employees just to play games.  I did learn to write code, and that was a lot of fun, but they continued to pay me as a low-level clerk even while 50% of my time was spent coding.  This is a company that would rather hire multiple people to replace one, rather than give the one employee a deserved raise or promotion."
bad,Doesn't help really. They tell u what to do once and don't explain everything. They work u like a dog and pay hardly nothing at all.I hated working there.
bad,"Jarden was purchased by Newell Brands.  They are a cut-throat company.  The days were busy and long, which I do not mind.  What I mind is the poor lack of communication by upper management.  I am a team player, but with this company you better watch yourself.  I would never recommend anyone to work for a company like this."
bad,Equipment in plant is dated and plant has leaks ans hazardous materials around that would make OSHA shut this place down. Plant is not managed properly.
bad,"this is the most difficult place to work for I have ever encountered. people are so nice but management is off the chain. they say there will be no lay offs, then bam 25 of your best colleagues, people who have been there for over 15 years are walking out the door. so unstable if you need a job that won't fire you for no really good reason."
bad,"Don't apply unless you're desperately in need of a job.  Long days, not a good job if you have a family, management sucks, pay sucks and there's no room for advancement."
bad,"This work environment needs a serious overlook by Undercover Boss, I agree with the person who reviewed this before me. The management wants no interaction between coworkers. They want this place to feel like a prison. I am currently trying to find a new job but am working for this company. This company has the worst micromanaging I've ever felt in my life. The only plus to working here is the pay is nice until you max out on raises at 13.85. How they plan to keep a staff and not give raises is beyond me."
bad,"Jarden Zinc is the worst managed company I have been associated with in 22 years in industry. The leadership is very much a closed off group with no future vision. Their lack of vision is passed on to managers, supervisors, and employees who have no goals or direction and work more hours than anywhere I've known. There are as many salaried employees on site as hourly leading to inevitable job reduction. I would strongly advise anyone considering employment with Jarden Zinc to politely decline."
bad,"Management is bad! Its a culture full of nepotism and favoritism- if you are born into the families with the power structure, or sleeping with a member- your existance is temporary and you are expendable."
bad,this is a good job. I love working for this company. personal issues made it to where i missed to many days. Good pay and good job environment. would work here again.
bad,I went to work for Jarden under the impression that what they told me was true.  Don't take the word of these people... I have never in my life worked for a more unorganized company in my life.  The coworkers was the best part of this job.  They will lure you in by telling you that you won't be doing a job that the higher paid employees do.... Then when you get there you will be doing that job plus some for less pay.
bad,The employees  on the floor are nice & helpful but the management  needs to be out  on the floor to see whats going on. The management  dont want anything to do with the people on the floor
bad,maintenance dept.is really bad no team work!! dept. Head has know idea what he's doing like working with kids and it starts at the top foreman's let hourly guys run the place!!
bad,not a very good place to work or move up. work is slow at the moment so I'm not working a lot and the way they expect more out of some lines and others get away with stuff is wrong.
bad,Management needs an overhaul.  Opinions to improve is not heard. Expected to work 12-15 hour days and available 24/7. High stress.
bad,"Jarden was tough, but needing a job at the time I had to take it until something better came. Being a hard, fast learning worker I excelled but remained a temporary employee with no benefits or insurance. I got hurt and was poorly taken care of, left with nothing but hospital bills."
bad,"They switched to 12 hour shifts. You work 4 days one week 3 days the next but they split up the days off. 2 on 2 off 3 on 2 off 2 on 3 off. Should just be 4 on 3 off 3 on 4 off. You get a ""10 minute"" break every 2 hours but they count the time it takes you to walk to/from the break room so you actually only get about 5 minutes. Lunch is only 20 minutes which isn't much time for anything. They don't give the 30-consecutive-minute break after working 6 hours which is required by Maine labor laws. They expect you to push yourself to keep up with the ridiculous speed of the machines but they don't pay competitive wages. All they care about is production and numbers. They disregard ergonomics, they don't care about and the health and safety of their employees, and they don't care about the quality of their work. They package plastic cutlery but employees are required to grab the cutlery by the head to break the utensils off of the racks. Broken fork in the box? Meh. Cutlery missing? Who cares. Package not closing properly? Too bad. Just. Keep. Up. So many employees getting frustrated trying to keep up: swearing, getting aggravated, throwing/slamming stuff, and I understand why. I can say one thing for sure, after seeing the way the cutlery is handled, I'm never buying plastic cutlery again and I will try my best to avoid ever using them again."
bad,Very low pay no chanch for advancement. Some ten year temps at $8. Hour. Hours are uncertain and not revealed until end of the day. Making it impossible to make personal appointments after work.
bad,I worked at Jardens for three weeks. They would change an 8hr shift to 12 hrs with a hour notice. Nobody is hired permanently. You can work there for years and forever be a temp. The line Leader was very disrespectful to the Packers and treated us as children.  When we worked 12hr shifts we would get the same break as if we were working The 8hr shift. There were no room to advance and the pay was way too low for the type of  work we were doing. My suggestion is to stay as far away from this place as possible. They do not care about the happiness of their employees.
bad,"Supervisors showing lots of favoritism to some employees, and picking on other has not direction how to run or operate the shift. No overtime no raises"
bad,"a great job for shipping an receiving. Team players hard-working co-workers. Loading an unloading trucks, checking to make sure inventory is affection. Checking the quality of the inventory,"
bad,If you're not social you won't like work there because everyone talks and it's dramatic and not a emotionally safe environment. They are taking away benefits and part time.
bad,Dead end job with unprofessional employees. The best part was the onsite private fitness room. If you donâ€™t form a click you get bullied and picked on.
bad,you either work 80 hours a week or 20 hours they don't balance the hours very well and they don't pay to great for the type of work or the kind of work time you put in
bad,This company did not support personal development or hold management accountable.  Focused on numbers only.  Poor team interaction and performance.  Some good people who did not know any better.
bad,"HR Manager decided to cut pay, Vacation days are taken away, plus you get absence points, that leads to termination, for every day missed, even if weather does not allow travel."
bad,this is the former u.s. playing card out of norwood.
bad,Hiring process sucks. And they are very unorganized. 12 hour shifts and every other Saturday. They have a high turn over. Town hall meetings with employees and nothing is getting done.
bad,"7-6 5 Days a week lots to do and follow up."
bad,"After running stamping presses before and CNC lathes, I found that the work there was boring and a lot of busy work. The people are nice. "
bad,"I worked at this company from the time it started up in North Carolina and was there 14 years as team leader. It was a great place to work for several years but it slowly went down - even when Jarden took it over. Supervisors are terrible and the company keeps firing/letting go the employees but should fire the supervisors as I was a supervisor in manufacturing for some 30 years and these people are not supervisory material. When Jarden took it over the benefits went down and the health insurance isn't anything to brag about. I actually quit the job on my own which I have never quit a job during my working career before but just was fed up with management and everything. I'm now in semi-retirement and soon to draw my social security so looking forward to my retirement, although I would have liked to work with Jarden until I was 66 for full retirement but it wasn't worth it with all the stress. Oh, Jarden wanted me to go back after a little over a year since they are having trouble getting team leaders but the fact is - they went through a fellow co-worker there to ask me about coming back. Jarden could not pick up the telephone and call me which would probably had made a difference."
bad,"Management turned over so much, you never know if it will be a good month or bad."
bad,Company did not thoroughly understand the needs of the market and the lack of control it had over third party suppliers. Middle management was not transparent to executive level.
bad,"A CONSTANT FIRE DRILL"
bad,"Company was primarily focused on buying and selling smaller businesses for profit.  Worked at a location that was not considered core to the business so the company closed operations, laid off the employees and sold off the assets."
bad,"We work with firelogs packing and shipping , I really liked the job ,I was on time everyday and never was late . I am one of the best forklift drivers they had"
bad,"Stressful before you get to the office, 1000 emails per day. Learn how to multitask and prioritize workload. Management style was micro managing which made it more difficult to perform duties."
bad,When I first get there I do a PM on my machine and get it started.  I help pack out fans when the line start getting behind and I help service the line with materials they need to make sure they don't run out. All while maintaining my machine.
bad,"Great people, management leaves a lot to be desired.  No direction from upper management and poor morale run through this company."
bad,Solid company that gets the most from its workers.  All job functions will require one to dedicate their time and demand a high priority in one's life.
bad,i worked at a factory were fans were put together and everyone had a duty  of put a part of a fan together i work at the end of the line stamping the back of the fan and and checking to see if the fan work properly before sending it off to packaging. It was a fast paste work place my co-works was good team players and i learn how to move in a very fast paste least there a min. hardest part standing for 8hrs in one place.
bad,I liked my job at Jardin but they choose profits over employees we came to work one day out of the blue Vine or moving to Ohio everybody lost a good paying job in Muncie very unexpected so grown men in tears no warnings no rumors so yeah the management no good profits over employees period. They moved so they can save money to pay a lower wage because they didn't like our union our Union
bad,"Job was high stress, constant machine failures do to poor engineering and lack of training for general employees and then when fall set in they show their true colors and I was basically a temp and never to be hired and let go and glad I was ,then they went to 12 hr shifts . And constant employee turn over ,you never saw the same face twice in a month . They ran lp gas fork lifts inside a non fresh air room ,can you imagine the carbon monoxide these people were inhaling ? not only a poorly ran operation but a toxic environment also"
bad,"Working here use to be the best place in the world, but now you have new management who have there picks. They allow supervisors to talk to people like kids. You cant give a employee a ride. They will not allow black people to advance as much as other races unless you fit in their circle. There is no confidence at all with human recourses. There are a lot of racists people in the office and it shows. The Hispanics can get away with a lot if they complain. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and how they get involve in your personal life and talk behind employees back calling idots and stupid. I use to be a team leader here and there have been so much stress from management people quit that been there years, even supervisors!"
bad,Jarden is a fortune 500 company that has to do with making firelogs.
bad,"Have worked here for almost 11 years, very stressful and very demanding!the manager does not treat his employees fairly at all. It's all about the numbers now and not the quality of our products!"
good,Jarden hires through a temp agency. It's a good just to hold you down in between jobs. I wouldn't recommend working there full time. Because they always lay people off and never have any room for advancement.
good,"No job succession unless you are in finance or marketing.  Every year there are major lay-offs in 4th qtr so job security is shaky.  Jarden Corp is very cash and stock price driven and only cares about the shareholders, that why the layoffs are a constant. Pay is lower than industry."
good,"long hours 12 hour shifts. Management has no clue. No Communication between supervisors and upper management, hr acts like she has no time for you and that you are bothering her. If you don't want a life at all this is the place to work. The union is not very good mainly takes your money and does nothing for you."
good,Management was horrendous. Get laid off every year. Cannot get answers out of anyone. Too much favoritism by supervision. Most of the associates were great but too many were full of themselves.
good,Management is led by one who specializes in sales which concentrates solely on monthly $$.  Culture is struggling and will only have a breakthrough with new leaders.
good,Hours were great and alot of overtime.No chance for advancement.
good,"I work for Jarden for 6 years and liked my coworkers a lot, but there were too many restructures and chnages. Not a great pay, but not bad for South Carolina..."
good,The management lacks planning and forward thinking skills . Alot of hurry up and wait or we need it done now all for nothing . Overtime is scheduled almost every week .
good,I like my job i didn't like some of the bosses in the last 4years of working there i had 7 different bosses.my job was to load my truck and drive to the warehouse unload my truck by forklift. I did this 8 to 10 times aday plus i did inventory once a month
good,There may be days when you get sent home because of lack of work. Even if your full time. Poor communication and inadequate training. Required to lift 50 lbs or less. Very physical and demanding.
good,Jarden is a contract plastics company with 5 sites doing a variety of molding and automation work for major consumer product companies.  The opportunities are wide and varied.  The atmosphere is dynamic and energetic.
good,"Some people seem friendly but talk about you all day including the Human Resources Manager, she hangs out with her employees and if they don't like you personally, youre fired!"
good,This was my first job in housekeeping and it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. I would go in clean everything that I needed to and after I cleaned everything I could go home. I had no problem with my co-workers I mostly worked by myself. The hardest part was working in the heat and cold the most enjoyable part was I learned how they make fire logs.
good,good opportunity to improve maintenance skills. co-workers are helpful and good to work with.
good,"The place is a good friendly work environment.  Although the salary and benefits are lacking which is why I am looking for alternative work.  Could be partly because of my own fault for that.  The company is currently undergoing a major restructuring since its aquisition by the Jarden Corporation. "
good,Did various jobs to meet spec!
good,"Management changes, scopes change.  Very helter-skelter.  Purchased by the third company in 3 years.  Interesting work and incorporation of ""state-of-the-art"" technologies."
good,"It wasnâ€™t a bad job, I just didnâ€™t like the favoritism and special treatment among other workers. The work was pretty easy and I never had a problem with my pay."
good,Either you get it quick or they don't need you unless you are trying your all then they may keep you to run the entry level machines your whole life!!!
good,"Pouco tempo para avaliar, fiquei na empresa apenas 3 meses."
good,"Hot, poor circulation, short breaks, minimum wage for maximum effort, stressful. Water fountains do not work, very loud, short breaks, the exercises are not done by management correctly."
good,typical day 7am - 330pm sometimes 5:30pm i learned a lot about production shipping receving product dealing with fire logs how there made co workers was pretty cool management pretty decent up and down relationship hardest part of the job communication most enjoyable part my co workers and taking a break lol
good,I didn't feel very safe a this job location. It was located in the Geo Space Caves and when it rained the power would go off and it was very dark in there and we had no communication because there was no cell phone reception in the area.
good,Supervised 50+ people on first shift
good,"They decided to hire a new group of people in Freeport IL, to do our accounts payables jobs....because it would be cheaper, even though they hired people with no A/P experience."
good,Jardens is a good paying job for the area but the way your coworkers and superiors treat you/each other is unacceptable and unprofessional. A typical day at work was very stressful and fast paced. The job itself was easy but the environment in which you have to work may not be worth it.
good,I feel more associates are needed to run shift efficiently. Working 12 hrs can be very difficult. They want to overwork employees. When shift could run better and produce more with proper staff
good,It was alot of lifting involved. I worked with alot of nice people and good bosses. I was a temporary worker because they never hired on for full time employees.
good,Jarden is a relatively large company that is very disjointed and in many areas does not have well established policies a company its size typically does.
good,A typical day at work is being on da line and moving at a fast pace packing boxes with product and passing it down the line. Everyone on the line working together made your day go by smooth.
good,"It's sounds like a dream job, but the long drive (unless you live in Brampton), not exceptional busy and quiet environment made the day a lot tougher to pass. It's going through some re-structuring due to acquired by Newell recently, understandably there are certain degrees of uncertainty on job security."
good,My particular company within Jarden wasn't too bad. But the advancement opportunities aren't plentiful unless willing to seriously relocate.
good,"Jarden Technical Apparel is the apparel branch of a rather large corporation.  The location up in Stead is pretty remote, but traffic is not bad if you live in Reno."
good,"Many great people working there, decent benefits and if you want OT this is the place. But management will say anything to pacify people with no action or intent of keeping their word even to older employees. Little to no action taken when problems do arise even though they promise to take care of things. "
good,"Worked long hours, co workers were great.  The pay was not too good."
good,"* Extremly busy based on the season.  Lots of phone calls and e-mails to work through.  "
good,"Average company to work for.  There's a lot of work politics and favorites. However, I would recommend working for this company for some experience and competitive salary"
good,"Although this was a contract position, overall, this was a good place to work. It was an enjoyable workplace with a good management staff with great hours."
good,Jarden is a nice company to work with excellent people. Work environment is very friendly and organized. I will like to work with them in the future..
good,"Good learning experience. Learn to work with multiple machinery, quality control, and fork lift driving. Manageable hours and voluntary overtime. Also shipping and recieving experience."
good,The most important I love the money. Typical da at work I unloaded wax trucks . Pump wax into another rail car to another so we can run. Learned how to make mix for fire logs.
good,The advancement was little to non but the job was fairly easy load unload trucks stage material put the material away in the right locations voluntarily overtime
good,"Gente con muchas ganas de ensenar y acogedora."
good,"great place to work, clean environment, excellent staff, culture was diverse, management was fair and responded to the production floor regularly to promote morale"
good,"Not much else to say, not sure what the new owners decided to do with the facility, left because I had been warned my position was going to be downsized after the buyout."
good,"Had some fun with the people I was working with, also became lead on the dock and felt like I wasn't compensated well enough for it. Felt like I should have been compensated for the responsibility that was placed upon me"
good,plant closed in Cloquet.  It was great the yrs I worked there.  Sad to see it go.  There are in other states but unable to transfer.  They went through a lot of change in ownership before we became jarden
good,very hot at a non stop pace a lot of employees very busy at time busy traffic got to very careful while operating a forklift sometimes have to stay ov
good,"Too many management clicks, if your not in the click your a target for blame for everything. A no it all manager that doesn't give anyone respect that isn't part of his click or worked with him before."
good,I work  8 hours or more standing on my feet . i process items to be shipped out to customers through popular couriers. Very nice place to work i enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,What I learned: Direct Import information and quote entry for 4 seasonal categories. Entry level NPD and pricing ladders.
good,I worked in engineering and had a fun fast-paced job. I built machinery and did welding projects for the engineering department.
good,A typical work day was fun knowing it would be something different .Ive learned to work with different types of people seeing different point of views and loved my co workers .The hardest part of the job was the long hours but eventually got use to it.
good,"I Loved Working On My Machines, I Enjoyed Most Of The People I Worked With, All And All It Was Ok!!!"
good,"Companhia dinÃ¡mica, multicultural, muitas frentes de trabalho para crescimento continuo no mercado onde atual."
good,It could be a great place to work if they had better team leaders that are trustworthy.  A day at work was frustrating because of the environment that i was in. I love doing my job as quality an i did an outstanding job doing it.
good,"A year and a half ago, Jarden provided me with a job description that never actually existed in the company.  I moved my entire family down from Iowa for a job that I could not actually do with my skill set.  If I was doing that initial job description I would probably still be working there.  There is a lot of good people in the building that work very long house.  Management at Jarden is process managers and not people managers.  The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the volume of work."
good,very productive job fast pace only cons where the distance and heat
good,"Buenos compaÃ±eros."
good,"Good environment and a lot of challenges every day, which help to maintain the interest on the job and keep learning and aquiring more experience."
good,- Working in Shipping and receiving
good,long tedious work no smoking on propertie and machines always go down
good,I enjoy the job just rough on my back don't see alot of advancment for my future looking to move up the ladder in whatever I'm doing in my life.and I would like to be able to move up the ladder
good,"Very fast paced work environment. It is a very seasonal job, and hours can fluctuate during different seasons of the year. The salary is a little below average"
good,"fast moving, constantly covering others for breaks ., average pay for work, standing all day, work not difficult or that physically demaning, but you are on your feet for a 12 hour shift in steel toes. breaks are exactly 15 and 30 . usually overtime avaiable"
good,you have no place for advancement and some supervisors don't work real hard expect you to do more than what your pay is. during the busy times you don't have a life working 10-14 hours a day the only good thing is no weekends unless its mandatory.
good,"Fast paced & challenging. Something new every day. Great people, helpful and supportive. The biggest issue with Jarden was a lack of upgrade paths; hard to be promoted. Now that Newell has completed their acquisition, that may change!"
good,"The work schedule is good, being off every other weekend. Although they a 12 hr shifts: work no more than 3 days during your schedule rotation"
good,Schedules requires a lot of your time but Job security. Flexible overtime hours. Good company but will be away from your family often.
good,"I arrived at work at 15:30 and started bringing product from the warehouse to the docks, to be loaded onto trucks. Got out of work at midnight."
good,"The day consisted of filling orders for shipment. A lot of heavy lifting and bending."
good,"Manage the logistical aspects of customer drop shipment orders. Prepare proformas, work with customer questions issues, provide assitance to internal customers, monitor, track and address issues with inbound container orders for inventory. Maintain extensive database of customer order files electronically."
good,company encouraged employees to grow in their career. always looking for ways to make the job easier and more enjoyable
good,Its a good place. Must be able to stand for a long period of time. I drove front end loader and forklifts. i did maintenance on production lines and machines.
good,Nice to place to work.  Flexible hours. Good coworkers to work with.  Very safe environment. Management was always straight forward.  Have dinners when we met our goal for the month.
good,I wasn't there long enough to give a full honest opinion of how they truly work they but while I was there it was fast paced and clean place to work. Everyone in the management section I did get to interact with were nice and knowledgeable  and the people whom I worked with on the plant floor were good and helpful.
good,Depends on the amount of that has to be pulled and weighted is how your day will run if you have small line it will run slow and if you have the grass trimming it will run fast
good,"Good place to work. Good hours, team communication, organized management."
good,"The job is a lot of head scratching. I work in the distribution side and I feel like if your not a supervisor you have no voice. We have a corporate, production, and distribution, Its like working for three different companies  in one building. The communication is poor and the open door policy is poor."
good,"-people were good to work with "
good,"Really enjoyed the people and interactions between departments, however, very difficult to know who did what. There was no job description or training to help when starting. Difficult. But, helpful, and really enjoyed the different products the company manufactured and learned a lot more about them."
good,Small company spun off from Ball Corporation in 2002.  Local officers were great to work or an with.  Great location; the company was purchase (formerly Alltrista Corporation) and renamed Jarden.
good,I learned how to use vox ware..learned about shipping and receiving and how to send product out on the correct trucks..the most enjoyable part of the job was Definately driving the forklift and the competition with coworkers on who would produce the best numbers and pick the most product
good,Buen producto pero sin apoyo de marketing para darle visibilidad. Empresa con muchÃ­simo trabajo que recae en poco personal
good,It was a fast pace job. You had to keep up and make sure you didn't fall behind. You had to pay close attention for any mistakes and remove all unsuitable products.
good,No complaints about working here. Give you a decent lunch time. Very clean warehouse and everyone there is really nice and easy going. It does get hot in the warehouse.
good,Ok learning experience for a fresh out of high school graduate but not a career dream job if you want more out of life. Steel toe boots required job. Hot and very low venting environment with steady fast pace moving line . I have had the experience of working with quite a few ex cons who are thankful to just have that job and listen to their stories of how they self destructed themselves into the prison system and now given another chance to not mess it up. With my up bringing and being a graduate of high school and a few months of college I do know this not the career I would choose to do. But due to my family's situation with my baby sister losing her site I couldn't afford to stay in school. But with my intelligence I will not give up my desire to obtain a degree in Criminal Justice.
good,"Work here is pretty mundane. The coworkers are very friendly; things don't seem too stressful, but they are not highly interesting either."
good,"help maintain machinery and keep lines running"
good,"We check in drivers for their load and work up their paper work,"
good,Typical day was to sort out parts for military antennas. Machines that we operated were straight forward and only took me a week to learn the whole process. Management was great and didnt really micro manage any of the workers there. I can't recall a hard task at the job beside inventory at the end of the year. The most exciting part was learning a new process.
good,Everyday was a good day at Jarden Plastics.  We sat down until our machine starts acting up. My co-workers helped one another and believed in telling you when something is wrong. Nice supervisors and enjoyed sitting down to assembly the parts together.  I didn't enjoy the days when my machine wouldn't run right.
good,This was a great job that I could have kept for as long as I could. Unfortunately I was a temp and they only needed me to clean up the mess that the para-legal had made because she didn't file a single piece of paper for four entire years. I enjoyed the work. The hardest part of the job was reaching high places. The most enjoyable part was the work itself.
good,"JCS is a great company with established brands and products in major retailers across the US. Upper Management is supportive and strong. The Company does, however, need to grow market share outside of the US in order to stay competitive. "
good,"There were so many nice people to work with. Everyone was a team player. My supervisor was so flexible if you had to leave for an appointment or if your child was sick. I was able to learn so much about our software, to use more functions in Excel I had never used before."
good,It was a relaxed atmosphere unless one of the machines break down. The people were nice especially the manager I had. The weekly payments were good but I recommend more pay.
good,I worked with some great people and really enjoyed my job. I got to learn alot of different things while working ar Jarden. They try to teach you a little something about every machine.
good,Amazing place to work I would recommend anyone looking for a job in Springfield Missouri excellent management team always able to help their employees
good,"If manufacturing is where you want to be, Jarden Plastics is a great place to start. Spent the summer analyzing different processes and studying the manufacturing process in its entirety."
good,The corporation has great potential. The purchase of Jarden by Newell has changed the culture to a be more focused on the immediate than proper planning for the future. The key metric has changed to revenue per employee which resulted in the elimination of many employees and a movement to using outside resources.
good,it was a clean easy job i got hands on training on the cnc machines and acquired a good knowledge of them the pay was low and made it hard to keep the job
good,Wonderful culture that values balance and family.  Growing and getting better everyday.
good,workplace very hot and very dangerous forklifts everywhere can see around the corner you have to place very close attention. Other than those things fun place to work.
good,I've been with Jarden for 15 months. I'd continue to work there except our office is being consolidated into our Corporate Headquarters.
good,Lots of brand exposure amongst some of the top CPG brands globally. Great employee culture with lots of social connectivity amongst all of the teams. Recommend!
good,"Received adequate training for the position."
good,"Lots of overtime required..Union Company"
good,"Usual stuff goes down - huge goals, not enough resources, lack of prioritization. Everything was a priority so nothing was. I had the privilege of working with amazing people, but their bosses and their bosses' bosses were completely out of touch."
good,"worked there around 20 years, started machine operator, then went to material handler, eventually went to (team lead)running packing dept. for over 10 years, then went to team lead in warehouse, worked in two of the 3 warehouses."
good,I worked there for almost five years. It is a decent place to work at in my experience. They are great people that work there.
good,"Pros:"
good,"A typical day would be working from 8am to 3pm. In that time frame my team and I would have to unload trucks full of products, wrap them onto a skid and have a forklift operator take the skids away. We had a minimum quota of finishing 3-4 trucks, if we finished early we would help out other sectors of the company or just do general cleaning. My co-workers were hard working and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job would be working in trucks that have a lot of dust in them, it wasn't good to breath in. Masks were provided, but it would slow my work pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was company events and how management would treat all the employees for doing a good job."
good,"Really nice, showcase plastics company. Great people to work with and just plain be around. I learned a lot about plastics and what it takes to succeed in production invironment. Always a new challenge and strive to improve work habits."
good,"Long tenure as temp. depending on department in warehouse."
good,"A typical day at work consists of retaining shots from 30+ injection molding presses. Taking them back to the lab, inspecting, measuring, and insuring they all conform to the customer's requirements and recording information on QAIDs. I also make sure that all materials(labels,boxes,bags,material,concentrate,etc.) used at the press are correct. Oversee IPs to insure they are following directions. I use a number of gauges such as force, calipers, leak, blocks, comparator, optical (OGP), etc..  Write CAPAs when needed"
good,"It was long hours, but when i was first there everyone helped you with everything you need to do. But i busy doing your job, everyone one had time to talk and joke around during breaks. Supervisor was very good at his job. He would fine out how your were doing. If there was anything to help me to do my job even better."
good,"A friendly atmosphere and a good place to work. The people were truly good folks--smart, talented and helpful. Most of the management folks were good, with just a few bad apples. I enjoyed my work and the people around me immensely, but there was no thought to work/life balance here. Every department was overworked and could have used one more person to spread out the workload. When I was there, the company wasn't growing so there was no expansion, no way to move up. I did learn a lot and I enjoyed my job but for the long hours."
good,Great people and projects. I will miss the close relationships made there over the past 4 years. This a company that is driven and cares about it's customers.
good,"I worked at Jarden as a apprentice in the Tool and Die shop, my co-workers were great people and taught me a lot. They gave me on the job experience which allowed me to advance in my career."
good,Its a clean and friendly place to work but there are too many changes in management. I worked there for four years and every year there is something new which seems to keep workers from advancing.
good,"Very confident that this company is excellent work place, good place to grow. I spend 9 years working to improve quality and that the customer perception so far ... good quality products"
good,"It is a productive place to work. I have learned a lot about the process of packaging. The co-workers have good intentions, even though some do not take the job serious. The hardest part of the job is being able to stay awake through the 12 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and working along with them."
good,"- Diversified culture of professionals"
good,"Ran a lid press and bulked lids into paper bags."
good,I have learned an incredible amount working here for the past 5 years.
good,"Good, fun, awesome, place to work.  Would recommend to anybody that asks.  Management is awesome and lets you thrive in your line of work.  Does not micromanage you"
good,I love to come to work I liked the people the management if you had a problem you could go and talk to them about anything you have on your mind I liked that
good,Good co-workers. Main issue is picking/packing can be boring and one must be alert for quality control issues for parts coming out of mold machines. Sometimes one worked two + machines so one was always busy.
good,"company was very flexible, working from home was very helpful at times.  Discounts are pretty good.  The team was great we all got along and worked towards being the best in our positions."
good,"Department heads should know how how their department works and what they do. If you don't what your department does, how are you supposed to make well-thought policy and organization changes?"
good,I gained various experiences from this employer. The hardest part of the job was correcting someine else's mistakes. Management did not always hear employees views on given situations.
good,"A typical day at Jarden varied from day to day.  I could be working on a complete build out of the office one day and the next work on accounts payable which were due each week.  I managed travel arrangements, investor relations as well as many other projects."

good,"It's slow during months of jan-April "

good,This was a very fast working job that I really enjoyed. The pay and benefits were good and it was a good working environment. I really enjoyed working first this company.
good,I have been with Jarden for almost 29 years. I have 2 boys playing hockey and have been able to make most of there schooling and sporting events for the past 15 years. Jarden has very family oriented morals and treats all employee's in that manner.

good,"I like the variety offered by a venture capital company such as Jarden, lots of opportunity and potential!  I really appreciate the opportunities afforded to me by this company."
good,It is a very busy work place.  I was always learning and working with good people.  One aspect I enjoyed was not being micro managed.  Manager let me do my work.  Hardest part of the job was being insufficiently staffed.
good,"A regular day was like this: show-up and clock-in at 7:00 am (not a minute later), say what's up to the co-workers, take your position, stand-by for incoming firewood, and prepare to package. Management was hard-working and dignified. The culture there was magnificent, I loved it there. The hardest part of the job was the accuracy and precision required to stuff fire-starters into boxes. The most enjoyable part of the gig were the wonderful aromas and scents of the firewood."
good,Working for this company was a wonderful experience. I was exposed to all facets off the company and really learned more than I could've imagined. This goal-oriented place is lead with smart management who really care about their employee's.

good,"Fun and enjoyable experience. Great people concerned with both employee welfare as well as getting things done."
good,"Office culture was relaxed and engaging, but still hard working individuals. There was a much communication and teamwork within the team but between departments there was little to no communications.  This limited communication did not inhibit productivity."
good,Excellent place to work and great learning experience. One of the best go lives and customer started using SAP from day one
good,"Everybody is sweet there, and super caring!"
good,"A typical day consisted of everything an administrative assistant would handle, plus anything else anyone in the building needed assistance with, from ordering and setting up lunches to proofreading sales materials, to making travel arrangements, and assisting in the HR Department with a variety of clerical-type duties, which provided me a day filled with variety and many individual employee contacts with professional and clerical personnel, who were easy to work with and relate to, making up an enjoyable day of business interactions."

good,I enjoyed my time as the shipping manager with Jarden. I loved my staff like family. We were extemely succesfu as a team for six consecutive years.l
good,"Great team, great products and strong work culture.  Unfortunately due to a merger, many of our jobs because redundant and thus eliminated.  The company as it stands today is a different version than what existed when I was there so I cannot comment on today's situation today other than to say they still have great products/brands."
good,A typical day at work was easy going without a single sweat broke. Being moved everyday allowed me to experience different steps in the hair clipper process.
good,It was a great learning experience and I made a lot of great contacts. They were very flexible with my schedule and work/life balance. Management was very helpful.
good,Everyday was very fast paced and interesting. Working on an assembly line made most days fly by. I learned how to work well with others. Management was great. The hardest part was break time. It was too short for the amount of people that work there. I really enjoyed working with the group of people  I met there.
good,There was a great rapport with all the employees.  It was a pleasure going to work everyday.  I came to Jarden as a temp position for 3 weeks as a clerk and was hired and stayed for 12 years.  Computers were just coming into the workplace and I started doing data entry.  I filled in for the receptionist during her break time and lunch hour.  Eventually they taught me how to do reports on excel that showed the percentages of complaints per product model.  The mail room clerk was retiring and asked me to replace her position.  In 2005 I decided to retire.  What a mistake I made for leaving such a wonderful company and all the people.
good,"Busy "
good,Looking to improve salary. Get back into more public relations.
good,It was a great place to work good benefits learned alot about shipping and receiving and...management was great amd they took care of they're employees
good,I liked the job. I only worked there for 3 months and I was making 8.25-8.50$ an hour and got an increase to 9.00$ and an upper position. The work was very easy to me which I caught on very easily. Just not good enough pay to pay the bills. If youâ€™re experienced with YEARS YEARS of work like the Mechanics that come fix the machines and donâ€™t do much work around then youâ€™ll be making more than a 1000 weekly . Some people were nice and some were mostly of drama. Of course the women mostly. Managers were great . If you get the right group team to work with then youâ€™re all good .
good,"Good people and awesome brands but a serious lack of structure. Massive shifts in direction and strategy annually, no training and development programs. Extremely under-staffed and cheap."
good,Jarden is a great company to work for. Management team is great and listens. Jarden has good upper management teams. Jarden is a place and has a great environment.
good,"As mentioned above, very productive company with steady growth in all aspects of business. "
good,A typical nite a Jarden was great when all the machines would be running great. Managentment was great. Co workers were great workers an friendly.Hardest part of my Job was not being able to reach the top os the machines sometimes.The most enjobale part of the job was working alone.
good,As a maintenance technician/shift lead for this company I enjoyed the fast paced environment and the people I worked with on a nightly basis.  The schedule was fantastic (rotating 12 hour shifts).  The communication between day and night shift was probably the least desirable part of the job.
good,At Jarden it was very easy work but I had to pay very close attention to the line to make sure all appliances were available. The job was very repetitive
good,"Overall, Jarden is a great company to work for.  Unfortunately for me, my entire department is being relocated to Fishers Indiana and I am not willing to make that move."
good,A day would typically start at 6am travel to site. Safety meeting at 7am. Full day commissioning. Leave at 5pm and travel back to hotel at 6pm.
good,"My main duties were to assist in the administration of web content. I worked as a bridge between IT, creative and international branding. I learned about retail platforms on a digital scale, implemented social media strategies and learned more about e-commerce. Management was often reluctant towards the use of social media campaigns. My co-workers treated me with the utmost respect even though I was a full time intern. The job was pretty easy, the commute was possibly the most challenging part. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with such diverse people. The global branding department was a potpourri of cultures."
good,"Unloading the trucks and putting the product into the warehouse for storage."
good,"Technical support/customer service call center. Mondays are the busiest days due to the office being closed on weekends. I have learned how to troubleshoot smoke and CO alarms & quickly differentiate the sounds that each will make. Supervisor looks out for the department which makes the environment peaceful. The hardest part of the job would be trying to coax the customer into troubleshooting when they don't feel comfortable, or have never done any type of maintenance before. The most enjoyable part is getting the thanks from a customer for helping resolve their issue."
good,"At Jarden Corporation, they had a large retail store which was the Coleman Factory Outlet.  I was initially hired on part time, but quickly promoted to full time within 2 months asked to be Assistant Manager.  I was responsible for training and opening and closing the store. Also making sure all deposits and registers balanced in the morning and at night. It was a great place to work. We had truckload sales March through October, which was probably the hardest part of the job because they were held outside, in a tent.  This was extremely hot and we also worked very long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job were meeting some wonderful people and helping customers. In addition, I learned a lot about products."
good,"Friendly, diverse, and fast-paced work environment. Excellent place for entry-level employment, those looking to get back into the workforce, or people looking for part-time labor. It's flexible, with lots of opportunities to do various different tasks. No two days are alike."
good,I love my job. Met a lot of good people and I actually like going to work. The hardest part of my job is getting there. Sometimes its challenging but that is what I like about it.
good,Very nice place to work. The people are nice and so are the vending machines! Haha! Very quiet and reserved. The hardest part on the job is remembering that you too could be on the other end of the phone.
good,Very energetic place to work. I enjoy every person I work with. The customers we have a mostly great as well and we get to have a personal with a lot of recurring guests.
good,"if your hired to work 8 hours you are expected to be working those 8 hours. you get 2 - 10 min breaks and 30 min for lunch unless you're in management you get hour for lunch. This is very doable."
good,found better. needed a better pay rate. hours were great. just didn't care for the pay rate.
good,"i loved working at jarden zinc. other than being laid off, i would still be working there.  i love the people from production to maintenance to supervisors"
good,Jarden is a great company to work for. Newell Brands has bought the company and will start laying people off because my department is moving to Chicago. I have worked for this company for 11 years and it is really sad that I have to find a new home. (Job)
good,Best experience ever. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help
good,I worked at Jarden through a temp agency Staffmark. We assembled  electronic components into military communication equipment such as antennas. My job was the specialty builds. I was put on this assignment because I could read prints well. I also was able to work fast and with few mistakes. The management was excellent. They gave us everything needed for success. There was real teem work that made the production efficient and enjoyable. I loved this job and miss it. I was laid off because of the cut backs in the military.
good,"Enjoyed my time there, the creative services group is a team of talented designers, prolific and enthusiastic."
good,"They allowed me to semi retire. Great benefits. Family comes first"
good,You did something new every night the managers was chill the second shift was cool you just don't be long breaks you get a ten minute first break and twelve minute lunch
good,"This was the best internship I could have asked for. I received lots of mentorship, time with executive leadership, autonomy on my own projects, and invaluable work experience. I was paid well and I learned a lot."

good,a day at jarden was always fun the work environment was nothing less the enjoyable I learned how warehouse would be when I started here it was my first warehouse I worked at and I loved the environment they taught me how to meet certain production requirements how to operate rf guns and receive daily department work. the management here treated associates like family or close friends. co workers enjoyed working daily together it was like a productive family reunion. the hardest part of the job was making sure labels were printed on time. the best part was working daily with people that loved working there as much as you did.
good,Was a good Place to work until it sold to Newell Rubbermaid They ran it in the ground not repairing machines and micro managing here in Muncie  They announced in July of 2018 that they were closing the Muncie Indiana Plant supposedly because of the age of the building and machinery. I feel thats not true they closed us down to get lower wages because thats what Newell brands is all about Cheap labor and cheap products. We were the last of the remaining original Ball Corporations Factories here in Muncie Indiana Making Ball canning lids Kerr & Golden Harvest also and the bands. Was a great place to work till Newell Brands Destroyed it.
good,"Fast paced work, night shifts, great training, breaks every two hours. Lots of time between shifts to maintain a regular sleep schedule and life. Full time guaranteed."
good,"When I first started it was in receiving and then I was able to get transferred into shipping and then I got approved to work in the office at night. The people at Jarden are very nice and good people to work for. They do onsite training and gives you opportunity to move up in the company. The hardest part about the job was unloading the trucks, but once you got the hang of it, it wasn't to bad."
good,"Great atmosphere. nice people. I would recommend this company to anyone. Benefits are a little more expensive than I would have thought, but provide good coverage."
good,I made some great money here and met some wonderful people. I have gained the best computer knowledge using excel and word. I have written policies and sat in board meetings at Lilly.I will never forget the experience I have gained at this place. it was again..AWESOME
good,"This is one company i would defenitly work for again instead of going through a temp on their site. My experience here was great people worked with you, helped you out plus another you can make some good friends there and so forth. Great people to work with. Like i said if had the chance to be hired on to this company again i would definitly do so."
good,I learned the use of drafting software. The hardest part of the job was the heat on the floor. A typical day would be me in an office drafting and occasionally going out to the floor to take measurements.
good,"Working for Jarden was a major stepping stone in my career.  The culture was unlike any I had experienced.  It was an amazing place to work, grow, and build friendships."
good,Jarden is a great company to work for.  They are very flexible and can be caring. The products they make a amazing.  The culture is not a good mix.  That is the sad thing.

good,Milk over 1000 cows 3 times a day. I learned how to operate a Skidloader and how to properly take care of cows and calves. The management is very hard working and follow all procedures. My co-workers are also very hard working and follow all procedures. The hardest part of the job is milking because it is very repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your co-workers and  getting the experience to work with cattle.
good,I really enjoyed working for L-3 Communications. They offered further advancement within the company and are strongly willing to train. They schedule classes for furthering my education and for other positions within the company. It's a team working environment and everyone is willing to help each other.
