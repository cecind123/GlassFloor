bad,"Atencion postulantes....por un defecto de Indeed...esta oferta aparece como si fuera para Chile pero es para BRASIL."
bad,Not a very organized place the CEO doesn't answer his calls There is no support from the staff. Sales are not followed up on time by the crews . enormous amount of customer complaints.
bad,"Work for Adobe via Teleperformance, didn't exceed my expectations"
bad,didnt like it learned nothing nothing enjoyable about it management never cared about there employees not worth anyones time or effort do not recommend
bad,"Adobe has a strong culture, leadership and product suites that target Marketing Executives and core developers.  I learned a great deal from my Management and peers."
bad,"We work on building SAP HANA solutions for business users."
bad,"Few years back Adobe used to be a reputed software firm. It's losing its reputation mainly due to creeping politics, forcing serious developers to look for options outside Adobe."
bad,"Your growth is not based on your talent and work, but rather if can keep praising your dumb manager or not. Manager has gang of lazy and dumb people who eat all your rewards. Good and intelligent developers are leaving. Senior management is sleeping."
bad,"Adobe lacks leaders...it is managed by people, who abuse authority. In the race for EEE, Adobe  ignores to place real leaders for strategic positions. And most of the Sr Directors, Directors and Senior Managers, abuse their position. The CIO has not demonstrated any leadership qualities and the focus is only to staff with own peers, instead of finding the right person to lead. iN the desire for raking in Fortune100 list, quality, leadership and fairness is comrpomised"
bad,No growth prospects and management had very bad sense of direction for employees
bad,Bad culture - layoffs every November (wasn't impacted but a colleagues were) - management not ready to take big steps to move the company forward - market changing fast and company heading for a painful period...
bad,"I have worked here for over 5 years, I only stay because of the brand name. There is lots of managers and people that are racist and don't allow women to be in leadership. It really all depends on the team you end up with."
bad,This company micro managed. Told all day that cameras are watching. Hours were cut because I wouldn't drive bus which wasn't what I was hired for.
bad,Adobe has great products that positively impact their customers.  The amount of money they pour into research and development is commendable.  Premium products that are worth the price.
bad,"Adobe is a growing company with tons of opportunities. Unfortunately, the group I was in had awful culture. My manager would use improper language to criticize how I look in my employee picture, and she never really worked with me to develop a plan for my career growth even if I was fully prepared to discuss.  "
bad,"Pushing the Adobe brand and illustrating the benefits of using Adobes Creative Suite for video production, editing, and always focused on the goal of the excellent products provide by Adobe."
bad,"I have worked their for Adobe Web based support."
bad,Implementation of new big SAP projects and working on migration projects
bad,Fair goob and not good convence and long distance company at my house and long Time job hours and night shifts my job and not good my health not my salary very poor
bad,"Low worker morale comes as a result of poor management, specifically due to being micro-managed, and over-burdened with workloads/expectations without commensurate compensation."
bad,"The company itself is good and gives nice benefits, however the management is bad and doesn't allow employees to grow on an individual level. If you just want a job where you can be laid back then it might be the right company for you. As long as you obey your manager you'll be fine."
bad,Please don't get carried away by name. It's a typical bay area company. They do fire employee more often then any other big companies so there is nothing like job security.
bad,People are motivated with good money. Good talent there however thought leadership to build a strong work culture framework or overall organisation running methods can get better.
bad,Working as a Team lead / Technincal Consultant in Adobe for its CQ5 Product. Good Place to Work
bad,"For example,we learn how to manage and communicate with clients.From then,we able to present and introduce our products .This enable us to close the deal and proceed with the orders"
bad,"Good learning curve ,good opportunity if you want to learn Worklife Balance"
bad,"Was a very long time ago. It was a contract job out of College. I enjoyed the experience with Adobe. Our boss though was not a very nice person. Always yelling! Never happy. Made us all kinda uneasy. Not a very good place to work back then. I'm sure it's improved since then."
good,"If you made a single mistake and your manager is not happy with you, you are doomed."
good,Adobe is a great place to work if you want to explore the horizons of Digital Marketing. The management is very supportive if you want to learn different technologies and products.
good,"Adobe's complex licensing structure makes it almost impossible to succeed in education.   I started on a team of 9, 7 of them left within a year.  Management is not attuned to this issue."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Adobe working for two different managers in my term there.  The work was doable and very enjoyable.  Managers in the Treasury team were great to work with.  "
good,"I have 5 or more years of experience working with the public; both face to face and over the phone.  Although, i do enjoy working with the public the one thing i have learned and has changed from the older days to present day is that the customer is NOT always right.  Research show that 1 in 10 customers complaints are because the customer is correct but that the majority of the time he/ she is not.  Alleviating the issue for the customer based on that old fact alone can be challenging.  I find  it to be a great learning expereince for both parties; the customer and myself .  Often times, I am able to alleivate the customers issue by simply educating the customers on the product or service at hand.  This way the customer does feel special and appreciated because he/she has a better understanding of what ever it may be that they are purchasing and is more likely to return a happy customer and less reluctant to buy more."
good,"Don't have a positive outlook on the company after spending a couple months getting in the details.  Management is lacking, culture is stagnant, and the world around us is changing.  Yikes..."
good,"Great products, but their internal processes are lacking.  Incompetent Saleforces instructors advise to delete all budgets and assigned hours in lieu of asking the customer when consultants should work against the SOWs!?  Likewise, the budget/saleforce analyst don't have a clue; they enter erroneous figures daily which make the pre-established budgets and scheduling totally bogus. Unproductive and inconsistent processes.  "
good,"Company is good but managemenr is not good according the company, because they do partiality with new employees. Climate was good but so much workload."
good,"Good salaries"
good,Used to be a top notch player in the software space with good benefits and top employees. Company has since changed to a more rigid enterprise company with much few benefits and strict management. No longer the feel good company of the 2000s.
good,Working with customers was always a highlight and you got the ability to interact with loads of interesting and talented people. Would there was a clear view on career
good,"Adobe Systems Incorporated is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States."
good,"I managed the higher education segment s in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. Traveled Tues-Thurs. Office days were Monday and Friday. I found management to be more hard driving than would be expected from a creative based software company. It was financially rewarding, but a difficult place to work."
good,"I worked at Adobe full-time"
good,"A nice place to work with lot of in-house facilities for recreation and entertainment, working atmosphere depends upon peer pressure and varying for different departments. Growth is low."
good,"Pros:"
good,"They provide great work life balance and the benefits are one of the best in the industry. It's a great place to work if the project you are involved in, is in the focus of the company."
good,"sehr gutes Lösungs-/Produktportfolio, leider Schwächen im Management durch häufigen Wechsel und fehlende Kontinuität"
good,"Open to work from home"
good,This was a good company. they really took the time out to insure your safety. The culture was difficult due to race and ethnic background. the most enjoyable was tripping pipe as a team in a timely fashion. most of our work days consisted of overall safety and production.
good,"Great new buildings in good locations. Workplace culture is very hypocritical and much more political than other high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. Pushing people out of the company is common practice and a high-stressor that greatly impacts employee moral. Lots of unqualified people in mid management who excel with managing up, but perform poorly when it comes to achieving business results."
good,"Your peers will help the best they can, but management doesn't spend any time onboarding the knowledge you need for your position. Management also doesn't spend any resources furthering your knowledge with Adobe Solutions or the industry. Their is a wiki, but it is poorly managed. Good luck finding the tools you need to actiquitedly do your job."
good,"Em si a empresa não é ruim, o que estraga são os coordenadores que não sabe atender as necessidades do operador, alguns são legais porem outros um funcionário sabe mais que um supervisor."
good,"Adobe has been a fun journey and is a great place to work, with immense growth opportunities"
good,Nice to be able to say i work here - great company brand and high growth but the EMEA leadership is in flux and it makes it uncomfortable. Offices are fantastic and there is a good vibe.
good,"Adobe is certainly a place to work.  It has 4 walls, cubicles and people inside.  We were paid every two weeks.  Of all the places I have worked, Adobe is one of them."
good,"so far the best company i joined ever, all working environments, benfits etc are very well."
good,"This is a great tool to use if you are a video editor. Amongst all other competitors, I feel like Premiere allows every producer to do whatever they desire."

good,I enjoyed working with Human Resources; The staff is wonderful with great benefits and work hours. The atmosphere is pleasant. Supervisors were helpful and friendly.
good,"Work is well managed and steady, but environment varies greatly from team to team and office to office."
good,"Poor training provided. Agreed upon a 12 month contract with them for analytical support, but they cut the contract after 3 months even though I completed all deliverablesa."
good,I worked for Adobe over 20 years ago. At the time it was a very interesting place to work. I remember the people being great to work with as well as free food at quarter end.

good,"Project #3"
good,"Good work, life balance however growth and development are not stressed enough."

good,Adobe is a very forward thinking company that is ADD! They reorg and layoff every December.
good,"Great, hard working people who are able to do a lot of work in a short amount of time."
good,Not so much to say as i have only spent two months till date
good,"Highly technical job with co-workers in another City. The best part about Adobe were the people. The hardest part is not being around my teammates since they were in another city. Adobe is a great company, the only downside is being isolated from my teammates and learning the job."
good,"Hardest part of the job was every November .  Lots of churn and changes and annual RIF. "
good,"No Comments"
good,"Trabalhava de segunda a sábado das 9 as 18"
good,Great culture but not much prospects for growth.
good,"Learned a lot with great people be it automation, development, designing etc."
good," Eu efetuava a checagem de cadastro dos clientes, com isso aprendi  a desenvolver melhor os sistemas relacionados como excell, word, e a resolver situações adversas com clientes. A direção era boa estava atenta a novos talentos acho isso importante, tinha um bom relacionamento com minha equipe nós sempre nos unimos para resolver o trabalho e ajudar um ao outro, a parte mais difícil era entregar o serviço no tempo solicitado porque a demanda era muito alta porém com o trabalho em equipe nós sempre alcançamos o objetivo, e a parte mais agradável lógico era entregar dentro do prazo e ter um tempinho pra se organizar e respirar entre um serviço e outro."
good,"valutazione molto positiva"
good,"The business culture is very respectful in the interactions with the employees, sharing of resources and polite manners.  There are constant changes in schedules and interaction with customers, sales team and product improvements."
good,Fast paced environment. Company has above average benefits and perks. Lots of great people met many lifelong friends. Harshest part at times were long hours. As with many companies lots of work and not enough staff to get everything completed.
good,"Using a mix of Creative Skills used to communicate to come to ideal solutions, depending on finished product."
good,"Working with great people on interesting campaigns is at the heart of Adobe's culture.  Managers are usually accessible and often work side-by-side with their teams.  Co-workers keep everything interesting."
good,"Working for Adobe India for last 6 years> I find a good work life balance here. very nice facilities, free and good food are some USP of the company."
good,"Labour act documents."
good,room for growth but not alot
good,You get to learn so much. people around are very kind and helpful. One can really improve its skills. Job Work/Life Balance.
good,working there was an experience on an every day basis because I was in the shipping dept scheduling truck that were coming and to pick up loads for deliver.
good,"Adobe employees are treated with respect and are given good opportunities at Adobe. There is wonderful Adobe work culture that blends, jells and treats employees like Adobe family."
good,There was an overemphasis on billable hours which were controlled by sales. The culture changed over the years from a customer first to a demand to bill hours. There was a disconnect between new management and the philosophy we followed.
good,"Some things could have been better, but overall I'm grateful for the experiences. Too many meetings, too low compensation, too many ineffective managers - but can't beat the work life balance. Hope to be able to return one day."
good,"During my time at Adobe as a contractor I experienced an inviting team but lack of any personality from management. The managers seemed scared for their own jobs, rather than focusing in on the people. Seemed like they always had something to prove to their bosses."
good,"Adobe claims 100% pay parity yet this is not always the case.  Using a generic job code is not sufficient when determining parity.  At the team level where work and responsibilities are substantially similar, there is NO pay parity.  Men still make more money at Adobe in Utah.  I can't speak for California or other areas.  For me, the difference is 15-20% lower than men.  Despite management and HR being aware of the discrepancy, no change has been made."
good,I a not a good match for my former manager who is now the skip-level manager of mine. I learnt a lot from her but she did not give room for advancement. Luckily my new direct manager is way better. I wish for higher pay.
good,"Good place but always shifting for better or worse so be prepared. Sometimes the company organization are not aware of the structure of other acquired companies, making it difficult for others to succeed once acquired."
good,"Work Pressure is Less, Team is with good co-workers. Good facilities with Food and condiments. Easily getting together people around. Teams work hand in hand."
good,Prefer not to disclose.  It could be that it was just this particular group.  Planning takes too long.  THere is too much focus on detail and it slows down the project.
good,"-Benefits, rewards, handful- salary, perks, bonuses etc etc etc "
good,"Overall: Progressive in some ways but still male dominated and no innovation. "
good,"Arrived daily very early to accomplish goals of the day and to complete work from the previous day.  Work was intense and there were many projects, deadlines and people to communicate and interact with daily as the environment was intense and charge with electricity.   Learned much about the culture, the systems and the strategies that were moving from old platforms and concepts to newer ways of thinking and delivering process and information to the internal staff. "
good,"Very interesting product and people.  For some reason, the team members always seem to be running behind for meeting and deadlines."

good,Great company. Friendly atmosphere................

good,Adobe is definitely a fun and productive WorkPlace.It gave me my first patent.People around are helpful and they want to grow company along with your personal growth.
good,"For starting a career, it's a nice place. For understanding different aspects of the Business, it may not be the right place."
good,Great job with great co-workers. Enjoyed every moment of it. Some of the co-workers have become some of my closest friends.

good,Fantastic working environment and a supportive network of colleagues. I'm fortunate to have found a career that I love and a company that truly cares for its employees.
good,"everyday was new and challenging with the products and the ideas of the people were amazing. I learnt about the technical writing products like framemaker and robohelp and their working. i interacted with people from within the company and worked with them on various projects , many of the projects were done alone so i learnt even more.  enjoyable part was to solve the challenges and speak with the customer organizations regularly and look out for bugs. "

good,"There are no typical days, but a variety of work. "
good,Work at Adobe was mostly interesting and the people were smart and intelligent.
good,A lot to learn about the software world and it would take several years to get comfortable without any software experience. I learned quite a lot about the Global Trade System and software manufacturing. My co workers were very helpful.
good,"Pros:"
good,"As an intern, I had limited experience, but found the teams to be competitive and somewhat dissatisfied with communication and lack of growth. Good pay and balance for tech."

good,"Its good Company to work and Learn and work culture is awesome."
good,"Adobe and HCL both are very good company, i  learned a-lot in HCL and now learning new things in Adobe.. But now i am looking forward to grow my knowledge in Financial domain."
good,"Adobe has very good Job culture, normally it is a good company to work. My own experience so far is good. Adobe make quick strategies but overall impact may not be always quick. I personally feel that it is a big big and growth can be sluggish due to org changes every year."
good,"Here at Adobe Systems Pvt Ltd the work culture is very open, a place where I have learned many things, able to run the premises 24*7......... One of the best Company in NCR region..."
good,Great experience for the resume but little opportunity for career growth. The annual reorganizations confuse corporate strategy and are very disruptive to productivity.

good,Adobe was a great company work at with lots of exciting new products and great people. I learned the importance of coordinating with an international team and making data driven decisions.
good,Engaging and challenging tasks were given. Trust based relationships and teams are world class. Environment is very positive and lots of opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"Energetic, enthusiastic employees for the most part. Great benefits and salaries. Not much room for growth and/or advancement. Lack of collaboration within organizations."
good,"por mi parte me sentí cómoda trabajando en un buen equipo de trabajo, ya que se hacen lazos de amistad y compañerismo a la hora de ejercer el trabajo, el apoyo cuando algo se escapa de las mano, la rapidez y la eficacia de aprender rápido, con el tiempo me fui incluyendo en el área de la preparación de licores y cócteles, no tuve mayor problema con el grupo en el que estaba, por otro lado la parte administrativa tuvo sus altos y bajos,ya sea a la hora de entregar los  suelos y propinas, pero que con el tiempo se fueron mejorando, en la transparencia de los datos; lo que me gusto de este trabajo mayormente, es la experiencia, las habilidades y el saber trabajar en equipo ."

good,Great place to work but beware if you are a contractor then you will be the outcast. FTE's do not eat lunch with you and they look down on you like you are not good enough to be a FTE
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time at Adobe. My position was on a contract-to-hire basis and, sadly, the budget did not allow for conversion to full time when my contract was up."

good,Adobe is an amazing place to work - inspiring leadership and great work/life balance.  The only frustration is with such a large company you can feel like a small cog in a huge machine and begin to doubt how effective you can be.

good,"Adobe expects a lot of out of its employees. That is a good thing. You are challenged daily and given great opportunities. They also understand you have a life besides work. That being said, it's not a rest-and-vest company. Expect to work hard. It's worth it."
good,"Everything that Adobe does says that it cares about it's employees. Even contract workers are able to participate in the corporate culture and are allowed to take advantage of some of some benefits."

good,Adobe is a great company to work with a great culture. But in some orgs growth is limited because the few leadership positions that do surface are faced with significant competition and not necessarily granted to the folks that brings the most value.  IT leadership has floundered over the past few years and is struggling to find it's way.  Overall a great place to work but may be frustrating for anyone looking for career growth up the ladder.
good,"Adobe is a great place to work and the only reason I left was very poor management and the lack of pay compared to other major publishers in the area.  The work life balance was great and the people there were wonderful to work with.  I still keep in touch with most of them.  The culture was great there and there was more mingling than I have seen in other large companies.  There is a real emphasis on work life balance.  I would recommend it to my friends, but with the expectation that they will make less than other companies in the area,"
good,I enjoyed the work we performed the work was challenging and working with the system admins and application developers helped build strong working partnerships.  Atmosphere was great.
good,Daily work deals with all aspects of software development and get to interact with some really smart and fun people. The culture is relaxed and emphasis is on getting things done the right way instead of quickly.
good,"Awesome work culture with a great work life balance. These are some of the words people commonly use to describe their careers at Adobe. As an Adobe employee, you’re encouraged to be creative.

good,"Working at Adobe, the pace varies by the business. There isn't a typical work day which I love. Working in Sales, Adobe allows you to be a brand within a brand which I love. I have a manager that allows me to jump in wherever I feel and learn. This enables me to develop my position outside of the job job description. The culture in NYC is every bit of the feel of family. We are very close; work hard and play hard. It is a very collaborative, team environment. The hardest part of the job is when you lose deals. It feels personal when you see your teammates lose a deal or not be able to close a deal. I enjoy everything about my job. I love my manager, he is absolutely the best!!! He is more than a manager, he is my family. I love my co-workers. When big events happen for them, they happen for me as well. When they hurt, I hurt. I LOVE MY JOB!!!!"

good,"Adobe's a great company because of their benefits, culture, business model, CEO, and people. Most of the locations are state of the art, with excellent cafeterias, gyms, and other on-site benefits.  Adobe's financial performance is hard to duplicate. They've achieved double-digit growth for 3+ years, which is difficult for a company of their size and age.  Most of this growth is due to Adobe's migration to the saas model which, while controversial at the time, has allowed them to considerably increase their revenues, especially within creative cloud.  I would strongly suggest working for Adobe."
good,"Program Manager for Channel Marketing Business Segment"

I learned how to self motivate myself to get up early (6am) and to put hard work in so your satisfied with your work and payment. The hardest part of the job was lifting things that may have been to heavy for me but i like to tackle a challenge so a i pursued and got it to where it needed to be.

good,"Receiving calls and taking care of customers.  Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.  The hardest part of the job is to have to listen to people yelling, using profanity and being expected to take it as part of the job.  Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on a good job and making certain they have the best experience necessary to have them return to your company and the company acknowledging how wonderful you are doing with the company.  It's not always easy but colleagues as well as those wonderful customers makes it a joy to go to work and do the best that you can possibly do and go home at the end of the day with a smile on your face and a song in your heart for a job well done."
