rating,review
bad,"they wouldn't teach me anything, everything I learned I learned from watching other people working, its just a hard job, a very race oriented job. this isn't a career, its a I really need a paycheck type job."
bad,"It would have been a great place to work but it's too much politics, too many trouble makers and poor management and it's enough to keep you from working there."
bad,"Management sets unrealistic, unobtainable goals. You get wrote up and suspended for not reaching unachievable goals that management sets. I used to love working here. When you work for a corporation,  especially this one, you feel like you have to walk on egg shells."
bad,They did not have  standard. They pretty much moved you around however they wanted to and did not have a care. There is no work life balance at this job. No training either.
bad,This place was a joke. Horrible upper management and very cut throat. Nobody worked together to try to be successful but always pointed fingers at each other. Very bad place to work.
bad,"Don't work there !"
bad,"Need to consider the long term and invest in the technology required to be a world-class manufacturer.  The Management is dated and full of the ""Old Boys Club"""
bad,"Spent 26 years there, company became so unethical and treated employees unfairly through consistent lies and threats. I quit, thinking alot of this was normal in corporate work place and was completely enlightened to find Navistar's brain washing of employees was not the norm. Glad I left would never recommend working here."
bad,Stay away from this place. The work isn't worth the pay. Horrible management. They could care less about the workers. No overtime. They build until they are out of work and lay everyone off for a week. Wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time at this place.
bad,Treated with dignity and respect every day . Interesting work . freedom to make decisions . respect opinions and people . seasoned knowledgeable staff
bad,Management is corrupt. Numbers driven. New hires only last about a month. Stressful place to work. Mandatory overtime to keep you away from your families.
bad,No respect from management. Very low Moral. Warehouse manager and PDC manager are the worst bosses I have ever worked for. Save yourself and apply somewhere else. Id take much less pay for respect.
bad,"I was offered a job and the company retracted it due to me having slight pain in my hands and wrist. He informed the company that I couldn't do my job. Mind you this is the same job I have been doing for the past 15 years. They wouldn't let me get a second opinion, or even review the so called doctors findings."
bad,no secure job especially when you are a temp employee.
bad,"Lately it is not good place to work.No top management business strategy definition and very bad work environment ."
bad,Work there for 15 years they close down the plant in Garland Texas no one should look for anything good from them there going down hill fast now i own my own truck and it not a international it a peterbilt
bad,horrible management that makes going to work miserable.
bad,"Navistar is a terrible place to work.  Their management is corrupt and they all look out for themselves.  Their management is known as ""The Good Ol Boys Network"".  They protect each other and will do anything, and I mean anything, to keep each other's jobs safe.  The best thing that could happen right now is for MAN/VW to finish purchasing the company and fire 100% of the management"
bad,I came from one of the Big 3 auto OEMs and after being there a year my corporate structure above me came in from another Big 3 OEM and pushed myself and others out as much as they could and as fast as they could. The culture once they got there was toxic. I was cursed at and treated terrible.
bad,"You only matter when it’s convenient for you to matter, otherwise you don’t exist."
bad,"Company was okay when I  first started there. Lots of benefits and the managers liked my work ethic. I was encouraged to relocate with the company to a different state. Helped to train new hires. When my compensation (pay) got to the higher end of the payscale the management began harrassing me about various metrics (productivity,  quality,  etc.). Mind you, I didn't have issues with these things when my pay and benefits were less."
bad,This company is beyond dysfunctional.  There is no room for advancement since they make managers where multiple hats without experience.  They are also getting ready to be bought but no one will admit it.
bad,"A typical day at work is just go in do your work and leave. What I've learned was that people are not easy to get along with and they like to keep up a lot of trouble. The management there was just at a low time low, no matter what you tell them or how the job goes management was doing there job. the workplace culture was okay at best but it can only go so far because you had people who didn't won't to do there job and believe it not that was the hardest part of the job. The mos enjoyable part of the job was going home to be with your love ones, because they care about you and that what really matters. It's okay to work there in a short term but just staying there, I wouldn't recommend that to anyone and you're asking for trouble if you do stay there."
bad,Management is the worst that I have ever encountered and corporate could care less. This company was one of the best but since the change in management it's terrible now.
bad,No one at this company is happy. In fact a survey was sent to all employees after the last layoff (There's been 8 in the past 3 years). This survey was sent to get a real grasp for how low the employee moral really was. The results were much much lower than they expected. the the point the company created moral booster groups that work with the human resources department.... It's not effective. Moral is down even after the new VW signing.
bad,This would be my last choice of employment now that I have experience what the culture was like.  Not good based on my experience. 😟
bad,"While I worked there I enjoyed working with different cultures.  My role had a lot of challenges, everyday I had something new to learn and able to achieve my own expectations."
bad,the company is very inefficient and there is no scope for creativity in the job.
bad,"The money is excellent, but the drama is unreal. I love my job. Management is horrible especially the people in human resources. They do not except Dr. Notes for you to be off work. You are just a number to them."
bad,"People are decent enough that you work with but the job is menial at best and they actively discourage people from thinking in their own/being logical. There is no chance of being hired permanently, some contractors have been in that role for 3+ years with no days off, no sick pay etc. Highly inefficient practices and no desire from management to take into account employee feedback or recommendations."
bad,"Managers micro manage and have no respect for the workforce or supervision staff. Expect long days with no lunch or breaks, it is typical for a supervisor to work 12 to 14 hours per day. Breaks and lunch time are spent standing at metric boards while managers belittle you."
bad,"Overall dead end job"
bad,The most enjoyable part were the people I met while working there. Due to some financial issues they find themselves struggling but I'm sure it will rebound successfully.
bad,"Worked as a HR Coordinator for a HR Generalist, she was a horrible manager."
bad,Hmm I really don't know.. it's a job . Like any other job.. u get along with some and others not so much .. everyone plays a large role in building safe trucks
bad,If you dont have FMLA or pa time you have no chance of ever making it there 1 year. If you have Drs appts you can forget about it! Gossip all day long
bad,Worked as a trainer. Not a bad place to work. could be fun but those times were few and far between. The guys I worked with were like pirates and I didn't enjoy them.
bad,The manager and warehouse manager has no remorse for employee safety. They r more worried about getting orders out then the safety of employees and snow forget it. No matter how dangerous make sure u report to work they don't care!!  Sad.
bad,"You work really hard for the pay. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter. If you get hurt, line keeps going. Do not get in trouble because they will fire you on the spot."
bad,"the managers are terrible, the union is falty they do not care about there employees even though they pay union dues and its just the management is so bad there i didnt want to work there anymore severely cutt throat place to work"
bad,I worked at Navistar for about 2 and a half years. During that time I had 20+ different supervisors from a very high turnover rate. What they expected from us changed daily sometimes more often. Everyone I worked with hated it. The only way for them to continue employing people is from the pretty good pay and great benefits aside from that it was absolutely awful and I have been a much happier person since leaving!
bad,Safety was a priority in theory but not in practice. Poor safety example set by top management. Navistar reportable injury average was one person per day reportable injury. Employees were not properly trained in safety for the jobs they performed.
bad,Pay is average to good. The company is more interested in making money then supporting management. Regular employees have better benefits then management. Management and engineering are very understaffed.
bad,"Pdc manager with unrealistic expectations and has no excuses for herself. Numbers driven all the way with no help to achieve those metrics. New hires don't last, constantly revolving door on supervisors."
bad,"Great new CEO working with entrenched executives used to doing business the old way that got the company in business trouble. Functional areas working in silos, decisions are reactionary rather than pro-active."
bad,"poor place to work. they will work you hard while a person next to you that is not working as hard as you is, I am not kidding making triple of what your making. avoid this place"
bad,"Typical day in Navistar of Indianapolis Indiana was awesome"
bad,"management, is oblivious, the owner is garbage. working here is ill advised."
bad,"In short, I have filed a discrimination due to disability complaint against Navistar with the E.E.O.C."
bad,Navistar is not a good place to work. Union and Management are both terrible. No one is held accountable for doing their job. Worker drink and smoke weed inside the factory.
bad,"Whole plants understaffed and regularly doesn't have enough people to fill open jobs. Everyday you're setup for failure then asked by upper management to explain why you failed. Twelve hour work days are average and if you don't have to work on Sunday, it was a good week."
bad,The leadership has huge egos and are too smart to listen to their direct reports.
bad,"Unqualified management at all levels. They seemed to promote tall and large men. "
bad,"Worst place to work at, the manager has a horrible temper, production rates are super high, Imposible to reach those rates. They never appreciate your hard work."
bad,"When I first started with them it was a good company. Then the lost a lot of money. Started making major changes, promising things that never came and forcing everyone to be the same. When that happened, no one was safe. The staff moral went down. The  individual goals went higher. The staff incentives disappeared. But they still expected the same results. There were issues that the management would not fix or even seem to care about. Near the end I was unhappy and looking for other companies to go work for."
bad,"At my experience in working there I came to work everyday with a smile on my face, ready to work, eager to larn, and have a good day because this job was my dream job. I did great work there and had left my previous to job to work there after being told that I definitely had a gauranteed spot. Two weeks went by and I was let go, when I had asked why I was given no explanation as if no one had known what happened. During that small two week I had also witnessed them firing a lady who was on maternity leave and almost cleaning out a guy's desk who had just had surgery from being sick (but he returned just in the knick of time). I believe that I was fired because the man who had been gone off medical leave had come back but in all reality I really have no clue. I no have no place of work because of this situation. It was handled very poorly by the company and I would not recommend working there to anyone."
bad,"Who makes potential employees answer questions via video cam before bringing them in for a face-to-face interview?  Navistar does!  Many of us are great employees but don't do our best work in front of a camera.  This was a HUGE turnoff.  Unfortunately, you lost out on an excellent potential employee."
bad,"I worked at navistar for six years and would not recommend it to anyone. It was the worst experience ever, there is no support from your managers. Management is afraid to make decisions and do not help or support it's employees. I no longer work there and it's one of the best things i've done."
bad,"I've never worked for a company as unorganized and mismanaged as Navistar. Their lack of processes and comminalities between engineering departments is staggering. In recent days the companies stock has really taken a big hit...if the market only knew how the company was ran, then I suspect the stock wouldn't exist."
bad,only thing good about this job is that you get to talk to other people at time other then that.They talk to you disrespectful when asking you to do something. it sad all the way around
bad,Employer compensation far below average wages as compared to other local companies. No advancement opportunities for those without Accounting degree. Management team is lacking in ability to keep good employees and employee morale is extremely low.
bad,I didn't know them from at all. They gave use little to no  information on where we were going or what we would be doing other than we would be working in the HR department helping them out with Administration duties.
bad,"I am a veteran employee and the company did not want a legacy cost employee to continue working for them, So after my second day my pay was lowered 30 percent and the management team implemented a fire at all cost order on me and the recalled employees from local 98, The job was not worth the negative environment so I will resign Nov 9th 2012."
bad,Horrible management. No training and high expectations. I would never recommend. No work - life balance. High turnover. No opportunity for growth. Toss you from shift to shift.
bad,"I applied emergency decals. I learned a great deal on how a bus was built. Management would make promises and never follow-through or just tell you what you wanted to hear and never completed."
bad,"Another example of a once great company with a long history going down the toilet.  How do you expect a company to change or transform when management is the problem.  No direction, no vision, no focus or willingness to change.  I would not be surprised to see this company filing for bankruptcy in the next 1-2 years.  I hope not because the only thing good about the place were my co-workers.  Executives are currently keeping investors happy with all the layoffs and plant closures but when the music stops and there isn't anything left to cut, there won't be a chair left to sit on.  You can't cut your way to profitability NAVISTAR MANAGEMENT!!!!  You have to have a good quality product that customers want to buy.  Not a thrown together mess of the cheapest foreign supplier parts and out-dated and tired designs.  The reputation of this company is ruined because of poor management decisions and high warranty costs that come from designing and producing junk. "
bad,Best part of the company is the people you work with on a day to day basis. The people work hard and care but unfortunately the company can not seem to do well.
bad,"Bad management dirty, bad hours no job security no pension for full time employee don't waste your time on this place it's a dead end , you don't get the proper tools to do the job, you get two days training When you should have at least a week maybe two they have a small group of people that think there better then everyone else and the union is just JOKE  they only want your $$$"
bad,"You must fit into a clique for office survival or look out for your back. Environment is very rude and no respect for others or their personal life. If they find out something about your personal life, they will make it a quest to come after you. The training here is the worst you will find in this industry period. They sit you down and give you a pc but you may not get access to things you need for months down the road. For training you are expected to read all of their job aids but be weary of asking for help. The rude environment there will get you ridiculed behind your back door not just being able to do a job by reading a job aids and go for it. It's almost like their expectations are ""Hey you have a degree, you should be able to do whatever you may have been told to do or not to do without any further advice"" ""So there!"""
bad,"Plant staff needs to be replaced with managers that can coach, train and mentor instead of threatening and intimidating lower level management. Each day supervisors are worried about keeping their jobs, living in constant fear."
bad,I was a great place to start off after collage. but lack of mobility and individual incentive makes it a hard sell for an experienced engineer
bad,Economy and poor strategic moves has really taken a toll on Navistar. There is no focus on employees and reorganizations happen frequently which disrupts work flow. Morale is at all time low and leadership is focused solely on Board of Directors and shareholders. Stringent cost cutting measures have cost many employees their jobs and company hit a new low when the thermostats were set to 66 degrees in the headquarters in Lisle.
bad,If your where a tenor employee your are safe but for the newer employees that use you and lose you
bad,It was just not the right kind of place for me.  The worst place I ever worked.  It was worse then high school with all of the drama. all the downtime
bad,"Ultimately, due to a change in leadership - it was not for me anymore. I felt like the direction the company was headed restricted my potential and would have continued to degrade my ability to have a happy life."
bad,"There is no work life balance, if youre not at work youre probably asleep trying to recover so you can go back monday. Usually work 4 days off 3, but sometimes mandatory fridays. 10-12 hours shifts when you work depending on production needs. Decent pay especially if you can get to a process tech station."
bad,"PDC manager doesn’t do her part in running the warehouse at set expectations but expects employees to meet their expectations. On a bi weekly basis,  running out of boxes and supplies that are crucial to getting the job done. PDC manager doesn’t know how to run the warehouse or make it a better environment. Employees make the warehouse unsafe with trash on floors and wood and product protruding work aisles. No advancement in positions. All employees will pick, pack, ship, receive, and count inventory."
bad,The Navistar corporation became too large to understand the complete picture of producing and selling chassis.  Top heavy in management.  With the buyouts the company became overextended.
bad,The job itself is fairly easy. Management is horrible and treats employees with disrespect. Co-workers are the worst.  The job atmosphere in its entirety is miserable.
bad,bad management! constantly running out of materials and is up to the picker to improvised. at the end of the day you still need to meet productivity regardless.
bad,"Every one was stressed all the time. Celebrates breaking even or only coming in short by a few million dollars short a quarter. "
bad,"Navistar's pay is more than most local companies, but the management, organization, and professionalism is horrible.  They're always telling employees business is not good, making silly budget cuts, yet they sure pay the horrible managers well."
bad,"Great engineers, managers and chiefs to work with."
bad,"Management has steered this company off a cliff and continues to do so even know they paint a rosy picture.  If you're a person who strives for the best and wants to express ideas, Navistar is not the place for you.  If you like hearing, this is the way we've always done it then Navistar is the place for you.  Oh, and if your daddy worked for Navistar, sign up now because you'll have job security until your son or daughter are old enough to work there."
bad,very stressful - management is cut - throat. Do not support the workers. Don't care about the customers - just looking at how to make the fast sale without taking care of the customers.
bad,A typical day was from 630 to 330pm or 430pm to 1230am. I learned that factory work was definately not for me.
bad,"After spending several years with the company, the work culture has gotten worse. Management only looks at you as another body and I was in management."
bad,I did not like this job. There were to many daily changes. Every day rules change for different people. No need to going to a supervisor because nothing would happen.
bad,Work-Life balance is unheard of.  If you need an income and have no other options is the only way I would recommend this company.  This unfortunate because there are many highly talented and smart people in the company.
bad,"To be clear, I was a contractor at Navistar. I worked 10 hours a day, and took a 5 minute lunch because of the workload. In the end they dumped me (because I think I was working to much overtime). But, then again they let about 10 great, dedicated other workers go. Weird! I hear it took an employee and 1/2 to replace me!"
bad,Difficult to go through the lean years due to the forced transition to SCR technology due to the failed EGR experiment.  Engineering was continually understaffed to handle all of the projects that management was pushing for.  This led to a lot of engineers leaving for greener pastures.  
bad,"A typical day at work is very unpredictable. Personally, I learned a massive amount of things from various roles during my duration at Navistar under the IC of Oklahoma Bus Plant. Management is not great, there is a lack of true leadership around the Tulsa Plant but Navistar in its entirety still has bright spots. The Tulsa Plant culture is one of poor communication and is dependent on the work force being in the dark. There is currently a work union being transitioned in and the politics are very volatile to the work environment. The hardest part of the job is learning a new role due to the lack of training and job expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the product and learning about the industry along with the people you meet on the assembly line. Useful pay but keep expectations low."
bad,"Typical work day was picking your orders, and packing them out. Their quotas for productivity are astronomical, went from picking 32 an hour to 65 an hour in a matter of months, Management has their favorites and it is plain as day to see. Everyone that works there live off drama. Everyone knows every thing about your life, or they fill in the blanks with whatever they think is whats going on. There is literally no place for advancement. You are a material handler and will stay in that position till you retire. The union is horrible, works more for the company than the people they are suppose to be representing. And I never understood why there are two different unions in the same building. Just another way Navistar has the upper hand. "
bad,"There is a reason why this company underwent so many restructuring. I wish they valued and respected their employees more than how they are now. The company itself has a great history and value that they are trying to built in, but seems like the operation is not efficient."
bad,"It all depends which manager you are under. If you are in a good pocket, it's not too bad. If not, your life can be difficult there. Since the finance is not good, you are under high cost saving pressure day in and out."
bad,"High paced and very hot, learned grinding and deburring, management doesn't appreciate employees. Hot and humid. Learned the value of teamwork."
bad,"As a contractor for IBM at Navistar, I wasn't involved in the Corporate Navistar.  The working conditions were very good and the campus is beautiful."
bad,Newer leadership has been put in place to change the company's path.  The new culture being established doesn't make sense at times.  Major attrition problem at the moment.  Company is aware of the attrition problem but the efforts and initiatives being implemented to retain talent are just bandaids.
bad,"Was never a bad place to learn the trade. However, pay was not great. Equipment was good and building was new. Coworkers were not bad but management was very stingy."
bad,Worked there for 12 years the best thing I've ever done is quit.. I would advise anyone that would like to work there get in and get out.. the pay is decent but low compared to other automotive industries. Would be good for somebody to get experience and then leave.  speaking of experience training is a big issue. people are more or less trained here's your tools and here's what you need to do now your expected to do it and keep up. Union and company disagree even though they sign the contract... contract is legal binding..  there is no union rule book issued. from what I've been told they are now hiring ankle bracelet aka felony rehabs (temps)  because they can't find people is that will work. Because the company has a bad reputation in the Tulsa area. You hardly ever see HR/ upper management on the floor. safety is number 1 whenever something happens otherwise they don't care... slogan is safety first quality always.  if you could find the ratings they are the highest in unsafe practices in the automotive industry..  They are reactive not proactive.   overall they need a whole new management team that would care about the employees because they are the ones that make the company... the people like the CEOs and upper management and corporate don't have a clue what the people on the floor go through.  everyday somebody should come thru and shake people's hand and tell them how much they appreciate them working to build school buses and quit making excuses and give people some heat and air..  yes it's approximately a million square foot  but I don't see corporate or the offices
bad,Serious financial issues at this time and executive management has made poor decisions
bad,"Autonomy and being a self starter is encouraged"
bad,I was very excited when i first got the job. I put in 110 percent every day. I have never called in for any reason. But because i was hired at the time i was i am being laid off for no reason. The jobs are all pretty easy. Its a very fast paced work environment. But 2 months ago i had no idea that they would be laying off. And if i had started just one month earlier i would not be getting laid off. There is no job security there.
bad,much nepotism in promotions; I hear things have improved. Eliminated an entire layer of middle management and it was done based on how well you were connected to the top.
bad,"Pick parts, load trailer, inventory , restocking parts, union shop but no money here because of a three tier system. Seniors make the money. We do the same type of work for less pay."
bad,management was never around when you needed them and when they were they only were there to complain about the work load. They also enjoyed being on your back about your work constantly.
bad,"Hope is not a strategy, although management thinks so."
bad,"Estress full ,  poor Managment  The hardest part of the job was Lack of communication ,the most enjoyable part of the job was perform as a Forklift driver"
bad,Working with a team that didn't get along was difficult.  Receiving specifications piecemeal from the business analyst meant I constantly had to go back and revise completed work when the next piece was available.
bad,Co-workers great.  Management daily loved pointing out how you could be replaced in hopes of motivating workforce
bad,"Great people to work with"
bad,I would not recommend applying to Navistar unless you work in finance.  That appears to be the only part of the company that offers opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Coworkers were amazing and fun to be around. Had weekends off and off work by 430 PM through the week made it nice. Biggest downfall is management. I have never work somewhere where the managment was so shady and lied so much, left the employees in the dark with no knowledge of what was going on in the company.  Was told by HR when hired there was no worry of a layoff and within a year and a half the company layed off almost 400 employees."
bad,"The unions and their power made this a very difficult and hostile place of employment. The  workplace culture is one of ""That's not my job, you can't make me do it"". If discipline is administered, it is ultimately cancelled when contract negotiations surface. Employees who are fired for misconduct are rehired and practice the same poor behavior."
bad,There is a lack of communication plant wide. Credit isn't given where it's due. Everyone is always taking credit for other people's ideas or accomplishments.
bad,"If you work hard, stay out of trouble you are paying union dues for nothing.  Most supervisors were clueless, in over their heads, production associates would work the line drunk and hitting their dap pins, staying high all day. Top out pay nice at $28 an hour if you can make it without being laidoff.  Insurance compaired to line of work and company  is not that good."
bad,"Good place to work at if your a ""do what ever it takes""person. Seems like they care more about the numbers then the people working there. Work lots of overtime. People there are great but policies make it hard to do the right thing. Seems like a dead end job."
bad,"Some days are great, and others are not so great. Management can be unpredictable, and non collaborative. A lot of close relatives and friends work together and it can make it very difficult for outsiders who take on their additional work, which is then scrutinized. If you have a problem, it's not even worth bringing up 90% of the time."
bad,"The company has lost a large amount of their experienced work force and they don't see it as an issue at all.  There aren't people left who know how things should be properly done.  Management is filled with people who entered in from other companies and who don't know the business from the ground up.  "
bad,"Very unstable environment. Lack of direction and goals for both the organization and individual. I have been disappointed by seeing the potential at Navistar-Cherokee, yet the lack of desire to capitalize on it. Navistar-Cherokee is unreceptive to integrating systems that would increase efficiency and are more concentrated on selling the business and assets to a prospective company. This leads to a very unstable environment. I go to work each day expecting an announcement on who Navistar sold the business and employees to."
bad,Possibly a good place to learn because there is a lot to do. Other than that they work in fits and starts with little method of fixing accountability. Poor in creating technology.
bad,"The management that recently left had no idea of what it took to run efficiently and still produce the required product, while reducing waste. Now that I am gone, I here they have replaced the obvious thorns in Navistar's side and are doing much better"
bad,"Great people, opportunity to move around to different positions because people are always leaving the company. High-level management doesn't seem to care about the employees and is instead solely focused on making the company attractive for a buy-out."
bad,"Navistar is in the process of trying to restructure and dig itself out of the hole caused by not using selective catalyst reduction technology. Time will tell if they are successful, but it is not a fun company to work for while in this process."
bad,The logistics department at Navistar was a great place to work. I supported 7 logistics managers. Each needed a different level of support for analysis. This is where I learned my Excel and Access skill set both through formal and informal training. The managers that I had were very fair and took the time to develop my skill set as an analyst. The hardest part of the job was the effects of government regulation since it would create demand spikes for the trucks/engines based on EPA regulations.
bad,"Poor management from CEO to my boss - Did not plan or use resources effectively. Respectful culture, but obsessed with unimportant details at expense of big picture. Good riddance."
bad,"Layers of bureaucracy means everything is slow. A lot of very long tenure employees that are not incentivized to do much. A little trimming of the fat went a long way to expose inefficiencies. Being almost a behemoth of the auto/trucking industry, it is unlikely to disappear and will probably weather most storms."
bad,Typical day at work:
bad,"Hard work, long hours; production over quality. How to install windows on school buses. Great supervisors, Fast paced environment, the work was very hard, going home."
good,Provides great and safe work environment. Break room is up to par for employees to relax off the job. Parking lot needs improvement. Overall decent work environment.
good,Job is not guaranteed if you're trying to support a family navistar is not the job for you. The Union does not back you and management is horrible there.
good,"Relaxed work environment- no career improvements, old mind set and everyone is afraid of losing their jobs. No clear guidance to employees, siloed management."
good,Navistar International - Typical the Bus Plant in Tulsa Oklahoma sucks. Non- climate control environment and very fast pace hard work. Management sucks as well. No work/life balance.
good,"To much politics , but this is expected of a big company. There is no real growth with in the company. Lack of management more micro management ."
good,Plant closed...again for the second time. Corporate had no intention of keeping plant open.Company did invested serveral millions of dollar in a failing plant.
good,"Suppliers keep the position interesting, team members are an extension of your family. Many changes are in the process with opening a new facility in San Antonio TX and the realignment of the supplier base to the south for supporting manufacturing."
good,"currently not interested in leaving a review.  It was pushed by the website.  However i think there is greener pastures elsewhere.  Navistar is a good stepping stone, difficult to make the company work for you."
good,After being an employee of 8 years I was told my job was being eliminated.  Upon leaving I find out that if I had stayed my job would have been secured.  Management is awful.  My coworkers and family environment created was the best thing about my time at Navistar.  The work was not hard.  It was a completely different company and place to work between my hiring date and upon my leaving.
good,"Unstable work environment; union environment; compensation good. Co-workers with tenure did not explain or train on job requirements. Company does not have a training program. Most difficult part of position was trying to determine the direction upper management was leading the company.  Upper management were very poor communicators. Most enjoyable part of the position was achieving productive work rapport with union representatives and workers, as there was a history of past practices by Navistar management to work around the union instead of together as a team."
good,Shift starts at 7:00 am. You do your specific job for 8 hours. I have learned how to build a International Truck. The hardest part of your job is not knowing if your going to get laid off or not.
good,"A typical day at Navistar is driving around on a taylor dunn and pulling orders, loading and unloading trucks. I have learned to be more efficient with my warehouse skills though."
good,I worked for Navistar for a little more than 9 years. I did take one advancement during my time there. This company is a fortunre 500 company with offices all around the country so there is the ability to move with them.
good,"After a failed engine strategy in 2012, the company is regularly laying people off. Also, a whistleblower complaint combined with an industry downturn increases the lack of job security. The culture has suffered."
good,"the only enticing thing about navistar is that they pay welders decent. they dont provide tools, theyt dont know wht is going on half the time, it is a challenge to get anything done there,"
good,Management needs improvement. Overall work conditions are ok.
good,"The people for the most part are great and very hard-working. Some of the best and most knowledgeable people in the automotive/vehicle industry are here. The upper management (some Directors, VP's and up) are completely out of touch with what is important to most people. Most decisions from above don't make sense and are not aligned to a common vision. Promotion from within only if you're in the right circle, not based on merit. On plus side, overall compensation is good and have had profit sharing every year."
good,"I turned 51 and was making to much money for my job title and was let go.. I never once got a review that was less than average, every year I always received above average reviews and was still let go."
good,"learn to process ups , fed ex.orders ,quality .respect for others communication .heavy lifting.and lots of physical  movement ,management communication to poor,"
good,"i loved it in the beginning, and i worked my way up quick, went from $13/hr to $20/hr over 4 mionths. the only thing i disagree with was thry worked on the buddy system mostly and when i was laid off i was given no warning"
good,I started with Navistar at a young age and really enjoyed my time there. I was able to grow in my role and learn a tremendous amount during my time there.
good,"Union environment, with hostile attitude towards supervision and management. Two different union contracts, one for the main plant and one for PDI. After new contract ratification for PDI workers, company eliminated PDI, and moved back into plant."
good,"Great place to work at very competive enviroment and fast pace and great people to work along a side of.  Also, company goes above and beyond for employees safety."
good,Worked with many great people. Learned how to manage multiple accounts. Fast-paced job. They closed due to poor business choices after only a year or so.
good,"Navistar as a company is struggling with an identity, a company of a long legacy has yet to overcome obsolete processes that iis holding them back from competative advantages."
good,The review says it all. I am taking the money and running away. Business conditions and leadership methods do not coincide.
good,"The most difficult part of working at Navistar is the lack of leadership.  There is an absence of management that can make quick, effective decisions.  This leaves room for a lot of ambiguity and unclear job descriptions."
good,Companies direction is unclear and future is dismal.  Numerous employees have left.
good,The work was easy but no room for advancement. Didn't like standing for ten hours.
good,My day at Navistar varies.  Right now I'm processing layoffs.
good,"Navistar is undergoing a systemic revision to their work structure.  This restructuring is needed due to the issues that arose from the Engine Emission shortfalls, and the fragmented leadership/vision.   "
good,Manage multiple project that limits your ability to really learn business areas. Currently the company is under resource constraints.
good,"If you are looking for decent pay and benefits then this can be a good place. The down side is that the constant changes going on with production going up and down creates a stressful environment because there is no promises that it will stay open. They can't seem to ever get things straight. Always lacking parts, moving people around to adjust to their needs. Overall they don't care about their people"
good,"Plant manager has no respect for the ME department.  He creates a hostile (illegal) work environment, berates individual staff members verbally in front of entire staff and should be sued but you will lose your job if you report it.  Navistar says they are not this way, but reality....They are. Several HR managers have been removed and left the position in less than 1 year.  16 of 22 people in the department have quit from the dept. in the last 6 months.  His plan is to promote shop floor people to these engineering jobs, even though they are not qualified and trap them there with a bit higher pay.  They can go nowhere else for the pay."
good,"Do not have anything to say, you make the best of the situation that you find yourself in.  Mainly try to follow the SOP for the position that you are doing."
good,when I started in 2002 the pay and benefits were amazing. Then layoffs and plant closure which caused the employees to dread going to work. It use too be a great place to work but they gave up on their employees.
good,"Company is in a transitional stage.  Duties change all the time due to the nature of my current job.  Very supportive managers and coworkers, great bunch of people.  Hardest part of the job is handling the stress from the changes going on for the past few years.  My favorite part of the job is meeting and event planning where I'm in my element."
good,There are times to where you have to do the things that management fails to realize that need to be done in order for the next day to run smoothly. Even then you are still punished for trying to help them out.
good,It is difficult for me to review Navistar directly.  The company overall was great. But as a Temporary employee your treatment is very different.  Job security and your chance of being hired on is very unlikely.  Management was wonderful depending on the department.
good,"People are leaving every day and not getting replaced. Employees are asked to work ""harder"" as if we weren't already, since we are doing the job of 2+ people. Work-Life balance has gone down hill because of this, and have been asked for weekend support at times. I really enjoy working at Navistar, but the times in which the company stands make it a not very friendly work place. People there are great. My immediate managers are decent and do not demand anything crazy, unless is coming from above them."
good,The culture needs more transparency in order to improve communication and respect for people.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers. Although your co-workers quickly become part of your life and family the company does a poor job at allotting proper time for employees time to create a balance work life atmosphere. The reward often times for individuals working hard and going above and beyond is typically additional work versus compensation that matches the employees commitments. Job security is gained only if you go above and beyond the call of duty
good,Everybody is hardworking there. Management is in transition. Co-workers are wonderful to work with.
good,Navistar has a great headquarters with several ammenities to enjoy.
good,"The hardest part of the job is while we are transitioning, folks are struggling with clear roles and responsibilities.  Company has undergone several leadership changes as well which causes the inexperience to affect company morale, etc."
good,"Most Line leads do nothing and when asked to take over a position for the day they have a bad attitude. A lot of the Line leads also treat you badly. Supervisors are hard to talk to."
good,"Benefits  were good, most of the co-workers were nice.  Management doesn't listen, and no room for advancement.  Bonus structure exists, but not fairly given."
good,"Work Life Balance - would be better if ALL teams had off shore resources for night and weekend work."
good,"- Good work life balance"
good,I worked for Navistar during a tumultuous time when many were laid off or fired.  My experience was good and I felt the company was adjusting to new market conditions after military spending subsided and engine technologies cost the company a lot of money.  I'm hopeful that the ship has righted and is headed in the right direction.
good,A typical day of work was going in at 6 am and setting up for the day. In the job i learned how to do various tasks on an assembly line. The management was average and the work culture about the same. The hardest part of the job was the monotony and the most enjoyable was the people.
good,"When I worked there, there was a great deal of financial pressure and market share pressure on the business.  Many decisions were made in survival mode, and were not beneficial in the long term.  They seem to have emerged from the crisis, and are back on track.  Solid people who care about the business are part of the culture, but management pressures sometimes push those people into atypical behavior"
good,"Everyday is a different battle. Different  assignments or job duties daily.  Company is changing slowly.  Loosing money every year is getting old, not sure home much longer before we are owned by a different company."
good,"During my contract position, I experienced:"
good,"i used to enjoy my job at Navistar, but do not any longer, hours are cut, company does not care about its Southern employees"
good,"Navistar used to be a fun and exciting place to work while the company was profitable.  As everything gets tighter, you will find yourself bean counting instead of performing the job functions you were hired to perform."
good,good company but not very challenging.  they want to keep doing things the same way and get different results
good,"Great people and good environment,  the upper management on the corporate is poor.  There is an a lot of wasted money and poor decisions which is slowly leading to the demise of this corporation."
good,Navistar is a good company although there have been several financial struggles
good,Product development and lots of work.
good,A typical day at Navistar goes by quickly. There is plenty of work to do and projects to deliver. Great people but the company functions best when in fire fighting mode.
good,"Co-workers are one of the best perks of the job, very good work environment, very pleasant, enjoyed coming to work."
good,"Lay off is going to happen. Talk is cheap, so it’s everywhere.  I loved my job and didn’t miss a day.  Attitude is everything.  There are gravy positions and hard positions, find what you love and it’s all gravy."
good,Navistar is an insteresting company for the fact that they build to a customer's order rather than offering just a few standard style trucks. This does allow for defects to appear more often (fixed before leaving the line) but that is expected with the level of variation.
good,Company paid well but the management was very insane. Extreme micro management and don't trust their teams. No collaborative atmosphere. You have to just follow instructions and respect for any suggestions/feedback. Not a great company to work overall
good,"Good and bad like everywhere else, typical assembly work, some was faced paced and difficult other jobs were easy and could be done in the time frame given"
good,"I decline this option to participate in this query.  If forced to submit something to continue, I'll decline this function and leave Indeed, I'm sure you understand."
good,"Company still recovering from disastrous (noSCR) stratfy few years back"
good,"too many layoffs, no communication with the management, to many moves from place to place in multiple different cities, and finally too many upper management changes."
good,"A typical day would juts be assembly work, sometimes you may have to do a couple of repairs here and there. Since im a Group Leader i to call in more parts to the line, handle confrontations, make decisions that may affect the work process, and sometimes setup overtime. Management can be difficult sometimes but they try to be understanding to situations that may be work-related or personal-related. I'll say the hardest part of the job is communication. the enjoyable part of the job is really the people that you work with."
good,"Navistar is in the midst of a turn-around due to poor decisions by past executives in regards to emissions strategies.  There has been poor strategic product planning and program management.  Product offering is so broad that it drives unnecessary complexity in managing the product; however, the technical aspect of the product is not very complex.  As a result of the turn-around, there has been an enormous amount of attrition and reductions-in-force of entire organization.  Employees are currently hopeful for an acquisition and there are many rumors abound."
good,"Navistar is a company that possesses great talent, where employees have the opportunity to provide lean engineering solutions for future profitable growth opportunities across projects and programs."
good,"This is a good place if you are a mediocre engineer with limited ambitions. The people are friendly."
good,"If you want one position for life this is the company for you. "
good,the gime gime guys were always there every contract to threaten your job going to mexico
good,"Constant turnover of decisions, people and direction.  It may level out but not for a long time."
good,Navistar is reeling from bad engine designs.  I would recommend all job seekers to keep looking elsewhere
good,"Great  facility work demands can be a little much. Facility has all new equipment, ability to work from home."
good,Navistar could be a great place to work with the right manager and coworkers or a difficult place to work with the wrong manager. I have seen both. Office politics keeps the company from dominating the market.
good,"Being a master coach, I get the oppurtunity to interact with people; teaching, encouraging, motivating, and helping others understand our process and helping them realize that every job is important, and because we work together as a team we can accomplish anything."
good,Challenging place to work with advancement possibilities if you are willing to sacrifice principles.
good,Navistar integrated its Vehicle and Powertrain functions under the same roof at Lisle campus in Illinois. There are many activities and utilities provided to the employees.
good,"Good paying job, great benefits and insurance. Bad thing is, company doesn’t care about you though and doesn’t feel very secure. They have broke contract a few times and find loopholes to get you to do something you shouldn’t do if you don’t have the qualifications."
good,"it's a  great place to work "
good,I liked working there it was really good money and there's alot of good people there. The down side is they went down in production and had to lay off 126 people. Unfortunately I was one of them.
good,"always challenging and opportunity to collaborate with technical SME`s"
good,I was a remote worker at the Navistar account. I was asked to perform many migrations and handle day to day activity within the multiple development teams.
good,"not enough job security, fair salary, great benefits ,wonderful work hours Monday -Friday 6:30-4, union job, management needs improvement, employees are nice and very helpful"
good,"Great company, poor manager"
good,I enjoyed working there. Great chance to expand your career. I held several position there at Navistar. I would enjoy a chance to work there again. Pay is very good.
good,Great benefits but struggles with identity and direction. Management team lacks vision and drives for dates more than results. Could be better but not realizing potential.
good,While Interning at Navistar I learned a lot to advance my career. My boss was excellent at teaching. Lunch was on site and was at a reasonable price. Wish it didn't have to end so soon.
good,"- Some positions are overwhelmed while others are underutilized with some poor leadership and some best in the industry leadership."
good,I worked for Navistar in Fort Wayne until they moved the company to Illinois.  I enjoyed working there the management was fair.  Wish they would come back.
good,Nice facility.  Employees as well as contractors have access to gym. Not enough collaboration   More training need to be provided. Management could be more honest with team.
good,Navistar is a truck manufacturing company with many location's including headquartered in a beautiful location in Lisle Illinois. Very nice amenities at this location.
good,Flat org w/ no ops for advancement. stagnant now as company determines go forward strategies and leadership changes. Great place to learn skills for your go forward career.
good,"I began as a temporary worker at Navistar for 6 months and was laid off. Then I was rehired later as a temp for another year.  All the while making about $11/hr.  Then I was finally hired as a full time employee at 17.80/hr I think.  Total I worked there about 3 years.  "
good,"I didn't have any problems with the coworkers , although some were not very nice but I still got along with them. the managers were ok too. the factory did need some improvements there was a lot of injuries there though"
good,"Navistar is a good place to work.  Fair benefits, normal work day, good people, great products.  The company has made a lot of progress over the past few years."
good,my morning starts off with our meeting we take on spot on the line and begin to assemble trucks for 8 to 9 hours a day .keeping track of part numbers.so you can make sure that the trucks are being assembled correctly  .also going by all safe rules .
good,Could be ran better not really any employee input it's just like this is how it's going to be done pretty safe environment to work in but doesn't seem to be as employee friendly as it could be
good,Great Atmosphere you never clock watch and rarely do days drag on. It is a young fun environment. You can make a lot of money if you are willing to work for it. Would recommend to anyone
good,"Navistar was the first real job that I had, and working for such a large company allowed me to really learn the different aspects of the business world.  I was allowed to see how a large corporation ran and what the benefits and disadvantages were.  I have been able to take that knowledge with me as I continue my career."
good,"Is an American trucking company that provides quality vehicles from light duty to heavy duty. In addition, Navistar manufactures the largest school bus fleets which is over 40% market share."
good,"Worked there over 2 years and went through 2 lay offs because of the plant manager who is no longer there. He ran us 7 days a week after the company we supplied messed up and lost several contracts so we worked all this extra time to ""get ahead"" when we ended up not even using half of the material we used it still sits outside the plant."
good,"good place to work, nice pepole to wok with. depend on the vichle ypor driving you can get beat up, long days,can be hard work if you ley the job get to you"
good,"The people are the best thing about this place.  You are able to build relationships that will last a long time."
good,The company tries to take care of the employees providing a gym to workout and other areas to relax so not to burn out on the job.  The company went through a Lean period so it has highly efficient employees.
good,Co-workers are great to work with and are very helpful when needed. Management could be better under certain teams. I enjoy getting to use my degree while making lasting relationships with co-workers and clients.
good,its a good job. but overall it is a good company.it opened up a lot of jobs for our area and there are good people that i work with. it get slow at certain times of the year.
good,"30% reduction makes it difficult for growth opportunities. "
good,"Great place to work at. Great managers, The corporate building is easy to access from the highway. The company allows for career advancement."
good,Management is supportive of career and personal goals and aspirations. Strive to find resources for advancement and continuous  improvement.
good,"I worked for Tyco/ADT sell home security systems.  It was a good work environment.  Travel was 80%.  Cold calling, mailers, door hangers, canvasing geographic areas."
good,"Very busy day at work. "
good,"The greatest part of my job was autonomy, people did not interfere with my work, great feeling of trust. The toughest part of the job was working with the union."
good,"Due to changes in company structure, opportunity to advance within the finance company is limited.  Before the changes it was a good place to work, with plenty of various departments and opportunities.  However, after the decision to drop retail financing the staff levels and opportunities have dropped tremendously."
good,Struggling company and high rate of attrition have contributed to difficult work environment and demotivated employees.  The headquarters in Lisle are very nice.
good,"co workers are separated into two groups old and new. The older crowd are the untouchables. Job is straight forward once you get use to it. Layoffs are mentioned on a daily bases , ""stressful"""
good,They were forced out due to the new heath care laws. The branch closed and team separated.
good,I grew and developed my management and leaderships skills over the 10 years of service to Navistar.
good,Great company to work for and challenging every day.  Good people and great culture.
good,"Before the plant closing my responsibilities included mentoring new Engineers from the USA and also from India and Mexico, leading 14 different projects, assisting in Supplier Quality and Supplier training which would include going to the Supplier and evaluating the quality in their manufacturing, adviser for the Electrical power system area for the organization of Project Charters, and I would attend the pilot builds and assist to trouble shoot the issues and provide working solutions. I would follow my Projects from the Charter to grave."
good,"Work/life schedule is very managable. Work environment is good. Very nice campus. Good benefits for employees including full cafeteria, workout facility, basketball and volleyball courts and putting green."
good,As an associate in the Sales Leadership Development program I had exposure to management training and learned a great deal about the company structure and the automobile industry.
good,Was ok place to work until the company took the wrong turn.Not very stable.
good,Navistar is in a state of transition trying to change direction after poor decision s in the recent past. Though still an inefficient producer they are taking steps to increase efficiency which includes layoffs.
good,"Great company to work for.  Was able to prove my value, move within the company and be promoted.  Co-workers were great! "
good,The management and the crew are really self reliant. They did not help me with much. I was just shown where to go and what to do when I got there
good,"Lots of work currently, understaffed and underpaid. I have learned that working for very large companies isn't as great as it seems. Co-workers are great, corporate headquarters are more than plush. Great facilities."
good,Enjoyed my 15+ years with no regrets. Company has went global and now with the trying times has looked inward and its core assets to recover a viable business. The result has forced plant closures and lose of valuable people.
good,Member of North American Truck Division‘s “Weight Team”
good,"A very diverse manufacturing plant building 150 trucks per day, with 1 line and shift."
good,A typical day would consist of loading engine molds to be made. troubleshooting is a must during the process.
good,Considering the down time and uncertainty the company is just doing OK. The question is how long is this OK situation going to last. It is very uncertain whether it is going to be worse or there is going to be a slow recovery.
good,"At any large corporation, it is a challenge to navigate all the departments and groups involved in accomplishing simple tasks. While the expertise of long time employees is tremendous, there is also a growing void created by frequent job reassignment and consolidation. Work-life balance, collaboration, and other healthy lifestyle habits are strongly encouraged here. It is full of resources for those who want to take the opportunity to learn."
good,"Meet daily production matrix"
good,This company is based on assembly line work. You have a certain amount of time to complete all tasks per day. Sometimes the workload doubles or triple due to trying to complete contracts.
good,"This really isn’t a bad place to work. I met a lot of really cool people, AND some bad ones. People were helpful for the most part, pay is good, with the potential of being great! But...there’s always a feeling of instability whether it’s the union talking about strikes, or GM cancelling contracts...it’s always something. At this moment I am laid off, with little hope to return. Oh yeah, management sucks!"
good,"I’ve been laid off numerous of times and always have problems with unemployment. Every time they shut down or lay you off, it’s a stressful experience dealing with getting paid to make sure your bills stay caught up."
good,"A typical day at Navistar consists of sitting at desk, look through emails for work, then look through a ticketing system for any issues, support end users with variable issues, meetings about meetings, putting bandaids on applications"
good,"I never had a day at work that was the same.  Each day brought new opportunities to learn and new opportunities to push myself. The job itself was very satifying. When I was there in 2014 the company was in a bit of a transition, I have not heard since if things have improved."
good,"My day consisted of developing tests for an diesel engine system. Conducting tests on an engine dyno. Interacting with engines/hardware and software. Performing In/Vehicle testing"
good,"Good work culture with hands on work experience. Great Chicago area locations at Lisle and Melrose Park, Illinois and New Carlisle, IN if you work in product development."
good,"While as of 2014, a lot of ""the old guard"" wass gone, there was still a vibrant ""good old boys club""  if you are not in, you're probably out. Be aware that the people that are still there from the old Navistar will protect their own."
good,"Learned a lot but my role is now stagnant and I need different challenges, less stress and less hours being that I have two small children. Not enough managers to carry the work loads."
good,"ability to interact and use end product"
good,"Very pleasant work in the medical department covering phones, checking in injured or ill workers from the floor.  Scheduling workers to see the MD or nurses.Assisted with triage including calling for ambulance for serious injuries. Expanded role to process leaves of absence (FMLA, etc)"
good,Co-workers were great to work with.  Learned many skills while I worked at Navistar and met some great people.  Unfortunately the past few years we had been struggling and downsizing was necessary.
good,El manejo de las unidades y realizar pruebas de resistencia
good,"Cut cost, cut cost, cut cost, cut cost, cut cost, cut cost, invest a little, cut cost, cut cost, cut cost, cut cost.  Company run by a manager, not a leader.  Managers follow leaders.  Leaders lead.  R&D isn't about pinching pennies.  Rickety IT infrastructure, fragmented systems, and lack of automation drain productivity.  Company is top heavy - kept most of the chiefs; fired most of the indians."
good,The Company has employed some of the best engineers in the automotive industry & they will make the organization great again...
good,"An absence of product vision, business/marketing strategy, and knowledge or targeting of a competitive advantage makes working at Navistar both a frustrating and open-ended experience.  Without a solid foundation in the product strategy, it tends to shift monthly or so in priorities from cost to timing to quality and back again invalidating the work done continuously.  On the other hand, the lack of leadership allows for individuals to do what ever suits them well, for better or worse."
good,"good work life balance, but currently undergoing transformation."
good,Navistar is undergoing much needed transformation and experiencing growing pains as such.  While they are on the right track they are forgetting their most important resource -- people.
good,"Navistar is a challenging but rewarding environment, where you are focused on tasks based on strategic goals and cost savings initatives. Time management and multi-tasking skills are highly useful and you can see your work impacting the companies bottom-line. Most difficult thing is the challenge of increasing market share for our organization as volumes are dropping and suppliers are requesting increases, challenge is to use strong negotiation tactics to keep prices low in order to get market share back to keep Navistar in business."
good,"Interned at Navistar WHQ in Lisle. They were very flexible and paid well, and allowed me to grow my skills. They have tons of benefits like a putting green at the office etc."
good,"Always challenging environment, very entrepreneurial. Never a dull moment"
good,Navistar was a great company and unfortunately they are going through some rough challenges.
good,"In my present position, I am required to ensure that vehicles are repaired in a timely manner by getting required parts to complete the repairs as quickly as possible. The job is high stress, but often times rewarding. What I have learned most is time management and how to help others achieve business goals through training. The hardest part of the job would be the overall stress level of the duties of the job, which is often times comparable to a trauma center environment in terms of intensity. The most enjoyable part is being able to help others get vehicles back on the road."
good,I work with great people. I have made many great friends throughout my career
good,"Granted it is a hard job to train someone in. it is more of a hands-on, ""you'll learn when the time comes"" type of situation. However, this is not an effective method of training. I constantly felt like I was expected to just know how to do things one day when I had not been trained before-hand."
good,The people are the best part of working here. They are genuine and always happy to help.  The team I was part of helped me to gain industry knowledge.
good,"The workplace culture is very intense with changing focus points.  The product is the best it's been in years and taking that to market is great.  My typical day is administrative duties in the morning and evenings, and in front of dealers and their customers during the day."
good,"I am thankful for the various opportunities at Navistar providing me with a variety of jobs in accounting, finance and sales.  The company continues to have challenges and efforts to save money are through reorganization and layoffs."
good,Navistar is a fine place to work with good benefits and a solid work-life balance. Like any large company there are many pros and cons but ultimately it has provided me a good start to my career.
good,Difficult work under extreme deadlines. Support for peripheral programs is very weak. Lots of good technology. Lots of good technical people. Management tends to second guess and wander on mission
good,"My job was unique, which I loved.  I worked with a small group of people in my building, which I also loved...but the Engineering building was not as enjoyable to work in."
good,"An individual has the ability to learn a lot and progress if they so chose to, or become and expert in their current role.  The company offers a lot of opportunity to get involved in project work and work on cross functional teams."
good,"Great place to work and teamwork, very poor management, does not promote from within the company. Does not listening to the employee"
good,"Design Engineer: Design, development and application for the Engine Cooling System and Lead Engineer for defense trucks. Worked with cross-functional teams including Analysis and Simulation, and Mechanical Development and Reliability for successful product development. Worked closely with vehicle teams to ensure optimized design of the cooling system which involved testing thermostat, water pump and coolant tubes and installed them in flowbench and Dyno Lab for validation of parts."
good,Navistar Management personnel are too political. Friends and family of existing managers get moved up. Hard work will not pay off in this company.
good,I traveled primary to customer locations and to plants to improve production processes and quality of the final production.  The workforce is incredible and has lots of pride in the product.  However many times it was counterproductive to stop production or identify issues without receiving criticism from executive leadership.  With some minor changes this could be a great company and the CEO has made many tough decisions and has great ideas.  The issue is some of the leadership under his command doesn't follow his lead.
good,"Productive company, with benefits. Not much room for growth without a degree. Great employees where I have made some life long friends."
good,I liked working for Navistar. I learned and developed a lot in my current role.
good,pick and pack orders for shipping. The environment is nice and productive.
good,It wasn't a stable job.  Lay-offs happened frequently.  A typical work day would be about 8-9 hours. I installed harness covers and power steering hose for most of the day.
good,The position was extremely demanding and with the wide range of model mix and production level planning and execution for all maintenance activities and change overs were challenging but also very rewarding when achieved. Our facility produced 150 Long Haul and Severe Services trucks daily in a 10 hour shift. The work force was impeccable from the floor to the plant manger.
good,es un reto el conocer cosas nuevas y eso fue lo que decidi y en cierto aspecto fue logrado
good,Co-workers were always a pleasant experience with adequate training needs provided.
good,Good place to work on automotive related items. Worked on items related to multiplexed systems such as CAN 1708/1939 networks and visited the plants in Ohio and Mexico quite a bit.
good,The mindset of production people and new employees on line with right work instructions. Going to a visual work instruction and being consistent in way line is ran from supervisors and management. The company will do just fine.
good,"Fast paced with UAW representation"
good,Its a great paying job in which you know youll have day in and day out. its a union workshop that doesnt promote from within. if you are lokoing to go into management this isnt the place for you to work.
good,assembled engine blocks and operated a fork lift. Excellent work environment. have to use safety equipment around metal and iron. worked with a lot of skilled tradesmen.
good,This is a great place to work. Dress code finally got relaxed. People are great and hard working. Not a ton of politics at play.
good,"Multiple system integration provided ample opportunities to learn and co-ordinate with different teams. Enhancing technical and interpersonal skill."
good,"As a part of the SharePoint team, I really enjoy assisting users with gaining great business results with the solutions that I provide."
good,"A typical day at work was a past faced environment, learned a lot about heavy duty vehicles here. Management was great but depending which department you were in. It was a manufacturing plant and being there was never a dull moment. Always had something going in that needed to get done in a fast turnaround time frame."
good,"Typical work days are busy"
good,First class product training and knowledge. The amount of depth and understanding of competitive analysis and targeted marketing is amazing.
good,There have been some changes since I worked there. my warehouse was shut down due to corporate decisions of finances. Minimum notice was given. It was a good company to work for. Lots of opportunity to grow if you were in a major city where the opportunities were located or you were willing to relocate there.
good,"The hardest part of Navistar is ""NOT KNOWING"". No  stability at Navistar......Management is wonderful as    long as you perform your job. Co-workers are just that ...Ppl that you work with. I've learned a great deal about machining because of the management department and the few  machining personnel that cared for the future of the company."
good,"Good environment and good benefits, they offer me  overtime every week and supervisors are really nice. I got laid off. I really like working for Navistar it is really close to my house"
good,If you like working on big trucks this is the job for you. I enjoyed working here but the pay wasnt great althouhg the benefis were awesome and the trucks
good,Very stressful when not provided with the tool's needed. Assembly is done in less than 60 seconds. Once you get used to it. A different assembly begins. Overall very fast-paced and the day seems like it will never end.
good,"Worked from 10pm to 8am. I enjoyed driving a different vehicle each week, putting them through the paces of the track. It gave me new respect for the newer trucks and buses."
good,"Hired everyone through temp hiring staff agencies so they wouldn’t have to pay benefits. Shut this place down, do to this place not being a unionized workforce. Cheaper to lay everyone off here than the Union workers at other plants. Also had open a plant in Mexico as well."
good,"Too many short work weeks, do to part shortages. Hard to live when you don't work 40 hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to stay busy. It makes for a long day when you are creating work."
good,It was a really good facility in Lisle it's just that I worked as contractor and they treated you like contract didn't include you in any company business.
good,A great company to work for but the work is very hard. No AC in the summer so it very hot and could easily work 12 to 14 hours a day. Usually exhausted by the end of each shift.
good,This place was hotter than an oven and you couldnt wear cut off shirts or shorts. The benefits were good but some days we had to work 12 hours a day with only 1 hour break and one 15 minute break
good,Typical work day consist of making sure you are logged in to the cisco phone.  Certain managers are very strict about punctuality your computer needs to be running and logged into phone on time.  If not logged on exactly on time then you are considered late in the (WFM) Work force management system.  Only CSO ( Customer Service Operations ) Uses WFM.  You have to log out of communicator to even use the bathroom and if you do not then it will count against you as not being productive in WFM. Lots of system issues and lack of urgency.  You can be on time at work but marked late by WFM because computer can take almost 20 minutes to start up.  Learned alot about Internationals Engine platforms and Parts distribuition and sourcing. Co workers are easy to get along with but some tend to use vulgar language and can be childish.  almost everyone comes from a technical background which makes it easy to pick up trends and make good connections with the peopel you work with.  Hardest part of job is the WFM system and annual reviews are now being stongly based off the WFM system.  It is hard to get help and new information through engineering which increases tension when trying to support the product and provide troubleshooting steps to field support.
good,"I really enjoyed the people that I worked with and the job was both rewarding and challenging. Navistar was a good company to get a lot of experiences in different areas that you would get in most companies. In a give day I might be working on a quality issue with the plant or suppliers, then later working on inspection criteria for quality inspector or developing new processes that improve the flow of information through out the organization. I got to wear many hats which made the job very interesting."
good,Trying to recover from some terrible executive leadership
good,"This position provided good engineering experience. The people that work here are all very willing to help new people and are friendly. This may be subject to change, since the entire company is going through major transitions."
good,it a nice place to work the hour are nice and pay can get better but u got to put your time in I met some very nice co worker it very hot inside in some department .
good,"As a contractor for Navistar had little guidance and was given direction from too many people with no one fully communicating their expectations and needs.  Very confusing and dysfunctional department. "
good,"This was a dirty and very hot place to work. I was able to do almost every job there during the sixteen years I worked at Navistar. Very heavy lifting, pulling, and pushing. We made blocks and head for school busses and trucks."
good,"I was only a contract employee so I do not have an opinion for a review for Navistar.  I was told what I was to do when I first started and that the job would be for 4-6 weeks.  and in fact, I was there almost 1 year.  I did not go to many meetings as the employees did."
good,"The work/Life balance is great. The Financial Analyst has a very broad view of the Accounting cycle, you will learn a lot. The deadlines are great, give you plenty of time to close the Accounting Books, reconcile and prepare reports to Management. The only problem is when the automotive industry is in crisis, be prepared for massive layoffs."
good,"There is no typical day in Navistar for engineers. The tasks is based on the program assigned. "
good,I enjoyed the position I held. Was with company for 5 years. Gained a lot of experience. Good place for young single person to build resume.
good,"This has been a good company to work for. The opportunities to learn and instruct others occurred daily. A typical day would begin with a review of the production equipment status and any out of normal production requirements. As the day progressed if equipment issues developed I would dispatch skilled tradesmen to the site and if there was a need for assistance in the form of additional trades, Engineering support, specific documentation, job instruction, parts or materials would take the required steps to get what was required and communicate to those affected.The work force was comprised of a mix of skills and talents that could respond to most all situations. "
good,Good opportunity for technical challenge.  Strong product and long product history.
good,"Very diverse atmosphere, working with tech writers and engineers was pretty good to work with.  The mechanic work was outstanding, with use of new tools"
good,"Great company, good benefits and the head office is located in a really nice building in Lisle, Illinois. Management is pretty open and supportive. Overall a great place to work and gain experience on the transportation industry."
good,Enjoyed working hands-on with engineering to build configuration rules logic. Managed BOM changes while developing process to reduce engineering re-work.
good,Good company to work for but layoffs are pretty common. Pay is good and hours are decent. Supervisors are nice and friendly. Fast paced but fairly easy work.
good,"Strict deadlines. Accountants have to work 1 Sat every month. Two Saturdays every 3 months. Corporate segment wants to help or so they say. When you do ask them, they turn their back on you."
good,"No major complaints, it's a volatile industry, but it's a big company that can help you learn important skills. Engineering department has a decent track to follow for early career employees."
good,"I just remember always being rushed, and constantly being eye balled. "
good,Navistar is looking to grow and are willing to work with you to find the perfect fit. They take the time when they first hire you to train in their process and 3D software.
good,"I worked by myself for the most part, cant complain. Everyone was nice, but didn't see people often. Like the security measures taken in the building."
good,Good Company to work for and not sure that the addition of the Union had the effect that the employees thought it would. lots of time off for parts and order issues. Always the fear that the plant would close.
good,The pay and overtime is great! Management is terrible. They get nothing done. They also have a hard time keeping clients. The plant is running out of money and they have a lot of down weeks and layoffs.
good,"Navistar was a very enjoyable job. The atmosphere was structured and detailed (following each job allocation was critical.) My fellow associates were engaging and friendly as well as management. I learned how to assemble everything from pistons to flywheels (most engine components.) The hardest part of working there was learning to maneuver some of the airlift equipment that allow you to assemble parts of heavy weight or the engine itself. I enjoyed Navistar, as long as you did your work correctly and timely there was no trouble with management."
good,"Good company great opportunit, thankful, sad they moved location not very good about the safety of employees. i learned a lot there and that's why im thankful about my experience with them"
good,"Employees are dedicated to the direction of the company and Navistar is a great work environment for anyone who wishes to start an engineering, sales or management career"
good,"What once was a very an extremely respectable company has changed over the years where the bottom line is the numbers.  People are not important and the customer service is almost obsolete.  The company has struggle like most in the economical down turn, although I believe morale of the employee would produce a large market share as the customer satisfaction ought to be the target, not the numbers."
good,great company. took care of employees and paid very well. would recommend company to other people.
good,Learned a lot of things as a part of product development process
good,"Collaborative environment, challenging goals, great people"
good,A very good Place to start your career. Many Opportunities to learn and Grow.
good,"Meetings and schedules. Technical reviews."
good,"Coworkers were knowledgeable and supportive.  "
good,Great company that allowed me to grow and own my department.  Company has many opportunities to grow and challenge individuals.  
good,Great people and a great place to learn essential business skills.
good,"My typical day at Navistar start with my responsible for picking up 65 lbs. air compressor to prep for I6 engine. Scanning air compressor to main computer for accurate syncing with engine. Connecting all hoses, nuts, and bolts to air compressor with clinch wrench for installation to engine. Connecting all clap to all hoses to make sure no leak, slip, checking building ticket for engine work order, and assembly. Using power tool for torching nuts and bolts to air compressor. Prepping, installing dip stick to engine. Build and assemble manifold. Stocking area at all time, cleaning area at all time, and maintain working area at all time. "
good,Numerous changes over the years. People are great to work with on a daily basis.
good,"Great company for development, learning, and growth. Opportunity for cross functional learning and transfer to apply skills in multiple facets."
good,"I have seen this company through 3 CEO's, moved with World HQ 3 times and then even rehired me after I left once I started a family. I enjoyed working for Navistar and while the company is going through some tough times right now I really hope the new CEO can pull it back up to where it once was. Management was strong but asked a lot from staff when there is not enough people to make ends meet. requirements should have been adjusted after the loss of many within a dept. this was not done causing a lot of stress for good hard workers to meet their goals and feel successful."
good,Clean fun work environment with nice co-workers. Management made u feel like family.
good,A lot of good knowledge in the Distribution group. Many years of experience.
good,"Navistar is a great place to work and learn. I gained much experience in the field of Talent Acquisition and have the pleasure of working with friendly, wonderful co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the sense of satisfaction I receive with completing the many demands the position requires. Working with Coordinators and Recruiters was not only fun, it is a learning experience I will never forget."
good,"There is always work to be done, with plenty of knowledgeable co-workers to help understand processes. Management is willing to listen to process improvement ideas and implement them to better the workflow."
good,Great workplace for a lot of learning and to gather experience.
good,"Since Navistar moved to Lisle, IL it was best for my family to not re-located to Illinois."
good,The company was a great place to work and provided many opportunities for personal and professional growth. I was able to become versatile in my skills and advance my abilities through training and work experience.
good,"Great people at the mid management and skilled levels, but senior leadership is very weak.  Senior leadership seems mostly interested in managing symptoms and not root causes.   ."
good,The engine division is dead.  It was fun while it lasted.  Engineers were free to explore designs fully and push boundaries.  Advancement was slow to occur and benefits were mediocre.
good,It use to be a great place to work than all of a sudden got a manager that only cared about the bottom line not much about the workers there. Basically you did it her way or you didn't stay there long.
good,I liked working there.  Just needed to make more money at the time.  Would recommend working here if physically able. I learned alot from the staff.  They worked with me while having my child and gave me the days off I needed to be at hospital
good,"Same as the review previously written for ICC, with the exception of the work environment being dusty and hot.  It was a very good place to work, but the job security factor was not very good."
good,"Working on the big truck assembly line was both boring and challenging at times. It was especially challenging as a replacement employee with low seniority for much of my career. I was actually laid off the first 6 months of my 33rd year due an influx of higher seniority employee from closed plants in Ft Wayne, Louisville, Memphis etc. The pay and benefits were excellent. This was a UAW union shop, with good and bad people on both the union and management side.The most enjoyable part of any job is doing it right, with the customer's best interest in mind. In the insurance and real estate business I enjoyed helping people by doing the best job I could for them, As a server I was told I was the best in town by several customers. I treated them they way I wanted to be treated as a customer."
good,"Every morning I attend the morning safety meeting after that I meet with my Supervisor to find out where on the line I will be working that day. Then off to the job station to begin my day assembling turck with the parts from my station as needed from the stationary. I have learned many things over the years in fact one of the bigest things is equality and respect everyone wants to be treated fairly and be talked to in a respectful manner, and that alot of work enviornments are like a family you may have your boughts but were are all here for the same reason to do the best that we can do, make money and memories. My co-workers are amazing I get along with everyone the big thing is learning all the different personalities. The hardest part of the job is sometimes your expected to be a superhero and manage to do way more than you can handle but it also makes things interesting. the people are amazing and the fact that I am continualylearning."
good,Navistar  has  been  very  good  place  to  work .   I  ran  wastewater  daily   I   LOVE  my  job!   im  only  one  left  in  plant  and  don't  know  how long  til  building  will  shut doors.  im   kinda  in  limbo
good,Very rewarding and challenging. Like to work with various disciplines of people and responsibilities from upper management to the shop floor personnel. Unfortunately the company has ceased operation in Canada and moved to Mexico. I was not open to relocate my family outside of Canada.
good,Navistar is a good place to work with great people around you everyday. People are cordial and respectful all the time.
good,Incredible opportunities existed for increased education. Great co-workers-team environment.
good,"Overall a good company. They have good benefits and compensation."
good,"I have been working as a contract employee of Navistar for almost 2 years.  I was able to transition into a new position after only 4 months here, however after that management issues have seemed to leave my career stalling.  The company is on hard times, with lots of chefs in the kitchen trying to has things out.  There is no  longer a clear path of advancement."
good,I am responsible for the containment activities for both manufacturing plants.  Supplier and Assembly defects.  Determine root cause and put in place permanent corrective action.  I have 4 direct salary reports and 21 hourly employees.
good,The most important thing I have learned since working at Navistar is the importance of treating people well.
good,A great environment for getting your feet wet in areas that you may not have imagined working in/with. Cross-functional work often created great success through collaborations that led to better cost efficiency and lessened redundancy.
good,I enjoyed my job and I enjoyed working with my co workers we were line a big family we all got along great and we all helped each other out when needed.
good,"nice friendly people, great team work, supervisors willing to make sure you had proper training. Navistar made sure you provided proper safety equipment."
good,Navistar was a great place to work. They gave me a chance to learn a lot about engines and how theyvwork. Their work schedule was perfect for me. Their building was very clean.
good,The culture is a fast paced environment that expects a great amount out of its employees. I learned how to interact with suppliers to deliver the best customer experience. Navistar focuses on customer satisfaction and wants employees to learn from mistakes made and use them to develop a great product for the customer.
good,"Navistar is a great company in the midst of turning themselves around from the earlier emissions scandal. "
good,The environment was very relaxed but the pay scale is on the lower end of most jobs of the similar category. Unfortunately I had a contractor role and then I get any benefits but I heard that they were very expensive and helpful when he came to vacations and holidays.
good,"Navistar changed its mission and CEO twice while I worked for them and it was not always clear what was changing. The company core values also changed which was unfortunate as the previous values focused on respect for people and the new values focused on speed and agility.  The company I started working for had definitely changed dramatically in the time I was there."
good,Great Place to Work! Great Culture with many opportunities to learn and grow as a contractor.My manager allow me to take advantage of learning as much as possible to gain more experience and skills in my tool box of knowledge. I Loved It!
good,Great place to work. Generous contributions to 401K and management listened to your concerns. Some coworkers were jealous but they are everywhere. Got a lot of experience there
good,"I worked for Navistar for about 10 years and the company went through many ups and downs with management and CEO. The group I worked for the first 5 years was great team and department. I enjoyed the company at the time. Once the company made many changes and relos it was not such a job to look forward to every day. I left for other reasons, not by there decision. I always appreciate and cherish my time with Navistar. Currently, the company is looking much better. I would go back to work for them with no problem."
good,"Union shop"
good,I was an MDM consulting engaged to re-implement their Product Master system.  I was responsible to evaluating the current system architecture and suggest improvements.
good,A good place to work. The hours were great and the work was easy plus fun to learn new things.The supervisors were very patient and took time to make sure you know what you are doing.
good,"good co worker "
good,"Navistar is a good company to work for. They have good benefits and a good 401K program. In my opinion, upper management needs to sit down and train with employees at the lower levels to see what is involved in their roles and what is expected of them."
good,"Overall good place to work, good pay and benefits.  Only left company due to the closing of the facility in which I worked.  large organization that had many layers of management."
good,"Good pay, good benefits. It was a good place to work. Could be stressful at times but overall was pretty laid back. If you complete your tasks, you have nothing to worry about."
good,"Good benefits and pay, quick pace to work. long days in the summer with no air, some of the managers don't appreciate the hard work that the line workers do on a daily basis."
good,"i like my job, just need a little more income. Fast paced, do repairs on a fly, fix anything i can from simple as; pushing window seals in the right place to changing radiators on line."
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work.  Had my contract not expired, I would have continued with the company indefinitely.  Goals were reasonable, pay was fair.  Some days were better than others, but that's life."
good,"the place is clean and the work is interesting but some times there is a lul. also pay is kind of low i wish i could review Indeed, this is ridicules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Great people who could make a great company if they were allowed to"
good,"...if you enjoy Automotive engineering and related fields, be it: mechanical design, engine / vehicle electronics, program management, sourcing, sales, etc"
good,"Great pay, good benefits. People really pulled together to get the job done. Achieved alot of experience in different departments of the company. made a few good friends along the way, still keep in touch. Great Company, sad to see it close it doors."
good,"This company has a great rotation program called FALD, which will give the candidate a chance to rotate in three different roles at corporate and plant. The management style is ok, just like other typical companies at manufacturing industry."
good,i worked here as an intern during the summer of 2013. learned many things regarding manufacturing and quality control in an industrial environment.
good,"Fun work place when there were busy product launch. For engineer, it is place to learn diesel engine and commercial truck engineering."
good,I worked in the purchasing department . Excellent learning culture and team structure. Fast paced work environment and great company benefits.
good,10 hours of assembly building diesel engines in 90 degree weather in the summer.  I have learned to be very independent working at Navistar. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the 100 degree weather in the summer time. However the union accommodates the employees with water and other cold essentials. The enjoyable part of my job is that Management allows you to work independently and not watching over you.
good,Manged changes to vehicle throughout the life cylcle of the MRAP.  Updated BOM's and submitted engineering changes notices for documentation.
good,"I've learned after assembly in Indiana shut down that the best policy in dealing with the new management at Huntsville was to keep your mouth shut.  Management though intimidation  has become prevalent along with a ""part of pack mentality"" with some of the managers.  We lost good people because of the ""my way or the highway mentality""."
good,"Work within groups or independently"
good,"worked 10 hr days, learned what it meant to be a family member in a working envirorment."
good,I enjoyed having the experience to travel to other countries.  After three years of traveling three weeks a month it became trying.
good,"work depend on team work and fast pace, I have learned a lot from it the working environment was terrific and we communicated very well with our management."
good,"Good place to work if you dont mind traveling. "
good,"I am enjoying the design related work, here. You have freedom to work in office. People are really helpful."
good,"Manufactured 120 International trucks and department of defense vehicles daily. Very exciting, very hard working staff. Unfortunately the plant in Garland Texas was moved to Mexico early this year. Almost 2000 employees were laid off."
good,Enjoyed working at Monaco/Navistar. Company was sold & moving to Decatur. Would have liked to continue employment there.
good,"Navistar es una muy buena empresa, con prestaciones inigualables. El ambiente de trabajo es bueno al menos en las áreas donde he estado. Lamentablemente algunos jefes no ven por el balance en la vida de sus subordinados. También es difícil crecer sino perteneces al circulo de amistades de los de arriba. Las metas son alcanzables, pero en ocasiones te miden considerando las actividades del compañero de a lado."
good,Navistar ofrece la experiencia de conocer qué carrera profesional te gustaría hacer y te da las herramientas para desarrollarte en el área.
good,"This was a very exciting job, although they did away with orderlys. The different job tasks were always exciting."
good,No stagnation here.  Constantly learning something new.  Most people stay here for years which helps promote a stable and rewarding environment.  Develop trusting friendships with coworkers and management.
good,Good job sometimes extremely busy. Then bottom drops. People get laid off. No job is secured anymore. But its worth the stress because your paid very well.
good,Being in the process of making sure the customer gets what they want and what they pay for is great to work in. Making sure the customer gets a truck with no defects is very enjoyable.
good,"The job was easy. I picked, packed and shipped. Sometimes I would even work the dock. It just came down to the management because it was a union warehouse and management wasn't. They complain about every little thing and they had favorites. They wouldn't bat an eye if the person they sit and talk to did the same thing someone else just did 5 minutes ago. Don't get me wrong most of the time the management was right for doing what they did. But some of the things were really small and they just took it to far."
good,"I usually arrived early, prepped my station, and made sure that my area was clean and ready for work. My shift started at 6:30 a.m. and ended at 5:00 p.m. with lunch from 11:30 a.m.- 12:00 noon.  The company culture was one of respect and and fair treatment. In addition to learning the necessary skill sets for performing assigned assembly tasks efficiently and effectively, among other things, I also learned the importance of mutual respect, commitment to quality results and professionalism. My manager provided excellent training and supervision.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction experienced because of the exceptional collaboration between employees, managers and departments which contributed to an atmosphere free of intimidation and stress."
good,During the years I worked at Navistar there were several years of really good company performance and everyone was given profit sharing bonuses.  Other times there were times when IT migrations and program refresh would require vast amounts of OT.  Overall great place to work.
good,"Good place to work. Great people to work with, your work generally gets appreciated. Various departments don't reach out to other departments. Not a very process oriented company."
good,"A Typical day at work..."
good,"The company has good pay and great benefits. The people are friendly, and many will make an effort to help you where possible. They make a significant effort to avoid silos within divisions. Sales goals are not reasonable for most, and only a minimal bonus is attainable. Goals are based upon the top 10%, and are highly dependant upon national account sales orders. There is almost no product or sales training to speak of. Management will offer no assistance to underperforming salespeople."
good,"a good place to get experience and work.  A fast pace environment and good management. Will not be stuck working on a single part for years, but lots of diverse projects to work on."
good,"Muy buena empresa, buenas prestaciones y estabilidad laboral"
good,"The work was hard on your body, a dirty environment, making engines from raw sand to block and casting molds into metal, the people made the job bearable. It was a good environment, full of diversity."
good,"pretty good beginning introduction job to this industry. career advancement not as much as i had assumed but also is not that bad."
good,I am contracted in to Navistar so a review is not applicable in this case. I work full time at SERF Inc. as the operations manager. I will be available after the first of the year.
good,"Very strenuous, intense production line assembly and quality control. 4 10 hour days a week allows for 3 day weekend which is the best part of job. Unfortunately the real money and benefits are for permanent union employees and making the jump from a Temp to Permanent worker with full benefits can be a very long time coming."
good,"If you love big trucks, you will love working here.  Would probably still work there if they hadn't moved to Illinois.  The only downside was the attitude of the full time employees towards the temps."
good,Great employer for salary and benefits.  Teams working toward mutually beneficial goals.  Opportunity to learn in supportive environment.  You must find your own work/personal life balance.
good,15 years with Navistar has been a blessing. They taught me a lot abut trucks and buses. I was able to grow and move in different positions within my career. They are struggling right now as many companies so that is why I am no longer there but if asked to come back I would in a heart beat. I enjoyed the people there and what I was able to learn. This would be a nice place to learn about the truck and bus business if that is your field of study.
good,"Your days at work are pretty chill if you doing your job right, mangers all ways change so that suck because you get dum one th u get smart head strong one,co works depends where you work most where I was at was snakes that like to see you fail but then you had the one that will come to you at lunch n give you pointers to do better"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Navistar, the Culture itself was a great place to be at and the people were Great. I learned a lot working here, with all of the different parts on engines. The hardest part about this job was learning something new in the first day other than that it was very easy once you got it."
good,Would love to be able to stay here but I don't think that this company will exist in 1 year. It's a great place in a great facility in a great city with a poor mgmt. staff.
good,fun place nice co workers some crazy but overall good experience
good,"Navistar is a good company but with the financial issues and need for a challenge has left me wondering...""is the grass greener?"""
good,Basically a very good company.  Previous financial problems have been difficult to over come.  Decisions being made right now will make Navistar profitable in the future.  Good company that will eventually shine again.
good,"Good company to work for, but long term security is currently non-existan."
good,I am totally happy with the current project and work place. Its very cool environment.
good,"Typical day at Navistar, start with meetings to follow up suppliers issues, some times visiting suppliers on site or approving PPAP`s"
good,"They have a very dynamic engineering staff."
good,Company very good to work with employee trianing needs. Rewards implemented employee ideas.
good,Like the company but they've fallen on hard economic times.  Good place to join once their recovery plan has been executed.
good,Reviewed part and quantities daily to ensure production of truck units. Reported daily of any issues to management and worked with suppliers to work thru the issues to secure on time promised dates with our customers. This job was not enjoyable but it benefited me greatly.
good,"My experience while at Navistar was a positive one. Unfortunately, due to a reduction in force, I was laid off before I got to really know the company well."
good,"A couple of people in management wanted everyone to learn and sign up for training, so they advance their career for the next job. They want everyone to ""win"" and push that. They were aware enough to ride herd on those that need it, and left the self-motivated alone to do their work."
good,"Good job, good pay,  I would love to return to work. It was hard for me at first, but after you get the hang of it, things go pretty  smoothly. Its fast paced."
good,After working there for a year I go layed off for 6 weeks do to GM strike and then layed off again after working three weeks. Do to truck orders are going down.
good,Was a great job with good benefits and lots of time off. I wouldn’t have left but got caught up in a lay-off that reduced the plant workforce by two thirds.
good,La cultura de la empresa es muy buena y se motiva mucho al trabajo en equipo y apoyo entre distintas áreas para llegar a un fin común.
good,It was a good place to work.  The culture was great but later changed to not at good.  A few mean people were promoted and they treated certain people very badly.  They are technically strong and know their engines very well.
good,I enjoyed my time with most of the people I worked with for a little over a year. The management at the regional office is fantastic and dealer body is great.
good,I enjoyed working at Navistar. Great work life balance. .Work is not very challenging and trucking industry is mostly behind when it come to technology as compared to other industries. Good place to work for people with families.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, buenas prestaciones."
good,A very Family driven. Managers has a open door policy all the way up to the CFO and CEO.  Navistar believe in diversity.  Navistar is a strong believer of the STEM program.
good,Daily issues are identified with a three minuet window and 24 hours for containment. Working here has been enlightening and a great experience into the manufacturing assembly world.

good,My day at work started with checking my company email for job assignments.  I would either do the assignments on my own or work with the two other mechanics in my area.  I learned a great deal from working with the many different maintenance guys at Navistar.  The management team was happy with our work and treated us very well.  The hardest part of the job was locating materials needed for repair sometimes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the time and ability to learn.

good,The pay is decent the benefits are great and it's a fast paced job really keeps you busy but you never know if you will be working over from day to day

good,"It is very fast paced and stressful for the most part.  Usually on the go the entire time whether it's on the floor or at my computer.  Must have consistent daily routine to stay on par and/or ahead.  I've learned a tremendous amount working at Navistar:  handling multiple tasks at once, prioritizing tasks to meet individual deadlines, manufacturing culture, corporate structures and how each department work together, developed excellent people skills to manage union workers, supply chain operations and procedures, inventory control, lean management, line side presentation, and many more.  Union manufacturing is fairly unique in a sense of workplace fairness and following the structured rules within the contract agreement.  Hardest part of the job is holding people accountable for their work and responsibilities; and also attendance issues can cause major problems to ensure the business is operating 100%.  The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day when I can tell report that our team was 100% with no POA misses or line down time."

good,You know what you are getting into from day one. Coworkers and management are very supportive and helpful. Managers are very understanding of the unpredictability of life.
good,"The environment is fairly typical of a corporate office with jobs fairly well outlined.  The management is friendly, understanding, and know what they are doing, so you don't deal with things that are over your head too often.  Training is thorough enough to cover you for most of the tasks you will be doing, but a lot of lessons are learnt on the job as well.  Hardest part is knowing who go to when encountering something you've not seen before, but a quick word with management will usually sort that out."

good,"This has been a great job, I've learned alot on"
good,"There are no typical days. Every day is a challenge. It is a dynamic environment. Change is is what makes the company interesting and at the same time frustrating. Line and lower management are the backbone of successful operations. Mid management, in many cases, are a mixed bag of political hustlers and those promoted to their level of incompetence. Executive management has made mistakes in the past but show signs of big improvements. Company and union conflicts still exist but in an effort to keep jobs as a key objective have leaned to compromise. Outside of benefits, the major pluses for most locations are, a safe work environment, respect of people, customer satisfaction, competitive awareness, working colleagues, and recognition for a job well done. Cons are relative to location, immediate supervisor, and reduction of labor force."
