bad,"sales sales everyday speech .Dont work here better to work for free at the worst company. Ceo dont care no one cares, Horrible people at the top. Cut staff and Managers for nothing, if you dont sell watch out."
bad,This job is not secure people that had been there for years are getting fired for what ever excuse they come up with and people getting sick of all the stress.
bad,"Not for those scared of heights.  If you like working with tech it’s great and the customers are fun most of the time.  Avoid having a different van, stick with one and keep it well stocked."
bad,"Would include countless meetings, upper management yelling, and the focus on number of hours per day you worked - not what was produced.  There are badge stations that know when you get something from the cafeteria, go to the bathroom.  The workplace culture is not one to promote a fun atmosphere where team members can collaborate.  Travel to client sites resulted in shared rooms."
bad,Daily scolding are numbers met and not met.  They push their employee to excel with threats and scoldings.  the atmosphere is toxic and I could not wait to get out of the building.  I will never work for that organization again
bad,"•	In charge of training new personnel in download department"
bad,Management lacks in every way! They never make smart decisions nor do they ever do testing.  They have no people skills and are constantly dishonest about things.
bad,"CEO, VPs, Regional Management, are talented in the abusive management style.  Adults yelling down the management hierarchy instead of coaching.  They even bragged about being able to yell at your employees in order to motivate them."
bad,"The management and business is very disorganized, the fire people at there leisure. The security is a joke. Would not recommend to no one to work there."
bad,"Incredibly unrealistic expectations of their workers as in number of saved customers daily/weekly, time it took to save that customer; i.e. 2min from start to finish of the call with an 80% save rate. Constant bombardment of calls from angry customers that didn't realize how bad the satellite signal would be, can't get an upgrade, their bill suddenly became more expensive, etc, etc, etc.Constant bombardment meaning the second I hung up the hone another call came in."
bad,It is closed now. Treat you like you are a kid. You go to the bathroom. You have to log-off. For how many minute you use in the B.R. then deduct the time from your lunch hour.
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Poor pay, poor benefits, no advancement and terrible management.  No consideration for workers lives and needs.  I would never go back."
bad,"Just do your homework before considering joining this company or Dish Network. Read all the reviews in depth. Also, research who the worst company to work for in the US by their employees ratings..."
bad,"Worst place to work, no promotions, management lies all the time."
bad,You are made to badge in and badge out when you leave the facilities even in the Corporate Office. It is a toxic environment and not very open minded and they pay 20-30% below market for positions.
bad,Not a good place to work. Your a number not a person and you only get promoted if you friends with the boss. Coworks hate each other and management is a joke.
bad,"I did not like working here.  The short period I worked here, I was moved around departments and the QC team was really strict.  The pay was low and benefits were high."
bad,"Anytime you are subjected to being cursed at, having your childrens lives threatened and then told by your supervisor that you got the customer off the phone to quickly it is a problem. Supervisors and managers expected everyone to try and sell customers extra channels that they did not need simply to get more money even if you had spent well over 30 minutes on the phone with the, being belittled in every way imaginable."
bad,"I highly recommend that anyone considering working here think again. In order to work here, you must move to Cheyenne which isn't everyone's cup of tea. Between the weather and the intense loneliness and boredom and insane jerks, not everyone will find the capital of Wyoming in the southeast corner of the state to be habitable, certainly not desirable. "
bad,"It is difficult to work for Dish/EchoStar.  The management is in constant flux and turmoil.  The pay scales vary regularly as the upper management try to adjust pay to pay less for more effort and achievement.  Values change with meteoric speed.  The sales staff there are some of the best I have worked with.  Sharp, aggressive and most have a good sense of humor. Because of this there is a good deal of turnover as they can find less difficult culture elsewhere."
bad,Strange place to work nobody says hello when you walk by. Management doesn't care about you or making you better. Its rated like 1st or 3rd worst company in all the polls and the company doesn't care. Benifits are expensive. I need to get out
bad,- Provided excellent customer service to all positions
bad,The management at EchoStar in Cheyenne was the pits! Lack of managerial experience which caused a lot of the hostility within the department! They have a revolving door of employees due to the terrible way they ran the department. Co-workers were okay because they had to deal with the same problems & many were unhappy but were unable to leave like I did. Benefits are horrible! What I learned was there was no advancement at all just lateral moves with no pay raise. Many of my co-workers who have been there for many years were stuck in the same position for many with no advancement or raises while others like myself would come in at a higher position & pay which I found unfair.
bad,"It cost more to work here then being unemployed. Benefits change from month to month. Gas reimbursement, forget about it."
bad,This is perhaps the worst company in the country to work for.
bad,Too much overtime it's great if you have no life or family. The customers scream and yell at you all day long. Management only care about their numbers. Low moral.
bad,"mundane , low morale, management is chosen on a first come basis... co-workers are zombies and the hardest part of the job is being there. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving."
bad,"You're not a technician, you are a salesman. There is never a set time you might get off work. Your schedule changes weekly with no notice in advance. You have sick days but are penalized for taking a sick day or pto."
bad,"As a salaried employee, I felt belittled by having to swipe my ID badge when I came in and left the building -  like a time card!  There was no employee appreciation or team building experiences except shared disgust with the company.  I resigned as soon as I could."
bad,"Run away and don't look back!  In my short time there, 2 directors and one senior executive literally walked out on the CEO!  "
bad,EchoStar was named one of the worst places to work.  Look up EchoStar on Glassdoor.  Look up EchoStar in Newsweek.  Trust what you find there.  Atlanta was bad.  Colorado is the worst.
bad,"Training was heavenly. You sit back and collect great money for doing nothing but soaking in what seems to be the longest Dish network commercial ever. The torture comes when they throw you on the floor with back-to-back calls. Mostly irate people. Not just because of their original reason for calling, but most of them have been waiting for 15min, and some have been hung up on by other agents. You're instructed to handle ALL issues in under 5min. If you're too helpful and go over time-- write up. If you're not helpful-- write up. Release the call to boost your stats-- write up. You ask for a coach to take an escalated call or make a billing adjustment to an account-- you get avoided or laughed at. Breaks and lunches resemble a mud fish mating pool. If you crave drama you will THRIVE here. I only worked there 2 years and I learned A LOT. I feel like after that I can survive anything, but I would still never EVER go back."
bad,"It is a dead end job with absolutely no opportunity to grow or make a career out of it. Definitely one of those jobs that defines a person and their ambitions, there were people there who had been working there for over 20 years and never been promoted, you either work there and realize that you need to change your life or work there and stay stuck there. Compensation started off good but they changed and it ended up being really bad pay!"
bad,"This company prides itself on being the lowest cost tv service and 1 of the biggest ways they do this is by severely overworking and underpaying their employees.  When an employee gets to a point where they've been there too long and are making more money than they would like to pay that position, they will either fire you or make things so miserable you'll want to quit.  For 3+ years I was putting in extra time from home every day of the year that I was not paid for.  I was lied too by 3 different managers each of those 3 yrs that a position was being created for me that would result in more pay for the work I was doing but this never happened.  Eventually they let me go for something they perceived as a problem but had never been brought to my attention at any time as being a problem."
bad,A day at echostar is a stressful event with customers who  hate you and management that seems to hate you even moore.  They expect improvement but do not provide any tools for you to improve with.  Periodically they get rid of several employees.  Ironically enough it is usually the highest paid employees that get fired.
bad,"I arrive at work early in order to log in and get ready for the day. Once it's time to take begin taking calls I open my phone line and proceed to respond to our high call volume from customers, old customers and even new or potential customers. My day consists of answering back to back calls until the end of my work day. I help customers set up accounts with our service, answer any questions they may have about their account or any troubleshooting questions they may have. I always try to satisfy the customer by using my up-selling skills to teach them about different packages they could sign up for or better equipment that they will find useful. Included in my daily routine was responding to retention calls. I enjoyed being able to help customers keep their service by offering them solutions to their problems."
bad,Most management was horrid. I was one of the lucky ones to report to a descent manager but the director was horrible. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
bad,"Dirty created air that produced respiratory infections. QC harasses the workers. Hostile environment that would threaten termination. Cost cutting made satisfying requirements very difficult and time limitations encouraged mistakes that were penalized heavily. Job applications all but ignored by HR unless you were friends or family with someone important. Work was exhausting and bad for health. Best part was my last day when I walked out for the last time. If I could, I would give negative 3 stars. Stay away from this place!"
bad,This was the most difficult place I have ever worked. It was a very toxic environment with management that treated all staff like children. We were micromanaged and my boss played favorites. She would actually take a few of her favorite team members to Rockies games and leave the rest of us behind. Learned a lot about processes related to what I did and that helped in the next role. Pay was low.
bad,"don't work here its hard to satisfy all the different people, because one wants it done this way , then your trained to do it this way, then new equipment comes out and more training, I felt I spent for time training then working some times."
bad,Management will stab you in the back just to have something to do. Upper Management will scream about policy until no one is looking then threaten your job unless you do something they know is wrong. They owe remote techs just from the Fairmont WV office hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay because unless you worked off the clock and drove the truck off the clock you were fired.
bad,They are overly demanding and do not recognize a good worker when they see it. I was fired 1 week before Christmas because I did not fit the companies new direction.
bad,"Had to make outdated, unsupported equipment work by taking parts from the back-up systems to maintain satellite support. Management both in the building and corp. kept giving the financial support to other stations and upgrades to every other department. Was promised an upgrade to systems that NEVER happened and to my knowledge still hasn't happened even after 4 yrs. Co-workers were great."
bad,EchoStar (Dishnetwork) is a company that I am sorry I ever applied to and worked for. My stress level has gone down tremendously. I am now able to sleep thru the night.
bad,DIsh Network treats you as just another number equally replaceable. You are told to appreciate the job you have. The only motivation to do anything is to not get fired as doing well will not be noticed.
bad,"If your into burning up with excessive weight connected to your body while on the roof, go for it.  If your into freezing in the cold Texas winter months while weighted down on a roof go for it.  If your not really into good pay or weekends off, go for it.  Otherwise, this job isn't for you.  Beware, managers will yell and scream about things outside of your control, i.e. customers wanting a different package from what Customer Service has billed the work order for.  You, as the technician are caught in the middle, and should expect to be asked why you didn't meet your metrics, even though you reported the discrepancy.  And don't count on Customer Service to back you up with customer interaction facts.  They cover only their own tails and put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the field tech.  Good luck to all who venture their way for lack of other resources available."
bad,this was by far the worst company I have ever worked for.  The environment was hostile.  Certain employees were allowed to run rampant and actually sabotage projects.
bad,"Echostar at the time was a ""sweat shop"" environment, management was grinding, unfair and stifling. I did not enjpy the position and left as soon as I found a better position."
bad,Great place to work if your management (which I was) but as a rep you were hounded constantly regarding quota. Favoritism was a cancer at my site and I had to butt head with HR daily to protect my agents
bad,"As a rule the people on the floor that I worked with to be good hard working and enjoyable people to be around.  "
bad,Trained for Technical Support... I was forced into sales...
bad,"You must clock in through a turnstyle every morning and then clock out through the turnstyle at the end of the day. Any divergence in your time will qualify you to be fired, no exceptions."
bad,"Just a terrible place to work. You were expected to bend over backwards on most projects and when you did, there was no special acknowledgement. i. e. .....thank you, nice job."
bad,No communication between departments. The departments are separate silos and the management will do everything to keep it that way. Upper management is a good ol’ boy system. They only watch their own back.
bad,The company is pretty standard in terms of HR/Benefits offerings.
bad,"All dish cares about is selling the customer over priced soundbars, surge protectors, remote covers etc. My fsm manager was great however the directors care only of sales. Great environment for working, just constant phone calls and txtn from ppl you work with trying to inquire sales. Hints why dish has non up to date equipment. Its faulty mostly returning to fix issues with the equipment. Dont go to work here unless its a job that isnt a tech job. Stay clear of here."
bad,"typical day at work = fun, demanding, challenging. Management was some what helpful. they are good on implementing new changes but lack in help if needed. Co-workers awesome people to work with."
bad,"Way slow and way set to the way we have done, and worked, before so no need to try anything new.  Someone else is bound to do it, do not rock the boat."
bad,"I liked the company when I started there, it was fun and no one watched over your shoulder. When things started to change, it became hard to work there do to we the employee's would have to raise their hand's to get help from their supervisor, we could not stand. We also had to save customer's from disconnecting their service."
bad,"Honestly the management was horrible, overtime was mandatory which made home life difficult, absolutely no sick days available and even if you had a note from doctor you would still get docked, no advancements but only on pay but not position wise. Not the best place to work but they will make it seem like it at first then once you actually see how it works to get advanced thru the company it becomes completely shady."
bad,"                        The position of Tester, warranted me to test Dish Network satellite receivers to 			ensure they were they were in proper working order.  Part of the training also 			allowed me to complete Spartanburg Community College's Center for 				Accelerated Technical Training (CATT) certification."
bad,This place is not a good place to work! They lie about the job duties you are hired for versus the duties you are trained for and the duties you eventually do once you are on the floor and phones. There is rampant abuse of leadership and people in positions of trust can't be trusted.
bad,At the time I worked there it was a new center so there were a lot of growing pains.
bad,"company does not care about their employees, they work people a lot of hours and pays them little to nothing"
bad,"Was there only for the short period of time as a contractor. "
bad,Echostar is not a well-run company. This is the kind of job you take when you can't find another job or need to get your foot in the door. It reminds me a lot of a prison.
bad,"Working internally the CEO and founder seems to have set the tone for the culture of the company, which is suffocating. The upper management encourages a manage-up style instead of managing the employees creating and disconnect and discouragement among the employees. "
bad,"EchoStar is great for recent college graduates to get their career started.  EchoStar is typical 8-5 job with minimal stress and risk involved.  The management is top heavy so career advancement is unlikely and if a position does open up, they will fill the position with an outside candidate.  The good news with EchoStar is job security, the bad news the lack of pay and benefits.  The culture and moral are very low at EchoStar, but most of the employees are content with there careers and have very little desire to venture out for a risk and reward position."
bad,"If you are a teenager, with no life, and lies and deceitful practice is ok with you. Then its a good job."
bad,"Regular 50-60 hour work weeks, trying to do what was asked until management decides what course of action they want to take. Politics are the rule of the day, and it isnt what you know, it's who. Mid-level management is good, but no cohesiveness at the top and no clear direction. Co-workers are the only thing that made going to work bearable, but even those are leaving as there is struggling between the parent company and those companies they purchased."
bad,"Rampant calls from irate TV customers, sardine can style call center. TV rips off people as bad as anything. Unexperienced people ""leading"" others; tenure as key. Ghetto, unprofessional workers. Snap decisions were being made all the time by management. You could ace your position and be phased out into a whole new area of the company almost overnight. Socially driven atmosphere."
bad,"4 day work week with 10-12 hrs. shifts..mandatory overtime.. work in rain, cold, hot  weather.. drive company van.. provide great customer service skills. Use of power tools, satellite meter, ladders.. go into crawl spaces and attics.. great pay.. undermanagment.."
bad,There are possibilities to learn (for some people) and work is interesting. Most people who work there are great. The company policies make management to treat its employees just a little better than slaves.
bad,"The company wasn't so bad back in the old days when it was still small, but as the company grew and when it split into 2 companies in 2005, Echostar and Dish Network, that's when it really started going down hill. The DISH side was much worse than the Echo side."
bad,Turn and Burn mentality  get the customer to sign up at all cost mico mgt work environment no future in the company bathroom break raise your hand and ask nicely and hurry up
bad,"I started off on the ground level at Echostar and through hard work, a good boss, i was able to advance.  The company atmosphere/culture is lacking to say the least.  They teach a class here that culture is one of the most important items in a company, while also one of the most difficult to change.  Things haven't changed here. The culture is lacking.  Twisting arms to get the day after thanksgiving off is incredible."
bad,"This place can be a good place to work. The long days with the changing in your schedules every 6 months or so. There is a paid time off but if you don't get sick you will have them to use. Management is never happy about the progress that the employees make, They are always on everyone's case about time and call volume.   With this company they want you to forget about life outside of dish and just focus on the company and their values if there is any. This job all comes down to good money  for the area. If you can take the changing of schedules and the way you are treated on the phone. This job could be for you."
bad,"While working at the call center it became abundantly clear that anyone outside of the management teams was a number. Little to no opportunity exists for advancement. I started off on one of the worst shifts in the building and it took me a year to get off that shift. There is no flexibility on work schedules, sick days or time off. Everything is treated as an absolute. I had to go the hospital because of a medical emergency and was nearly fired because i missed 2 days after having missed days previously due to family emergencies. Employees have little to no rights in the company and they actively look for reasons to keep you from getting bonuses and rewards that company touts to its new employees. The metric goals they set are generally unreasonable especially since a majority of these metrics are entirely out of your control. This is not a company you want to work for."
bad,"As customer service call center, very demanding calls, very short breaks"
bad,"They have fair wages."
bad,need to have alot better managers and upper manager that know what they are doing and how to treat there employees fair and not have favoritism of any kind
bad,"they company just liked to use people . they never like to pay you but they ask a great deal out of you day in and out. Management was very poor ,they didnt take care of their employees"
bad,"Do not recommend as the management, culture and environment are undesirable. The health benefits are lacking and the number of vacation days are less than what other companies provide"
bad,"I learned a lot about electronics design while working at Echostar. I helped created some award winning technology. It was my first job after college, and I worked there for about 15 years."
bad,"Executive team is out of touch with current employment practices. Workplace culture is non-existent.There is no business plan, at least not shared with employees."
bad,EchoStar is or can be a terrible place to work. Middle management is held by some under trained people in need of some people training.
bad,"I hated working there, there was structure or good leadership at all. there was no work ethics or room growth or improvement at all in the company"
bad,"The technical difficulties that are being addressed are real. They are ground breaking and it is exciting to be a part of a push for TV innovation."
bad,"I did enjoy the job in the end.  I was one of the top sales agents and they decided to have a $10,000 sell off between the top sales agents in our region.  I was impressed with the amount of effort they put into the contest."
bad,Frustrating management team. Little chance to advance within company.
bad,"Handled Inventories, large collections and different area in Accounting."
bad,It was a great place to work with plenty of friendly people. I learned a lot about the job from the supervisors and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to finish every task
bad,"Poor management, poor pay, and people promote their friends rather than those qualified. Also had issues with HR, which did not seem to be taken seriously."
bad,I just filled out the review? You had me review some prior employers and come back to this one? Come on indeed this is a little bit ridiculous. DRRRRRRRRRRR
bad,Poor senior leadership and no vision for future growth of EchoStar. The culture is very depressing and no fun is had at work.  You will work hard and get no reward.  Benefits are not good. The most enjoyable part of this company is that it is leading edge techonology.
bad,"Company is not mature to modern industry concepts.  The management style is of the 1980's and fails to keep good employees because of poor management decisions.  "
bad,"Performed workforce management duties (scheduled agents in a call center, scheduled time off requests, ran performance reports, performed statistical analysis for business needs).  Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  Overall the organization was more concerned with the bottom line and not with the people in the organization or the customers purchasing the service."
bad,"Dish Network was a fast paced multitasking enviroment. My taem had great chemistry, cause we were left toour own defences often."
bad,"At dish the management they have is really just a puppet to upper management. If a process doesn't make sense or does not benefit the customer or the company's employees nobody has the idea to challenge the directives that are set in place. Also in a one particular position I held, although we have Paid Time Off given to us, we had to ask permission to put in that PTO even if the day was available to take off, most of the time a lot of us were told no. Employees there are placed on performance improvement plan and even though they pass all metrics in the plan, the company will still fire you since it is an at will company. They do not care about their employee's the attendance policy is horrific, you can only miss 8 days out of 365 or else you are fired. Place is a very stressful place to work. I would recommend against making this a career choice if you don't have to, find a place that respects it's employees. A place that works for it's employee's so it's employees can be solely dedicated to working for it's customers."
bad,Depending on management you can  get the support you need to advance if management does not believe in you you will be unable to advance or transfer out of that department
bad,It was an ok place to work. the management was very young and it felt like I was back in High School again. the pay was ok for what the type of work you did.
bad,"Fast pace work area.  Always on the phone.  Loud working environment, in a call center.  Hard to concentrate when talking to the customer to assist."
bad,"The work environment varies depending on each departments management chain. However, there are constants including lower than average pay, poor benefits package, high turn over in general, and an overwhelming number of executives and directors that resort to yelling and cursing as standard practice in day to day operations. Both technical and business support salaried positions are pushed to work overtime as standard practice. Negativity from the top down yields a work environment thriving on low morale and employees just trying to keep their heads down to get home without daily conflict. There is a lack of positive encouragement at the company as a whole, of course there are those rogue managers that do a great job supporting their employees and providing positive leadership, but they are in the minority."
bad,Just a normal call center job.  40 hrs a week listening to people complain about their services.  Fairly boring environment and a non existent chain of command.
bad,Working at Echostar means giving your life to your job. You typically have a day filled with people yelling at you and you giving credits to the bill to make people happy.
bad,I liked a number of the people that I worked with.  I was able to take on a variety of responsibilities.  Management was not very good at identifying talent and helping people to contribute to the company.
bad,The job was quite easy but the management was relatively senseless. Seems like the place is run by people from a different era of business struggling but failing to keep up.
bad,"A day at echostar is very stressful and ovewhelming. I believe all of the workers are underpaid and deserve better than what they are being treated. The people there are great but the job is so stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people who called in, because I love people and love to talk. The hardest part about the job was making the manager happy in which it seems as if nobody could ever do that."
bad,"Changes inevitable but no proper training. Management is only worried about numbers nothing else."
bad,"A typical day at work was taking care of customers with billing, packages, technical support, and listening to their needs. I learned that my personal beliefs were not looked at respectfully by everyone and it was taken personal. Management for the most part is great, but there are as always a few bad apples. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what I would personally be asked to do each day outside of my job requirements, for example, change some of the personal information regarding my beliefs, being asked to do drug testing during my shift, and seeing that the measure taken for absences with other employees was not the same for everyone."
bad,I started working here directly out of high school. It was good experience and job training. The hours were long and the schedule was not flexible but the pay was nice.
bad,"EchoStar is an easygoing work environment with good people and a chill atmosphere.  However, middle and upper management are terrible, with a few notable exceptions of course.  Benefits are below average and pay is below average.  Accountability is non-existent.  For those on the twilight on their careers, there is no better place to work as you could ride it out until retirement without doing anything at all.  If you still have passion for design and want to work on something competitive in the consumer electronics industry, you'd do best to look elsewhere."
bad,"Talented staff of employees made working at Echostar enjoyable despite the worst benefits of any engineering company where I have worked. The company produces quality products."
bad,Typical call center job.  Lots of turnover.  Cold calling is a lot of the job
bad,Interesting opportunities for experience in operations.
bad,A typical day at work involved learning about the industry and contributing towards management goals. The hardest part of the job was collaborating with colleagues.
bad,This was a good company when i first started working there. this is also where i met my spouse and we were equals and not any type of direct report. once we decided to get married we told our boss and we found out that he also was interested in my spouse and got vendictive and looked for a way to get rid of me. we moved out of town which allowed for us to resign
bad,I enjoyed working with my tteam I did not approve school shedules they would sometimes not work with school shecdules and mandatory overtime
bad,The job itself was not difficult. Customers could get angry when having no signal. Co workers and Management was not professional at all whatsoever.
bad,"The day starts with calls and ends with calls. I learned that if you want to make sure someone keeps their word you must get it in writing. Management treated new employees like they were less than them which made the job less enjoyable. Co-workers were great, i made some close friends through this job. The hardest part of the job would be trying to maintain a low call handling time, it seemed like their expectations were a little high. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers out."
bad,The company is currently far behind on technology as they hold on to outdated design techniques refusing to adapt to current technology standards.
good,"Management was awful, they were very unorganized. Co-workes was the only good thing about this job. I really disliked mandatory over time they forced you to come in on your day off with no notice and if you didn't show up to work it would be counted as a ""No Show"""
good,"Interesting place to work to say the least."
good,I had to load and unload tr4unks and clarify and check invetory.The job cause for long hours. my schedule was 3pm to 11pm but i would have to work until 4am sometimes to 6am . and if i wanted to leave at my regular time they would deduct points from me.
good,This particular environment was more hostile than anything else.  There were a few good people to work with but overall the company had a hostile work environment basically towards everyone.
good,It was a fast paced place to work. The pay was decent. The management and politics were the bottom of the barrel. They were rated the worst place to work in the nation by Glassdoor for a very good reason.
good,"The training provided was intensive and prepared me well for the job. The job in it self was not a bad job, but management was unprofessional and employee moral was always low. No job security. There were days when 20+ people would be terminated. Had everyone worried all the time."
good,If finding joy in helping others is your strength Echostar would be a good company to work for. Throughout the years of working there I have increased in my level of having patience for others as well as learned how to deal with conflict in a respectful professional manner. The most enjoyable experience I had while working there was meeting alot of wonderful people which assisted me getting me through my days even when they were highly stressful.
good,"Subpar compensation, poor benefits package, unethical sales strategies encourages, increasing irrelevant group of products/services. Mid management concerned with simply keeping their job. Extreme disconnect between uper management/C-Level execuives and associates exclusively interfacing with existing and potential clients."
good,"Typical day starts with a meeting so you can watch your manager read his email - very counter-productive."
good,"Echostar is a decent place to get your feet wet but past that, moral is poor and most within the company are more concerned with the politics than product."
good,"typical day is easy. A lot to learn if you are on right team. Senior management lacks vision. Co-workers are good, nothing more or less, just like at typical"
good,"Team work                                                                                                         Data Entry "
good,"There was one manager during the time I worked for Dishnetwork that was absolutely phenomenal.  The other managers were average, but it seemed like it was more due to just giving up & not wanting to push anymore.  "
good,If you like working in a call center than this is the place for you. I did not like the mandatory schedule changes every few months. Make sure to get to work at least 20 minutes before your scheduled shift to find a computer.
good,The technical elements of employment are extraordinary and fun to learn. The management environment is very tightly controlled with little latitude for bottom up collaborative improvement strategy.
good,I learned a great deal from my coworkers and manager. I experienced situations that helped me grow as a person and I'm grateful for that. The hardest part of the job is getting all the work done on time and starting out when there were no departmental procedures to follow. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I met. It is a highly competitive environment and people are encouraged to step out of their comfort zone as it is the only way to move up in this world.
good,"Answered incoming calls for customers and field agents needing troubleshooting and installation instructions. I enjoyed meeting new people to work with. Two things made it hard to work here. One was finding a manager that was willing to help you if you had questions, The second was trying to balance work and family."
good,"• Participated for four months in Hurricane Relief Crew efforts in Florida"
good,"At this place you are just a number. It is male oriented place and there is no room for a female supervisor. They will make your life miserable until you quit on your own,."
good,"Dish just like many corporate giant is huge on rules unspoken or otherwise, and trained their employees to do things that can later come back to hunt the company. This style of management lead to many lawsuits that are still being fought today"
good,Employees were treated as bodies in chairs. Very little reward and recognition was given. High turnover rate and poor leadership in most cases. Would not reccomend.
good,Working here was like all deadlines were due last week and your hair is constantly on fire.  There is nothing at all that moves at a regular pace and ever since working here all other employers have asked me to slow down and take more time and give myself more time to complete tasks.  While here they take full advantage of all your skills but never plan to pay you for all of your assigned tasks.  They called it career development and training.
good,"Assist with technical question, troubleshoot and try to fix issues over the phone with the customer. Keep up to date with constant changes and equipment upgrades."
good,"you have to set you own pace, no one is willing to listen to your idea you have to set the standard for work, you are overwork and not enough composation is awarded towards emplooyee's"
good,"Very little chance of promotions.Had 1 promotion in over 16 years.Very little training, had about a month and a half of training in 16 plus years. Management from what I received was by intimidation."
good,"EchoStar is ok if you can survive the first year. Benefits are not the best but have gotten better over the years. Fast paced environment, must hit the ground running."
good,good place to work depending on the department. 24/7 facility with a good bunch of employees. Good company values and a diverse background.
good,Back to Back customer service on bill and technical inquiries. Able to view situation from a customer perspective. Team mates was the most enjoyable part of the job
good,Almost every day was the same. It was a repetitive routine. I learned a lot about cable and receivers. As well as remote controls. It was all for DISH network. Management was disappointing. I attempted to go part time and was denied several times. Even though I was told they would work with my schedule so that I can go to school when I interviewed. The co-workers were great. The best part was when your shift was over.
good,"• High call volume (up to 120 calls per day)."
good,"Benefits were horrible. After the company hit 6 years old, the owner no longer cared about his employees. Year after year benefits got worse."
good,"Walk-in to a fast paced buzzing workplace. No telecommute option. Nice cafeteria and very green campus with tennis courts and baseball fields. Workload distribution is uneven, need to be fixed by management."
good,The compensation is below industry standards. Job advancement is possible depending on the group that you join. Focus on consistent employee training is missing.
good,"Corporate drama.  Lots of ""not working together"" to accomplish mutual beneficial tasks.  Not very pro-active thinking until ""up against a wall.""  A very pretty location."
good,If you like to monitor and respond to issues as they arise while getting to watch/monitor television stations then this is the job for you.
good,"Typical work includes:"
good,"I usually get up around 6 am in the morning to start van inventory count and job listings for the day. Once the works orders are received, we call all customers on the daily route with estimated times of arrival. When at the job site, we perform the necessary needs as far as new connections, troubleshoot, and upgrade services to the customer. It involves a lot of hands on and technical skills to deliver great service and rapport with many different type of consumers. "
good,"Answer incoming calls "
good,A typical day at work consists of maintaining and refurbishing receivers. I learned how to better work as a team to accomplish a set goal set by management.
good,I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job but not the fact that my schedule kept changing.
good,Interaction with customers and knowledge of the latest technological innovations make the company a leader in telecommunications industry.
good,"Good stable company, slow wage increases and not to much earning potential in the long run."
good,"Dish Network was very concerned with the bottom line. As a result of this, there was no sense of job security. Management and Director positions were frequently being eliminated. In the last two years I was employed there, they had four different directors, each of which had conflicting ideas of how the business should be run. To cut costs, there were often mass layoffs, commonly referred to as Black Thursdays."
good,"Although it was a good enough job, the pay was low and the amount of hours I worked when I was there were to many hours for the amount of money I was making."
good,"Good place to work, compensation is moderate, management as a whole is good. However, some department managers can be very personal rather than professional."
good,"Great opportunity to grow among the organization, however with very limited benefits and pay."
good,"I spent almost 7 years with the company and learned a lot, but I feel that it is time for a career change."
good,I did enjoy helping customers and liked my co-workers. Management was a little bit too uptight.
good,Answered all calls and sold Dish Network programs. Set install dates. Answered all questions or transferred call to appropriate department. required to know how all Equipment worked. Transferred to Tech support
good,"i have been with this company for over 11 years and I feel it is a good company to work. But, personally, I don't find any potetial for grrowth in my area and that is why I am looking outside. Management is okay, but for the past 4 years the policy in treating employees from other coutries is changed. It may not be a company policy, may be it is department related due to change in management level. I feel uncomfortable due to discriminatory policy in my area. But overall it is a good company to work with moderate satisfaction. Despite of this issue in my area I love this company."
good,"In a call center is loud, I was QA after 30 days. I listened to calls and graded then review. I trained and worked with coaches and could take a team so others could do paperwork"
good,"It's customer service over the ph... call after call, none stop for 8hrs. You are trained on the products well and are given enough time to get comfortable to get on the phone after training. It is stressful because it is customer service for TV services. Customer can be very bad and rude and demeaning. It can be fun and can make great friends within your team and area. Needs to pay more for what you do though."
good,It was a job that paid the bills when there was nothing in my field of study. I had a decent time but got home every day mentally tired. the location I worked at has now been closed.
good,"It was a busy job with multiple roles, We were expected to Up-sell collect and perform Tech support. I was on the escalated tech support team and was required to take escalated transfers from other reps."
good,"Since they are again part of Dish, some of the improvements in benefits that were seen at Echostar have diminished.  Dish is a service organization and Echo is an engineering org, but the Dish mentality prevails to some degree."
good,Great place great people you cant become rich nor can you afford life here in CO but still a cool job to get you by. Collect collect collect. Dial Dial Dial.
good,Culture has gotten better in the time that I have been there.  Still has a pervasive culture of we do everything the best and new ways have been slow to adopt.
good,"that i worked for is closed, so i can't actually recommend working here to anyone, although i suppose when it was open it was a pleasant enough job. mm"
good,"Echostar was the first major company I worked for, and with that said it was a great company to get your foot in the door.  However, with so many layers of management and competition advancement is very difficult and is not on par with the cost of living in the area compared to its competitors."
good,It was a good place to work.  It paid well and if you could do the job it was a place you could move up.  Overall it was a good place to work and the people were friendly.
good,"Enjoyed working with all types of people. Fast pace, and sometimes stressful. Updating technologies and good workplace culture. Always something to manage."
good,Changes since our business unit was given to Dish Network has made this a difficult place to work.  They focus more on punishment than support.  We do not need rewards...but all we get is punishment.
good,"The company really good at giving employees goodies. they had raffles for certain upsell, pot luck. they gave shirts for special events like boxing and movies."
good,"Casual but fast-paced, hard working engineering environment with diligent hard working people. Business casual all the way with fun activities during the holidays."
good,My time at EchoStar was a really good opportunity to get some real world exposure in the satellite communication industry; combined with technical writings and drafting policy briefs.
good,I go to work to work and get things done! Productivity is key. I learned patience and how to multi task. The hardest part was not being able to help like i wanted
good,"You do not work with many people so mostly by yourself.  Pay is poor."
good,Dish Network is just like any other call center.  Metrics driven and lack of balance for family life.  Their training was great and they have several positions available.
good,Worked with the Greatest Manager I had. He was very willing to teach and help the engineer to be successful in many ways. The Product was amazing and launched on time!
good,"A typical day at work was being on the phone and troubleshooting problems with satellite internet.  It could be interesting at times, but also boring at times if one kept getting the same problems."
good,The upper management does not have any idea how to run the company. They run the company like a fast food restaurant. No vision at all. I wouldn't recommend my friends to work here.
good,Good company to work for but they expect a lot from their employees. I only left the position due to our local call center closing.  Would have stayed had that not happened.
good,Pay and benefits are ok. Working at a call center tends to bring different people together. learning to work and help each other out. if you apply yourself in a call center there is possibility for you to grow.
good,"Overall the company is run from the top down and had no schedule flexibility. "
good,Provided daily and monthly sales analytics to the home office.   Updated the metrics report daily to assure the employees were being rewarded for hitting their sales and quality assurance marks.  Upon closing of the division when needed I also assisted in manning phone lines for technical support and sales inquiries.
good,Good people. Environment was constantly changing. R&D lab. Challenging job with interesting prototype products. Very smart people. Very good environment.
good,"Over all a good place to work, but management has issues.  Too many chiefs and not enough indians.  But the work that you get to take part in can be great fun and the people that you work with are awesome.  But little to no advancement, at least in Gilbert.  The main push is to manage remotly from other locations."
good,"Reason why I'm looking for a job is because you don't get paid very well here. Secondly, this industry is going nowhere but down due to streaming online services."
good,"EchoStar was a good place to work, great co-workers, some of the management was a little in over their heads, other than that its a fun place to work with good incentives. Company always finding ways for agents to sign up for overtime with encouraging compensations."
good,"The entire enviroment of the company is like a call center, you learn to accept it with time.  It's a good company to start out at, but not a lot of room to grow."
good,Used programs like Photoshop and Illustrator to design movie and TV posters for DISH Network subscribers home guide screens.
good,"A fun environment, can be stressful at times but they have a billiards pool table, pull you off the phone at times for your hard work and give you 10-15 minutes to play activities they may have or just to relax a bit."
good,I went in and took calls from customers and helped them troubleshoot issues or went over their bill. I learned how to connect the receivers to dvd/vcr/tvs. I made alot of new friends and my trainer was excellent. The one thing I didnt like was that they would change your supervisor every few months so it was never the same one. I enjoyed my job learned alot of useful information made a good deal of money unfortunate that we parted ways.
good,"take payments over the phone and help customers with their technical problems."
good,"Supervisors always willing to help on technical issues, very good at training sessions, and customer appreciated our technical troubleshooting for them."
good,"Tested equipment to make sure it worked. Also worked in shipping, receiving and maintenance"
good,"As a marketing rep. it gives you opportunity to meet so many different people, and learn so many different cultures.  The management style for the Rep Dept.is very lax, is a multicultural place with a very friendly work force.  The hardest part of the job is to deal with sales quota and the most enjoyable is to work with people (customers) you can chose."
good,Hours are very managable. Work is challenging and exciting. High level of responsibility. Great workers and team.
good,I worked WAY to much for what my salary was.  my pay would of been double if I got paid overtime
good,nice place to work. family environment. growth opportunities available
good,"Portable , technical skillets can be absorbed in the right departments but uncompetitive benefits / pay create a revolving door type atmosphere"
good,"Its not as bad as most people make it out to be."
good,This was a telemarketing agency for Dish Network.  I sold movie packages to existing customers.  I liked the job because it allowed me to talk to a lot of different people everyday and taught me a huge amount about specific selling techniques.  I was trained with ProQuest selling technique and was one of the top sales people almost every week that I worked there.  The scheduling was very rigid and as it was a part time job while I was a full time student it was difficult to keep up.
good,The team was great and i learned a lot. There is nothing that i want to write about this company
good,Not the best place to work but great hours for someone in school.
good,"- Organized and planned work for staff"
good,If you are looking for a job that pays well without any job experience then this the job for you.
good,"I was a technical support representative.  I handled calls in both English and Spanish.  I also handled all regular billing, programming and sales calls."
good,I have great co-workers and a good location. Increased my customer service skills and ability to work under pressure.
good,"This job entails alot of different responsibilites like being the cashier, stocking the product, changing the coffee, and cleaning the store as needed. This job also requires you to pay attention theives."
good,•a typical day at work- input orders in computer
good,"Long days starting at 6am and ending sometimes at 2am, but 3-4 day weekends to compensate. Enjoyied the job but the basic pay was a little low for someone with student loans, and the fiberglass insulation was eating my ankles. Sometimes I think I should have stuck it out anyway and held out for a supervisor position. They loved my work, and the team were all great people. Knowing as much as I do about electronics was a real asset to getting jobs done that had involved requirements. Probably would have stayed with them but got talked into testing and interviewing for a higher paying job."
good,"It was a pretty good place to work at. Not much fun, but a decent environment to work in. Everything was going well until they laid off the customer service department."
good,.
good,I have/had learned alot in Echostar for the whole 8 1/2 years working there. I had helped on different departments and had traveled for physical inventory inside and outside US.
good,"The people I worked with was very nice. As a controller, they are not many opportunities to move up. If you do not have a BS in Engineering, you will not be hired as engineer. Experience will not get you into that position. This is why I left the company."
good,"Gave me opportunity to learn how to organize the time of a team, to distribute jobs, to supervise and support the job of the technicians."
good,Great company and great people. Support was fantastic from all departments. Super energetic and highly skilled workforce made going to work very enjoyable.
good,"Pretty typical cubicle job. I was an intern and never a a full-time employee, but I always heard the employees complaining about their benefits and pay. They have a great intern program and paid their interns well."
good,"I was intrigued with the environment, and I learned a lot through the experience. I learned about the software development cycle, and it helped me to gain a better understanding about what my responsibilities are as a developer. The upper level management was not the best, but I enjoyed working with my direct supervisor who was very helpful. The workplace culture was very laid back, but it seemed like work still did get done."
good,"A typical day consisted of preparing daily work order routes for technicians, prepared end of the day logistics, transactions and customer reports, dispatched orders and relayed messages and special instructions to technicians and contacted customers on technician scheduling."
good,This was a good company to work for.  I learned a lot about the job and was able to carry on the information to other companies.  I will never forget how loyal the company was to me and my coworkers.
good,"Enjoy my job very much when I'm left alone to do my job correctly, but not when I'm being strong armed by management to be a used car salesman... this job is great for meeting new people if you're a social and tech-savvy person"
good,"The job in of itself isn't a difficult one. Our job is to manage the signal flow coming in in order to compress the data, make it efficient, and process it through our varies tools and equipment in order for customers to enjoy their tv viewing experience. We also are responsible for maintenance on equipment and systems, problem-solving, and troubleshooting outages. It is essential in this position to make quick but educated decisions, decrease outage times, and create processes to make the systems run smoother and more efficiently. It is a 24/7 operation, which requires the flexibility of constantly rotating or changing shifts. It is a relatively secure job, provided you show up to work with a willingness to learn, be a team player, and follow procedure."
good,Trouble shooting with customers on their newly installed equipment. Some calls were having to walk a customer through when equipment with inexperienced customer. Loved this place.
good,The company was not horrible but the work killed my soul.  its hard to sit and answer the phone for 8 straight hours.  from what I remember they made the best of it.
good,"Every day is busy, but not so much to become overwhelmed. With an open mind anyone can learn something of value every day. Compensation is fair along with the benefits offer. Discounts to Dish Network are a nice bonus."
good,"This call center staffed over 2,000 employees. There were always many events and it was easy to climb the corporate ladder. I was given good direction from management and was supported in my education."
good,The job isn't hard. The management was very poor. I learned a lot about how the satellite company works and installation. I worked with people over the phone assisting them with their satellite problems.
good,I liked the company. I did gain good experience from there. I even enjoyed the schedule I was on. Management did change a lot. It was hard getting use to the constant change of rules.
good,Opportunities for advancement. Company not updated with development and test tools. Employees are knowledgeable and work together as a team.
good,"While the compensation could've been better, ultimately my time at EchoStar has been a flexible one in most aspects. Work/Life balance was usually pretty fair, and I had a lot of leeway in the type of work I got to do."
good,"I would take calls during my shift, helped out customers with their needs. Managers where not friendly enough. They would treat us as an electronic instrument not as humans."
good,"Fun and hard Job, but HBO and no free TV was simply not worth the work it took day in day. Often long hours in the heat and cold on top of roofs and in crawl spaces."
good,I was a . Broadcast Operations Tech II where I would watch a board of TV programs that was in the United States as well as international. Where I would make sure that there was no outages and if their where I would notify the department that fixes the problems I would also do other daily work pertaining to that type of work. I learned that there needs to more training for people who are new to that type of work who do not grasp it as fast as others. I did not work their long enough to make an opinion of management and my co workers as well as the rest of the reaming questions
good,Great for advancement opportunities. Very flexible and good place to learn new skills and development.
good,"Answered calls from customers that required dish network television, upsold movie packages and took care of minor technical problems. This job was rewarding because I was helping people solve problems or get quality tv."
good,"Worked in call center as CSR, answered calls on programming, activations, billing inquiries, technical troubleshooting and set up installation dates"
good,Work with vendors and internal departments to bring in new components for testing and qualifications.
good,"Echostar is a decent place to work with decent pay, as long as you stay out of the politics. Management played too many political games. Co-workers were childish and political. The job wasn;t hard."
good,"professional organization that treats their employees fairly."
good,"Early morning schedule. Four day work weeks and overtime  workers are helpful. Advancement  was difficult to achieve at times benefits were good, ok 401 k plan."
good,Over 12 years I watched the company grow and expand into a solid fortune 400 company. The first 10 years were great as the company reached it's growth potential. The last 2 years were filled with layoffs and uncertainty.
good,Company went for close because management position was not setup correctly or they used back door to get their position and high level of favoritism  as to why they hire people who don’t have knowledge because they can control them.
good,"Very simple job.  Great co-workers, but micromanagement from the person in charge of materials.  Not a great place to work, but it was a  job."
good,"Long hours normally working weekends."
good,Fixed customers problems with the system over the phone. Love talking to the customers .  I have learned how to be patient and work with the customer over the phone
good,"Busy constantly, multi skills needed for areas you were needed as set per Que.  Sales, troubleshooting, setting up a tech to come out.  Never the same thing everyday."
good,I worked Technical Support and Sales and both were good departments to work in. The management wasn't too bad and Ill say the training department was ok as well.
good,"This was my first job and i loved it, I learned a lot from this industry and developed skills that would help me in the future. I was a variety of calls that we would take, from inbound, outbound to welcome calls. So there was never a time where we were always doing the same thing. The hardest part was dealing with so many different managers who wold be the point of authority. Constantly enforcing strict rules, people where always under a microscope."
good,"It was a great job to work at but it was not family oriented, not flexible for parents with children and needed to leave early due to issues. The were goal based for the company."
good,"A lot of hours during big pushes for software releases which is common at technology companies anyway.  As long as you are doing your job as expected and trying to go above and beyond it, I have no complaints."
good,"Echostar is a good place to work.  All of my coworkers were friendly.  They have some extremely gifted engineers.  They talk about opportunities, but the day to day is mostly static.  They will usually hire from outside instead of moving someone up.    They develop set-top boxes for mostly Dish.  They have some other ventures and are part of Echostar Technologies which include Hughes and Sling,  They control and maintain 15 satellites over the US and Central America."
good,"I worked full-time as a Broadband Technical Support agent (AKA the red-headed step child). It's a higher, specialty skill that's difficult to qualify for and impossible to move up or away from. Typically eight hours of troubleshooting symptoms on multiple platforms/devices, using both internal and external tools. You have to be self-driven and responsible because your manager will not know how to help you if you hit a snag. You get ""call dumps"" every day - this is where someone at a lower skill level is either not trained or not competent to continue troubleshooting and instead of asking a supervisor for a help, they breach company protocol and transfer to the Broadband dept because we are believed and expected to able to assist with *ALL* tech problems."
good,Clean and comfortable place to work with good people and organization. Lower level management can be short sighted and fail to be loyal to employees.
good,A great place to learn about the communications industry and the importance of understanding your competition.
good,"This was a fast paced work enviroment, with mostly hands on learning. Customer Service and sales was key parts of the day. Co-workers were enthusiastic about bonus incentives. The hardest part was technical support. The best part of my job was making customers happy with their new programming choices!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving phone calls from current and potential customers. I have no complaints towards the customers because I realize that every individual has specific needs that need to be met, so my only complaint would really have to be upper management. I was promised after a year that I could be moved to a shift that would allow me to attend school in the area and the promise was not kept."
good,Very busy and fun place to work. Management was very helpful. Hardest part of the job was working all the overtime.
good,A typical day in a production plant was very fast. We had to meet quotas and I always met mine. My department heads were so thrilled to have me apart of their team. 
good,The company was a great employer I learned a lot from coworkers who had been within the company for years.
good,"I learned alot and enjoyed helping people.,"
good,helping trouble shoot over the phone was a challange but rewarding
good,"echostar was a great place to work in, since i was a contractor..i dont know much about benefits and all. However managament is really good"
good,"Nice job. Always busy, spent a lot of time troubleshooting cable systems, changing system components and training customers on system operation. Schedule was 4 days on, 3 days off."
good,"start work at 7:15 each day, morning meeting going over what occurred the previous day and what could be done to improve certain situations. go over your work orders and load the required equipment needed for the day. call first appointment with ETA. and proceed to job."
good,The intern position was mostly data entry. Nearly every week you do the same things. Every now and then you do some new things. The company could use better communication between managers. Overall a decent place to gain first-hand experience.
good,It was a great place to work. It's sad that they ate no longer in the state of PA .They pay was nice at the time which was 10 plus yrs ago but now people need to made in the 15 to 20 range to survive and male ends meet. Would of liked to be paid for the extra work and responsibilities I took on. I knew more than my supervisor and did my job plus his daily. But was never paid ed or acknowledged for it.
good,"Great company to work for, recent merger with Dish may provide new challenges and experiences. The company designed and deployed the best DVR receiver in the industry."
good,"No two jobs the same and you can learn a lot if you want to."
good,"Have lots of training opportunity. Good working environment. No on-call requirements. 9am - 4 pm working time. Management level are nice. Relatively flexible working time, but no work-at-home option."
good,answer phones all day everyday.  lots of fun people.  I began to perfect my customer services skills at this job.  I loved getting irate customers on the phone and providing good enough service that I was able to upsell the on other features before the end of the call.
good,"Answered incoming calls and assisted customers with technical support, tv packages and programming, and took payments. Incentives were given for attendance."
good,"It is a call center. I handled around 50 to 60 incoming calls per day within 8 hour shift. I learned to communicate better with every kinds of customers through phone. Also, i learned to be more patient. Management was good but at times it was not very convenient. I had great group of co workers. I found this job to be pretty easy. The most enjoyable part was to make the clients or customers happy which gave me ultimate satisfaction."
good,Good opportunities for career advancement. They have a talented group of leaders and support teams.
good,"Put on  my head phones and start selling Dish to clients.  Worked continuously until break then did it all over again until lunch.  Keeping track of sales. Learned about new sales.  I went to Tech support and really liked learning all the equipment and helping people solve problems over the phone. "
good,I enjoyed working at EchoStar and spent 7 years there before I was made redundant in 2013.  The EchoStar Steeton site was closed down in 2017 although the US parent company is doing well.
good,"Can be a challenging environment pending on the position you hold.  Some individuals are promoted within whenever possible. Unfortunately, some jobs do not have any advancement."
good,"the job was OK, manager did not get you a job until you had proven your self in was nice work but the place was in the middle of no were and that was the problem"
good,"I worked as technical support for the Dish Network. I had to pass five test and score higher than a C + average. I started working right away. I won a lottery to change my shift, but I was a good worker. I like my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was having to cross railroad tracks in the beginning and end of the day."
good,"A typical day at EchoStar was coming in and taking calls for DishNetwork. Providing information about the satellite company and to get customer to purchase it. Learned how to provide information for the sale and setup appointment for installer, took payments as well. There were different projects still dealing with DishNetwork that I was apart of for the mean time that it was available. The co-works were wonderful Individuals to work with. The hardest part of the job was to sale the product but did have a script or scripts for rebounding answered or denials. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and environment of the work place was."
good,"Strong customer service issues and constant being on the phone with claims and billing problems"
good,Sold Dish programming and changed Technical dept. to help customers with problems.
good,Great management just not enough opportunity to advance.  And also schedules are hard to get used to.
good,Meeting new people and doing different type of install i love field service work.
good,This call center was fun to work in there was not much stress and the work flow was easy going.
good,I have been at EchoStar for 6 months now and really am enjoying my time here. We are in an exciting industry with new product releases and satellites launching on a regular basis. Huge improvements to the 2013 benefit plan with more positive changes to come.
good,If it weren't for the closing of the center I would still be there! I enjoyed working there.
good,"I was lucky to be assigned to the Netherlands office for two years supporting a large customer in Poland. Then, another two years in South American supporting a top 5 global telephony company from Spain."
good,"The temperature of the facility made for a challenging work environment. The thermostat was set in the 60's all the time, which caused my fingers to be numb a lot."
good,"Atlanta was a nice mix; benefits could have been better but thats a hard one since the company is trying to cut costs.  Things were decent until 2011, many changes."
good,After working there for some time I received a promotion from customer service and retention to Help Desk.  Help internal and external customers with technical support issues using custom software and handle some escalated calls.
good,"Excellent learning environment, individually the most intelligent and skilled workforce I have ever worked with. Executive management is somewhat disorganized and at times seem to lack the ability to lead within a mature market.

I always learned something new everyday due to different situations I worked on, As far as management they were very hands on when a technician would get stuck on a project. My coworkers for the most part were very productive driven. I am a fast learner so nothing was to difficult to overcome. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my day is leaving a costumers home and there completely satisfied."
good,"I loved working there it was my first job out of high school, i got to work and meet new people. enjoyed learning new things as far as satelite tv, the only challenging part was dealing with upset customers. it was a good challenge it teaches a associate there limit of patience. Good inviroment and good vibes."
good,I was a pleasure to work for them. People in Gilbert where wonderful.
good,"Als je wat wilt leren of doen, moet je op eigen initiatief dat aangeven. Regelmatig is er geen tijd of geld om een interne of externe cursus te volgen. Je krijgt alle ruimte om binnen deze kader je te ontwikkelen. D.w.z. veel zelfstudie en kennisoverdracht van collega's.."

good,My co-workers were amazing.  We always had great meetings.  The management was very helpful and supportive.  It was a great place to work.

Lots of great customer interaction including decision making about how and where the service will be installed, operation and familirization of equipment. Each day you meet new people and I personally had fun being a part of the process with them."
good,"I have been very lucky to have been placed in a great team. My manager is phenomenal and my team has a culture that is fun and conducive to learning. The pay and benefits are lackluster which may lead to high turn-over rates at Echostar. Executives are out of touch with the rest of the company and it shows. Building 100, where all the executives work, is uptight and runs rampant with immature politics. Building 94 and 90 are much better places to work. The work itself was rewarding to me because I owned my projects. I was a major decision maker in all the projects."
good,"I enjoyed working at Echostar. I found the people to be smart and fun to work with at all levels. The work was great with a huge amount of possibilities for new and exciting projects. The benefits are not as good as I have had before in a large corporation. There is a lot of room for improvement on true work life balance, but there are exceptional supervisors who do what they can to bridge the gaps of the formal rules."
good,"I would start taking calls, it could be tech support , billing, programing spanish or english. I learn how to deal with customers not to take it personal, to have patience specially with the non english speaking customers.Management always try to help with a difficult customer and provide the best training, The hardest part of the job was when a male customer wold ask for a male agent for technical support w/o knowing that we would get the same training, and this at the same time was the best part because I would help them and solve their issue and they would see that not only males are good with truble shooting."
good,Good benefits.

good,Had great time with travel and seeing the world. Worked long hours and travled about 95% of the time but it was worth it. They had a popcorn machine in the break room.

good,"handled bill inquiries, went over each charge on the bill.  I learned t to use several different computers systems that made my job a lot easier.  Management was always around to hell me with any doubt to make sure the customer was always satisfied.  The hardest past of the job would be when u cannot hear the customer right due to noise on the background or when they would be doing other things while on the phone.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that after  each call at random I would get surveyed for my performance and if the customer gave u a 5 which was the highest score I knew then that I was doing my job correctly.

Enjoyable part of the workplace was talking to different people and learning things about their culture and surroundings."
good,"Working for Echostar was a great experience with great teammates, great experiences, and amazing upward movement potential. The only problem I ever had, was initially I wasn't good at sales as I gained experience from managers and coworkers, my sales surged. As they did company policy changed and put more focus on the sales aspect of each appointment."

good,went in at 6am and didn't get off til 9pm. But I loved my job. the most worst part was dealing with a few of the techs when they didn't call in with the information I needed.
good,"Each day I start by picking up my events that are assigned to me.  I log into the computer, open programs that I will be using, and enter my events that I will be monitoring.

I learned that the customer is the reason we get a paycheck and you always want to please that customer no matter what. You had some managers that were fair and cared about what you thought or how you felt about different things. My co-workers were a joy to work with we all made it comfortable for each other. The hardest part of the job was when a customer wants to disconnect their service and you try whatever you can to save them but they still disconnect.
