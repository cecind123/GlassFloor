bad,Stay away from this place. Cutthroat atmosphere. They treat contractors like second class citizens. The culture is really bad towards IT people. Very unethical environment.
bad,"I worked very hard for this company, they tried to force me to resign."
bad,"QEP culture has been changing drastically throughout the years.  The environment is no longer engaging and collaborative, it is cut throat and back stabbing."
bad,This job was really good and a great place to get my foot in the door. I was unable to advance to due a biased supervisor who only advanced people she had a personal relationship with. Was constantly belittled. This problem was only in my department and the other departments seemed to be amazing.
good,i clean a lot of stuff all the time while i'm at work i really don't know how much longer i will have to clean all of this junk that i have to clean its crazy
good,A typical day on the job is constant movement. There is always something going on in addition to the every day tasks. This is what I enjoy about working here.  The hardest part is driving the dark country roads in the early morning hours.

good,"Learned something new everyday, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  Knowledgeable, hard working always willing to answer questions. XX"
good,"Great employer with typical oil and gas management- male dominated and very white. There is an ""in group"" from the Oklahoma office that relocated to Denver and very much dominates the management structure. Very smart, engaging CEO."
good,"I worked in Lease Records/Land for thirty five years so I am able to work on my own with little guidance.  I have been very lucky to have had the opportunity to work in a job I truly love.  The office that I planned to retire with closed the doors on their Oklahoma City and Tulsa offices, that is why for the first time I am looking for a position in the oil and gas industry."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for QEP.  The people are great and the hours were amazing - However there is no room for advancement which was a determining factor in my leaving.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Great work schedule and core values. People are friendly and great to work with. Team oriented. They give back to the community and to the employees.

good,I worked in a temporary contract position doing data entry of geological file information from files that were being transferred to offsite storage.  Interaction with QEP employees informative and pleasant.  Learned new data base software.
good,"By far, my favorite company to work for. If I hadn't been moving out of state, I would still be very happily employed with this company. I worked for the Accounts Payable department and the levels of compensation exceed my expectations. The management and opportunities for growth were par none. I couldn't say better things about the people I worked with."
