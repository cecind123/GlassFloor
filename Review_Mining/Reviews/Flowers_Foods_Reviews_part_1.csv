bad,"I don't recommend ANYone to apply to this job. Management is new and everchanging, more chiefs than Indians, literally NO thought goes into the work process. One person makes a random decision, every one just falls in line. If it makes sense, it's not going to fly. No breaks for the shifts, they mess up ur check and make you wait a week even when it's THEIR fault. DO NOT APPLY!!!"
bad,Hours suck sometimes you get your hours sometimes you don’t. Manager don’t care the top people of the company doesn’t care about the workers only about the product. Management does not care so the employees don’t care either
bad,Unfair that i was told the day of i would be going from full time to part time the exact same day it was said. Being employed for 8+ years they take me from full time hours to 19. Company doesn't respect you as a employee since being under new management a year and a half ago.
bad,Awful company to work for management is in adequate. Would not suggest working for that company to anyone if you’re looking for a position in that industry avoid flowers bacon company there are other reputable companies that are hiring in the area
bad,The shift that I was working on was very under stat so there for it cause my shifty to have ton of work loads. Very unorganized and not professional. Need to hold everybody accountable for their actions
bad,This company is the worse place I have ever worked out. Management is never there. Corporate makes promises but when it’s time to settle the promises they come up with lies and when ask for prove they can’t provide it. You have no help. Now I see why this company is closing stores everyday. If you want a steady job for long term this is not the job because this company will not last much longer.
bad,"This is a sales driven job if you can’t get sales you’ll die trying. Everybody wants to be your friend but your better off not trusting anyone even the boss. Lots of backstabbing goes on in this job and if your a trusting person you shall be eaten alive by your coworkers and boss."
bad,You have to buy your bread route it is a 7 day a week job. They will tell you that you get Sunday and Wednesday off but you really don't you still have to go to every store twice a day
bad,In a nut shell...stay far far away from Flowers! They are contolling and love to gamble with your money. If you sell your route they take a big chunk of the sale amount. STAY AWAY!
bad,ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO WORK FOR!!!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES life nor family!!! LONG VERY LONG HOURS!!! The pay is great but if your ready to live for flowers bakery then this is the job for you.
bad,"Reviewed operations conferred with technical or administrative staff to resolve production processing problems."
bad,i would not recommend this job to anyone this place is unfair and unjust to all employees. work conditions are horrible.  this company has no compassion for the ones who are keeping this company afloat.  managers steel all the credit while the regular employees cant catch a single break.
bad,"I would give the management a zero if it were an option. Long hours with no commission. Typical day is managers lining their pockets. Other bread companies think they are a joke, which they are. I wouldn't recommend working here"
bad,"I was promised a raise every year....that was a lie, I was promised no less than 28 hours a week.....that was a lie. No benefits except for the ones hired in as an actual flowers employee. No paid vacation,  no sick days, no benefits at all. No paid breaks, you eat when you can. Absolutely no over time or you will get wrote up. No communication with management in Jamestown.  Always disorganized when it comes to maintenance of stores and signage."
bad,you can not believe any of the information you got for running your route and the salary you received. I was promised vacations and a salary that was ok for the first 3 years then they ended the vacation program and your salary went down.
bad,"Slave work for blood money. No days off. Unless you trick/pay someone to do it for you for however long they last untill they crack and can't take it anymore. I wouldn't wish this job upon my worst enemy... Wait. That's exactly who, if any , I would wish this job upon. A true enemy of my existence."
bad,"to anyone who is not willing to put in the time and effort that is required to build your business and relationships with customers."
bad,You get no time off for any reason. I was just let go to payroll cutbacks right before Christmas with no warning after 7 years of service. Work day was 12-14hours with no compensation. The management team was horrible.
bad,"Hired people at the spur of the moment to meet a safety inspection for three months and once they met inspection, we were released. Hands that were with company for years don't get moved up."
bad,"Ridiculous amounts of over time, hardly any days off, usually working 6 days a week, no family time, and the management do not care about their workers."
bad,Left the bakery to explore groth elsewhere. Feel like I can grow somewhere else. Given and opportunity I would not let an employer down. Very hard worker with a great work ethic.
bad,This company treats there people badly! There do not offer any praise only discipline. They have gone back on there contract with there distributors and i would never work for them again!
bad,They make everything seem great till you sign to buy a route and promise you route development money. Then they take it away and you go bankrupt because you go from making 2k a week plus to less then 500 a week with all the overhead still not paid.  Stay away they got me good
bad,"No life for yourself the company only cares about the production of bread and nothing else, the supervisors show alot of favoritism, no proper communication skills"
bad,You do not want to work for Flowers. They constant berate you verbally and will talk down to you in a heartbeat. They have no respect for anyone except themselves and only when it comes to the bottom line.
bad,"I was laid off after 25 years, and was replaced by an idiot, that they expected me to train. If you were not the the VP's little circle of friends, you got laid off."
bad,"Terrible place to work, the management is extremely poor, have to work an entire year before getting a weeks vacation, then have to use it all at one time with little or no choices of when it will be used"
bad,Horrible place to work. Unless you don't like to be with family and like being treated like a dog. Poor managment .they give you a half a point whenever you can't work over
bad,Sells rep was banded from many locations most customers have issues with the sales rep and flowers continues his employment meanwhile the sales rep goes after the route owners for any discrepancies and or arguments with account regardless if profit margin has gone under
bad,"No support for new employees, poor management and bad human resource department, no follow up.  I would strongly not recommend this employer for anyone looking to begin a fulfilling career of any kind."
bad,absolutely terrible company to be involved with. tons of lawsuits against them. treat the distributors horribly. failure to uphold contracts. constantly trying to manufacturer problem.
bad,Most of the time I dislike coming to work because of the supervisor having there favorites. The hardest part of the job was working hard just to not get any recognition or raise.
bad,"A/R Department short staffed, poorly managed, Employees are overworked and underpaid, advancement not supported, backup policies are lacking, office furniture and technical equipment is broken and non-functioning, employees have to buy own supplies that are decent, no bonuses, no incentives."
bad,The boss was incredibly mean. They cheated me on my hours and didn't want to reimburse me for them. It was just an overall terrible place to work at and I wouldnt recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"Favoritism to the max. Helpful if you're related to a big shot. Had to work weekends and holidays, never knew for sure when getting off. Supervisors would put their hands on you."
bad,"The days were excruciatingly long, The delivery schedule was over-booked. Almost no chance to move up in the company. Management tended not to mix with the ""hired help""."
bad,"Terrible place to work, It's not safe. I saw two people lose fingers in two months. The company does  not care about the product or employer. There is no GMP there, only when there is an audit. Management has no real prior management experience, and have no leadership or people skills."
bad,"the most corrupt, greedy, deceitful company to work for. loved the job itself. being outside working with my customers. but when you are asked to do more and more while watching your paycheck drop, your motivation runs low."
bad,"I worked here for almost 4 years and you never have an opportunity to grow with the company and move up. If you need a job then its great, but its not something I would make long term."
bad,Do not work for this company all they want ia brown nosers who suck up ots doesnt matter if your on time or of you are a hard work they treast you like c
bad,"Me and friend both started the same shift at the same day eight hours from then went pretty easy the work was a bit fast paced and other employes seemed really nice and helpful as far as training and learning went. You could take food off the line before you went to break and you every hour to a different line which was nice. The supervisors where extremely friendly from what i seen very helpful at answering questions and offering suggestions to improve job performance. I applied with staffmark for this job starting pay was 8 something then 9 or 10 after 30 days. After day one me and friend recivied a call from staftmark stating our ""assignment was over"" without giving any reason. Not sure what happened or why we where let go seemed like a decent place to be employed at."
bad,"Maintain a bakery product business Loading,delivery, and retail sells to establish new customers. Service major chain retailers. Set displays of product and fill shelves."
bad,This is modern day slave trade. 7 days a week no time off no sick days and no vacations. The management will not do anything to help you only to hurt you.
bad,"You work long exesive hours, 6 to 7 days a week. Managements job is find everyway possible to take your money. When i left i fulfilled my 31 day notice as my contract states, didnt recive any of my paid in equity or my final settlement. They force stops and towns on you."
bad,"Management weak with upper management protected, arrogant son and older weak manager of warehouse. They chain smoke and curse constantly. Racial slurs are multi daily occurence and aimed at all staff. Markets shrinking, hours longer, no money to be made out of this warehouse with this company and local management. People need to be warned to stay away!!! Not a good investment of your time or money!!! They advertise $60,000 a year and that is a total LIE."
bad,You are the owner of the route so you take on all expenses. And the Management that are in charge; you can get several different answers on how to run the route.
bad,I learned to productive in every thing I did for company from packing running the line to maintain there machines. they had a good management team. the hardest was keeping the machine going when they got back up when we had company parties
bad,If you have a family or a social life DO NOT apply for a position at this company. Management is chaoic. Bad atmosphere. Everyone is overworked. Micro Management. NO set hours or shifts. DO NOT APPLY.......
bad,"dont work here if you a family, no time off, work you 7 days straight 12 hours shifts."
bad,they rip you off don't do it they find any excuse to take your money and you get no holidays off  and you are helpless to get it back that's why I quit
bad,they day i got hired the HR lady said that i should not work there because i had a clean back ground if you have not been in prison dont work here 
bad,"This company is still in the dark ages thinking they can just run you up and down the road on the unsold routes they would assign. I'm talking 16 hour days on a route that covered 2 states and about a 260 mile round trip with no overtime, just straight salary. No help or support from management either. Most of the Owner/Operators seemed clueless with regards to running their own business, so there is a definite lack of training and the company seems to take advantage of that situation. This is not a warm and fuzzy place to work, if you do not have any experience in this field of business, you should not apply for a job there. If you do have experience in this field, KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR FRIES!!!"
bad,I would tell anyone looking at a job with this company to look else where and thats speaking from a former employee of 20 years. This company has NO values... Terrible management... And even worse the Presidents are the worse and being with the company for 20 years I seen ALOT.
bad,Management is a bunch of the laziest people I’ve come across. They will come in and give everybody 40 hours because they don’t wanna take the time to add and subtract. Very unprofessional. Especially if your by a route. They will give a a route that is ran into the ground an now they are just looking for a scape goat to take on their issues
bad,"Unorganized company no opportunity for advancement,  supervisors dont help distributors  but still have their title for 30 years.  Only family and friends from management get hired and promoted within months. Not an original company, they imitate and copy ideas from competitors. Still operate the same way they did in the 80s not able to transition into modern times."
bad,"Long, confusion no communication, work area never left set up for success "
bad,"I have been in the dsd business for 25+ years, so I decided that I would buy a flowers bread route, This is the worst set up I have ever seen. First of all you are hired for abm, a janitorial service company for your traiing 10.00 an hour, next they had a different so called supervisor come in to train me, one week at a time and I taught them more than they ever knew about the dsd business."
bad,"You were made to work 7 days a week 12 hour shifts, you made excellent money and benefits, but you didn't have a life you worked went home to sleep and get back up and go to work hardly ever had any free time, the management was sorry they believe the supervisors over the workers that worked so hard for the company, wouldn't give u a benefit of a doubt, my job was never enjoyable, but this was back in early 2000's ive heard it has gotten better, doubtful but just maybe, the breaks sucked u only got 15 mins to eat lunch go to the bathroom etc, etc the supervisors were all hateful and hard to work for!! that would be the last place i would ever work!"
bad,Worst employer I have ever worked for. Management actually screams and you and belittles you on a regular basis. The ambient temperature inside the plant is over 100 degrees many times. It is a very depressing and miserable atmosphere to work in. The company even hires most of its employees through temporary services. I would say unless you are starving and homeless do not take a job here. The company moved to North Carolina to avoid the Union so they are proud to treat employees horribly.
bad,"I worked 3rd shift, in the ""engineering"" department. It really was machine maintenance, yet they were called engineers... except it seemed odd to me because there was ZERO engineering being done. We were maintenance, maintaining various machine efficiency to insure consistent output was up to speed in the production line, at all points. I was studying mechanical engineering at the time, and so seeing the type of machines, and their specific application in the company's processes, was very beneficial. First day i get asked if i know calculus... and especially being actively in school at the time, I was very proficient in calculus. Then the manager asked if I knew what the derivative of a constant is... I told him zero because if the derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function over a specific interval, finite or infinite. Thats where I made a mistake and I was told later that I got such a hard time because people older than me were intimidated and were trying to get me fired. So I wrap that up, and moved on. Good experience seeing things like boilers, hoppers, conveyor belt systems, photo eyes etc.  And that was what I liked most about working there."
bad,"Head of HR fired me when my grandfather for too many points, but tell me sorry for my loss in the same breath. The HR business partner, has lacking empathy for the individuals that work there."
bad,"Production truly operates on the concept of ""based on business needs.""  With no regard for employees or even basic common sense. "
bad,"If you don’t want any kind of a social life, this is the place for you. If you enjoy working horrible hours and split shifts, this is the place for you."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone to work especially if you have kids. They have spilt days off on one line Monday’s and Friday and sometimes they cut into your day off and have you working. They change your schedule at the last minute. They don’t care if you got kids or got to pick them up. You can’t plan anything with your family. You work every weekend. They say they’re going to do something but when they have a problem they will tell you something you want to hear just get you out of there face or to shut you up for a little while but the whole time it’s a lie they don’t have any intentions of doing what they say they’re gonna do. The management is micro managed. They have no incentive in a years time you will be at your top pay. Bouns are terrible you might receive a 200 dollar bouns before taxes. That’s once a year in March. Top pay is about 21 dollars if you are full time and 15 dollars for temp. High turn over rate hire people every week can not keep anyone that says a lot how it is to work here.
bad,"You have too many people telling you to do they same thing in totally different ways. One boss will tell you to do something one way and another boss will come and say STOP DOING THAT, DO IT THIS WAY!! Yes yelling like you are a child and not an adult."
bad,Terrible company to work for. Long hours no work/life balance. Management do not care about family only making bread. Managers will tell you one thing and do another. Micro managed and will write you up/fire you for anything. Learn from my mistake do not apply!!!!
bad,Management on the bread side was very poor (that's being respectful). A number of times night shift personnel were told if they wanted better treatment they needed to be on days by management. The hour are not so bad and the pay is decent. If you can tolerate constant stress and and lack luster management staff that has it out for the majority of their employees then go apply. I took a pay cut leaving that place in oxford PA and am loving life now even though I work the same amount of hours if not more. If the head office in Georgia really cared about their company they would get in there and revamp that entire management staff.
bad,"I was hired and asked in the interview if I could work weekends and overtime.  Which I  don't have a problem with that.  Once you are hired they don't tell you that it is every weekend.  I talked to management about getting every other weekend off, so I could get my children from a previous marriage.  Management could not work with me on that at all.  Management will get in your face and scream and cuss at you.  I saw that on two occasions. The last time I was yelled at like was in boot camp.  That is was not happening again.  I am an adult and I will not be talked to like a dog. I had been there two days and was handed a task to complete by management.  Management knowing I had no idea how to do the task.  I was told to go figure it out on my own.  I was set up to fail the task that was giving to me.  No respect for the employees.  A union would fit in nice here. Unions are not what they used to be, but the way people are treated this is a place for one.  No vacation for a whole year.  You have to ask to go to the bathroom.  It feels like you are back in elementary school.  Breaks what breaks. You are supposed to get 3 20 minute breaks, but your lucky if you get one."
bad,"management its racist"
bad,Flowers bread company was a horrible place to work. the pay wasnt worth the work in the sweltering georgia summers and cold winters. on top of that the managers treated you like a dog.
bad,"I quit a high paying job with great benefits to work for myself through an independent distributor program.  What I was told in training was not what actually happened in the real world.  I was doing the same fast paced job which requires a lot of labor and customer relation skills but come to find out was going to earn me about a third of what I was making and no benefits whatsoever.  "
bad,worst 2 yrs of my life. never quit a job in my life until here- I walked out in the middle of a shift. the work was easy the immediately coworkers were awful. mgmt didnt care
bad,"Good money, bad people, darn shame too. Management is fat, lazy and nepotistic. You spend the day wading through social conflict, people talk ALOT. It's not fun"
bad,"The only good thing is the pay, Management needs to be trained in managing personal. This job consumes all your time. No time for family or Holidays. Its sad to say, but its all about the bread."
bad,"Flowers was a good place if you had a big route to run but if you had a small route it was tough."
bad,"its ok really early hours stressful job rain sleet snow you have to be there only time we are closed is xmas the next day its back to work from 3am to about 1pm then go back at 4pm to re stock the stores its a lot of paperwork cumputer work so you can get paid but for the most part its ok , its ok really early hours stressful job rain sleet snow you have to work 1am to 1pm you have to work"
bad,The best way to sum it up? Management. The place is micro managed by some 20 something year olds with no clue how to do their job and have no prior management exp. Management can't handle pressure. They'd rather run around like chickens with their heads cut off. Theres alot of drama mainly coming from the supervisors and leads (which is very unprofessional). They lack alot in training.The place is a hostile work environment. Its like being back in high school. They are not for safety like most other places ive worked. Floors are slick as snot. Its painted over concrete. Even the best non slip shoes get no traction. Ive seen ppl slip and fall from all the bread crumbs on the floor. They would rather worry about the condition of their equipment and the product than your own condition. Its hotter than hades especially in the summer time. It feels like 110 degrees or more. This place has a high turnover rate. They say its the worst site in the country. I BELIEVE IT. Like someone else stated. They need to weed out their management and rebuild and it needs to be done quick or else 👋 👋 Wonder 🍞 Lenexa.
bad,"Jealousy from top to bottom of the corporate management chain. Back stabbing. The first to know has the power so you better tell me first or else. They talk about The Flowers Way, but don't live by it. They act like they have built a culture of teamwork but it's everyone for themselves."
bad,Benefits are good is the best thing about the place. Management makes promises they have no intention of keeping. You are expected to give up home life for work and are treated terrible in the process. Good people in management are few and far between. The good ones are run off. Would not recommend  to my worst enemy.
bad,"the pay and benifits were good, but it was a very depressing place to work. there was no lif balance there, it was all about flowers. no sick time, no paid time off, could only take vacation in one week blocks."
bad,"Job was fairly easy but regards to time off, it is very poorly structured. No regards to family life. As long as they have a body to hold down the position, rhey don't care about what goes on in your life. If your children get sick, they don't care, as long as you are at work and on time. If you are sick and call out, they require a doctors note. That's normal. But if your illness requires you to be off for a few days, then you will get put on probation for EXCESSIVE excused absences. Very poorly structured."
bad,"a typical day at work required getting up very early and often working long hours, it was pleasant working with the customers and had several great co-workers. the hardest part of the job was it was life consuming and difficult to get a regular sleep schedule down with my average starting time at 4 a.m."
bad,"Maintenance department personnel lacks Lean, Six-Sigma, Lean Six-Sigma, TPM or any recognized Quality Assurance certifications."
bad,"worse place i have ever worked. hostile work environment. Poor treatment by management that reflects on every ones attitude."
bad,"Poor management, very disorganized, tons of broken promises, machine maintenance was horrible, long hours and we were severely understaffed, tons of safety violations as well"
bad,"Decent pay, but not worth it"
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible! If you work in bread you can receive all the help you need, if you work in buns you don't matter! Management admits they don't care about buns!  It sucks!!!!"
bad,The Flowers expectation is that you will work as many hours and days as necessary regardless if you home or away.  I have had to miss my son's wedding because Flowers expectations to cover routes when I need that day.
bad,Started with one day off a week and two weeks vacation a year. Company decided we didn’t need a day off and vacations anymore. Been working 7days a week with no vacation for two years now.  Pay is good and work is not that difficult.
bad,"Everyday for the past year I wish more and more I had never signed that contract, they have taken all the fun out of selling and thanks the the non-negotiable stops like walmart and dollar general, you put all your money making ability in the hands of those companies. Flowers can run promotions that you pay for anytime they want and very seldom will buy back stale if their non-gmo bread if it doesn't sell in a store in the middle of nowhere."
bad,I never been at a job where the techs know more than supervisors/upper management. So unorganized. They change rules as they go. This place is not for normal people. Supervisors will blame techs for everything. I will never recommend this place.
bad,"A typical work day it usually starts slow then to pick up when the buns start to drop bun crumbs and handing out breaks."
bad,Not a great place to work anymore. It's now a management vs employees setting. You'll get stabbed in the back. It used to be a good place to work but with management changes for the worst it's not anymore.
bad,Need to take more responsibility and hold accountable the employees. Train production workers better and spend more money on the supplies needed. Upper management needs to be more aware of what's going on inside the plant with the employees and not the product going out the door
bad,"I was there when the place opened its doors it’ a good company and advanced in my position but ALL management is lacking in communication skills, shows favoritism and always try to say lead by example but never set the example. I also feel most of them have no real integrity and love to blame others for their own mistakes or lack of attention to there specific department/shift. From what I’ve saw there are circles or clicks within management (upper/middle good old boy style) which could be looked as very unprofessional with some, as far as work loads go it’s never ending so there is job security but people get hired and fired all the time! I didn’t hate what I did but it wasn’t fun either, it’s physical, hot and it’s fast paced ALL DAY LONG! Split days off for most to almost all of the plant...Middle to upper management no splits lower management splits...This type of work is not for everyone but if you like staying in shape and being active then this is you’re kind of work! I made more money working for Flowers than anywhere else but due to this I’ve also missed out on ALOT of Family and Friends time/get togethers!"
bad,would not recommend due to poor management and lots of hours. typical day starts at 12AM and d ends around 11AM. Flowers claims we are independent contractorst treats us like employees.
bad,The pay and benefits are good! A high turnover rate they can't seem to keep many people at the Lenexa KS plant. Anything goes it's reality tv Management is a joke the Supervisors run the show on Bun side they like to talk crazy to people  but when you do it back it's a problem. That place is going down fast need to clean house as far as management and start over! KARMA comes to all.
bad,Meeting and earning customers business is challenging and as a independent distributor that is our number one goal. Management is slim will not help in any time of need.
bad,Not a great exp. due to the fact company was not truthful about sales figures . income was alot lower than expected.
bad,"You cant get sick or have important doctors appointments cause it will cost you your job. Excused absence is not allowed, one point for each.  You are only allowed 5 points."
bad,"poor management. Always changing the work schedule. On shut down and snow days they will not call you to inform you that the plant is closed."
bad,"Awful work-life balance, run to fail maintenance philosophy causing untimely breakdowns and unscheduled maintenance. This in turn necessitated mandatory  short-notice overtime."
bad,"I love my job I'd wish they'd let me move my bed in there, I would rather make minimum wage than work 70 hours a week for 6 days,    .     .      .    ."
bad,"Ias a Sanitation Worker it was hard for me because I Couldn't do first shift at Flowers, but good people to work with. But very hot inside the Bakery and Supervisor are nice but have a lot of Favoritism(the favorites got to do nothing and just stand around) it seemed like when I worked there."
bad,"If you have any self respect, do not apply at Flowers Foods. Management is completely self serving and lazy. They are completely two faced when it comes to your review and nobody cares."
bad,"* A Typical Day At Work - Being pulled in all different directions by many different people"
bad,They pay is good but you never hardly have an off day if you get a 3 day you have to work 14 days before your next off day the supervisor are unprofessional very flirtatious with the women an of course if you have a big butt the male supervisor stand beside you all day not hardly checking on other workers and get mad if the machines mess up... Be Aware if you tell them you’re being harassed they will fire you..
bad,Flowers Barker of Thomasville was a good place to work.The pay was fair and the management for the most part were fair also.The only bad thing was the swing shift.
bad,"Its flowers hours change all the time the pay is good cause you get paid every week, you will be hot when its hot and cold when its cold"
bad,hot. running oven.production is hectic most of the time. some co workers do not believe in team work which makes it hard for everyone
bad,"Flowers will lie to you just to convince you to buy a route then once you buy it flowers will not help you as promise. They promote that you are your own boss but that only applies when it comes to expenses. They will tell you how, what, and when to work."
bad,"I would never work for the outlet again. Horrible manager. Shows favoritism to one employee, I guess because they all hang "
bad,"Worked 7 days a week used my own vehicle for work with no compensation for mileage. No time off, But easy job over all. i enjoyed the relationships i built with customers."
bad,The use of a temp agency would leave a lot to wish for. The partner companies ABM and Flowers would not take responsibility for any opportunities and or challenges.
bad,"managed route daily ordering and delivered  product, learned how to manage my route organized, management not trusted, my co workers where very nice, hardest part of my job is loading my truck, what liked most  about my job is relationships with accounts."
bad,"You don't get to have a life outside of working here. You will have crazy schedules and hours, never knowing what days you will be off, if any, until the day before. Kiss your family and weekends goodbye. You do not get a lunch, you only get 4- 15 minute breaks a day"
bad,"I was trained in one day and left by myself. I was told to call a cell phone that was never answered if I have any issues. the back of the store was a warehouse with no air flow, so it was hot and it was mandatory to wear pants. I was not a manager f a store but had to participate in monthly manager meeting via phone conference. I also had to do inventory of the store by myself."
bad,"Long hours with little pay.  Very disorganized.  You are treated like an employee, except that you are a owner.  The company's communication is very low on a scale of 1 to 10."
bad,"Get to the depot around 3.00 am. I down load my load report and customer  order . "
bad,None at this time the company don’t provide much assistance and will allow you to fail in every area of the business. The put you out with little to no training and hold you accountable for issues they didn’t train or teach you
bad,they take advantage of you toss you aside put your job on the line by threatening to fire you for small things horrible work ethic professionalism you're expected to be a robot
bad,Long hours. I've learned how to maintain and control inventory. Management was decent. This company doesn't have a good workplace culture at all. Hardest part of job was balancing home and work life. Enjoyable part would be choosing when you wanted to go into work
bad,I had a very busy route that was spread out over a lot of miles. My old route is now 3 or 4 routes and likely wouldn't require the same long hours I had to put in to keep management happy.
bad,Working as an independent contractor is very trying and difficult. Moving into a trainer/manager has been more rewarding. The driver turnover is above average in my opinion.
bad,Work 364 days per year no exaggeration. Cost $150 per day off for manager to cover a distributor's route. 50% of gross income goes to route expenses. This company and management is not geared toward employee's welfare or livelihood.
bad,"Basically if you aren't in their click or a male tech, regardless if you pass the 30 day trial period, if they want you gone, they will fabricate a write up and get you wrongfully terminated."
bad,It's a job I thank god for opening that door for me there because the lord knew I needed that job at that time.Like every job it's always the people not the work.People can make work very difficult.But when the lord allow the door to close I still gave him that's.People difficult...
bad,"First I would like to say, this company has the ability to be the best company hands down. That being said, I would never recommend it to anyone. Yes it is not climate controlled and you work 12 hour shifts. Work at least 48-70 hours a week. The worst part is this is not what makes employees unhappy or want to leave. This is what make us work hard for the company and our families. “Hard word deserves reward “   The problem is upper management. Period. This company on a corporate level needs to open there eyes and see they are slowly, with their attempts to save move, destroy what’s has taken so long to build."
bad,"Worked there for over a year. It wasn't bad at first but once you figure out exactly how everything works, you realize nobody has any idea what their doing, including management."
bad,"Working hard. Stressful, lack of management and favoritism. No advancement. Bosses are very disrespectful. They do not appreciate their employees hard work."
bad,"I was very proud to work for this company and was humble to my advancement but there is too much negativity, especially from upper management, creating a very stressful and hostile work environment."
bad,"poor working conditions lack of training,poor attitude of management"
bad,My work days at Flowers Bakery are normally long nights and very demanding. I have learned about production and how to operate different types of machinery. The hardest part of my jobs are the long hours over night and being away from my kids and not having much time to spend with them. I'm a single mother. Days have gone by that I haven't seen my kids because of my work hours. Management doesn't communicate very well you hear one thing and then another. You never know when or what time you get off or go to work. Your schedule is basically ran day by day. You can speak on these things but it doesn't makes a difference. Therefore its very hard to plan things outside of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers.
bad,"It was your average every day job, company really don't care about their employees.  It will provide for your family income."
bad,When I first started it seemed like a great place but when they got new supervisors it got bad. The supervisors would tell your personal problems to other co-workers and things that was suppose to be confidential.  There was great co-workers but most of them are leaving due to personal reason and to get a better work environment.
bad,No clear definition of basic job requirements. Upper management prefers to micro-manage rather than delegate. Felt unappreciated at the end of the everyday.
bad,"Management is clueless. Bring the old teams back. The new guy is charge is a joke. No family life, no leadership to call or rely on as a newbie. Coming from management I'd hate to say this about management but Flowers has to rid their new Columbus, OH supervisor. Too many rookie mistakes from him in such short time."
bad,wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. it just a rabbit hole. management walk around like they're better than us. they only bring temps in and rarely hires anyone on.
bad,The only way I would recommend this job is for someone who is in desperate need of employment. I am grateful to have had the experience but it's not a place I would want to retire from.
bad,very unorganized company.  No family time always on call.  Mileage compensation not at industry standards.  No chance for advancement. Company is very unethical
bad,"Yes, the pay is good and the benefits are good, but the stress that is handed down from management is ridiculous, especially considering that most of upper management has no idea what is really happening in the factory. "
bad,"start off at 18.10 an hour. You work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. That's easy $4400 a month, but you really don't have the time to do anything else. Working 70+ hrs a week doesn't give your body enough time to recover, nor does it allow you to decompress. Money is decent, but your health will diminish in the long run which will cost you a lot more money than you made."
bad,"this is were all the addicts end up, if your ready to do everyones job at the expense of your own health and time, then you may like this job. management is horrible.... and creeps to say the least"
bad,"The pay is good, but tasks are simple and unfulfilling. Good for gaining experience, but hard on a person's body. Shift requires 7 hours straight of standing in one spot most times."
bad,This is a factory style bakery. You go to your assigned work area on the assembly line and do whatever the task required. Lot of scrambling when any equipment go's down.
bad,"Flower's had a poor work enviroment . When hired was told that their route avg was higher , than actually was . Was a new hire and was training new r.s.r. Always was held responsible for trainee's even thou they were on their own"
bad,Fun workplace. Great benefits and easy to get along with everyone
bad,"Not the best company to work!  Very uneducated and unfair managment,"
bad,job requires many hours and very little pay. if you need time for your family life beware
bad,long hours with no holiday or vacation time. the job is not for people that have family
bad,Racist managers thats keep it in the family. They will hire there relatives before attempting to promote a minority. They play paper work games. Use black puppets to carry out the unfairness.and injustices
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for. As an engineer, you’re payed decently well, but are expected a lot from you. Most of the equipment is old and deteriorating and yet the company spends as little money as possible to maintain them. Therefore, you should ideally have quite some experience working with tools, fabrication, and welding. Only work here if you need money."
bad,"I did little selling and was forced to do back breaking Route Driving."
bad,route that i had was long hours no time off lows pay wanted me to guy the route 60.000 and get in debt for years and be locked in to a contract  had to pay fuel insurance truck repaires and every thing else with 500. a week
bad,This company was unorganized and very stressful due to the demand I received. The route I was taking over was overly saturated by every local store in the South East Raleigh location working 72-78 work hours a week. I left due to the stress and seeking career opportunities.
bad,"When I worked at Flowers (about 4 years ago) it was a new operation. With new operations, tough times occur due to the fact they were trying to work the kinks out. The front office and management wasn't in tune which made most shifts dysfunctional. From what I hear now things are a lot more stable than they were while I was employed."
bad,I am joy working around everybody that work there to all the employees nice friendly and helpful other than that supervisor was awful all he cared about is himself himself.  John..
bad,It was a place to work. Their work ethics need work and so does their behaviors toward employees. There's more to a job than just money. The employee's should be considered important and respected for the hard work they put into their job.
bad,would not recommend as a career. hours can be long.bread can be late handhelds may or may not be working the hardest part of the job is properly ordering
bad,"Plan, develop, and execute the companies plan to achieve the overall goals of the company. Work alone with little support and guidance due to the lack of managements abilities to move the business forward."
bad,"arrive by 4am everyday. sort product, build orders load truck and drive to locations. service stores ( take new product in and remove dated product.) build displays and service them. talk to store management eveyday. be oncall 7 days a week and 24 houra a day ."
bad,"People want different things in life. I care more about the experiences in life. Especially if I make good money, but this job doesn't let you do that. Majority of people their let their family spend the money, because they don't have time to do so."
bad,"Never off on holidays, even on Chrismas, they only shut the plant down for 18 hours. Most companies give the employees a turkey or ham for the holidays, we got a bag of bread."
bad,"Great job if you can establish customer baseline, downfall is having to pay your own taxes plus that of which company decides you are responsible for."
bad,this place was good at first then it became so stressful and cut throat.  for someone trying to provide for there family its a good place and the benefits will help once you get hired.
bad,"I enjoyed the challenge of being an independent distributor. Eventually, over time, i could not make enough money to sustain my weekly expensive. The hardest part of the job, not having co-work. It was a lonely time and cut throat."
bad,"0245-1645 Site to site Route management"
bad,the job itself was easy..great pay! nowhere near enough hours to support your family while supervisors and office people continued to benefit and collect fat checks!
bad,"Different from the oilfield back ground I came from, but learned a lot and game me a chance to sharpen skills on motors and controls. People were very helpful and nice."
bad,The hours are terrible and the pay is worse.  Look forward to working 12+ hours a day and getting very little compensation.  The people are very nice when they are trying to recruit you to buy one of their routes and they offer you the world and tons of benefits until you sign the contract and then the tone completely changes
bad,Too demanding 7 days a week. You get two weeks vacation but that's it. Never anymore the money is good but it's also inconsistent you have to keep constant watch
bad,Good Strong company with solid growth innovative with new categories and new distribution centers Good growth new product lines and took care of their customers.
bad,"4 seperate shifts, but did not work a 12 hour swing schedule.  We worked 6 days in a row, two days off, then 6 again.  The fourth shift covered all three shifts' days off.  If someone called out, They required employees to stay at least 4 hours over, or even a double shift without notice."
bad,Typically you're on your feet the entire time that you're working and this is a production environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team and depending on each other to complete the job.
bad,The job was pretty hard I had too unload 2 53 ft trucks a day full of bread stacked 16 high in trays. I also had to separate them a distribute them to 15 different routes daily. I also was in charge of breaking down pallets of cake product on Wednesdays and Sundays along with my bread product. This was the hardest part it was to much work for one man on tempt. i made 12.50 but labor was so intense that i really felt under valued as a employee and would never work for them again. Management was unorganized. The most enjoyable part was getting paid every week
bad,"A typical day at Flowers Bakery. Is coming in setting up and running quality product at a timely matter, and working a 8 to 12 hour shift. I have learn many things at the bakery such as, trouble shooting problems, team work, and time management skills. I work with many different personality's but team work gets us threw any tough day. The hardest part of the job is having a run of bad product, and still send out quality product at the same time. The most enjoyable part is knowing that we send out tasty and good quality product to families all over."
bad,start pack line and box bread till bread  order is complete and if there is mistake with bagging then we re bag bread.
bad,"12 hour day, standing only,  co-workers for the most part very good at their job, large turn-over.  Fear of write-up used to get work done.  Upper management very good.  Work place management consist of both knowledgeable and some with little over all training in all work or management of people.  Very hot in summer with dehydreation taking effect on many workers.  Leads and suppervisors at both end of scale.  Most enjoyable- working with co-workers that helped each other."
bad,It was a great opportunity for me to learn about the bread industry & start my own independent distributorship
bad,Management isn't all that great It has good pay if you're in the right department. You get a raise often like every 3 months if u can handle the work and the people
bad,"Unsafe workplace. All kinds of safety training, where employees are required to sigh off, but the reality is, once you hit the production floor, nothing else mattersexcept to keep the line moving. And implied mandate by management to put self at risk in order to maintain production flow."
bad,"Use to be a great place to work, but with this new Structure it put all the extra work on you, you no longer have any extra men to help."
bad,"Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday you will check your order, load your truck, check your truck, service customer accounts, order for five days out, unload stale and empty trays. Sunday and Wednesday you will straighten and tidy your accounts."
bad,"The job itself paid very well and first shift employees were verily nice people. Second shift is the pits and I would not recommend going to night-shift. Although, night-shift is not optional after several months. Generally after 3 months you will go to night shift and stay there until...well, about 5 years probably. "
bad,Long hrs to low hrs schedule changes in production little regard to employes my way or highway type attitude im gona keep it short and sweet that it no more
bad,"The company itself has great potential. There is very few good management in this facility, mind you the good ones seem to be fed up. It seems the ones who do have the time and knowledge do not share. So its pulling hairs trying to get trained properly. Benefits, and the pay are a plus. Actually its probably the only plus with the way things are ran here."
bad,A typical Work day is hectic.  I learned to ask questions. Management is seldom seen. Culture is strenuous. Hardest part of job is keeping up.  I enjoyed the Leads.
bad,You get according to what you deliver. Some low output guys make 70K. High end guys make 160K. Very repetitive work. lots of lifting. it never ends. 24/7 for 364 days per year. Organization is the key to success! zero benefits.
bad,expect to work at least 12-hour days 5 days a week with no employment benefits. Starting pay was $14.50/hourly so that part was nice. Most of the time spent working will be spent alone.
bad,"The place pay good but they real don't care how many worker they go throw, the short Time I worked there I seen on 15 people fire and or quit. They have bad management most of them don't even no what is going on half the time. They don't coordinate with each-other so you are to do different things by different supervisors. Also the work to home time is bad you get one day in a roll. They also don't know how to spread out the workers they have so that work gets done faster and in a more ever way."
bad,Almost 17 years with this company. If your not a buddy buddy you don't get anywhere!!!!!!!!  Period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,At the numbers of hours you put in and being oncall 24/7 you will have no life if you work here.
bad,The management needs better communication amoung themselves and their employees.  Training is not strong if you can't work in a fast paced enviroment then this isn't the job for you.  DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA like in any factory job.  People constantly trying to get others in trouble to move up themselves within the company.  If you have children the schedule is totally based on work load so during the winter months usually very very slow you could have 2-4 days off a week and during the summer you will be working 5-7 days a week depending on what line you work as well.  Shift hours are set but you may have to work 12 hours a day a couple of times a week. Benefits can NOT be beaten by anyone in Crossville they are amazing and well worth it. Pay could be better they are top paying around here but you deffinately earn the pay without a doubt.
bad,the hardest part us not being home. Managment was not the best. After 10 years the company started going down hill
bad,Pays well no flexibly management it's well at all. Benefits are well. Prolonged standing depending on what position you literally stand and do 1 task 8 to 12 hours gets tough on the back. Great pay though.
bad,The bread business is cut-throat and competitive. Flowers is an old school company not willing to invest into the future and keep valuable employees along the way IMO. Communication was very poor between all departments.
bad,"If you are willing to work yourself to the bone but barely have the capacity to think for yourself, you may be a good fit.  Not all bakeries are alike but that is the cultural mindset in a nutshell."
bad,"Upper management is not professional. "
bad,"On top of working 55+ hours a week to upwards of 70+ hours per week, the management team refuses to allow use of personal days or vacation time if you do not come in on your days off to cover other shifts which have a habit of constantly calling out without repercussions. As well as poor management of scheduling, sometimes you will be scheduled to work 6 days a week due to lack of individuals to cover vacation time. With over 200 employees the company only has 2 individuals to cover employees who are on vacations. Management team expects you to come in to work on your days off due to mismanagement of scheduled vacations or call outs which have no repercussions. There are numerous employees who have missed weeks to months of scheduled days which are still allowed to be employed with no negative consequences. Others are expected to go into work to cover shifts of those individuals who have a habit of calling out."
bad,"Long hours, sometimes stressful. Management loves to play the blame game so beware. Great pay for an entry level job. The work itself isn't hard. Can get extremely hot in the summer. The best part of my job is the people I work with aside from management. HR is nice as well, but a lot is out of their hands."
bad,"good place to work houriy pay wise,but schedule is demanding split days off ALWAYS,and NEVER EVER have a weekend off.I have worked for several other companys ,and Flowers does not have very good benifets in compairison."
bad,"The pay was good but didn’t like working long hours. You don’t really have a social life or an actual day off.  You have to deal with customers and a lot of managers or assistant managers. A lot of people are in bad moods, you have to work around the store hours. Very frustrating."
bad,"Flowers is ok, you work long hours. It can be unprofessional with leads and mangement. Not as clean as other plants. The quality is not up to part.lazy"
bad,"Extremely hot in the summer. Always at least 5 degrees hotter inside than it is outside."
bad,Okay job. I feel like my time for company has come to end.  The money is good. Just don't want to work every weekend anymore.  Any one that wants to make money it's best place to go and work.
bad,The scheduling would change so abruptly the Management was terrible and very unprofessional. would not recommend this job to anyone with a family.
bad,"its not a bad job often super hot and the shift are not designed for a family man, i wouldnt  refer anyone who has young kids or seniors that they care for"
bad,"Work culture bad,but pay is good. There is no work/life balance. You are expected to be at work no matter the weather conditions. Most people don't like being there which leads to the high turnover rate."
bad,Enjoyed working for Flowers. Good pay and fun environment working on on your own. Better to own your route than to not. I know that's sounds like common sense.. You just have to know my story.
bad,Have been looked over several times for supervisory positions.  Would like to work in a place where there is more chance to move up in positions and where I am recognized for my abilities.
bad,"Uncomfortable environment almost occultism within lower ranks of employees, but I thoroughly enjoyed my work and supervisors can be very informative and helpful when willing. Ive gained valuable experience to catapult my career."
bad,Working consistently 70-80 work weeks. constantly covering for hourly employees that call in sick or always late. Pay is fair. hours are crazy. Management not supportive in hiring more employees.
bad,not a bad company u have no life other bread 7 days a week no off days really depends on ur route I had a out of town route so may days where long really long plus I talk to customer I didn't blow in and blow out of them I could of made my day a lil shorty!! everyday starts at bout 2 a.m. and most days I would finish my paper work round 10p.m. most days there was a many day I did sleep bout every other day for max of 4 hours and then off to work we go!!
bad,didnt have a set schedule so it made it rough. it wasnt the best environment to work in as some of the bosses were very rude. i never new the time i would get off or half the time we had to guess on time to come in due to miscompunication
bad,Enjoyable at times however management is really difficult to work with. Personnel was great work very enjoyable when things were running correctly.
bad,I operate two machines that wrap the bread after it comes out of the oven.  These two machines have several different parts that I am responsible for cleaning and maintaining.  I handle several different types of bread. The management team is ok but not great. We have lots of machines that are in great need of fixing but instead of fixing things the right way they get the machines running by rigging them. The part dept. is more worried about their bonus than fixing the machines with the right part. After being there for several years I have came to the point where I think the only reason the do well is the pay but other than that they are not that great.
bad,"I was not clear on compensation when I started, or the amount of hours worked. Typical day starts at 2 am with an hour drive to get to work then a day of 200 miles getting me home any where from 4 to 7 pm."
bad,"Good pay but you can't trust anyone there, not even management"
bad,"It requires you to put the job first, family second.  Though the pay is good, the lack of time away from the family seems like you never get to enjoy the money that you're working for."
bad,"Flower's Foods exploits its Independently Contracted deliverymen through a variety of ways, doing everything in it's power to keep as many profits as possible and to pass the cost of operation onto the IO's. It is a terrible company to contract with simply because there is no guarantee of support from Flowers. We are expected to do our part perfectly, and they expect us to cover up for their shortcomings."
bad,The money is good but the management is not on the same page. There is no communication.I would say the hardest part about the job is getting use to the fast past enviorment
bad,"Working at Flowers Bakery was fast paced, no place for advancement, always came in early if needed and would be asked to stay over or not let loose on time to leave for the day."
bad,"My review of flowers bakery Hot environment, fast paced, standing for long period of hours, short breaks, paid holiday, hours vary shorter during the winter season"
bad,Long hours and a lot of headaches with staff not properly supporting vendors. They don't care about you once you buy your route.
bad,It was the most horrible experience I have ever endured as a employee. The Managers actually screamed and hollered at employees like they where dogs. It was a horrible environment and it has horribly hot conditions. The training was horrible and it had a good old boy mentality. The good old boys got promoted and they treated people they did not like with utter disrespect and contempt. It has a horribly high turnover and they HR woman is concerned about firing people and she does nothing to help you out. Unless you are completely desperate for a job do not even think about this place. The pay was decent but it was ran by uneducated people who have no respect for others.
bad,delivered bread. learned how to listen to customers. certain managers were good.
bad,Days unloaded inbound trailers pulled orders of bread using on board computers to loaded unloaded products inventory  control was done daily. Myself was assigned to a production line pulled the product loaded on the trailers to were it was going Florida Alabama all though tt
bad,In shipping It is a fast paced job. A supervisor never trains you. They teach you to load a stack of bread and that is it. The rest they expect busy workers to teach everything. After getting written up and getting verbal for not knowing what I was doing I MADE a supervisor teach me. I learned every thing and was still treated unfairly. I tried getting my wife in but was told family members can't be working with each other. I learned that a supervisor has about 6 of his family members working for them. And his wife works as HR plus one of his nephews wife works in upper management. So even if I wanted to complain. I'm sure I'd be targeted because of my complaints. And in shipping you have to be a family member or a really close friend to move up. They over work you and it is HOT with barely working fans during summer. But they blast them real nice during winter. Management goes off of personal feelings when discipline. The only good part about the job is the pay and if you know what you're doing nobody bothers you.
good,Work hard for no reason. Care more about their selves then the employees. Just a bad environment to work at  they had their favorite and the people they didn’t like they treated bad.
good,"Job is learn as you go"
good,"Good salary but no vacation. You run it like it’s your own business, so if you want time off you have to pay someone. If the truck breaks down it’s on you."
good,"Poor  working conditions without organizational, lack of supervision, no consistency, poor lighting and heating, rat infested warehouse, broken or inafishent equipment."
good,Good company needing moral support. a lot fo good employes and fun place to just learn about where and how your bread is being made..
good,Management is very selfish and does not seem to want to keep hard working people around. They focus on the wrong aspects of business and they don’t seem to notice any pattern as to why everyone leaves for better jobs.
good,"First day of operations in KC, the also newly hired depot manager told us drivers that he's the guy to keep happy because he's the guy that does the 'hiring and firing'. The regional manager backed him after hearing this."
good,"Low pay, lots of hours. Management is not willing to help with problems much but wants to micromanage every single thing you do. Early to work late home."
good,"I would come in at 11 pm go into a pass down meeting were they would tell us what we would be running for the night. Finnish whatever product would be on the line set up my line for different product, run it, would switch over from cluster packing to individual wrap at least twice so crawling from one side to the other underneath conveyor belt to get to different areas. Use air hose to blow my line out and clean my area, and then go home at 7 am"
good,Don't work here unless you like being toyed with and lied too. Certified Independent but send you a W2. They won't explain shrimp charges so your checks can be played with if your not careful.
good,They are all about how much production they can make in a fast time. Don't care about anyone or anything... supervisor's are all about the brown noser's.
good,"The job was not beneficial if you have a family,one weekend a month is very"
good,"If you don't mind working in a salt mine, this is the place for you. Some of the Supervisors are absolute A-holes. No appreciation for hard work. Don't make a mistake or you will be black balled for any kind of advancement."
good,I worked seven days a week for eight years. Woke up at 2:30am and would get home 12 hours or more later. I never had any time to see my family outside of dinner hours.
good,Management is prevented from a truly effective and productive working relationship with Independent Distributors due to Old Boy corporate culture. Recent restructuring of company has not successfully addressed this issue and corporate management continues to make bad decisions because of this generally poor relationship. Would not recommend for this reason.
good,Hard working employees are typically over-looked or even mistreated. Management decisions are often made off of personal opinions rather than business choices. The culture is cut-throat. No support from upper management nor human resource department.
good,"baked all bread for fl area at a fast paced warehouse work made sure all product was baked correct also made bread for different fast  foods burger king,"
good,"Flowers is family owned, I worked my butt off, and was passed over several times by a family members. Rotating shifts were awful to get used to. Hot, humid environment."
good,The work isn’t hard you just have to follow an unclear set of directions...the weeks are unstable one week you’ll make 60hrs the next week under 40 .... the management omg they’re so confused..I’ve met good people over my six years at the company
good,"Flowers provides an acceptable wage for the employees and ample health benefits. The day to day work schedule, however is almost none existent. Off days can be cancelled at a moments notice; and often are. There is little to no support from upper management in terms of employee well-being or even morale."
good,I delivered bread and cake products to stores.  Started early in the morning worked 10 to 12 hours a day. Then on Wednesday and Sunday I went back to the stores and checked on them.
good,"Very poor  communication, and lack of good leadership inundate this place. Not a horrible pace to work altogether but very stressful at times .Demanding in  terms of work hours and shifts."
good,There is no professionalism. Everyone bad mouths everyone. Hours are long and changing. No organization. Work environment is hostile half the time and the other half do not care.
good,"Flowers Foods has changed a great amount when they evolved from ""The Flowers Family"". The IDO way of business has changed the way Flowers Foods does things,"
good,ABM is a great staffing company.  The management and staff perform their duties. I've learned many different skills in the various jobs that I have been assigned to.
good,Operate machines for long periods of time. Standing on your feet for a time. Heavy lifting 40 lbs+. Fast paced... sweat slot because it's hot. Short brakes.. Work 12 hours+..
good,"Flowers foods views their employees as numbers, and often shows little to no regard for the personal lives of the workers. This company of profit driven, as most businesses, however; because of this they treat their staff poorly. "
good,"It was a job I  would recommend to someone with limited other interests. Good pay if you do good work, but long hours. Its difficult to handle the meadling in the affairs and orders of someone who is classified Self Employed."
good,"I worked in the Thrift Stores which wasn't a bad job to have.  The pay was pretty good and the regular hours not bad.  Management expected overtime work whenever the need occurred without any notice nor did they ever ask if you had previous plans/appointment.   I enjoyed most of my co-workers, however, with the introduction of new upper management the work place became hostile.  Long time workers who had never had any difficulties became the target of the new Supervisor and employees were encouraged to make allegations that were not true with promises of future advancement."
good,"•       serviced  12  Markets and 2 chain convenience stores daily. "
good,"I've worked for Flowers for 4 years and the job is hard on the body and hard on relationships. A lot of men that work for Flowers are divorced because the hours are just not great. You work 6, sometimes 7 days a week and it is just not good."
good,I basically work by myself all the time stock manage and ran the store by myself. the head manager was barely there so I learn how to run the store by myself
good,"Work/life balance is non-existent. "
good,"This is by far the most challenging and exhausting job I have ever worked. My schedule was pretty chaotic and you could forget about knowing your Sundays if you didn’t work on Saturday. On aberage I was given three 15 minute breaks per shift instead of a lunch. Also had an injury that was treated very poorly. Overall if you want a decent paying job but don’t mind not being able to make plans outside of work and expect tremendous heat/had manual labor, then I recommend it."
good,"Its good pay for hard work. However it becomes a stressful environment, because lack and poor management. And when you step up and take on more problems and management duties as a warehouse laborer, they wont even consider a raise for your effort. They need to take care of the employees who can get the job done."
good,"Company needs to restructure their management in most departments alleviate overtime by hiring needed employees, establish a trainer or set training protocol that can be implemented to improve the overall function and efficiency of the production process. Show a lot more gratitude and appreciation for all the people that work hard doing 50+hours per week to keep the plant running and allow the employees to have certain benefits like sick days or PTO, because life happens sometimes and the last thing you want to worry about when it does it whether or not your job is going to let you go over it."
good,"during my first year i trained at 7 different positions and every time i made a mistake while training i was written up and it was held against me. they had a listeria outbreak and another line go down, so instead of laying people off they looked for minute mistakes in order t fire people. poor management with an obvious lack of diversity and a hostile racial work environment."
good,A typical work day at Flower's consist of me assisting customers by helping them find the product of their liking and checking them out at the cash register. I also do paperwork and take orders for the company. I work at a fast pace and work well with others to get the job done.
good,"I really liked the work I had to do, it was something different than I have always done. They compensate you pretty well and the raises are good. the issue I had with flowers is the work/life balance. the schedule would change almost daily at last minute and we would go months without off days. The training process needs to be improved drastically. I believe if they focus more on training and scheduling the high turnover rate would stop cease."
good,Not enough time to have a personal life. Top out pay as well as start out pay should be higher. Benefits are very good. Very hard work will take a told on your body
good,"Great job security, but has no time table when shift is over always working 12+ hours daily with various days off. Company was not sensitive to employee problems that may occur."
good,"High pace job base on productive and customer service "
good,"It was okay in the beginning, then progressed into a company i would not want to work for. I would not recommend this company."
good,"A typical day working at Flowers Baking Company was about 15 hours long and the work week was 7 days. I would start my route early in the morning, deliver the product, and had paperwork such as transmitting orders and end of week inventory. My co-workers were good people who worked just as hard as I did. Management seemed to lack efficient communication skills at times. The hardest part of my job was working the long hours and not being there for my family like I wanted to be. Also, another difficulty was trying to communicate with supervisors. I enjoyed my job and especially enjoyed interacting with all of my customers on a daily basis."
good,"They work every Holiday, and its all in who you know.  They bend the rules for people they know instead of based on education, and how you work.  Would be a good company if it was not for some of the managers.  In two years when one of them is gone, I'd say it would be a better company to work for."
good,clock in clear the floor of the bread that's on the floor. separate it to fill specific orders for each warehouse. then take a break and wait for a truck to come in then we do the truck unload the bread off separate it to fill the order of each warehouse then load it on to the specific door to a specific warehouse
good,"days were long, rotating management confused employees, company was newer to southern california, good people though."
good,Operate and monitor the performance of the bread bagger machine.
good,liked the area of stocking shelves monitorig date on brands. a good job. you must have good eye observence.
good,"Very disappointing that they don't allow for time off for family emergencies or life incidentals. They give a 1 week ""vacation,"" but they don't allow you to take the time off!"
good,It's a place that's going to work the h**l out of you...they think cause they pay you well above average they can work you like a slave..no room for advancement
good,Most of it is based on your route. I had a route with alot of little stops a 3 main stores but no power house stores to move short dated product fast enough. They want stores full and your returns down. Not always possible. Your told your not putting enough out then next week your bringing too much back. Stores call all hours of the night. And my route day ave. was 14 hrs. Reason i left was because area manager blocked me form acquiring a larger store to help me split my route.
good,"most of the coworkers I worked with knew more about how the factory ran"
good,"Working at a bread factory is difficult if you work on the line. The heat is hard to handle, but you get used to it. If you're smart you can learn your position pretty quickly and then start to cross train. I was a breaker and it was great to be able to move around to the different positions at the plant. There are some issues with how the breaks are handled and management wanted OT worked but didn't want to pay for it (hence the issues with breaks)"
good,Good old boy system. Its a job. Frustration on the daily. Constant gossip. Will change things whenever they want. Will force you to work hours you dont want. Keep your head down and just get your hours in for the day.  Just enough money to keep you second guessing a career change for the rest of your life.
good,"enjoyed one on one communication with the customers. being able to help and support their concerns for things we needed to improve, or items we didn't have that they were used to us having prior to their previous visits."
good,You never know when you are working they change schedule last minute and overtime isn't a choice you get half a point for refusing overtime which wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't everday
good,"All the benefits come when you get hired on permanent. As a temp you dont get any benefits,  you get about 37 hours a week, you work six days two off so your days off rotate. Its ok even if you never make it perm but your eligible after 400 hrs"
good,"Great job if you’re looking to work lots of hours, with no work life balance. Other than that it’s not a good family job. We are the most under paid flowers foods in the nation, and never shut down."
good,"The only thing that kept me at flowers was the pay. When I first started they had plenty of overtime, with a good hourly rate. When they cut overtime that's when I decided to walk. Management was also terrible, all they do is talk negatively about their subordinates to others rather than lead them."
good,Management does not care about workers and their personal lives.  They treat workers as slaves and have little no any sympathy for outside work lives.  Good pay and managers will throw it in your face when telling you not asking you to stay for 12 hours.
good,Its not a bad company to work for. I was able to work with a great group of people. Every day you do the same job. You work on average 6 days a week no time for a life outside of work.
good,No work life balance. Great for a young professional! Good support from management. Must be comfortable working overnight.
good,Production driven with little training for operators. Situational and reactionary rather than proactive. Liberal policy for different departments leading to a lack of discipline.
good,"Fast pace constant working. "
good,"don't expect any help from the company."
good,"Hours are long.  "
good,Flowers is a great place to work if you want a factory job to be your career job. The pay and benefits are top of the line considering the job its self is pretty easy. The hardest  thing to deal with would be the excessive hours in the summer and spring because half the year you will work 50 to 62 hours and the other half maybe 30.
good,"very good job managers need more training but its a very good job in Suwanee. Fast pace and very hot. Lot of long hours and no family time. Can be stressful at times, But is very rewarding."
good,You typically worked hard from the moment you clocked in to when your relief came in to relive you of your duties. Biggest complaint is that their is very little time for family...especially working 7 days straight.
good,Long work day with no opportunity to advance. Good job but you are required to purchase your route. Some people are not able to purchase a route. Good job for a young person.
good,It have its up and down . No weekends off. Gets too hot. They don't give credit where  credit is due. Hardly room to move on up. Other than that it's a good place to start from. If you can make it than you pretty much can handle most warehouse jobs..
good,"early hours, long days, must be ready to be called in at any time. Not a lot of gratitude for the life you give them. You be as good as you can be but it will never be enough."
good,"i loved the ppl i worked with , eay work, must be able to stand on feet the whole shift, woking with bread and cake products, i had to make schedules and baance money drawers, also make trips to the bank"
good,Typical shift schedule. Mandatory OT. Basic job functions. Management def lacking. Safety needs improvement. Great coworkers. Not much for employee recognition.
good,Job was very stable for a select few.  I learned to rely on myself and teach myself various job tasks.  I was determined to have a good day despite my surroundings.  I have been able to take that attitude with all of my jobs
good,Management makes poor decisions without any concern for employees. Long 12 hour days with only two days off and they are split days so you never get two in a row
good,I really enjoyed my co workers because they encouraged me throughout the day whenever I was unaware of something or struggling with a particular task in the job.
good,I enjoyed the customers I met on the route. get up early and work hard and get done early. bring your own truck. hardest part of the job no team work.
good,I was hired as a pan setter.  My jobs was to load pans onto a conveyor belt.  My suypervisor and employees were helpful in my training.  The hardest part of my job was consistently load this cast iron pans.  The most enjoyable part about my job was clean up at the end of the shift.
good,The bakering job wasnt a very good to work for it was very hot and dirty.
good,"Travel from account to account delivering product, then set store shelves with product for sale"
good,Very hard work long hrs but the pay was good and a lot of overtime. I really loved my job.
good,"Hard work, lots of stops and not a lot of sales. They have a great product and will go places when people in Indiana start buying it."
good,"The hours worked at this job were not optional. If someone in the shift before you messed up it was on you to fix everything. You could walk in thinking you are working an 8 hour shift and be forced to work a 12+ hour because of 1st shift not working as hard. Your schedule changes daily/hourly. I remember looking at my schedule 2 hours before my shift ended and having the next day off and then going to leave and it showing me having a 12 hour the next day. If you need a job with flexible hours this isn't it. You have no idea what your night or week is going to be. If you are bored and like to work constantly then this is your job. They don't do promotions anymore. My cousin was just demoted after 20 years of working there because her position was eliminated; now she makes entry-level pay. The most enjoyable part was all the friends I made working there. Without my coworkers, the job would have been unbearable. It takes about 3 weeks to get used to the back pain because you are hunched over all day trying to reach snack cakes. You get paper cuts all day on cake line so your fingers are all bloody and you have to get off the line to get band aids frequently (though the paper cuts weren't that big of a deal people just kept asking if I had a cat). It teaches you endurance at this job and I am happy to have had it. I am a tougher person because of this job. It taught me how to use my hands and fingers quickly and how to respond to my environment faster. There are really good people working there and it's just sad they will all eventually get laid off. I had to leave this job to"
good,"This company gives you great opportunities for advancement. There’s several departments to work in. Shipping, Production, Bread Wrap and Bun Wrap. Excellent..!"
good,Extremely long working week with lack of management support made for a hard workplace. Turnover rate of skilled workers made it an unstable work environment.
good,"Work life balance needs improvement."
good,A typical day at Flowers Bakery is very fast paced and can be very stressful. I learned a lot about the job but there was still a lot to learn. management is nice. The hardest part of the job is the bread wrap line and the most enjoyable part of the job is if you can keep your bread lines running without major incidents.
good,Very stressful and no time for family. It’s hot in the summer time and cold in the winter. You work long 12-13 hours a day and have no time to do anything
good,"It’s a decent job, nothing quite that special. Work is easy. Hours are rough. Some good days An some bad days but that’s every where ya go. Overall it’s decent"
good,The Maintenance Superintendent  Micro Manager and highly critical no pleasing him. Old equipment and did I mention its HOTTER than the fires of Hades!
good,"I started cleaning bathrooms, break rooms and offices and ended  working on the line.  Management was very nice. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the line. The most enjoyable part was getting those nice paychecks from all those hours."
good,"You're put to work and required to work - it's a job. You'll work 12 hour shifts and have no home life. Your life will be Flowers. With that being said, it's good pay for the area given the current economy. The work at this plant is less intense than other plants or even manufacturing jobs in general. As all you're doing is watching the machines do the work while you receive $15 - $20 an hour, vacation time, company matching 401k, health, dental, and vision. Politics really make it an average job though, as there is favoritism and biases in the workplace. I'll admit that compared with other jobs, work politics for the place are unusually intense."
good,Good company good pay. The management and swing shift hours are stressful on the body and the mind. No real breaks. Hard to have a life or family outside of work
good,I am at Supervisory Position.  Cannot promote.  Once in a position can not go any further.  Management will hire previous employees over present employees.
good,I learned to never give up and to keep going. you don't have to go through challenges alone because with a team that's willing to grow and build your company will as well.
good,"Extreme heat during summer months, strong possibility of dehydration and high levels of stress. The pay and benefits are amazing, but as a result of working six to seven days a week, family time is almost nonexistent. The employees overall have a positive attitude and are proud of their accomplishments within the departments in which they work."
good,"Dave's Killer Bread was bought back in 2015 by Flowers Foods. Working for Flowers has had its challenges, but I have been treated fairly. The work environment has become much more corporate, which has its positives and negatives. Overall, I have been impressed with the longevity with some of Flowers employees."
good,"Flowers is not a bad place to work in, but there is always a lot of room for improvement on management. One example is there were a better balance on work and life."
good,It was ok. I loved working with the public and interacting with store managers. The management at the time was a little unstable.
good,"A typical day in the Operations Department involves the monitoring of all the company's file movement, networking equipment, and monitoring of business systems.  The Flowers NOC also processes Customer Service Ticket, Help Desk Tickets, Software installations, the binding of reports, emails to customers, level 1 and 2 support of the help desk, and more."
good,ok.It was a fun and great experience.The people were really friendly and willing to help whenever needed.
good,"It's a job, you work longer hours, low yearly pay raise. Very little family time."
good,I advanced fast at the company and have been very sucessful at the job. I just would like more time with my family
good,"Moving stacks of palets filled with bread and loading and unloading trucks. Full work day was about 12 hours very hard work,."
good,"Oversee route operation, merchandising, scheduling. Managing stale products percentage. Monitor ordering."
good,"I learned alot on freshness on bread and cakes as well as the value of team work there. I loved my co- workers, every one there is like family. Hardest part of job was bending to lift bread crates while pregnant. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers"
good,"I enjoyed working at this company and the people I worked with. I liked that the company provided catered meals for awarding us for our hard work, health fairs, yearly meetings concerning our benefits."
good,"Alright  company to work fast pace and hot inside building, good benefits they have there goods and bad like most companies, you work 12 hours a day, off 2 days not off back to back days off, days  rotate but all in all it was nice working  there. off Monday  and Thursday  this week, off Tues and Friday next week  can make you work 1of your off days."
good,"tough different working conditions"
good,"work a lot but pay is good. very fast paced, but if you have a good trainer to show you different ways to preform the job it makes it easier. Its a good place to work and raise your kids ( money wise)"
good,"It was awesome thanks for the opportunity."
good,this company started with two men who had a vision to start a venture together that would eventually lead to the marriage of fresh start bakery to flowers foods llc. through the hard work of a small group of employees.
good,"Flowers is a good company but there is not much room to grow."
good,"from the exact time when you are in the building its non stop working"
good,It was fun and easy going at times and the good part was getting to know the customers and working with good people and be come a family.and hours aint that bad.
good,"Laid back, chill, cooperative job to support the family. I like my job. I always brought back the bread, which was a nice perk and I like the work was worth my pay."
good,Work every day.   A typical day working with customers and driving and delivering products to store . Start early .   Work handheld . load and unload product..  make order . Build displays .  Talk to managers
good,"This is a fast-paced work environment with excellent starting pay wages, and a great benefits package. However, when I was employed there, the work schedule was horrible. The schedule and hours were not consistent, management would constantly change your days off, or the hours you are scheduled to work. It was really hard to have a life outside of work."
good,Stressful getting sub contractors out of there while adhering to their rules and regulations. 
good,Afer new management took over. No one on the production floor knew who was the boss. No one communicated with the production workers about policy's that were changing.
good,A friendly fast paced environment. Most of the time everyone would be conversing with each other while working. We worked as a team until the task was completed. The most difficult part of the job would have to be when our rotating chains we're down. The rotating chains would transport the bread stacks from the top end down to the loading dock. From there we would load the crates manually with a dolly.
good,I love working for flowers foods making my own hour having fun with people in the warehouse adjusting with coworker.It was a great environment and professional.
good,"typical manufacturing plant, baking fresh bread, so weekend work is a must. pay is above average for location of production. managers work with schedule if going to school."
good,I enjoyed going to the different stores and servicing different accounts and enjoyed working with the different customers. The hardest part of the job was working in the different weather conditions.
good,This distributorship has treated me well over the years financially. work hours are from 3am to finish and its usually a 12 hour day. No vacations or days off.
good,"can be very stressful and is very strict there"
good,"They employee a lot of people.  They hire through staffing agencies which gives you an idea if you like the job or not.  Pay is good, overtime available."
good,"Its a good company with really good benefits. However, management is in its own group. Your complaints are filed, but not addressed. Seniority in the company is what matters most."
good,the truth is that the route sales drivers work for themselves not the bakery.  you own your truck and buy all of your gas and make your own repairs.  you rent dock space and warehouse space from the bakery and they sell you bread and snack cake products.  you load your own truck and unload it also.  if not sold you still have to pay for the bread weekly.  not too bad but if you have a slow route you make less money than some others.  you have to do your own taxes quarterly with accountant.
good,"the pay is good for the area, but upper management is not the best at all, they tend to say they care but will throw anyone under the bus. maintenance is the best department i think to be in."
good,"I worked for a sub contractor .I would love to work there again.The warehouse environment is what I love "
good,It was an ok job to work at I did my work. I volunteered when they needed people to stay over. I was on time came in early and stayed late got alone with my employees.
good,"My typical day at was to watch the flow of the bread in the Bread-line production area, I made sure there  wasn't any defective product going to the bagging section, I air blew out the bread crumbs between each brand to avoid allergens, I cleared all jams in the machines, I performed general house keeping duties. I enjoyed finding out how my bread I ate was made, sliced, bagged and then shipped out. The hardest part of the job was working with sandwich bread making sure it flowed down the line without jams."
good,Delivering product to stores help another round with the routes putting displays up in stores. Doing inventory the big stores that were pay by scan. Pretty stressful job.
good,"The job was fast paced and physically tiring.  I was a break man for the mixer, bun machine, oven, and wrap.  The twisting at wrap was not good for my back."
good,"it is a good investment of your time and efforts ,should be in good shape ,great job and investment for a young man starting with a new family.then sell the route and move to something with less hours"
good,"You have to get up at 2 O'Clock in the morning,  the job could be better , but you will work every weekend having only Wednesday and Sunday off.  But you do get a discount on the bread."
good,extremely demanding physical labor . Dangerous work conditions and equipment .very fast paced with not that much instruction .but  you do get paid weekly .
good,Great working group team.  Everyone knows everyone. All knows they job.  Strictly working conversate. Communication with supervisor. Opnn door policy to new suggestions. Diverse company
good,It's an okay job love the customers. All other work is not as easy as it seems. But if the employees all work together it will make everything else okay.
good,I have worked at flower's for 5 yearsgreat place to work if you liked fast paced environment. paid holidays 401k company match opportunity to move up. Family friendly atmosphere and great team building experienc
good,"Legal slavery, work conditions are extremely terrible and should be illegal. Only receive three 15 minute breaks in a 10 or 12 hour shift. Once again should be illegal. Very unhealthy place to work."
good,It's not for everyone. It gets hot and hectic at times. Training is a hit or miss sometimes they train you to much sometimes you have to learn as you go. Overall it's a decent environment with good people.
good,The job itself is not hard. Starting out seems like you have a lot to handle but once you get used to it it comes easy. The worst part of the job is the management crew. Many of them are either inexperienced or just don't know how to handle a team and the communication between people there is nowhere to be seen.
good,Did all the managing  checking in orders and running the register. Making out paper work and dropping off the money at the end of the day to the bank. Made out time cards for the employers.
good,"Company treats employees like family, benefits are great but pay is mediocre at best. Work long hours and weekend without compensation. Require to live up to unrealistic sales expectations, and there is very little opportunity for advancement in the sales department. Good job but not a good career long term."
good,"This job was hard work.  My day started with loading my truck at 3:30 am at the truck stop.  Then run the route then sometimes had to make run back to truck stop if route was too big for the truck that day, This was a seven day job.  Very hard work."
good,a good starting point as a maintenance mechanic. a lot of new automated equipment to work with.  pay is alright especially for entry level.  would recommend for entry level workers.
good,"Load bread truck make deliveries for various locations in Longview, Gilmer, Ore City, Diana, and Harmony TX.  Management didn't provide effective equipment until I had called 7 times over 3 months.  No co-workers as I was a route owner. Most enjoyable part of the job was little to no supervision, which allowed me to work more effectively. I sold two stops off my route, but was able to make up 3/4 of the income I lost from those two stops by having more time to effectively merchandise my remaining stops."
good,Very good place to work. Enjoyed the company hours. Co-workers work well together. Company well managed. RULES in company are always in forced.
good,"Very hot and busy!!!!!!!!!!!nice people.. lots of free bread. the hours are long but you can make good money. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the heat all day, most enjoyable is that you meet many nice people"
good,"Upon arrival at work, I print the load for the day, build each load for each stop, print out transfers, inspect vehicle, and depart for deliveries.  I deliver to all stops in Illinois.  At each stop, I pull all the stale product, get order for cake, and bring stock in to be placed on the shelves.  All items are checked in.  I am currently working a minimum of 14 hours per day.  When I complete all stops, I go back to the warehouse, and order items for the next week.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with customers."
good,If you are single it is wonderful great benefits and pay for location. If you have a family it is hard to deal with the drama
good,"Very rough working conditions dont reccommend the company to any body. Its A bakery its very hot ,long hours and too much management."
good,Terrible management communications. Production goals were often over met and rushed without proper management. Employees were unhappy at the management skills displayed on a daily basis. Poor work environment.
good,"Contributed to all phases of the production process, including the operation of"
good,Hard work. You will be very worn out and your sleep cycles will have to be completely reversed. It's definitely not a job for everyone. Most of the drivers and employees are very immature but that's to be expected. Don't work here if you don't have a thick skin.
good,Be ready for early hrs. lots of lifting and work 24/7 but good money can be made your independent so plan on that and you pay for all vehicle expenses. weekends are very done because you will work Saturday mostly guys work there you will be in charge of your orders product and hours. if you work hard and fast lots of money can be maid.it will take a toll on your body
good,"Flowers bakery bought out Kroger bakery in Memphis, TN. The working conditions were much the same as Wonder Bread in that the work place was very fast paced and there was miscommunications in management. The bigger percentile of coworkers had good attitudes and were hard working and easy to get along with. The hardest part about the work was also the fast paced environment of the work place, much like Wonder Bread. The best part about this job was also the free pastries. However, just like Wonder Bread this company also closed it's doors due to the lack of communication in management."
good,"good to work at the place"
good,"-excellent business"
good,"Most days are busy and can be stressful with getting in orders from the trucks that come from the bakeries and from the local distributors. Management is not the best, they do not offer the best schedules, they are not flexible. Very strict on certain rules to certain people even if they don't apply to everyone. You get really close with the people you work with, it does become like a family."
good,"The Company's profit sharing scheme was geared mostly toward Flowers leaving not enough meat on the bones for the I/O to do things like truck repairs, new tires pay taxes etc. Other than that it was similar to other DSD jobs that I have done in the past. Management seemed out of touch with what the I/O had to deal with on the market providing mostly late and incomplete promotion information. There also seemed to be a general disregard for promises made during the recruiting stage that played into the purchase decision but never materialized."
good,i enjoyed working here besides the fact it was 100 degrees in there. time flew by.
good,"worked in a very humid facility, 12 hour shifts, disrespectful co workers just nothing you would expect"
good,A typical day involved working in loud environment. The hardest part was the small details when processing the bread.
good,"Start up the line, make sure temp. are set correctly according to the product were running. Verify the products production is correct. My co- workers were always aggravated with the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 18.57 I was being paid a hour."
good,If hours could stay the same it would make it a lot easier job.
good,"It made me more responsible.On this job I became my own boss."
good,"Long production hours. I learned about the diffirent types of mixing,learned how too use several types of mixers use the SAP system proofing ,making sponges.The management was hard and fair to every one.The most enjoyable part of my job was too see a good finish product."
good,Your day started early in the morning. You come to the warehouse and load your truck. The rest of the day consists of going to each store on your route and deliver your products. At the end of the day you make a food order and unload your truck
good,A typical day at work was operating machines that sliced and bagged the bread before it goes to the shipping department.
good,It did not improve my professional growth outlook.
good,"very fun place to work,load and unload trucks,shipping out products,good team,friendly co workers,hours when no one showed up,co workers"
good,Flowers Bakery company of Jamestown will have you work crazy hours really no time off. No time to spend time with your family and have time to yourself. Work to get that bread out. Work what conditions are questionable there that's how I'm put it. Put overall pay was good benefits were good.
good,"This company will pay you well, but they will expect ridiculously long hours during the 3rd quarter of the year. If you need a good balance between work and life (especially if you have a family) don't feel like this particular company will be the greatest fit for you."
good,The So Cal Sales Team was very supportive. I do not believe the other divisions in the company were as supportive. It seems they were more concerned with their job security rather then overall company vision. They were ultimately right for being guarded because this company seemed to do things randomly.  I believe the headquarters in Georgia is out of  tune with the California Market and it's needs.
good,"had no time for relaxing ,we were always on the move from time clocking in to leaving very fast paced environment with all the ovens and timely issues of not having product ruined"
good,I packed bread into boxes and loaded into truck. I stood on a line and boxed bread. Once we boxed the bread we put it on a line and it got loaded up in tractor trailer trucks.
good,Management was great- especially if you performed you job. Clean atmosphere with opportunity for advancement. Encouraged continuing education and paid for it. Great company to work for/with. Workplace culture of collaboration and teamwork.
good,"Flower's did however gave me an opportunity get promoted from the inside, but however times that was in question. Currently facing a Civil Law Suite.."
good,"Just fine for people without kids or responsibilities, they make promises they don't keep and cut hours out of nowhere. They store in my area has had like 4 managers within a years and a half time."
good,Flowers is a good job to have.   It is physical work.  You can work at your own pace. The  customers are good to work with.  They do not provide paid vacations.
good,Flowers is a company that is growing rapidly.  This company provides a lot of on the job training for all levels of employment.  Flowers is in a nonstop industry of supply and demand and offers a wide variety of growth potential.
good,with the hrs you work you will need a much younger work force.  Benefits are great and supervisors are good and the fact that you rotate jobs is great
good,"It starts with poor training and after the first 90 days I realized the ""elites"" can get by with barely showing their faces where the work is while I'm expected to do it all or get written up."
good,"long 12 hour shifts, but pay is worth it"
good,"Not a bad place to work. Great benifits. Supervisors are ok. Break rooms have good food. Lots of walking in shipping, I walk about 14 miles a night..."
good,"Shipping off snacks to different sites and making sure the boxes have code dates on them. Majority of the employees were rude and nosey and that included the supervisors. The pay was good, you get paid every week, I wouldn't work there again!"
good,"Always weekend work, due to fresh baked goods. Work on holiday day but have day before holiday off, example: off July 3rd for July 4th holiday. Only thanksgiving and Christmas where they push to have off on actual day."
good,"depending on what area you get assigned to, you could make a decent amount of money and get time to spend with family. It could be a great place to work if you get assigned to a good territory."
good,"Working conditions vary by industry, establishment size, and specific duty. Most quality control inspectors work full time during regular business hours. Overtime may be required to meet production deadlines."
good,Making and producing quality product to the public. Operating the machine that packs and ships out the bread and roll that we make.
good,"Unloading breads out of a Semi Truck and sorting it all out inside a warehouse is your only duty nothing more nothing less."
good,"I enjoyed maintaining the safety of my workers, while making sure great quality was produced. I enjoyed helping someone if had any questions about the process."
good,"collect and stack wafers, run the lines, keep peanut butter full, cut wafers and send up the line. i learned to work as a team, how to run production, differnt 'names' of items and how to run each item, what weight they needed to be at and how to adjust the weights. The hardest part of my job was keeping the weights just right by adjusting the dough and temp of the wafers and the change in peanut butter. the most enjoyable part of my job was my 'team members'."
good,"Wake up early to start by 4 am.  Go load your truck and delivery to your stores.  When done to back to shop and unload your truck.   I learned that bread is not as light as it looks.  The Management worked well with you, if I need something they would try to take care of it.  Was on your own for most of it, it was just the stores your delivered to that I was in contact with.  You just took care of your stores so they would be happy with you.  The long hours was the hardest part of the job.  Meeting all the different people was the most fun."
good,It did not improve my professional growth outlook.
good,This job was very difficult as we worked 12+ hours per day receiving 20 min breaks every 2 hours. We often had to stay over without knowing before hand when we came to work and it was mandatory to stay.
good,Flowers is a great place to work if you are looking for good work experience and a stress free work place! Even though you work seven days a week sometimes it is well worth it!!
good,Job is fair.  If they come up with a better working schedule and more pay then it would be a very great place to work and advance in your career goals.
good,"In the maintenance department its a bit unorganized, hardly ever have the parts you need for repairs and very little training. If you haven't worked on the equipment before your told to figure it out with no or very little guidance. Most supervision even struggle to figure out the issues and if something goes wrong the blame game starts. As far as the benefits for the cost they are great and the retirement is the best I have had as far as company match."
good,I started in flowers foods in 1996 and owner_operator.I  have moved across the country to advance my career ..Then they restructured there management 1 yr later and I was told I would have to move again .and that's I pus
good,great pay but long 12 hour shifts 60 hour weeks in the summer.the place is felon friendly so that should give you a hint at the vibe of some of the people and the workplace culture here.
good,I just feel this job is only for someone who is trying to better themselves financially. I don't believe this is where anyone should retire from. Ok to get yourself started.
good,after I left Flowers I worked for an electrical contractors and I had the opportunity to see what the environment is like in other places of similar food production companies and can say they are definetly above average.
good,Bakery was a nice place to work. Staff was easy to get along with. Supervisors we're well in tune with their employees. There was a steady turn over rate which made nights difficult at times. There was plenty of chances for overtime and advancement.
good,"Flowers is a good company to work for. The pay and benefits are good as well, however it can intervene in your personal life. Working to many hours a day really takes a toll on the body."
good,Start out with a fast-paced pack out first thing then next prep the truck for loading and finally deliver to each client.  Able to take breaks periodically throughout the day.  Freedom to adjust start and finish time through speed and attention to details.
good,I love to work and I don't mind working but I love to work around positive people that get the job done. A typical day at work well that's in between because someday you have good days and some days you have bad days What I learn about working on a job is that you basically got to stay to yourself flowers bakery management is horrible they don't communicate with you period. the hardest part of work is working with someone that don't want to do their job. The most enjoyable part of work is working with someone that you're able to work with.
good,my typical day of work was standing up 8-10hrs a day at the end of an assembly line waiting on bread to come down the line so i can box and load it on a pallet.....i learn how to wrap a pallet tight and stock boxes on them..my co workers was friendly and hard working for the most part .the hardest part of the job was catching up when we got behind..
good,The hours were long and unsupportive.  You done things to benefit the company but no recognition.  Load and unload trucks if which we cleaned and organuzed.
good,Good work environment if you have small hands Bring gloves because it is hot in there and you will get burnt If not careful and pay attention to what you are doing.
good,i learned how to run every job on the roll line and met a lot of wonderful people.The best part about working there was the people I worked with from day to day
good,It can be a fun place to work but new management came in and started off the wrong way I was there for 19 years and saw many come and go some don't know how to talk to people they have to realize we are grown men not kids
good,"Maintenance dept. was always busy. It's a high speed bakery, so if something breaks everybody has to give 200% effort until repairs are completed, (typical bakery)."
good,"Plan your stops daily beginning with the biggest to the lowest commercial account based on the demograhic and logistic location. Your day starts by separating your accounts, loading the truck and delivering until you complete your responsibility per client. Unload the empties, stales, and complete the ordering process, once completed your day is done."
good,The work is not bad. The company changes the way everything is done alot. Communication needs some work with upper management. You are an independent distributor.
good,Guaranteed 40hrs with possible overtime. Fast paced industrial environment where time management and critical thinking are needed.
good,"The job was good overall, especially training you how to operate new machinery. The co-workers were really friendly as well. The schedule is a bit off; especially on weekends since that seems to be the busiest time of the week."
good,overall job was fine. Hours were always until finished task was done. Had no problems with any co-workers
good,Good place to work but work too many and long hours always work week end that was mandatory.
good,"Long hours, machine brome down alot because pf constant usage. The maintenance crew did the best to keep them running. The overal job is stressful competitive and its extremely hot . Great benifits but alot of pettiness with management and employees"
good,The company is a productive fast paced place to work with varying hours and a constant flow of shipments. Coming in and out daily. To survive be ready
good,Company will not allow you to grow sale on your own. I never heard of trying to sale items that does not sell in your store. This only cause shrink and profit loss.
good,"The job is nice, but the training hand off is not. as to with any other job there are certain people who think that you are there to replace them and they will not provide the proper training for you to work with."
good,"Flowers baking co. was a very fast paced job, the job consisted of a lot of physical work. to maintain at this job employees needed to maintain steady speed with their hands in order to catch the bad bread and not mess the bread line up.. Overall its a good place to work."
good,Great place to learn how to grow your business. Flowers provides the tools essential for successful sales.
good,Flowers is a great place to work with great benefits.  I learned a lot about accounting in this position.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to sit alone and focus solely on your tasks for the day.  i enjoy working independently as well as with a group.  The hardest part of this job was the workload. I always completed my work but it was difficult at times.  I loved the work schedule and the environment. I didn't like the way the workers gossiped constantly and talked about everyone around them.  That is not professional and I do not feel like that is what your job is for.  I do not think anyone should be isolated or belittled and I did witness a lot of that with some of the supervisors. It was overall a good work experience
good,Over the top job performance enables job advancement. Always new challenging and learning experiences. Fast paced and quality focusing.
good,New challenges and new learning opportunities on a regular basis. Allowance for advancement with over the top job performance.
good,Co-workers were a little difficult but overall the pay and job duties were awesome. Great benefits also. I enjoyed the environment as well.
good,The long hours where a test of endurance although each day provided different andvancement opportunities by learning new things about each level of the job.
good,I didnt like work for this company because I kept doing the same duties everyday and I wanted to try something new but they told me I had to start off slow before they can teach me how to do a new dutie. And it was bored and slow all the time . And I try to stay there a little bit longer but I just couldnt do it.
good,Great place to work it has its up and downs like anyother job does but overall its a good place to start can move up in the company if you have a great work ethic and show them you wanna be there.
good,"Although this was a steady paycheck and opportunities for overtime, it was a continuously disappointing experience because management would make promises about improving quality of life issues such as time off and having two days together.   There is nepotism rampant here.  The lack of compassion for personal life is GREATLY missing within the management/leadership.  Morale continues to deteriorate due to unmet commitments to the people around benefits, schedule and advancement opportunities."
good,"This was a contract job that I owned and ran, but still a district Mgr. that oversaw everything. In my opinion the company as a whole is fantastic but local management did not have a full understanding of the business ."
good,Long hours with a lot of mandatory overtime. Do the same thing over and over. Really fast and stressful work. Really decent pay though. Ask yourself if it's worth never being home.
good,"Wake up at 4am, at work by 5am. Check product load, sort product load, load product onto truck, start paperwork. Drive to first account, check product levels, make order, gather order, check in order, stock shelf, leave account. Repeat till the end of day. "
good,Shifts started as early as four o'clock in the morning. The faster you worked the faster your shift was finished. Daily tasks consisted of delivering and selling bread products.
good,I've been here 2 years. I was hired through a temping agency and was on night shift. I was one of the fastest temps they have hired also I got onto day shift within a year.
good,Learned how to distribute product to local stores. The business aspect....self employed...was the hardest. I enjoyed the customers
good,"I enjoy working for Flowers but I have absolutely ZERO chance to advance. They refuse to pay any overtime regardless of how many hours you work. There is no lunch hour, no paid vacations, no sick leave. Honestly, if the company would hire me on instead of keeping under contract with a temp service I would stay until I retired.  It's a relaxed job and most nights im there alone doing the packout."
good,You work all the time in an industry that is satisfied with ruining families and marriages. You never stop working and your job is your life. You work for the distributors and for the company. The relationship between the two sides is broken and seems to be something that cannot be fixed.
good,Nice place to work they have a click of people that protect their own they play favorites but the pay is great starting out at 16.13 or something like that an hour
good,"hard paced , lot of lifting, the supervisor was not trained , hours i worked was in the early morning , by myself , loved the pay and benifits , the warehouse we worked in had no air or heat"
good,"good place to work if interested in operating your own buisness.if you don,t mind flip flopping pay and no benntfits hardest part of the job was the hours and inconsistant pay checks,most enjoyable part was the peaple all pulled together as team to get the job done.job consists of sales,delivery keeping track of inventory and rotating your stock to insure fresh sales always."
good,"Pack nd unpack items to be stocked on shelves in stocky rooms, warehouse, storage yard. Store items in orderly and accessible manner in warehouse, tool Responsible for stocking me pulling bread &snack cakes and baked goods on shelves at restaurants and grocery stores.alao , pull and check out of date product off shelves onto moving truck to take various locations for distribution"
good,"The pay is excellent but the hours ( split days off) are bad if you work graveyard shift."
good,"Get up at 2:00AM work until around 3:00PM. Go back out pull up your market, another 2-3 hours work. Repeat, forever."
good,I worked 16+ hour days with only Wednesday and Sunday off. The pay is decent but you have little.to no time to live and actually enjoy any of the money you are making.
good,"Overall, Flowers is fair. Just have to bring the plant up to speed with equipment for efficiency which could eliminate safety accidents, can help produce quality product."
good,I wish the management would be more interactive with their employees. Projects come slow and may take years to finish. It is an old company that is not up to par with technology.
good,"working at flowers was a great experience, i met alot of great people, hard working people. the pay rate was great and there medical plan was just as good. only thing i had a problem with at flowers was they tend to over work you at times, working 6 or 7 days straight for months, no time for family or outside life."
good,"Pretty easy, and you get a lot of movement on the job. Every store has different check in protocol, so it takes time to get used to it. Early morning hours but you get done early too."
good,Descent place to work put hourly employees run the show not management. Good employees get treated bad a bad employees get away with murder just show up to work and you have a job
good,clean and sanitize baking equipment (break down clean out and rebuild equipment)
good,"Open/Close store, set-up daily sales, stock and clean store, provide customer service, make bank deposits."
good,Its an alright place to work at.
good,Lots of traveling and meeting alotof new people. Introduce new items to maximize sales growth. I learned alot about building charactor and how to build a company. The hardest part of the job was the massive amount of hours to be put in but was well worth it. What I enjoyed most was learning more about the sales field.
good,Has great pay but no life. Certain supervision people will throw you under the bus. Others will really take care of you. Depending on the line you will work 13 days straight to 1 day off.
good,Flowers is a stable job with good pay besides. I learned a lot about operating machines as well as managing people. The benefits are also good. The job allows you to build relationships with people with diverse ethnicity. Only downside to the job is the various hours and schedules.
good,It’s a job we’re your the owner/operator and it’s a great work investment into your business and future and it’s a great place too work and enjoy your job
good,"An enjoyable place to work. Friendly and busy store. Favorite part of job is interacting with cutomers. Excellent work place environment and great manager, very easy to work with. Loved setting up products and displaying them for sale."
good,flowers was a fun exicitng place to work but it was a temp job and there was no job security. the hours where long and mornings where early but it came with the type job.
good,"I was a very hard worker. I also trained other employees, as well as being responsible for product being produced on time. I made sure my community had safe and efficient bread on time. I was friendly and obedient to my superiors at all times."
good,"as stated good work,must be multi- talented, too many bosses not enough workers, everything is njt must be willing to learn. can't be afraid of heights."
good,"The work environment is fast paced, demanding, punctuality and accuracy demanded and a must. Daily interaction with store managers, store directors and receivers."
good,Flowers Baking Company has honed my team working skills and leadership skills.  Management is supportive to our needs and is a growing company.
good,Loaded the fresh bread onto the delivery trucks or loaded the freezer for storage.
good,It's hard work but the pay is worth it. You get major hours and over you get your pace and routine down pact it'll me easier to get through a shift...
good,"It was a pretty good job overall, the pay was decent and u got as many hours as u wanted each week,sometimes too many. They have there picks like every place does. overall i don't regret working there."
good,"Make sure all ingredients are correct. Mix correct, Cook time correct ,Oven temp correct and everything comes out done correct. Before i leave make sure the next shift have all they need to keep everything running without stopping."
good,"Fast pace production, shift work, 3 shifts per day, good friendly environment, a lot of management changes, production environment is a little laid back maintenances is demanding in a lot of aspects, over all it's a decent place of work"
good,"a typical day is the loading and delivering product ,getting to develop a customer relations,you learn how to manage your time,the hardest part was the long hours seven days a week.."
good,"I was not at a Flower Foods Facility, I was a Route Operator. i cannot speak to their daily operations but if you can make the Route productive it could be a very good place to work"
good,"no time to sit here. this is a fast paced production facility. there are always chances to move up if you are willing to listen, learn and do what needs to be done. pay is fair with good benefits.."
good,A typical day would start about 5am. I would do store checks in my area for 4 or 5 hours then go back and turn in stale numbers for the pervious day. I learned how to manage people and my time. The hardest part of the job is being on call 24/7
good,This was my first job which taught me the value of work they are well organized and teach you all the aspects of the company you can learn to run your own route and make great money here it is very hard to get a route
good,"Have enjoyed working for this company, but become frustrated with the inability to move up without having to relocate. I am willing to commute, but that is not what the company wants."
good,Assured line had products needed for line to run smoothly. Work crew and management very easy to work with. Hardest part of job was working third shift.
good,"Good products, good promotions. They have added some really good lines in the last few years. The technology is improving. The move to multiple route ownership seems to be working for those that are interested."
good,Liked interacting with different people on a daily basis.. Good opportunities for advancement... Nice work environment
good,"I loved working here, but didnt let me aquire the amount of hours I needed to get full time benefits.  I loved all the people here at FBC.  They are all top notch at their jobs.  Very Godly people.  I just feel, like they as Christians should have reached out to me more.  Sometimes I feel like I was forgotten about.  I felt left out of certain admin get togethers sometimes.  I truly loved everyones spirit there though."
good,Great opportunity to excel as a career. Already have moved up in the company in less than one year. The ability to raise sales is there if your willing to make the effort.
good,good work atmosphere and great boss to work for the independence of being able to work with minimum supervision. a typical day consists of getting up early in mourning's and loading and checking load to get ready to deliver to stores. the hardest part of the job is getting started so early in the mourning. the most enjoyable part of job would be the early get off times and dealing with managers on there up coming adds
good,"I usually arrived around 2:30am and finished after 2:30pm, five to six days/wk. "
good,Its alright good place to work good people. I have learned a lot working at Flowers. You are always busy so that's a plus. Good management.
good,"The branch I worked for was my father's personal business, and so was not affiliated with other Flowers Foods distributors. I worked in the summer and during breaks in the rotation of stock and distribution of products to several stores. It was a small head start, but it taught me certain responsibilities, and as a result, I feel I could work in several other fields effectively. As my father's business with Flowers Foods is now discontinued, I no longer work there. But for anyone who may have a chance to work in another business of the same type, I would recommend it highly."
good,"A fairly good company to work for. Was given freedom to expand business, boost sales with opportunity ads on products. A physically demanding job, but worth the effort."
good,"Day started at 5:30am ended generally 5-6pm, longer on holidays, I stepped outside my comfort zone here, but the money was good, I learned a lot of new things in regards to the vendors side of retail, I gained a lot of respect for vendors and how hard they worked, I learned to drive, deliver and all others aspects of the vendors business, I drove the routes when the drivers were on vacation,  The Flowers Baking Company is a large successful business, they are aggressive and the product is good, the manager was very knowledgeable"
good,"Long work days."
good,"I like the warehouse because it was very busy work and always something to do. The work day usually consisted of stacking totes all day, finding products and putting them into the right box for shipping. Cleaning my station at the end of my shift."
good,I really like delivering bread to my customers and take a lot of pride in my work.  Knowing my customers depend on my knowledge of their needs is very challenging but rewarding.  My days are typically very long but time goes by very quickly.
good,I would set up the machines and make sure they were working properly. I learned a lot about how bread is made and packaged. Management was very good. my co-workers were great and taught me a lot. The hardest part of the job was to keep the bread flowing. the most enjoyable part of the job was the final product.
good,"Self starting work days, with multiple tasks. Allowed to continue food safety training and requirements for audits/auditors. Management was very supportive of the department and needed training of the employees. Co-workers we exceptional and made the work environment pleasant, which was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was to place items on hold or reject items due to out of range specifications."
good,The people are great. Fun To work on all types of stuff throughout the day
good,i enjoy it but no room for advancement. very productive company. alot of equipment to maintain. co workers are team players
good,"Loading,unloading trucks,and racking bread up in the freezer"
good,Flowers is a great place to work. The people are great but the training is non existent. You will definitely work a lot and and stress. Good Luck if this is your career choice
good,A lot of work with very little time for family or other activities. sometimes I went as much as 21 days without a day of and as far as the culture there most of the management have been working there over 30 years.
good,I loved Flowers Foods great opportunity to grow and take some to the next level. The work load was not strenuous on the body. The machinery was somewhat easy to work.
good,"Good Job, very stringent rules. The pay and benefits are very beneficial at times, but job security is one of the main issues. Lately the company has been going through transformations and there have been many faces to come and go."
good,Be prepare to spend long hours on your feet. Standing in one location with few breaks in between. A production line is about the focus on the product. Making sure product is not damaged or contaminated.
good,"long hours on some days, and extremely hot temperatures. alot of walking and potential hazards if you do not pay attention to what you are doing. not for those who do not like to be on their feet all day."
good,"Managment in the shipping department always tried to one up one another and back stab the other in hope to obtain the others position or gain favoritism. The employees on the dock or the production crew didn't seem to have those issues with each other u less it affected their breaks, otherwise, it was a pleasure to work with them."
good,"You control how quickly you get done each day and how much commission you make.  Harder you work to ensure fresh product, more potential for income.  A manual labor job."
good,Other than the daily commute from Tallahassee everything else was fine!  Plenty of free Flowers Foods snacks to go around and give you the needed sugar rushes you sometimes need in the afternoon.
good,"working the nights and the hours you get out can get though on you, if you had to work over time it made you want to quit. its not a job for everyone but if you willing to work its a good place to be"
good,"Good company to work for, good teamwork with the different departments. Working in the engineering feild is a challenge, which helps a individual develop his skills."
good,"-Theres a lot of standing and moving."
good,It was a good job had to work everyday. But if you got up early enough you could get done and enjoy the day. Only bad thing is there is no days off and no sick days.
good,Fast paced environment.  Very important job with great responsibility.  Very good group of people with high morals and standards.  Top of the line products.
good,It is a job where you never know if you get off on time or what days you will for sure be working. The management was pretty good and the job itself was nice just the way you didn't know if you had to stay over until last minute got aggravating.
good,"A typical day for me at Flowers is pretty much the same as any night. Its a production line making hamburger and hot dog buns. So all that really changes is the pan size and different speeds on the timing belts. I learned how to mix dough, divide it in to dough balls, and bake it into bread. Management is really good at helping you with any personal problems you might have. The hardest part of the job is the ever changing work schedule to fit the needs of the companies orders. Sometimes we work 60 hours plus a week or we may only 40 hours, all depending on the orders."
good,"Nice place to work, good pay and benefits, responsible vacation time and allowed sick days. Have to be available to work weekends and some holidays but overall a good place to work."
good,"on a day to day base enjoyed the people you worked with and you bonded with everyone."
good,The store is about team work as many other jobs are. This job is about one being on your other side to make checking and stocking faster to be a neat store. Finish up counting and cleaning together to be ready for the next day.
good,It is a great place to work. All of the jobs in the plant are not physically hard but they do require your attention to detail. The management is very versatile. Most of the people I work are great.
good,The members of the flowers team is always willing to train and help a new member become a good addition to the team. The factory is very efficient and a pretty good place to work
good,Machine Operator I maintained the oven control of the oven cooking bread I think this was a good job besides not really having anytime off.
good,12 hours shifts not rotating shifts. The different products use to make bread an buns work. Co-worker are nice to work with. The heat is the most hardest part of the job. The company picnic.
good,"I worked second shift which was from 4 pm to 12 am. I would clock in and take my assasigned spot on the production line and begin to place the product coming down the line into the trays so they could go through the machines to get wrapped in packaging.  It was fast paced and hard work but all the people I worked for and with were very nice. I really liked my job and looked forward to being there a long time but had to move back to my hometown suddenly for a family member needing my help. I learned how to push myself past what I thought my limits were and found a strength I never knew I had. The hardest part of my job was standing on a hard concrete floor in the same spot for eight to twelve hours a day. I enjoyed the people I worked with everyday, and the money I made."
good,"service grocery stores and resurants with bread products"
good,"A day would typically consist of getting up very early and preparing to run your route and service many stores. co-workers were a delight and the hardest part of the job was able to balance the long hours versus family life. Although overall the job was mostly enjoyable, the management lacked many things that made the overall experience anything short of enjoyable. They lacked core values that deal with family and morals that should put your wife and kids before anything. They always tried to put their jobs before their families."
good,"its was ok,long hour,what i learned watch ur on back.management,nasty. co worker want help u out,"
good,My time at flowers was fun and i really enjoyed the work place because it was always something new
good,"It’s a great place to work if you’re not going to get hired through a temp service. If you are hired through a temp service you can not pull your phone out on the floor like people who were not hired through temp services can. The job is pretty simple though and fun to do. You stock bread, count bread and snacks, count the drawer, etc. It’s a cozy job that can get bombarded with customers but gets super easy with time."
good,"Good place to work if you like a fast paced environment, with good  benefits. You will stay busy on the maintenance side of the plant, working on PM's and looking to improve efficiency."
good,"over all good place to work, if you dont have anything else you want to do .  the jobs are not well planed out, some people work way harder then others, and people seem to be out for themselves. little to no team work"
good,Friedly family oriented company with great benefits and compensation I would recommend this company to someone who wants a job to retire from. This is a great company to work for.
good,"Great start to get your foot in the door to open opportunities such as healthcare, 401k, Pay. You Just need to go to work to get a paycheck. Keep to yourself and get your foot foward."
good,Would work for them again if a job was available close to my home! Good pay and a good benefit package! Original Bakery was bought by Flowers and then closed down 12 years later!
good,"bake and deliver fresh bread daily, so no weekend life, but good pay for the area. management accomodates vacation days as best as possible. your job is easy only if you work as a team."
good,"The overall work environment is pleasant. My co-workers are very insightful and helpful when help is needed. It's strenuous work that requires a lot of physical labor, but for the most part, all of the people that I have encountered really seem as though they care about upholding the tradition with the company. I am looking for an opportunity to advance and move forward."
good,A typical day at work involves excellent communication skills with team members to produce excellent quality products. Learned numerous skills with various products. Mixed work culture. The hardest part of the job was working double 12 hour shifts in extreme heat. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning multiple skills and receiving recognition for a job well done.
good,Ran mixer or I would be on the line getting doughnuts off of it I learned how the bakery makes all their doughnuts friendly management as long as you did your job .Overall everyone was friendly and very helpful when needed .The hardest part of the job was when the doughnuts come down the line and you had to box them up really quick and the most enjoyable was doing the mixing it kept you really busy but was fun to do
good,I have learned the importance of customer service and meeting the needs of customers demands through the many types of product's we provide.
good,"An enjoyable job for the most part, however the negatives outweigh the positives. "
good,"Paperwork was heavy and processing it was very tedious.  Busy day, every hour was full of things to do.  Receptionist job was fun."
good,"I enjoy working with my boss and the people on my shift. I also enjoy working with the production people and supervisors. I like to do the very best job I can for those I work with and for. I feel that Flowers Foods is a good company to work for and has good benifits. I do not like working my current shift, midnights and every other weekend. I would prefer to work Monday-Friday day shift."
good,"Flowers Foods is the distributor of famous brands such as Nature's Own, Sunbeam, and TastyKake."
good,It is a great job as long as you are under the correct upper management personal.  The coworkers are better laid back and fun to be around
good,It's a great place to work as long as you have a good boss. I like helping customers and distributors increasing business.
good,I would recommend this job to people willing to work very hard for their money. It is one of the largest bakeries in the country so the job security is great.
good,good job with good money to make fun people to work with and good management
good,"On a typical day, I will arrive to work at 6:30am.  Briefly check any new business email.   Then, visit around my distribution center with my six sales representatives before they leave out on their daily routes.   I will then proceed to update the office calendar with upcoming sale promotions and analyze the previous days sales and make sure that my representatives have ordered sufficient product for the upcoming week.

good,"Assist with problems, or issues."
good,"Where do I start!? Flowers of Birmingham was a pretty good company when I worked there. The bagger machines and lematics are out dated, management was ok at times. Pay was decent, a lil more money and I would’ve stayed."
good,This was a good job for me in my younger years. The pay is good and the benefits are ok. The main drawback to this job is the heat. Its a bakery so the temp reached as high a 120 degrees Fahrenheit
good,"I am 17 years old and still in high school. I come from split parents and stay with my mom full time trying to get another job to help her with things. I’m very big into sports, rather it’s playing or watching. I plan on attending college after I graduate and going to law school. My home situation is hard right now and I need money at this moment."
good,it was hot tiresome fast paste job the co workers were great management was ok at time seem like a bit of attitudes around but for the most part very good and straight forward hardest part is dealing with with the heat and the crazy hours leave limited family time if your a big family person but great benefits and a good learning experience
good,Flower's is an excellent place to work if you do not mind working a lot of hours and six to seven days a week.  Great pay and benefits and advancement opportunities.

good,Strong company with very committed management.  Difficulty lies in aligning independent distributors with company goals.  This conflict in goals/expectations creates too much conflict and stress when trying to meet company goals and customers expectations.
good,I have been happy in my current job for over 34 years but of late they have made big changes going from a regional style of management to a National style through the services of Accenture.  With this the company has lost the family focus that it has had for last 97 years to one that is looking to change from experience based and loyalty to one that just wants someone to fill a position for a cheap salary.
good,"Everyday can be challenging. It just like any other work place, you have good days and then you have your bad days. The only thing you have to get use to is the heat. We have two oven cooking bread and buns non-stop. But what can i say, I'm losing weight everyday."
good,A good place to work with opportunities for advancement. This is an excellent position for those who would prefer a more planned work space with little to any change in the environment.
good,good group of people (in the roll department at least) great operators who know their stuff even if others claim they don't know anything. they give you plenty of time to train if you want to.
good,I liked the job it was easy and fun but it did not work with my job of being a mom it takes up to 6 months to get full time so you work as a temp agent which means that if your child gets ill at any point with in the 6 months before u get full time u lose your job or have to wait longer to get full time. Good coworkers just bad corporate policies that does not allow for a better full time hiring process which would be better for those who are mothers or fathers and sometimes have to miss a day or two of work for their ill child.

good,Good place to work.  Was very good to me and my family when my kids were young. I was expected to work sometimes while on vacation and/or Holidays.  Bonus program could be better and pay needs to be more competitive.  My department allows flex time but sometimes at the expense of pay raises.

good,Its a decent working environment. Just extremely hot in the summer. The annual raises are nice but now looking for something a little less stressful on the body
good,As a distributor for flowers you will work with stores and deliver bread on a daily basis. Ordering properly is key to success as too much waste will be deducted from pay. One downside as being independent is no benefits are given from company.
good,Great people to work with. It has changed a lot in the last year and it isn't as worker friendly as it was when I was first employed there. Might want to consider that!
good,I know the hours are long and very stressful people but can get eachother day in and out. People adjust to the life or they force out. Regardless of the way life you live. Stay yourself for especially and everyone around you.
good,"A typical day at Flowers Food, I would start the mixer after management had made the brew and flush the pipes out with the liquids from the brew. You begin loading up ingredients for the dough.

I worked 60-70 hours a week for 2 months and then then the routes began to be sold and hours dropped to less than 30 a week.   So I would recommend that if this is a jb for you, then buy a route the pay is great if you work hard."
good,"Pay was reasonable"
good,"I started out with abm(workforce agency). Working at Flowers bakery,,, the work is hard,the hours are long , the workers complain about everything except the pay check and that includes me too..lol... It's a great place to learn the bakery industry, Management encourages  cross training in many areas,  after a year I was finally promoted to a full-time production technician  position  and i loved it. But FAMILY life was falling apart... so I put my two week notice in and moved to Las Vegas.. I miss the friendships/teamwork when it seems like nothing is working right,, I had a lot of laughs... it's  hot and you gonna sweat... but hey!, I lost 30plus pounds and feel good.... it's production.... gotta produce... some can hack it,,,some cant... overall ,, it was a experience I will never forget...."

good,"A typical day at work was filling work orders, making necessary repairs to machinery, doing PM's on production lines, coolers, and machinery. I learned more from on hand experience, as I worked alone most of the time. Most of my co workers were helpful, assertive, and took initiative, while others required more training.

good,"Flowers is a great place to work. It is a team work environment, as it should be. What I do not like, is, my shift, and room for advancement. My shift is 12 hours night shift. Saturday-Tuesday. This is a hard shift for a father of two sons. I do not get a full day off to spend with them during the school year. I have hired in with no room for advancement. With my Navy past it is embedded in me to always strive to advance, and better myself as well as better serve the company."

good,A typical day at this work place can be very physical with occasional stress due to the nature of the task at hand.I've learned it really takes a combined team effort to make a quality product.

good,"the best part of the job is the pay and the benefits. Years ago it used to be more family oriented but when the economy started suffering they cut back on certain things like full bonuses, company picnics, safety bonuses, steak dinners-cut back on ALL of these. And the crazy thing about it is that sales went up! The company continued to be more profitable despite the so called ""ailing economy"" but I guess they were just saving for a rainy day. But we did continue to get raises each year and the job is no that demanding. If you can get pass all the stuff I spoke of above then Be my guest, apply its a good place to work."

good,had a great boss and really enjoyed my time at Flowers. Overall it was a great experience
good,"Flowers bakery was a ""sweets"" factory where I was on the ""cake"" line. The best part of the job was the fact that we rotated positions throughout the day. Even though it was mostly packing, we (employees) would switch what they were packing the donuts into. It kept us paying attention and on our feet which for me was perfect. "
good,I make sure that everything weighs up and has the right amount of mix. I also put the mix into the machine where the dough will come out right and ready to serve to the public and I also make brew weigh-ups.

good,"Good Atmosphere, Fun Place to work if you enjoy working by yourself and meeting new people. Very physical job and can be very hot or cold depending on the weather conditions. This is mainly a delivery job unless you work at the bakery."
good,Hey I just want to have a chance to work through y'all company I am a good worker and want stop till the job is done.. At this moment I work two jobs.
good,"I load up 18 wheeler trailers full of carts of bread .For other companies and stores,locations, Unload trucks for inventory for re-stocking..for batter."
good,"It was a very hard job to keep the walmart customers happy.Walmart manager kicked me out and wouldn,t let me back in so I couldn,t afford to pay help"
good,"Distributors are being treated better then ever since the company faced lawsuits. "
good,"This was a very nice place to work for.  Sometimes things got a little stressful but otherwise I enjoyed the people that I worked with and for, we moved thousands of loaves of bread in and out as weel as cake products on a daily basis."
good,"Had the opportunity to work with all team leaders, store resets, training, building displays, working with new customers everyday in several locations."
good,"A typical day at work was to open the store, put product on shelves and greet customers and sell the product as much as we can in one work day. The faster it goes, the better. I definitely learned how to deal with the public, and build a friendship with reoccurring customers, I thoroughly enjoyed that part of my day. Management is fantastic. My supervisor was very understanding and encouraging, that we were able to establish a friendship aside from work. I absolutely loved my co-workers as well, which was also a good friendship. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was trying to clear out the warehouse by the end of the day. Overall, I loved working here!"
good,always ran smooth and everybody stayed productive. everybody got along with each other but the only bad thing about the job is that people would have to work at least 1 to 2 years to get hired on.
good,"Great job, great coworkers, benefits, insurance. I left a great job and would be more willing to apply again. There wasn't nothing to like about this job."
good,"I load all the bread on the truck at the warehouse in the morning. I ride along to all the stops (Sams, Wal-Mart, Publix, etc.) unloading the truck and taking it into stores stocking shelves, swapping out old bread for new bread. After all stops are complete for the day we go back to the warehouse and unload the truck."
good,Day to day I communicate with several customers from all over the US. I've learned to value customer service skills and maintain a positive relationship with each individual. My co-workers are very down to earth and understanding. We are all treated like family and put faith in our work environment.
good,I love my co-workers and the management staff a very loving environment . I learned how to watch for defects in the bread and the machines.
good,"weekly inventory, daily orders and unloading of ingriedient and packaging trucks. data entry...operate forklift on daily basis and ,maintain clean work area"
good,i loved working at flowers foods but the expenses got to be to much also working seven days a week got hold  also i had to pay for my own benefits never got a vacation in seven years so that is why i decided to leave flowers foods.
good,Great Management style and great co workers to work with. I learned a lot about the business process of the company

good,great job with tons of benefits and plenty of hours to go with the job titles wish I was on permenatly but i got on through an agency
good,I enjoyed working for there company I learned how to do a lot of different things and expand my work ethic
good,"A typical day at work, I might have to climb the cat walk to get pans/lids unstuck. Learning  that baking bread is not a straight standard procedure. Working hand and hand with others is very exciting because we have different ethnic groups and getting to know one another is enjoyable. The hardest part about working here is working 7 days straight before we get a day or two off. Management here is ok."
good,"I would load up my truck first thing in the morning, then make my deliveries to the various stores.  I learned how to make accurate orders for the various stores. The management were great to work for.  Being at work at 3am was the hardest part. Being on the road was the best part of the job"
good,"Planning and analyzing production, to make decisions with minimun supervision, identifying and resolving procedures problems by designing solutions."
good,"However it's feels outside that's how it feels in the Warehouse. It's completely equal, no direct management, no set time for lunch break, it's an open easy work environment"
good,"average 12 to 14 hrs. a day"
good,Work on daily bases was fun. always kept busy from opening the store to closing it and depositing the money. During the day we had to check in the vendors to stocking the bread in their respective place to serving as a cashier.
good,"A typical work day at the bakery consist of operating the cash register, restocking the shelves and checking in the drivers."
good,"I didn't have any issues, due to me being a self motivated individual. My supervisor worked hands on with me when needed and fellow employees worked together for the sake of the job and the team. Was terminated yesterday(August 15, 2014) due to the Chief Engineer wanting to free up some space on the night shift. Letting go 4 of 5 engineers, keeping only 1 hourly and 1 supervisor. We were wrongfully terminated but what's done is done. The guys had 20 years, 18 years, 3 years, 1 year, and are now all unemployed. Besides that, I loved my job because it gave me the opportunity to challenge myself daily."
good,"Here I started as a pick and stage employee and eventually moved to the Flex Shift. I get the routes ready for the drivers to take out of the building. I also assist in Crash sort, small sort, directing the drivers to their location, and resetting the building after everything is done. Amazon is by far the best job I've ever had. I definitely intend to advance here and retire here as well."
good,"Very competitive market"
good,"A wonderful place to work for many years. When our company decided to hire an outside business group to run our company, it changed drastically and immediately. I was one of over 700 people whom were cut by the workforce reduction."
good,"-wake up pretty early around 3am to be at the warehouse by 4am"
good,When I get to work we have a five minute meeting. We overlap from the previous shift. We make adjustments when needed to the machines and the recipes.
good,Management cares and helps with employees requests and needs.
good,"Job pays well actually better than most but, the job labor itself is tiring. Most of the time Especially in the summer time the heat and the work will break you down."
good,"Flowers Foods is fast pace.  As a Production Technician I was required to keep records of metal detector checks and paperwork which was required from various Companies such as Burger King, Walmart and Arby's."
good,The work environment is very loud. Work during the summer can be exhausting because there is no a/c and it gets extremely hot. Overall fast paced everyone is kept busy. Pay is great. Barely anytime off especially holidays
good,Love the job and pay but hated the long hours sometimes. We had a start time but no definite ending time. The plant was extremely hot during the summer months. Couldn't ask for a better management team from top to bottom.
good,"It's like buying into the company,  managing your truck, your accounts, your store displays, and your bread orders"
good,"A typical day at work would include processing customer transactions via cash register, calculator, etc and assisting customers with large orders. This job also includes checking in 10 bread routes and stocking. Since my employeement with this company, I have learned the process for product rotation, excellent customer service skills, and how to effectively be a team leader. The most challenging part of the day is trying to get the remaining stock put out before quitting time"
good,This job at Flowers was very laid back. A typical day included me going through and filing papers. My supervisiors were really cool and understanding. There wasn't a hard part to my job... unless you count working late during the holiday trying to get all the work done so you could be off. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to conversate with the people I worked around. I loved my job there.
good,I took pride in my job. I was proud to put on the uniform every day. I would like to work there again one day. Good benefits. Great pay. all the overtime you could want
good,it's a good company to work for they also you have to keep your area clean also when you work on the line you have to keep your line or you're working at you have to keep the area clean and continue to keep your eyes on the line when you running your grade also have to keep your backups going where you can be where you can put your bread into the bank and then wants to go into the bank what it does it go into a big old tree in the tray filled up with 16 train going to come off in off the machine and go on the line
good,It’s a very laidback job. The pay is very well for the area with good benefits. There’s a lack in communication with management and never a set schedule
good,I started with Flowers foods as a Sales Generalist. The company prefers to promote for advancement within. The company provides great benefits along with 401K.
good,"No place for a family man. Hours are crazy. Work all three shifts in one week. Work every weekend, every holiday. Too many supervisors on one shift to report to. Almost impossible to make 40 hours in one week with 4 active shifts"
good,They were a great team to work with.Always ready to help and look out for each other. I would refer this to others without a doubt. This company is big on Family and workers as a whole.
good,a typical day of work requires on the spot quick decisions .diagnosing and repairing break downs quickly and accurately. facing challenging  and typical problems through out an 8 to 10 hour shift
good,Great company that treats most of its people well. In the sales department as a route driver or manager you can expect at least a 12 hour day of hard work and pleasing customers. As a manager you can expect to work even on your vacation. No joke
good,I learned how to operate machinery and drive forklift.  Learned how to learn things really fast.  The pay is good.  Often overworked.
good,"of course this review is years old. When I was there it was a great place to work, but I was a mechanic, so it may be different for other occupations. It was a great company to work for, we did have a problem years ago with finding good talent. Overall 5 stars"
good,"I started my work day at 7 am and worked until 6 pm or after. The hardest part of my job was dealing with micromanaging.  We had a lead, a supervisor and a manager.  It was nice to be able to listen to my music all day."
good,My overall experience was great I had great co-workers and a good boss.
good,"Arrive at work 30 min early, got orders, set up machine, check shipping to see what trailer were available, check to see what person come in, checked quality of product"
good,My work day is typical slow.
good,"I stocked the shelter keep everything clean, I really loved the job was very upset when the closed. I had a great boss."
good,"Very good company with great benefits, employee incentives, however the management was lacking at times in my location. Overall a great company though."
good,"I love this job,but it wasnt a set schedule. Its a easy job to do,thats if you like working in the heat"
good,my duties are to provide my customers there orders in a timely manner with the right amount of product to carry them until there next delivery. also to provide fresh products.
good,Great workplace and environment. Very relaxed and easy to work for.I really enjoyed being manager at this establishment. I was allowed to make decisions on my own using my own descretion
good,"long work days . I learned about burners,  Management was helpful, the work place was great  the pay was slow and only one a year the benefits were go ."
good,"This was a great competitive place to work "
good,"Repaired delivery trucks"
good,"I worked as an engineer for flowers baking company on 3rd shifts. "
good,"Flowers Baking company is an excellent place to work."
good,"At flowers you will gain experience in conveyors, electrical photo eyes, 3 Phase 208-480 V wiring, milling, lathe, PM work and welding. However, it takes 3-5 years to get a chance at a day shift position. This is the only reason I can not work at Flowers. Great people, and a great job if you are single and do not have a family life."
good,A typical day is going in and stocking and getting ready to open for the public. We all try to work together to get things done. I Enjoy meeting different people that come into our workplace. Sometimes there is lack of communication with Management that makes things difficult.
good,working hours are horriable bad communication from mangement micromangement
good,Great company to work for. i loved everything but the pay. great place to learn if that what you like
good,"come in check my bread order, load the truck, then I went to whatever stores I had to deliver to that day fill the racks. go home then come back around 5  to all major stores pulled up all my product one more time for the day"
good,"•Audited multiple receipts daily or accuracy before posting"
good,Great Opportunity to explore new skills.  Friendly staff............................
good,Owning a business was a good experience. This makes you realize how important the little things are in everyday decision making.
good,"We have very knowledgeable leaders some are new but you can get an answer from someone."
good,It was very fast work but once timing is established then it does seem to slow down in which in turn makes for a very easy but boring job. The pay rate compensate for such
good,Absolutely the best company around. You receive everything you get that you put into this company. Great people and a wonderful team. Plan to stay if you invest in them.
good,This is a very good company to work for especially if you want to be a small business owner. The product that they put out is great I do have opportunity to grow with this company
good,"great place to work"
good,"I would rate this a good work place, also I have learned kronos,sas,leadership ablilitities. The culture of the work place is fair. The hardest part of my day, not having enough trays to continue running the operation. The most enjoyable part of my day is when all product was finished being shipped early."
good,"I only worked here on contract. Management was great. I obviously had no benefits, but the pay was good and the people were enjoyable. I would go back in a second if the culture were still the same."
good,"At Flowers Food You'll learn to work almost independently.  The work is tough sometimes as you "
good,Great company and plenty of opportunities to advance. People looking for a fast pace challenge this is the choice. Learning to thrive under pressure is a must. Solid company with family values.
good,"I enjoyed working here because everyday you learn something new. There was a lot of great teamwork as well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with fluctuating temperatures and humidity, and the most enjoyable was making others laugh even through hard times."
good,my current job usually keeps me busy. once the trucks arrive with the product my work time goes by fast. The employees are good and get their job done.
good,typical day at work ranges from working on water chillers dough mixers bread oven bread baggers conveyors etc i learn new things from day to day as i am new in food industry management is great the hardest part of job is the night shift having young kids at home great people to work with
good,Management is easy going and responsive to suggestions. Quick and easy work days. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part about the job is the ever changing schedule.
good,"long hours with great pay and even better benefits.. "
good,A typical work day was busy and long consisting of 12 hours. I learned the production and distribution of products. Management was something that could use more training. Co-workers were fun and interesting to work with. The hardest part of job was major breakdowns taking long to make repairs. The most enjoyable part of the job was company activities and rewards for years with company.
good,My typical day at work is stocking the shelves with bread and cakes and helping the customers.  My boss and my coworkers are great to work with.
good,Work in rotations all day. I learned how to be fast and efficient with packaging product. Management always asked for extra work to be done. Co-workers were really nice. The hardest part of the job was cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was the working environment.
good,a place where safety is a must but the pay and benefits are great managers tend to stay out the way and let the employees do their jobs
good,"No issues at all..company is a great place to work "
good,"Wonderful place to work."
good,Good Company to work for. Sometimes long days . Benefits are good
good,"If you want to work hard and build equity in a business quickly, Flowers is a great place to be your own boss!"
good,"Working there as a dock worker is a great job.you get trained very well on how to properly perform ur job. Managers are great ppl to work for. Everyone working there has good attitudes and everyone does there part or ""job"" allowing it to be organized and clear on wats needing done"
good,I loved working at flowers because they gave me a chance when no-one else would. They have a good team of managers and everyone gets along. Breaks are on time and everyone works together on getting job done
good,Working at flowers is a great experience for me.  I was snle to learn about production and to operate certain machines and learn about the food baking industry
good,"This is a great job. Coworkers are extremely helpful and management is always available for you. The hours aren't too bad. You may have to randomly take over part of another person's shift or come in early. Work starts as soon as you clock in, unless the schedule is running a particular product at the time that doesn't require your part. At that point, you'll have a ""break"" to get other things in order like paperwork and to clean up."
good,"I loved working there, always got answers to my questions and always got help when asked. The hardest part of the job is when you start because you don't know the route but once you learn the route it became easier."
good,"learned a lot, trained in a lot of areas. you have to be willing to work and learn to move up. Its a great place to work if you make it. Meaning be happy, and smile and have a positive attitude and then great opportunities will open up for you."
good,"At Flowers Foods the culture is great, and it is a exrememly positive environment. It is tough work but the benefits are great and the employees are there for you."
good,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews listed and wanted to put in my 2 cents. 2 of the 3 reviews were from Sanitation, contract labor, not even a part of Flowers.  I've worked for the company for 8 years and if you want a full time steady, stable job making great pay and excellent benefits - then Flowers is the place for you!!"
good,"Great company that has changed alot over the years.  Loved working and helping employees with all there Human Resource needs:  training, compensation, benefits, COBRA, FMLA"
good,The best part about my job is the hours and working conditions. I only have to work until the load is done and still get paid for 40 hours even though i only work 15 a week. Best part is working alone...i know the job will be done with 110% accuracy and in a quick manner.
good,"Very good company to work for.  Excellent benefits, great culture.  Lots of potential for up ward mobility.  Great culture that is based on employee input."
good,Always love the day to day task in the bread Buissness on constantly trying to sell the freshest products based on people bing patterns from week to week
good,working with Flowers Baking Co was rewarding  They are family oriented and show genuine concern for their employees Flowers is a good company with excellent benefits
good,This is a great company to work for . The work can seem hard but you'll get the hang of it. Long hours are required in this business...but well work the pay......
good,This has been a great company for me to grow with. I have learned lots of things as far as management and production of perishable product is concerned. Management has been helpful and knowledgeable along the way. I would say the most demanding aspect of my job would be the scheduling which was ok for me for a while but as my life has changed it has became more demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the finished product and having the satisfaction of knowing that i had a part in producing something at its highest quality.
good,Good work place. A big company with a lot of opportunity to move up in the company. Worked a lot of nights and weekends. But they were flexible if need be.
good,"Its was the coolest and friendly to work at flowers Baking Co. What I learn that how to stack bread in trade and stack it up. Then move up to the oven. Now the oven, I have to put the dough in the pans and put sheet on top and put the other dough, and on etc.. put in oven. The hardest thing is we had to stand on feet and work with hand and move our feets for whole hours. Most enjoyable moment is you get to know the people that I work with. Have break and take my lunch. Enjoy the job I work was coolest."
good,Route sales require you keep a positive attitude and understanding because you work with the public and have to promote your product along with promote yourself. Pay is based on commission so you have to hustle or blame yourself if pay isn't satisfactory. The bread industry is a product that is guaranteed to sale if the distribution and time schedule of the individual are consistent
good,"Great company very strong and aggressive in the market place, very interesting type work and Great Management . Job is very demanding with long hours however there is a reward of great pay and fellowship with other salesmen"
good,"Operated bread wrap machine, was responsible for quality control in bread plant."
good,"Enjoy working for company, unfortunately not enough hours available."

good,The work is great. People worked together to make work easier and faster and the pay was also great for the work I did. And made great friends and coworkers
good,You'll be training with awesome people who understand the nervousness and not catching on right away. It's an awesome family like atmosphere that will help you grasp the tools you need to be successful in whatever position your training for.
good,Good pay great supervisors  enjoyed working  there very much always chances for hours great pay.                                                     .
good,"The only down-side to working at Flowers Foods Inc, was the shift work. I began on second shift, advanced to a leadership position within second shift, but ended up taking night shift in order to advance further. The advancement opportunities are excellent and the balance between ""by the book"" and ""we're all human"", is very fair. That said, working night shift was very hard on my health and my family life. I only left flowers because I needed to change states and there were no management positions open in my new state. I would be delighted to work for Flowers Foods Inc. again, but only on 1st shift."
good,"My experience at Flowers was really dynamic, this was the perfect job for me  my experience in shipping and receiving, order pulling, machine operation was a plus in my field"
good,I started out at flowers foods 8 years ago learnt as much as I could and moved up into supervisor position the people I worked with was great people I had to move or I would still be there unfortunately there's no flowers near where I moved
good,"My day starts when I get to work at least 15min to an hour early, walk the dock to ensure previous supervisor on duty has everything up to par before I take ownership. Then I look at the schedule for employee placement. When my team arrive we do stretches and talk about safety everyday for 10mins. Then everyone goesto work periodically I walk the dock to make employees are following procedures"
good,"Overall, the opportunity to learn and meet many co-workers. The opportunity to work with different departments within the company made it interesting. The development of all departments and how we all worked together to all reach a common goal. Our mission was to produce quality product and ship at the lowest cost possible."
good,"Flowers food was a great place to work"
good,i worked 60+ hours a week but got paid very well. people were nice and trained me well. The only reason i left was because of conflict with another employee but you'll find that at any job.
good,Honestly everyone has their own work pace and things to do. As long as the distributors are doing what they need to get done at a fast and productive pace then i would usually have an easy day. Everyone has to be on top of their game and have everything ordered correctly. Not a difficult job just a time consuming one.Pays great and benefits are good.
good,"Working at flowers was a  good environment ,and everyone got along just like everybody was family ,working at flowers give me a good experience, I'learn how to  run a machine, I was machine operator ,a forklift driver and I moved around on the plant to learn different job and I really love doing different things on the job it was a good experiment for me and I really did enjoy."
good,Flowers Foods is an amazing company. Great benefits and great environment. You could not ask for a better workplace. I have learned so much. The possibilities with this company are endless.
good,Productive and well balanced work environment great benefits one of the largest baking company in America with various locations lots of opportunity to excel and move up in the company also has great management.
good,"good environments and fun job, learn allot about technician position, the management was acceptable, culture respectable people, work place culture was very good, the hardest part of the job was when the machine were stop working, the most enjoyable part of the job was making more friends and team work."
good,Complete Orders and Load Products For Shipment. Management doesn't bother you if you know what your doing and doing a good job. pay is great. lots of opportunity to move up.
good,I worked there for ten years. Really enjoyed the people there. You're the boss of your own business. A lot of hours involved but very lucrative. I recommend it.
good,It is hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It has it's moments like every job. But I love my flowers family...we have safety contests shift meetings where they give out prizes we get together 2 times a year just to be together family fun day and health day. We have dinners steak & fish. We do a lot together as a *family*. I love the people I work with and the atmosphere.
good,"Flowers was a great place for me to expand my knowledge on metal fabricating, welding, and machining. Also helped with electrical knowledge of food machinery. Learned how to work as a team with other maintenance men. Was offered supervision but did not accept because i had always had plans to relocate to the Knoxville area."
good,Load trailers using a two wheeler resulting in no injuries.Organize and stack bread in the proper place.Verify that everything was on the truck that was supposed to.
good,"Making sure I'm always 2 steps ahead all the time in order to stay ahead."
good,"It was in a warehouse building ,and the hours would change sometimes so there wasn't a set time on when to work.MY co workers were all very nice and everyone got along with everyone there."
good,A typical day at Flowers consist of making several batches of bread at 100%. I would throw the ingredients inside the mixture and then would operate the KRG to make the bread. My loafs would come out consistently right and perfect. I learned how to operate these machines in a matter of a week. The managers were tough to strive for the perfection but I enjoyed the pressure to be the best. I am also in the process of learning engineering with the company. A buddy of mine does that line of work and shows me new ways on fixing the equipment when it messes up. The hard part is when the machine go down it sets us back. But I enjoy helping with the repairs because it allows me to know my machines more and will help me in the future.
good,too bad they layed me off thery were probably the best company i have found to date.yet so far
good,Wonderful company to have worked for. Started my career out with them and was thought a lot as my first place of employment. Good structure and management as well.
good,Great company all around. They treat everyone equally. Always make sure your working and great enviroment to work.
good,"Twisting bread was a back breaking job, that called for constant movement around the bakery. Even thou this was a hard task, the type of labor I rentained, has disciplined me push harder beyond my ability. I cherish this skill."
good,I had alot of people who would lend a hand when I needed it and it was always a positive environment I was always happy to learn new equipment because there is so much there you will not get bored with this company because they believe in moving people up who want to move up
good,Get plenty of hours but that's what I liked about it they go through a lot of people there but it's only because they don't like to work for the most part only a few just can't handle the fast pace but I like the fast pace because it makes time go by faster
good,"I was in this business since I was 15. I worked my way up to management. It was a good experience for me. It was fast paced, some days we were slower, but I made sure we all got our stuff done"
good,During the 6 years that I was VP of Sales we had record growth in sales and profits. I would call these 6 years the vey best years of my career with Flowers Foods.
good,Avery nice place to work. The compensation was great. There was plenty of chances  for overtime. I was a vacation person. I filled in for jobs of people when they were on vacation.
good,"You have to work your way to day shift but it is a very fulfilling job with great benefits packages. I would recommend anyone looking for a job to check them out and give them a try. Once your on, you can bid on better jobs."
good,Very good place to work. Great people. I learned to run all machines on this job. The other employees were fun to work with. Upper management always had a open door for anything you need to talk about. The only hard part about the job was how hot it is in there during the summer. Other then that it is a all around good place to work.
good,first job I ever had in sales. You can say this was probably the hardest job I ever had for about the first 6 months! But after that I would say this was what set my path to be in sales the rest of my work career.
good,"Job is secure, benefits are great, and management is very supportive. As long as you work hard and don't call in all the time, it is a wonderful and fulfilling place to work."
good,"I arrive at the warehouse at 4am five days a week load my truck with my inventory and than I set out and service as many as 20 accounts a day, including stores and restaurants.   I learned customer service is paramount to be a success in this business.  As a owner operator I learned to managed my time and resources effectively.  Developed strong relationships with other vendors I came in contact with.  The hardest part of this job is ordering product levels for fluctuating market.  Meeting people was the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Great place I learned a lot as far as Human Resources procedures. "
good,I enjoyed being self employed I only sold the route because the value had increased a lot from the purchase of wonder bread. Even though I worked everyday my hours varied . I ended up having most of Wednesday and Sunday off.
good,"Work day starts at 8:00 AM.  Review any production issues that occurred during the night time unless it was critical and the on call person would have handled it.  Once all production issues are handled, then trading partner maps, envelopes, and codelist are created and worked on for the trading partners that are in your work list.  Any team member that has questions comes to me to find out how to do the task they are working on.  The job some times challenging figuring out issues but I would not say it is hard.  I enjoy the people and work atmosphere."
good,"Great company that cares for the employees and contractors. Company is laser focused on the longevity and a profitable future. Holds each employee accountable, while also providing the tools for success. "
good,"A good place to work. family oriented, there are many chances for advancement. Nice pay and good customer service, you get to work with some great people."
