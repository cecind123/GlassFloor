rating,review
bad,Empresa sempre privilegia sempre as mesmas pessoas. Pouca chance de crescimento e desenvolvimento. Alta rotatividade principalmente de consultores. Gestores nada imparciais.
bad,"This company can't keep employees because of the workload and lack of hiring more people to help out. They don't pay enough, your raises are poor, and you have the leads and supervisors who have no backbones. The hours are not flexible and the way they give you your sick and vacation time is ridiculous 2 or 4 hours a month is nothing because it takes forever to accumulate. Keep looking."
bad,GREAT JOB. The managers was great. the people was too. No hard parts of job very easy. you would love to work there they have more then 3 shifts.
bad,"The department you DO NOT want to work in is Partner Support, this manager is not experienced, she is the Directors friend. They will bully you into submission, micro manage you to the point of reading your emails.  Lot of work for a very pathetic rate of pay that is so far below the industry standard it's laughable. Just don't bother you will wish you didn't"
bad,"Glad I'm not there! High turnover, politics, unfair! Don't bother taking initiative, won't get recognized! Especially with AP manager, she'll get threaten by you and block you from success!"
bad,Hostile work environment.  Will burn you out and then push you out.  Blame flows down hill.  High turn over.  You can expect to work multiple jobs and be expected to double or triple the work for the same pay
bad,if you are not a kiss up to management don't applying .  They don't value hard working loyal employees.  The culture has changed over the years they use to care about people now all they care about is MONEY.  Accounting managers all have bottles of alcohol on desk. Sound like the place for you then jump right in.  I wish you the best of luck.
bad,"Worked there for plus years and the reviews that you read that seemed harsh and cruel are actually true, every word. Management sucks, HR is ridiculous their main focus is firing people for no reason. The turnover is huge because the company don't care about employees, just getting the work out. For many years I had been hoping that one day some big wig would come and save the people but, no and then you come to your own conclusion  (get out of here ) anyway think twice about working there ,it's not what they think."
bad,"If you want to be a success and are skilled at kissing up this is the company and department for you. The managers are horrible! They will hold you back from advancement and other opportunities, especially if you are not part of the ""in"" crowd. It's all politics in this place. The company used to be a great place to work, but sadly has become absorbed in keeping that stock price high with little regard for their employees. Don't fall for the fake smiling faces."
bad,"When I first started at Scansource I was amazed to learn how brainwashed their employees are. They are overworked, underpaid, but somehow think they have the best job in the world. Benefits are horrible, for example: you are not allowed to add your spouse to your medical insurance. So if your wife is a stay at home mom, good luck with that."
bad,"Overworked, bad office politics, not a happy place, everyone is a tool to management. Management has lied repeatedly to keep people from leaving with promises of advancement to cancel the advancement at the last minute."
bad,"From the beginning you're  not know by your name if you're a temp, you're know as ""the temp"" No chance of advancement because you're treated as ""the help"" nothing but politics and if you're not into major sucking up, you don't stand a chance! You take initiative and work hard and not acknowledge. One mistake you're treated as incompetent, meanwhile others even from other departments see your dedication and hard work and the difference you make. So sad! The manager of AP brings her home drama to work daily and its enabled! You mention defending yourself and your work and it's considered drama. Makes NO SENSE! You'll be lied on so they don't look bad and you feel like your hands are tied. Meanwhile most go with the flow for a paycheck in fear of losing their job. Why is it so hard to just be part of a team and get paid like everyone else? Management is obviously insecure women who have no idea what they're doing!  Pathetic. Scansource as a company is great but not the AP department! Been warned and see why turnover is so high there but went through it personally as well as seen other being treated unfairly. Simply because they don't like you and therefore you don't fit in!! Especially when the surroundings are like a kiddie daycare circus with most (the pets) AP analysts behavior!! Accepted by management of course!"
bad,A typical day at work was for me to gather the invoices for the analyst to pass out and key any drop ship or warehouse orders that came in. I learned that even though I wanted and asked for more job duties the management there didn't want me to advance.
bad,"Co-Workers are ok.  Managers are nice to you...to your face, then they stab you in the back."
bad,"It’s not changing well with the times — the original founder is trying to maintain his CEO status at the company’s demise. So much upheaval in the last 3 years but the last 12 months has the longest tenured top positions in audit and HR and marketing all bailing, that’s how you  know it’s time to go. Unless you work in the warehouse in Mississippi where everyone loves it this it’s an okay place to play the game if you need a little check for a year or two."
bad,"Don't apply here if you have any interest in receiving a decent salary. Also the ""benefits"" that they say are so great have been rapidly disappearing over the last few years - they're practically non-existent (don't even get me started on how the profit sharing amount is a complete joke at this point). Advancement is mildly available but they'll only give you a tiny raise with it and say it's the best that they can do. If you want to keep your employees you should pay them a fair wage for the work that they are doing."
bad,"If you have the ability to wait until another opportunity presents itself elsewhere, I recommend that you do so. You'll be happier elsewhere, rest assured.   "
bad,"Flat organization with no room for advancement.   Pay not competitive.   Politics played by management.  ""Fun"" working environment does not outweigh all the negatives of working there"
bad,You have to move around in order to move up.  The company constantly kept people from promotions in order to hold them in current positions.  Bonus structure didn't reward those who worked harder.  Drama felt more like high school than an office.  Management was unprofessional.
bad,"Your success at ScanSource will depend mainly on the department you work in. From what I can tell the sales, marketing, merchandising teams are pretty well compensated and enjoy their work. If you work in the finance/AR departments you will see extremely high turnover and a total lack of direction from management."
good,"A empresa tem um ótimo ambiente para se trabalhar, porém não há tanto reconhecimento por parte dos gestores."
good,"Worked as a temp. Enjoyed the actual work, although training was sparse. They (team leaders) were too busy chit chatting about their personal lives to take time to train. If you work in this department be sure to be in the ""in group"" where you can do just about anything you want. Talk, walk around, giggle, disappear, basically everything but your job and nothing will be said. If you are a hard worker who works most of the day then this place is not for you. It is frustrating. If you are a woman with half a brain the team leader is threatened by you and will then treat you badly. Been there done that, not doing it again."
good,Great place to get your feet wet just not enough compensation and growth potential. Good starting point to learn the industry but keep your eyes open if you want to grow and make more and have more opportunities.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, some great people but not all. Managers are not equip to be managers. Favoritism plays a role in advancement. Everyone is not given equal opportunity to advance to the next level."
good,High stress but great people. Really Strict about arriving on time but lunches no so much. Most of the time I worked there I was looking for a different job. Diversity was poor and career advancement was also poor.
good,"I worked since now 10 years at ScanSource Europe like a Senior Asset and Product Manager. I am responsible of the biggest Vendor, Motorola."
good,"On a daily basis, there is high competition for workload and once every order has been shipped at the end of the day everyone cleans up."
good,"As Marketing Manager for Catalyst Telecom and Paracon, I was responsible for coordinating all marketing projects from conceptual design to completion. This involved management of graphic designers, web designers, technical writers, events staff, advertising agencies, mail houses, and printers."
good,"A pessoa pode trabalhar no seu ritmo, pessoas ao seu lado pronto a ajudar em alguma dificuldade"
good,a typical work day was stressful management was crazy an it made the job very complicated so there was no enjoyment at this job because you never get to learn anything different.
good,ScanSource is a good place to start a career. People typically move on as a result of low pay and poor management. Career advancement can also be difficult.
good,Not the greatest company in the world to work for. A lot of back stabbing and cut-throat type culture. Upper management was not the greatest. Job was stressful and unpredictable.
good,"ScanSource is a solid place to work, great people and positive work environment.  The great amount of growth brings many diverse opportunities. There are both domestic and international opportunities."
good,"Pros: Floor Days with fun activities games and food all the time; awesome people leading to strong personal relationships"
good,"Years of changes in management left company without a clear strategy in place affecting results, deteriorating vendor relationships and losing best of talent"
good,"I learned a lot, but added YEARS to my life after leaving.  Too many hours - the pay was great but long term, not a winning arrangement for me.  I learned a great deal during my time there.  It is an extremely well run company."
good,"The culture of the company is awesome, rarely do you have to work long hours. You are only needed to do so when closing a large deal or during end of quarter time to assist the sales team with closing deals. My only issue was I lost my vendor bonuses which I was told I would be getting to make up for the gap between requested salary and paid salary."
good,Great Place to work staff is excellent facility is air conditioned friendly environment great benefits as it pertain to insurance and 401k clean warehouse
good,long work hours. benefits not good.  air conditioned warehouse. good group of work associates.  t ravel occasionally.  great human resource contact.
good,Worked with vendors to  develop and deliver training presentations.  Co-Workers made the job enjoyable.
good,"Not a bad company, good for starting out and gaining experience."
good,"This company is great for entry level jobs fresh out of college. You definitely will learn a lot in the technology industry. The pay could be A LOT better when it comes to the amount of work and daily responsibilities that come with the position (hence the name, ""ScamSource.""). It would be wise to be very attentive to what you do as this place is very HR happy when it comes to making complaints against other employees and will write you up for complete nonsense if you ""offend"" someone the wrong way. If you're a guy, good luck, because if you get reported by a female the HR department is made up of almost all females and there is no fair representation when you are called in."
good,"Empresa trasnacional que ayudaba a los empleados a desarrollarse, al crecimiento y apoyos para cursos varios, incentivos y premios como viajes a la matriz Miami"
good,"A typical day at work is keying invoices, working issues, and anything that may come up during that day. Management has a hard time separating friendship from work. This is were the down fall is. The culture of ScanSource is amazing. My department is very laid back. Those ""benefits"" sort of make up for the lack in pay. I have a 4 year degree and I am not nearly paid enough for everything I do. I feel as if I am used for my skills. Several people I feel have the job to be able to come and socialize...going back to the cant separate work from friends. Not much room for advancement."
good,"demonstates comprehension of techniques,skills,processes,equipment and materials necessary to perform job.performance evaluation are conducted by the supervisor regularly"
good,"A typical day began with checking email for any urgent matters and expedited requests/orders.  Once the urgent matters are resolved, email is reviewed and the priority list from the day before is handled.  I learned to stay focused and make plenty of notes throughout the day because your priorities may change.  The hardest thing about the job was learning it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the company celebrated all holidays."
good,A typical day at work is scanning and packing orders to be shipped out. What I learned is how to be productive. The hardest part of the job is the lifting and standing for long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be off on the weekend.
good,This is a great company with great coworkers who make coming to work everyday worth it.  Great culture with lots of perks and benefits.
good,I loved the job just not the enviroment. I think they should take more consideration on how employees feel. But i love the pay and very easy work just not the environment
good,The biggest issue was the lack of management training. Managers were often ill prepared to handle the various needs of their employees. Because it is a very flat organizational structure I found the managers often took credit for their subordinates ideas and left their employees out of key decision making for the sake of getting ahead.
good,"Empresa de distribuição bem estruturada e com objetivos bem traçados."
good,"Scan source was a very pleasant place to work for me, they were all about getting the work out before lolly gagging. I learned many things at first as the front desk procedures and how to handle difficult situations."
good,Scansource is a great place to work. They are all supportive. I feel like I have outgrown it because my job opportunities changed.  I am looking for something to push me on a daily basis.
good,Se enfocan en las Ventas aunque descuidan los procesos internos de las demás áreas que deben acompañar al crecimiento de la empresa para que pueda ser ordenado y perdurable.
good,I would rate Scansource as a 9%. They are very great and fun to work for but the benefit package has changed. They will work with schedule as needed and will provide overtime to selected employees.
good,"Tienen mucha rotacion de personal, la mayoria de la gente no dura mas de un año en la empresa"
good,"ScanSource Distribution worldwide helping others with a smile"
good,"Super agradável, pessoas disponíveis a ajudar."
good,"typical day very busy "
good,"-Face paced"
good,"Travail varié"
good,My review was good. My boss gave me a fair evaluation and he was very supportive of me and my family. I also received good support from human resources as well
good,Great company to work for...Co-workers are the best. I worked with a good team. I learn something new all the time. Cross-trained in all areas of the warehouse. Looking for better opportunity and better pay.
good,Good company to learn the distribution business. Very good culture to work in especially for young employees. Probably good for 5-10 years stay then to move on to something that pays better.
good,"The hardest the about the job is the unpredictable schedule that certain areas that one would work, for example the picking department may need help because too many employees called in,so they'll pull employees from all over the facility to work one department, which can be a hindrance if done to often."
good,Learn a lot in short periods of time. Small environment. Not much room for advancement but positions are long term and jobs are secure for the most part.
good,"Ambiente agradável,"
good,The company is growing and projects a very enthusiastic approach towards the future. In my case I am in management and their is alot of flexibility in my schedule but I work 2nd shift and M-F is either work or sleep. As a whole the company is good to work for and secure because of the type of product it distributes but is limited in advancement in the supply chain side.
good,I was just a contract writer for several months but I enjoyed working with everyone and I was impressed by the professional and supportive culture. Everyone loved the management.
good,La empresa es muy buena todos trabajan en conjunto y la verdad tiene buen modo de trabajar con las personas
good,"Empresa com ambiente agradável, ótimas oportunidades de conhecimento, liberdade para trabalhar."
good,"This company is very family oriented, has great values. Could improve its training abilities, and time spent on educating its human resources to become more productive."
good,I learned alot from this company. I learned about managing people with multiple backgrounds. I learned about overcoming conflict.
good,"For what it is worth, I genuinely enjoyed my time at ScanSource. They really do a good job of putting on fun events and including everyone in the company to create a college-esque environment. That said, the pay and benefits are pretty poor. It also has very minimal room for advancement. This isn't to say that it isn't for everyone. It really is a good spot if you want a secure job (they rarely fire people) where you can blend in with the crowd and lay low for a few years. It just won't do you any good as far as benefiting your wallet or resume."
good,"Working for ScanSource is rewarding, a lot of committed and hard work people. Big portfolio to promote and wide range of values."
good,"Well there's not a lot to talk about it was a typical wearhouse job deepening on the department you enter you're given a simple task to do such as: picking orders, invoicing, packing , or loading."
good,Tive minha primeira experiencia profissional nesta empresa e obtive vários aprendizados
good,"Great group of people to work with, great experience. Full array of benefits and time off offered. Very central location."
good,This is a good place to work that cares about their people and keeps a reasonable work/life balance.  They continue to innovate and grow. Middle management could be better but good top-level leadership.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"This company was always accumulating new projects so the company was constantly expanding. As a result of the company expanding, there was  always new opportunities for positions."
good,I learn great inventory skills to discover how to find lost product. In the inventory department you learn many task involving ways to find lost product. Good and precise ways.
good,The company has a very fun atmosphere.  It can be stressful at the end of quarter or end of year when trying to hit a large number. Pay is great for sales but low for supporting roles.
good,"Co-workers are great!  Work/Life balance is unlike anywhere else I've been.  However, you have to play the politics game.  If you haven't been with the company for 8 years or more, you're treated like an outsider.  Very little to no advancement if you're an outsider."
good,getting production done making sure everything is accurate with quality and counts being a team working and having a good bond and attitude with my co-workers the hardest part is lifting over 70 pound but i enjoy the work its easy and the management is very understanding and helpful to any needs i have dealing with work or the company.
good,A typical day at work was working hard and together as a team to get the job done.
good,"The culture of this company is great. No matter if you come in as a temp or through the door, you can have have a great career at scan source. I had a good learning experience at this company."
good,Awesome work-life balance. Helpful management. Culture to support growth and opportunities. On site gym and health coaches. Below average to average compensation.
good,"Very productive,making sure all shipments were shipped out at certain time. Love working with co-workers, teamwork work was a must. I worked closely with the supervisors making sure we made deadlines, etc"
good,"Good place to work. Lovely management staff. People are great to work with,"
good,a typical day at work in two hours of work and sit down the rest of the day.
good,Great group of people to work with where you truly feel you are a part of a winning team. ScanSource Communications cares very much for its employees and wants them to grow and succeed.
good,"a empresa a pesar de ser grande possui deficiência na comunicação , e também pouco incentivo de crescimento dentro da empresa"
good,"Empresa com Cultura de liberdade em execução de tarefas, sempre fui reconhecido pelo meu desempenho."
good,"ScanSource has a great culture and truly cares about its employees.  It tries to treat its employees as well as its customers.  There is a large effort on charity as well, not forced, but encouraged, and many employees give in many different ways."
good,"La empresa es demasiado buena, los jefes son excelentes personas, el problema aquí son los colaboradores que no siguen al pie de la letra las normas de la empresa."
good,"Nice work environment, friendly and courteous staff. Worked assembling and programming P.O.S. systems and other electronics."
good,"ScanSource has a unique culture. There are a lot of great opportunities for employees to have fun. However, management has difficulty accepting new ideas."
good,"Scansource has a great environment and culture. I believe they truly live by their mission statement. They have prospered by their great relationships with customers and clients. Great people, great place."
good,This company was a pleasurable working environment. The hiring process was extensive in order to make the right hiring choice. The employees there are very helpful in getting new employees settled in and knowledgeable.
good,"Fantastic place to work, and really enjoyed the environment. It is a company full of people who are passionate about what they do. Everyone there has a great team-spirit, and seeks to better themselves however they can."
good,"Empresa sensacional, excelente estrutura, funcionários qualificados."
good,"Great place to work with a very supportive management staff. They provide a great team environment, especially when first starting out. Other employees are always willing to help a fellow colleague. There is not a lot of room to move up in the company unless willing to move to HQ in Greenville SC."
good,"Simply picking and scaning parts. The management does seem to help their employees as much as possible. The people are friendly. The work can be a big load at times, but supervisors attempt to get everyone home at a decent hour. Also, there is good opportunities for over-time."
good,I was threw a Temp Service . I didn’t get hired on full time. I helped program the registers and I help build them for the different companies. The department was busy at times with the different types of jobs for each customer and what they require in each of their registers
good,great team members love the workplace very clean environment.although the pay was under i still enjoyed the time i was there with the staff. great company to work for
good,"Clock in, greet coworkers. Ask them how their day has been so far. Want to make sure people are in a good mood before I interact with them that particular day. Coworkers are 99% men, so it's easier to interact with them. Hardest part of the job was staying busy when there was no work. So when work got slow, we'd sweep floors, take out the trash, or help another department out. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how hard my coworkers worked and how much they took their job very seriously. Overall rating, I'd give my job a 9 on the scale of 1 to 10."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, rápida e com metas agressivas, time de gerencia muito competente. "
good,ScanSource was a wonderful place to work at with friendly co-workers that strive on getting their tasks completed. A typical day at work included meeting with executives and having fun while doing your job. The management at ScanSource are very willing to assist any of their employees.
good,making sure I do every thing right the first time. I am in stocking we have to make sure the count is right and the part number is right before we stock it in put in location.
good,It's a good place to work at management is good. HR  is good it's a good place to work it I recommend it to anyone I have nothing bad to say about scansource.
good,The most important part of the Job was making sure that the correct count and items were being shipped to the customer.I learned how to operate a sit down forklift how to weigh items on a scale. The culture was a mixture of different races no matter creed or color..The management was on point and was always eager to teach you as much as the job required. The only hard part of the Job was when it was time to do the Audits They never called in a special Team We as the workers were required to do it no matter how long it took.... The Entire Job itself was Easy
good,Empresa que dá liberdade para o auto desenvolvimento. Acompanhamento contínuo da gerência e diretoria para o desenvolvimento dos seus colaboradores. Sempre fui muito bem acolhido e respeitado como profissional.
good,"It was a good place to work at , I had a chance to work on every shift , management supervisors human resources all great people everyone got along it was a good place to work at"

good,"Easy paced, teamwork working together when it came to crunch time, enjoyed the people I worked with. Overall great company the hardest part of the job didn't know what time you were getting off at night"
good,Scan Source is a great place to work. I have been there 5 year and i have not had one complaint. I hope to work 25 more years. Alot of good people and good mangers to work with
good,I started with this company as a temp and became permanent. I got a lot of experience from working here. Great management team
good,They were clean and attentive. I had no problems and I did notice how they kept a productive work environment. No one was idol in the workplace. Everyone did everything plus more.
good,Wonderful place to work. Never had any kind of issues working with the teams and also the CEO is great and very friendly and mativating personality.
good,All Employees hard working and treated with respect.  Focus on accomplishments without focus on blame game for mistakes.  Allowed for faster progress of project.

good,Every night went smooth as ever. Management stayed on there jobs and made it a safe place to work. All of my co workers were down to earth.
good,Its a great group of people to work with. Management is very good at understanding the work value of its workers.
good,Great company with advancement options. Lot of employee centered activities with family involvement. I have learned the importance of inventory control in running a company to make certain merchandise is correct count and in stock. I have found that my workers in the Inventory department are team players and work together for the good of the company. The hardest part of my current job at Scan Source is getting up at 2:45 am Monday through Friday.
good,"A happy and energetic environment."
good,"Lo que más me gusto del trabajo es aprender a identificar directamente las necesidades que requieren las marcas que se manejan y a los clientes principalmente."
