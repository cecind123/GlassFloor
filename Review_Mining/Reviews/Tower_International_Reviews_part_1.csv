bad,You will regularly have to do the job of three people with little to no help or compensation. Forget having a home life as you’ll almost always be asked to work on the weekends and your days off.
bad,Fubar all around and the union is at the beck and call of management . management is worse and hr thinks everyone is a lair.. Screw this place and screw the job.. Family aint important to the company . time with your family aint important to them.
bad,"We work together with our customers in various stages of production, including development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing, and delivery. With a diverse mix of products and facilities in North America and Europe, we are well-positioned to meet customer needs. We have a strong, established reputation with customers for providing high-quality products at competitive prices, as well as for timely delivery and customer service."
bad,Tower mistreats employees no concern for safety or welfare of employees just amount of product off the line. its numbers over safety and quality ford would be ashamed
bad,"Management sucks, you can't plan your life because you never know what schedule is.horrible work conditions. They do not care about the employees at all."
bad,"The management is terrible, they simply do not care about you at all. They might pretend to, but you are expendable and treat you like trash, no respect for you. Then they have the nerve to wonder why no one takes their job seriously. You are constantly pushed for high production speed, sacrificing quality. Doesn't bother management at all, they want numbers nothing more."
bad,If u work 2nd shift at the Auburn in plant it's favoritism.  The supervisor has his favorites. He lets other people get away with things but will write you up for the same thing.
bad,"My role in the company is management. I have small kids and don't have health insurance because it is too expensive. Upper management has no clue what they are doing and it makes my job harder. We use to have morning meetings. So working harder, no insurance, and they make you go home feeling bad. Then have to go home to get up and do it all over again the next day..."
bad,"This is not a place for you if,,"
bad,"Management don't take safety into consideration, they would rather have quantity than quality, the place is way understaffed meaning they make people do more than 1 job at a time. No room for advancement, there is no way you'd get to top rate with the way human resources likes to tack on points. They don't listen to suggestions. The maintenance manager never manages. The production supervisor doesn't supervise. My advice is to get a supervisor position because then you can come and go as you please and never have to do anything right."
bad,"This job sucks. All around, as production. P558 is the worst line, and third shift is the worst shift. Team lead has no idea what he’s doing, this company is all about numbers you produce. DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU! They tell you in training numbers are less important than quality. This isn’t the case at all. If your machine goes down and quality comes to your station, even though you have documentation On it, it doesn’t matter because at the end of the day they will blame it on you and make you stay and makeup the parts you couldn’t create regardless of hours."
bad,"No one cares about the bottom feeders as long as they come in early, stay late everyday and every weekend and are seen and not heard. It's a dirty place and your the door mat upon which they wipe their feet. Run before you have  no self esteem because someone above you will make sure they take every ounce of it out of you."
bad,"Hours are long, management is disheveled at best, turnover rate is high, factory is often hot, laborers have low retention. No real room for advancement. Work almost every Saturday and usually 10 hours a day. Terrible work to home balance. Keep looking"
bad,"I have learned to become a good welder, 10 hour work day. management has some ethical skills to sharpen up on. dealing with quality sacrifices. being able to master my welding skills."
bad,"Tower has only one customer and that is Ford-Chicago. "
bad,Worst thing I ever did was go to tower. The money blinds u to all the other Things goin on that comes with that job. Revolving  door. No work/ home life balance. They let u know how easily u can be replaced. In I’m skilled trades. All around a bad place to work.
bad,I was a maintenance electrician for Tower Chicago plant for 11 years and found it to be the worst place to make a living. Union is the worst They will not help you one bit especially when you need them the most unless your black .Tower management are there for themselves only.
bad,When i say you literally are running the entire time for long periods of time you only get 2 breaks for a 10hr shift sparks for when the parts welded together come out at you when loading the machine and it unsafe and it hurts
bad,"You work 87.5 hours a week, every week. Forced in on most holidays as well, we used to have one weekend a month off and that's been taken from us. I'm a weld tech and the management in our department is the worst I've ever seen, everyone who can leave does."
bad,"Bad management, Production manager is a bully and a liar. The people out on the floor are good people that I worked with with the exception of a few zone leaders"
bad,"Job was too dirty. "
bad,"Working at Tower is ok if all you do is want to live at work."
bad,"To sum it up , we had a team member quit due to too many hours, You would come into work on your Friday looking forward to the weekend after a very long week of 10 to 12 hour shifts , only to find out you had one more 10 hour shift to pull. Could not make any types of plans in your personal life, Later that night in our every night safety meeting, some people were talking quietly to each other about the girl quitting, The supervisor pops up and says in front of the whole group that Tower don't care if you quit , says they will have you replaced just like that and snaps her fingers. Needless to say no one wants to work for a company who does not value their employees.The job itself is very demanding , on your feet the entire time you are there , get caught leaning against something , get wrote up or the threat of it. the best part of the job was clocking out to go home. Oh and forget the raise they promise after the 6 month period, you mostly will not get it, especially if you are on 3rd shift your supervisor won't pull for you."
bad,"While I was working at Tower, I found it a very good experience.  The president gave quarterly, all colleague  meetings to present the state of the business.  We were were very well informed.  A yearly bonus was dependent on Tower hitting or exceeding targets determined by the upper management.  While I was at Tower, we always met our targets and received our bonus.  We functioned as a team.  We produced a quality product and were in good standing with our customers. I would have liked to stay at Tower until I retired.  The CEO retired over two years ago and you could see from the beginning that the new CEO was positioning Tower for something.  In the end, Tower was sold to a private equity firm.  The new company laid off almost all the up front engineering that made a Tower launch of a frame assembly so successful.  Considering that Tower was a profitable, viable, and successful company, it was a very disappointing end to a nice employment."
bad,"Bad management, doesn’t care for employees. They make you want to quit...if you don’t they will fire you and make up excuses for everything. STAY AWAY!!!"
bad,"the company is average in terms of the work life balance, the company gives opportunities to learn new things and explore"
bad,Worked 12 hours six to seven days a week to make 70.000 a year my family don't know me  I was a team leader for eight years I tried to get an interview for a salary job they keep giving excuses why they can't give me a simple interview
bad,Due to the Management’ views with this company I was uncomfortable and unable to continue to work for them. There is a disregard to certain people as far as being respectful
bad,Place is all about who you are and how much butt you kiss everyone is treat differently and from production to upper management there’s no Communication
bad,"This is my opinion only not every person is going to feel the same way. When you show up for a welder job, you go to your work area. Need to check the equipment before using it. The welding boss will assign you where you are going to be welding. It is your responsibility to fix your weld liner, change weld tips, wire and weld cones. the overtime is posted so you know in advance. they have computers to request overtime or days off. The hardest part is when you get laid off and put in the production area for button pushers. Then as more welders continue to be laid off they have too many people and you can be laid off and put on unemployment. the welding area the people are good but the production is a little more salty type of people. The most enjoyable part of my job was welding. What happens is there tons of overtime then they lay off. The welding boss is good but the production bosses in different areas not so much."
bad,High Turn over rate.  No diversity.  Not a friendly place to work. There are a few good people there but scattered here and there.
bad,"Every shift and dept. are different. Doesn't matter if you work hard or not, if the managers don't like you, you'll be fired, they will find reasons to get rid of you."
bad,"Tower is like every other factory, that being your experience will change as the leadership (and thier policies) does. They say safety first, then quality. But thats only if its convenient to production. As a person, you will be an asset and not an actual human being. My experience at tower was that thier needs were above that of me or my family."
bad,"The upper management need to be more consistent with what the employees and also their communication needs to improve dramatically. Days and nights work totally different. I understand  nothing going to be exactly the same, but if days have two people on a line (because it’s a two man station) then I believe nights  should do the same. Communicate please...we’re being over worked."
bad,"alright wook days poor management "
bad,"7 days a week."
bad,"Tower used to be a great place to work. Then bankruptcy and lean management stepped in. Now in Engineering you'll find yourself working multiple positions and not compensated for the extra work."
bad,What Tower hired me for as a production scheduler I never had the opportunity to try. They were growing so fast  and quickly management did not know how to respond.
bad,"I received excellent reviews at Tower, but there was no room for advancement.  If I wanted career advancement I was going to have to relocate out of state."
bad,Training promised none given. Don’t let you personal life interfere with your project. Short on people resources. Inconsistent management styles. Over worked. Some managers have intimidation style.
bad,Most of management was just given a job because of race or friends. Maintaince never could fix anything but a few. Lack of leadership throughout the plant. No good training.
bad,"Union is terrible, Employees are the last thing they think about, Management is a joke there no sense of direction, pay is okay but mandatory overtime the schedule is all over the place. only good thing really is all the people i had worked with."
bad,"Supervision was a joke, you could find workers playing games on their cell phones and no one did anything to correct this issue.  Lot of shouting about making it difficult to concentrate on the job.  Lack of work minded people, if you are a hard worker and not into playing child games this is not the place for you."
good,Tower has a great group of UAW workers but they have a hard time keeping the plant running with the processes they have in place. They claim to be WCM but unfortunately they are very far from becoming that.
good,Don’t like it changes all the time I don’t want to do this review I do not know what it makes me do it I need more letters I do not have enough now it’s enough
good,"Union shop.  If you are in the ""click"" union will work for you, otherwise you are belittled and harassed.  Grievance system is poor.  Again, if you are union friendly the process if swift if not you are lucky if you get filing done before time limitation. Company HR in cold hearted and stiff.  Cases don't matter regarding circumstances.  Again, union is no help.  All in all tower is a terrible place to work."
good,"Management is very unprofessional, don't do anything for employees"
good,Very intense manufacturing environment working many long hours. The facility has hundreds of welders and robotic equipment. The atmosphere is very smoke filled
good,"Times were tough across the country when I worked here, but overall this was an ok company to work for"
good,"Some departments are worse the  others. Every company has its good and bad, tower is not any different. Huge disconnect between floor and office personnel."
good,not in a possition to thrw stones at anyone nor will i just wasnt what was best place to work for me i was happy to be able to leave and start my own gig and to be able to enjoy being my own boss
good,"Assembly is very mentally and physically demanding. Press operators stand in one spot all day and eat and get to be on their phones. Press operators stay on break about triple the amount they should, while assembly barely gets to have a break at all. Pay should be on different scales depending on department. The hardest part of the job is being about to meet hourly and daily numbers and percents."
good,This job is physically easy but the leadership on 2nd shift was lackluster. They do not offer help and take advantage of the relaxed environment because upper management does not work 2nd shift.
good,"Dress warm in cold weather,  bring extra clothes with you to change into after work.  You will be covered in dirt,  grease,  and steel shavings.  Your shoes will have grease packed in the soles as well."
good,Fast pace. Goals are always set right out of reach. They expect you to do everything perfect all the time.  If you do get a weekend off they will ask you to come in and clean their robots.
good,"Sometimes needed to work extended hours 12 hrs or more, as well as weekends. Enjoyed work with launch team, solved problem on supplier and business unit floor and had a great pleasure and fun with team members."
good,"typical day at work is you clock in go to your stations really laid back and fun environment. I learned different machines require the switching of paces and different parts how many rivets, nuts, bolts they are supposed to have."
good,Good company to work for.  Lots of room to advance in the company. Fellow employees make a great work environment. Lots of opportunity for overtime every week.
good,I was trained for a total of like 30 minutes and then expected to run everything smoothly. I'm a fast learner so I accomplished this task. The mental demand was more than the physical. All together its a good job but I want to expand my horizons a little more.
good,"Managers do not support you on the job, a lot of miss communication between departments! It does pay good! Benefits are ok too! The engineers do not support the Maintenance Technicians!"
good,It’s a okay place to work it’s fun and you will benefit from it I don’t have anything else to say about the company but you will like what else to say
good,"Decent job, management team could be a lot better. responsible for operating and maintaining equipment in a factory or warehouse and preparing items for distribution. The job description of a production worker involves assembling and checking product parts, ensuring that all machinery runs smoothly, and assisting in the shipment of items."
good,Quick temp to hire. Decent pay for the work considered. Nothing hard about it. Don’t expect to advance. They have their pets. It’s gets really hot in the summer and cold in the winter
good,"Typical day is fast paced, stressful , but if you enjoy what you do its an all around decent atmosphere. Some lack of management, and the management that exists is not very directive and leading."
good,Everyone on the floor appears to be working including management. The pay is below the cost of living but better than other places. Most people are operators or welders but they have fork lift drivers and maintenance too. Operators work with robots loading fixtures. Welders weld parts of the frames.
good,I don't have anything positive to say about this company other than the people where great to work with.  Very accepting.
good,"Pay is above average for location, time off is adequate, usually. Work environment is friendly and usually steady. Has multiple break rooms so workers don't have to walk so far for a break."
good,"Although if you work in the right department you get good overtime opportunities, most of the time you do not. Win everything that comes out of a paycheck dude to taxes, 40 hours a week at this company spent quite cut it. Upper management is terrible. Poor communication from the top to the bottom."
good,"Politics"
good,"I am not big on working in a factory, but if I was going to TOWER would definitely be the place. The supervisors for the most part were respectful and fun to work with, and most of the employees were pretty nice people. Outside of that it was a lot of repetitive work, and that always gets to me. This being the case I couldn't continue a career there, even though the pay was really good for unskilled labor."
good,"Not very employee conscious, lots of mandatory overtime, very little time off.  Repetitive, boring factory work."
good,Tower pay and benefits are competitive. Continuity of leadership is of a concern. I have had three quality managers in two years. Two Vice Presidents. With each strategic change comes a change in philosophy as well as direction.
good,"A Tower é uma empresa que valoriza as pessoas que se dedicam. No seu tempo e quando surgem as oportunidades os bos profissionais são promovidos. O salário é compatível com o mercado e tem bons benefícios. Tem grandes problemas de relacionamento entre as áreas, diretoria não é preocupada com os funcionários e a produtividade efetiva, apenas nos objetivos pessoais, passando por cima de tudo em função dos seus bonus"
good,"It was interesting to work on full frames for body-on frame vehicles. The frame interacts with many other vehicle systems including the body, powertrain, powertrain cooling, fuel systems, exhaust and electrical. It is also a main component in the design for vehicle safety and durability."
good,"dont come there with any kind of expectations, just come in and do your job. move fast, come on time, you will be a temp until you are hired on and that depends how consistent and fast you are on the line. if you good, three months youll get hired if you slow much longer before you get hired."
good,"É uma empresa boa."
good,This company has flexible work hours. Co-workers are friendly and job task are obtainable to complete during the scheduled work time given. This is a good company to work for.
good,"Bons profissionais, ótima oportunidade de aprendizado e desafios."
good,"patch holes on front structure where needed, help load the line and clean up work area at the end of the day"
good,"Days are non stop with constant running around.  Very fast paced and need to be self motivated."
good,"Operar máquinas de solda ( ponto e projeção, robótica), setor automotivo, operacional produção."
good,I had a overall pleasant experience at tower.  Every place you work is going to have their share of knuckleheads or people with a bad attitudes but overall a friendly place to work and earn a decent living
good,"Up until Tower Automotive was purchased in October 2019, it was a great company to work for.  They were well staffed.  The work was not easy and it was timed constrained but we had good teams and we were able to work independently to get our projects completed on time."
good,Generaly as a maintenance Technician we perform repairs as needed and have occasional down time for major repairs. We all work as a team to get the job done quickly and safely.
good,"Fast paced company, with an excellent Human Resources Team.  Workplace Culture is wonderful, colleagues are like family. In previous role I had interaction and was able to build good relationships from the ground up.  The employees are the best part of this company. The only reason I left the company is because I was offered a position very close to home."
good,"Empresa multinacional bem estruturada, com processos bem definidos."
good,"Dia típico de trabajo estar en piso 70% de mi tiempo por estar en etapa de construcción e instalación de equipo, el haber aprendido realmente poco pues el tipo de actividad ha sido parte de otros trabajos del mismo genero, presentándose  situaciones de lentitud en toma de decisiones por ser una coinversión para tener efectivo y traer refacciones o proveedores que solucionen problemas, trato excelente de la alta dirección."
good,I was a supervisor over 30 plus people and ran a very productive production line. L also made scheduling and done quality control to make sure all parts was good.
good,Corporate Headquarters are located in Livonia Michigan- traveled extensively domestically at other tower locations. Worked numerous weekends and Holidays.
good,Great place with minimal overtime but is available if you want to work it.  Only downside is the high cost of insurance and it’s not that great for what you pay for. Experienced maintenance make $32hr after 1 year and fresh out of school have a chance to work here but will have to start at a lower pay rate and earn their incraeases.
good,"I have been working the split shift for almost 5 years now and need a change."
good,"Great company,awesome perks, great bonus payout Little room for advancement. The benefits are higher than any normal job. Not a high raise when you do get one."
good,This Was A Nice Company To work for. They Were fair and showed everyone equal rights. As a welder it was honestly a settlement due to the fact that you didnt get paid due to the fact of certification.
good,"The work tends to get boring at times, but the awesome group of people you work with makes it all better. You learn new things and new ways of doing stuff everyday. Some days drag on but there are more good days than bad."
good,My second shift work was stressful when I first started but got more relaxed as I progressed in my job. I learn new skills in inventory management and receiving and customer relations. The hardest part of my job could be the heavy lifting ant times. I enjoyed working with people and helping them get the parts for their assignments.
good,"On an adverage, every day was full of opprotunities to assist co-workers in acheiving daily tasks ,and responsabilities to ensure the movement of materials both in and outside the plant."
good,Tower International is a major stamping and welding facility for the auto industry.  Tower gives employees ample opportunity for advancement and the management trusts their employees to do the job themselves.  Holidays off are plentiful and the pay is above average for the area.
good,Always on the go at the plant.  I enjoyed this type of environment but decided to leave so diversify my experience.  Plant Manager was hard to work for but I admired him for his tenacity.
good,A great work culture with good home / work balance.  You are given the opportunity to excel if you have the ambition to do so.  Not a lot of upward movement as it is a flat organization
good,"We have a daily goal to produce 341 frames per shift."
good,"Good place to work at. Working with various joining equipments from small nut cells to large lines such as frame lines, apron and floor pan lines at various plants"
good,Typical day was 8-5. With additional optional hours to be had by doing after hours custom release work.
good,Have a good relationship with hourly colleagues as welll as management. Have learned a lot about robotics through hands on training and classes that company supplied.
good,"It is a ok place to work. If you want to advance or move up, not the place to work. Even qualified people r overlooked for position filled by under qualified people."
good,Tower was a good place to work and paid well . It was hard and fulfilling work . Most of management were friendly and helpful . The hours got king of tiring .
good,Many Tower employees have been working at Tower for over 15 years and enjoy the friendly working environment. Co-workers cooperate well and support each other in daily work.
good,Excellent company to learn and build from. Very valuable skills learned at the time I was employed there. The paychecks are very nice at the end of every week and working there was a breeze.
good,"Love the people!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"light workload, busy nonstop movement most jobs needs to be completed in seconds. rewards workers with lunch when stander is hit. Management just like any other job"
good,"O dia dia na empresa é uma correria, aprendi a ser político, minha gerência trabalha em função do mais antigo ao mais recruta na empresa, alguns de meus colega são imprevisíveis e as vezes perigosos, a parte mais difícil é trabalhar sem plano de carreira e o mais agradável é a amizade encontrada."
good,"I have been at Tower for over 7 years now in the Benefits Team.  My team works together to accomplish the departmental goals.  We are very busy, as we support 12 locations, but that just means that every day is different and there is no chance to get bored."
good,"Nesta empresa obtive grandes oportunidades de aprendizado, bem como promoção e salário ajustado de acordo com o mercado de trabalho. As pessoas são prestativas e dispostas a ajudar.  "
good,"Great company to work for, good opportunities. Flexible work environment, travel is great, if you'd like that, great office location in the greater metro D area."
