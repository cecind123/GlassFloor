rating,review
bad,Basically a Chinese company with a US storefront. Their idea of innovation is to wait for competitor to make a product then make a copy of it. They do make sure it is just different enough not to violate patents. So there’s that.
bad,Hire and fire on demand. Learned about 38999 connectors and why not to work for them. Very interesting company that does not value employees. or management.
bad,"When your director gets demoted in less than 6 months of your hiring due to lack of personal , it's very demotivating. When you give your resignation due to the lack of communication and the obscure structure about the workplace and your director tells you ""well nothing can be done at this point..."", its very demotivating. When people constantly backbite and lie about each other, its very demotivating. Amphenol, please understand that the year is now 2019 and things have changed. Young talents will not stay or will not want to be recruited by you if these old geezers that have been here for the past 4000 years dont change their ways. I hope the best for those who try their hardest and for those who are hindering the success of others in this work place, I hope they cease to exist."
bad,"Canadians do not speak Mandarin we speak English and French.  NOT MANDARIN!!!!"
bad,People undermine your work and management allows it and covers it up. Already built in friendships that cover for one another to set others up for failure. Mistakes are told loudly in front of any and everybody in hearing distance. No job security is felt at any time.
bad,Poor management that does not have a clue what is going on day to day. they are only focused on sales and not customer delivery. the pay is way below the average in the area.
bad,"Upon being hired for Amphenol, I was immediately asked to work along side with the HR manager Jacob Johnson. He started blackmailing my job from the beginning. This individual has ""SHADY"" on his truck plates, which should have been my first sign. He manipulated many situations to put me in situations I had never sought nor thought any one person in management would do, one being that he had manipulated the Union numbers so that rather than being 10 up on the list, I was then at the bottom so that he could easily dispose of me without rapture if he had to. I started with the company making 21.70 per hour and by time I had left, I made 15.20 an hour, which alone says enough. I had watched employees leave upon their retirement times and never appreciated, as it was working there was like being in a prison, but the only difference was the pay. We were slaves to our jobs moreso than others, held captive by corporate monsters."
bad,"The leadership team at Amphenol gives no clear guidance for new employees, their expectations are unrealistic with no plan of action, definitely not a fun place to work, high pressure settings, and no direction in the slightest."
bad,Productive and fast workplace.Also it is a fun workplace with ping pong table. Typical day at work is meeting the order schedule and release drawings and BOMs
bad,"overcrowded with low paid workers that do not work nicely together. unsanitary bathrooms conditions, overwhelming smell from the moulding machines. back stabbing workers don't like to co-operate with each other in accordance to race."
bad,I was very disappointed by the lack of leadership and deception by the General Manager. I never felt like he was being honest and upfront about expectation and in fact reversed his position multiple times.
bad,Had a great experience going is. However a change in management also led to a significant change in leadership. Short sided and selfish is the only way to describe.
bad,Amphenol is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. After working for GE for 10 years amphenol bought our business . Made the work force moral fall to an all time low. Not one person that I work with wants to stay. Amphenol treats it's employees like dirt and could care less about your family life outside of work. Someday I hope karma cathes up with the higher management and they all die alone a slow painful death !! They took a wonderful place to work and made it nasty.
bad,I worked for this company for approx 10 years. At first the work was fun and we were told that there was a future in it. After the first layoff there was even less room for advancement. I am glad for the second  layoff and a chance to get on with my life.
bad,"No parts and no management support."
bad,"New employees are forced into a union environment that practices a ""2 Tier System"". New employees are stuck with the second ""Tier"". They are paid $4.00 per hour less than the first ""Tier"" union coworkers, for the same work. "
bad,I had recently quit my office job (2 weeks notice was given) because there was absolutely no work/life balance.  You are pretty much required to work overtime (on a salary that doesn't compensate you for overtime) for management who doesn't value your hard work.  Management is so poor that they don't spend the necessary time with you to grow and or train you.  You pretty much have to figure things out on your own.  They're very unprofessional which makes the environment uncomfortable. 
bad,Managers do not know the process of operation of the department and have no clues of how the departments runs or operates.   Managers and Engineer management don't communicate or work well together.
bad,"Amphenol was one of the most toxic environment I have ever worked in! Although most of the staff were reasonable nice on a personal level the office politics is extreme and there are numerous people in positions who are neither experience, qualified or capable to be in those positions. The management are absolutely diabolical hense the high turnover of staff and failures of the company in general. The management are without any doubt thee most backstabbing users I have ever seen in action. In short I would never work here again no matter how desperate I was and highly recommend if you are considering working here that it is only if you can get no other job as stacking shelves in a supermarket would be better."
bad,"A typical day will involve untangling problems. Damage control with the customers is a big part of most jobs"
bad,"Amphenol is primarily focused on meeting monthly financial goals. They are NOT focused on people/culture, creating systems, or any other long-term goal. The company does not have a focus on Quality at all. The office environment is the worst I've seen ... no one smiles or enjoys their job there. Most managers there work 12-14 hour days and are underpaid."
bad,"Had 7 years of my life, high stressed Company, high production in last day of the month...including New years eve....Intense self training."
bad,"Working in Senior Leadership and i would not recommend working for Amphenol. one of the worst companies i have ever seen from a corporate standpoint. If you ask questions you get talked down to and treated terrible, there is no work/life balance - you get vacation days but expected to work on them and be available 24/7. Corporate HR do not care and treat people bad, run away, do not work here"
bad,Every day was a mess. Didn't know how long each day would be. Fridays afternoon they would come to you and tell you that you had to work tomorrow. It was hard to make family plans at all!
bad,"Limited training, manatory overtime when there was little work to be done"
bad,"very stressful job and unfair to employees. i would not send my best friend to work there everyone is very unhappy and cutthroat."
bad,"Good worker  and  always on time good people skills  worked in shipping and  receiving  also in assembly  able to be lead people without , my supervisor being around   also  able to work with with computers showed people what orders that were needed to be done upcoming orders on making antennas,  also in shipping"
bad,"Overall the Amphenol Corporation has been met with tremendous success.  This particular $250M division Amphenol Aerospace located in a remote location in upstate NY has not fared well with the downturn in defense spending / new programs and commoditization of its MIL-STD-38999 circular connector products from numerous competitors.  This division has an archaic business model that is ran on a cycle of 30 days with no forward planning or thinking to address the underlying issues that are affecting its performance.  "
bad,"Company has only one interest, Bottom line! not employees."
bad,You would find a union shop with very good talented hard workers.  The problem is on the management side.  You would be reporting to a glorified plater that doesn't know what a ion is.  He is very easily threatened by anyone that knows more than he does.  If you threaten him his MO is to cut your throat and throw you out the back door.  Sidney is a small town locate far from any shopping or entertainment.  There is a lot of unemployment and street drugs.  Please use caution if you are considering this position.
bad,"since the son took over running the joint (was part of the purchase agreement that he would take over) the place has become an unorganized mess. Management are leaving in droves..."
bad,"The people there are awesome but management sucks big time. Mangers are not professional,, will use profanity. If you have problem, they will not try to solve it, they will fire you on spot to avoid it. It take years to get hire on, if you are not favor by the supervisor you will not get hire on at all."
bad,"Stay away very cliquey company . Uses the “ good old boy”.   , set of standards in promoting , giving out good jobs and keeping people . Some managers are not liars , many are liars . They don’t like smart people and are threatened by people that are fast learners."
bad,"Do not apply here unless you are homeless and really need money.  And they pay you about 20% below industry standards too.  First off, this job is based in Beverly, which is in the middle of no where and about 30 miles from the city. "
bad,Typical Work Day:
bad,"Bright new engineers with the drive and determination to conquer the aerospace industry have come to save the company - with one thing standing in their way. An entire family hired internally, who've gotten too comfortable in their positions, and their ego's stand greater than their knowledge."
bad,la mayoria de las veces era buen dia algo cansado porque era 12 horas pero bien porque descansaba 3 dias
bad,"Poor management , some good people. In fighting and politics.not a good place to grow. Inexperienced supervisors, engineered. Very unprofessional environment"
bad,"Most management has never worked elsewhere which has led to an inbred mentality that can't see beyond their very limited experience.  There is an overwhelming sense of nepotism that protects inferior workers and places ""outsiders"" in a position of jeopardy."
bad,If you want to learn anything about electricity and basic electronics this would be a great place to start. Little to no experience is needed to start.
bad,"Sales centric organization based on personalities rather than processes. Good place to start but not a long term gig."
bad,"Entrenamiento nulo"
bad,"If you are already there, you may be making good money and for sure are working with some great people on the floor.  There are also some very helpful engineers and support staff.  In general however, upper management is clueless and always reactive.  Don't tell them how it is.  Tell them what they want to hear.  No worries, they won't check up on it......."
bad,This job had every chance to be a lifelong endeavour and many I worked with loved what they did there. It was an amazing environment. By the end you felt used and thrown away for cheap temporary labour no matter your seniority.
bad,not a company i would work for again. quality of workmanship is subpar. pay is well bellow most other companies in this field. they care nothing for the people that work for them
bad,Big company and workplace is toxic as only a few people really advance in the grand scheme of things.  Management positions are scarce and and compensation is little for the work we do
bad,"Management here is not to be trusted.  They have a double standard, and even if working remotely is something that can be done they will not allow it for stupid reasons, while they themselves do it constantly.  They truly do not care about the individual, but the other people that work there are all good hard workers, and work well as a team.  They will continue to lose good people for their backward, old school views."
bad,"Executive leadership is driven by more money, at the sacrifice of the staff under them. It's not uncommon for hourly employees to work 20+ hours of OT a week, and salary to work at home, after a 10-12 hour day & weekends. It's never enough & they want more, but they publish core values telling something different. The GM has hired personal friends across the company. You're always being watched and reported on."
bad,"Management treats the workers like rented mules.  "
bad,"Reporting to two people never seems to work out as this did not. No job reviews by management so you do not know how well you've done throughout the year, raises are 1% to 2% which does not even cover cost of living. Some years they give you nothing.  The medical benefits is a high deductible.  Overall managers seem to not have to do their job to help grow the staff for improvement."
bad,"A typical day means analysis of rejections with quality/process/design, reviewing drawings and prints and customer calls."
bad,"A typical day at amphenol is hectic. There is no organization, the system used is old and out of date making the job twice as hard. Due to the lack of a better system, I did learn to work smarter and finding alternate options in problem solving."
bad,"worked straight midnight shifts which I did not prefer.  Everyone who is in a higher position is related and I never felt there was a real ""open door"" policy."
bad,"I was a test engineer, meaning I worked both in quality and in R&D.  I tested core products to pass/fail specifications, qualified new products for sales and marketing, and analyzed new designs for engineering."
bad,"SMT &PTH component Soldering and Rework"
bad,"en este empleo he aprendido a usar equipos que en otras empresas no usaba, rectificadoras, hornos para templado"
bad,"They have great ideas of how they want to advance their company but are poor at supplying tools to execute the plan. They expect their sales staff to do everything including Marketing, Market research and new design on product."
bad,"Empresa consolidada no ramo de produção de cabos e antenas."
bad,No esta bien organizados el supervisor no era buena persona con los trabajadores.
bad,Terrile management. Zero accountability for there actions. They are more concerned with jokes and gossip than they are with running a businesa. Petty and childish.
bad,Amphenol Borisch use to a great place to work when it was Borisch but when the new owners took over the company changed and it just went under. The raises are terrible and the company is all about who they like. You can never get ahead in this company. No bonuses anymore either!!!!!!
bad,"the management and  supervisor are very demanding. There is no life . only focus on number.  poor working environment, pay is low, HR is not responsive.  no respect for the employee."
bad,Was great until they started enforcing ridiculous expectations from the new hires. Unable to learn the most basic things from being rushed and berated for accidents or just slower than the employees with tenure.
bad,"Trabajo estresante, la dirección por parte de la gerencia es autoritaria.  Poco apoyo para proyectos."
bad,"Amphenol was a good company all around. Then they brought some people in and have changed it completely around for the worst! They do not care about quality any more. They just want to make it as cheaply as possible. That said they are shipping as much of the company out of the country as they can, so they can have people work for less and make 10x's more scrape! They want you to work there as much as possible. Bosses are thrown around the plant instead of staying in a place were they know what they are doing. You can not trust anyone in the place, its become a very unfriendly and unreliable place to work. They have gotten caught several times."
bad,Prepare and ship all with different carries
bad,"Was excited for the opportunity, than their business fell off a cliff. Nice people with extremely poor upper management. It was interesting to see if corporate would step in but it looks like they didn't. It's a shame."
bad,go in to set up the machines.  Once the machines are set up you run the parts.  Check the parts for defects and make sure measurements are good.  Then pack the product for shipping.
bad,"Amphenol was my first job when leaving school. I left because I wanted to better myself and try something I have never done before, that is why I joined P&G."
bad,"AFSI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amphenol Corporation. Amphenol is a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE - TKR: APH).  Senior management is dominated by individuals with Engineering Degrees  Manufacturing environment is high mix / low volume.  In the Supply Chain function Quality, cost, lead times is the mantra and priority list."
bad,"Place is unorganized, they have the worst training ever!! Always running out of raw materials to actually do your job. Would not recommend. Also, you do not get a 90 day pay raise...gotta wait for the once a year review for that."
bad,llegas a la empresa te preparas para revisar tu correo electronico de el cual reciviras peticiones de cotizacion para conectores los cuales son ofrecidos por la empresa. submites la informacion de el conector requerido por el cliente en el sistema y esperas a una cotizacion de el departamento de cotizasiones. le envias correo a el cliente en estados unidos y si es necesario te comunicas con el via telefonica en ingles. le confirmas su orden y le envias su cotizasion por correo electronico. le das seguimiento a su orden o cotizasion para finalizar la venta.
bad,"Le falta desarrollar a su personal, capacitarlo, tener mas opciones de desarrollo"
bad,"desayunar, marcar hora de entrada ver en la sección donde trabajaras, hacer el procedimiento requerido, cuando termina la jornada marcar hora de salida."
bad,its a great place to work if you enjoy being layed off all the time and seeing them send our jobs to mexico. the only good thing about amphenol is the pay thats it.
bad,"The location of the job is the primary obstacle for many. Situated right between Binghamton and Oneonta, none of the locations are a great choice for a regular commute. Binghamton arguably has more 'stuff' available outside of Amphenol, but Oneonta is closer. I personally couldn't imagine living in Sidney proper, there's not much there to start with. The only benefit to living in Sidney is a lower time you need to trek through the ice/snow to get there in the winter."
bad,"Great first job, but they work you to the bone without reward. Great people, management is on the rise, but it's a corporate subsidiary and it shows easily."
bad,This company went through a tough transition during an acquisition. Many layoffs in the 2008-2011ish timeframe. The company has since seemed to stabilized under the Amphenol brand.
bad,"The People are nice, however my Trainer was sick and kept coughing on me all week. "
bad,"aprendí cosas sobre ensamble para arneses de carrro y trbajo en equipo."
bad,"Amphenol Aerospace Management puts profits before everything, including the customers and the employees. Amphenol Aerospace management will ship defective product and not even consider the repercussions, not do they care. Amphenol Aerospace management does not care about anyone or anything. Employees are forced to follow the nonethical standards set by the executive management, or they are forced out the door. Amphenol Aerospace management uses the China and Mexico facilities as leverage to get what they want (ship defective product). If you do not give them what they want they send your job to Mexico or China and then they get what they want, and you find yourself unemployed. If you are an ethical person who insists on doing he right thing, Amphenol Aerospace is DEFINITELY NOT the place for you to work. "
bad,"It was not ideal for my work ethic or the desired environment."
bad,"Not a hard job by far, can listen to music with headphones but they have been firing people for no absolute reason. Its like they hire for a job once completed they fire you when you no long needed some last a week to a few months"
good,"Como primera experiencia fue buena, pero no hay progreso en aumentar sueldos o puestos."
good,"Standing all day with a 15 minute break, always having to rush to make a ridiculous quota. Always having to be on top of things even showing management how to do work correctly."
good,Need new management favortism is big in company Insurance is horrible.Foremans not consistent and fair. The Raises are horrible they don't give employee eveluations raises only cost of living and sometimes some employees don't get raises for the year that just greedy.
good,"Review daily bank activity"
good,"Most employees are afraid to speak their mind, afraid to confided in other employees."
good,There are a lot of people getting ready to retire. Which leads to a culture clash of the very conservative and the younger generation. The work can be repetitive and management doesn't always respect the work life balance. I will say I learned a great deal about the connector industry.
good,What I learned from Amphenol Optimize is multitasking and flexibility. Is a company that is constantly changing and need to addapt quickly to those changes.
good,Benefits are bare minimum required by law.  Management has lack of direction.  They will not think twice before taking cost cutting measures of reducing headcount.
good,"As the company grows they are becoming less and less involved with the employees needs and more focused on the money. Human Resources only pretend to be involved. They don’t solve your problems personally, they more so look to see how they can cover problems up and make the company look better."
good,Not enough modern tools available to succeed in sales positions. Unrealistic incentive goals. Unrealistic profit expectations for the market made it impossible to win business.
good,Only me as a maintenance tech on 2nd shift answering calls and being responsible for the whole plant. i am responsible for all productions areas of the plant for repairs.
good,I believe thery just hired me for an immediate need and and when that need was gone so was I. After the fact i do not think they planned on keeping me at all.
good,"It was on temp status, pretty boring - no opportunity to expand skills.  Warehouse environment, dirty and noisy. break room VERY small. too much talking and playing."
good,"lots of activity, days go by very quick, constant meetings.."
good,"If you are the type of person who just wants to do your time in life this is a great place to be. Clock in, clock out, earn your vacation. Very typical life style. Very big on attendance."
good,"Even though this was not on my chosen career track, I didn't mind driving to this job everyday. It was a very collaborative environment and management would gladly train people to work in different areas if they noticed initiative."
good,The work place was a clean environment. The best of  all I made new friends there. I learned how to solder. It was actually interesting job. I got to work with trainers on new assignments. I wish I was still there but sad work was slow.
good,"Expect to be overworked and undervalued."
good,"Amphenol had a lot of potential to be life time employment. But due to poor management decisions and the inability to work with and listen to suggestion from employees made this job difficult on a daily basis. I value quality in any company I work with in a high degree. Quality at Amphenol was unattainable although parts were and are shipped out in this manner with pressure from management. This was my least favorite part of the job. If you value quality in you work, Amphenol is not the place to achieve that."
good,"Étant agent de fabrication sur presse, mes journées sont agréables mais avec des gestes répétitifs. Je suis autonome sur mon poste de travail. Je travail en 3x8 avec une équipe souder et conviviale. J'ai l’opportunité de postuler pour un poste d’assistante dans mon secteur, j'attends septembre pour une réponse. Je suis polyvalente dans d'autres secteurs comme le conditionnement et le magasin."
good,Long time wrk and low salary.extra leave without salary.extra wrking times without over time.but less wrk full safety place.caring of foods.and maintenance.
good,"Empresa de ambiente familiar, até ser vendida, onde começaram os problemas de instabilidade de emprego, levando embora bons colaboradores, tornando o ambiente de emprego mais competitivo."
good,When its busy youre busy when its slow youre out of a job. very cyclical work industry working in the oil and gas field. they need to diversify to stay busy when oil is cheap
good,Good work pace but there is a partiality of canteen food facility for employees and contractors because I worked under contract so the management was not good
good,been there 15 year without annual raise. Good company to work for but no raises. I have not gotten raises in years  good working environment. Just no chance of advancement
good,"Dealing with all incoming calls, responsible for nightly backups, changing tapes, and collating information. Collecting of daily post, sorting. Dealing with user problems, and providing complete administrative support to programmers and any other staff."
good,"Salario un poco bajo, prestaciones de ley, un ambiente agradable"
good,this spot usually hires from an agency and will not hire you on. its a cool place to make some money for the mean while but its a dead end job with no room for growth.
good,"i have learned past 5 years in current company was ;"
good,"Amphenol had issues with new technology. Job security, which in the past was never a question, became quite tenuous as more and more work left the Rockford facility to go to other Amphenol facilities. The downsizing that took place 4/21/17, effected approximately 40% of the Rockford work force."
good,Esta bien en el hambiente laboral pero el salario no y no hay aumentos aprendes diversos procesos  pero los supervisores son muy ostigadores en la vida personal lo mas dificil es hablar con ellos y me gusta todo  cuanto a el proceso y el hambiente con compañeros.
good,If you don't get laid off. Great pay especially for the area. The company seems to take care of their employees with safety equipment. Suck part of the job is that the company will lay off 1/2 the factory thru the 1st and 2nd quarter and fall way behind in production. Then call staff back in and hire more thru 3rd and 4th quarter and that's if you are lucky to get a call back that year. I would work there again though.
good,"Aprendi  a trabalhar em equipe, meus colegas de trabalho foram sempre pessoas muito prestativas  quanto ao trabalho eu gostava do que eu fazia era muito bom. Mais eu quero ir mais longe do que eles podiam me oferecer."
good,Nice people overall.  Pay about 10%- 15% bellow market.  Medical plan poor for such a profitable company.  Very high deductable is a game changer.
good,"Place to learn cable harness, electronic packaging , production process etc"
good,On any day I could be asked to do anything in stamping or molding. My skills are from running presses all the way to set-ups of new jobs. I could be asked to simply run the presses which typically a person runs 3 presses. I could also be asked to trouble shoot presses that are not running for various reasons from process issues to errors that may have occurred in automation or machine issues. I have done mold setting and processing. I have also laced stamping machines and changed out prep tools on the stamping side.
good,"Amphenol/ Adronics is a day to day job that operates Monday through Friday from seven a.m. to three- thirty p.m. with the opportunity for overtime on occasion. Days off where major holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and Fourth of July with accrued days off. Benefits included medical, dental, vision, disability, flexible spending account and others. I learned how to manage time for maximum output. The work environment was relaxed, but structured. The management were easy to speak to when needed and any personal issues needing attendance where acknowledged and scheduled."
good,"1) set fokus on pos attitude,choose to wear a prodigious attire, strife  for achievement of ultimate goal"
good,they don't want to pay for more help. they will make you work overtime instead. they will not teach you anything. you must be able to figure things out for yourself.
good,"Self managing people tend to do best.  Turn over can be high.  Depending on your department, management is either micro or lax.  Same is true for systems.  Some are well developed while others have not been improved or updated in 10+ years. It is a complex company.  Most of upper management has extensive history with the company."
good,Typical administrative work daily. Manager requests and needs professional and personal. Work wasn't anything different then standard needs.  No advancement offered in role. Different work environment
good,"buenos compañeros de trabajo y jefes, necesitan capacitar mejor al personal en cuestiones de seguridad y trabajar mas apegados a la stps."
good,"Possibly the best employer-sponsored healthcare benefits I've ever had."
good,Worked there for thirteen years.  Loved it.  Then they moved to Mexico.  It was a good and hard work.  Wish I still worked there.  The people I worked with were great.
good,"Amphenol provided challenging work with good pay. Overtime was always available.  Unfortunately, the chance of being laid off was ever present and tensions were always high."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo 6 minutos de tolerancia a la entrada del turno, el servicio de cafeteria un poco mal."
good,"En general es un ambiente con muchos retos, ideal "
good,"there are many pleasant people to work with.  I am very happy with the tasks that my job includes, which is some computer work with some manual labor."
good,"relizacion de actividades de acuerdo a mi cargo , responsable del area en ausencia del lider del area , apoyo para desarollarse , buen ambiente de trabajo ."
good,"Iniciamos con la evaluacion de los resultados del dia anterior, seguimos con la actualizacion de los planes d eproduccion y el seguimiento a los compromisos de envio del mes. Verificacion del MPS y activacion del MRP."
good,The hardest part was working in third shift while I was going to work in the morning.
good,"I spent almost a year at Amphenol, which had started out as an internship. The people are great and it was during an interesting time of growth for the company. Wish I could have continued employment after the internship."
good,"It is basically  connector manufacturing  company it includes moulding, assembling,  quality checking . No over work load for workers. It is very nice to work there"
good,"The coworkers are nice enough people, but no one really wants to be there. The benefits are great and the pay is decent. But when things get slow there really is not much to do and it gets really demoralizing - a lot of that has to do with the lack of planning."
good,why does indeed want me to rewiew this company i dint like working here because it was to far for me so i look for better opportunity but it was ok try it
good,"It's a good company , I worked in the base of diploma mechanical and I worked at purchase department .this company is assembled the ship's electronic parts."
good,"A empresa paga certo todos o benefícios e tem um excelente salário pelo menos no setor da qualidade onde trabalhei."
good,Flexible work culture and environment. Ideas and values can be focused more on employees and empowerment. Growing and valuing employees more and focusing on continuous improvement.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo entre departamentos para el logro de objetivos, buenas tablas para experiencia laboral."
good,"Há valorização, mas mercados estagnado para crescimento da empresa."
good,"Work done for the Defence Complex very repetitive and not mind stimulating.  Not a place to implement new ideas or processes, very much different the the Medical Industry."
good,"Overall an easy job to obtain. The interview process is effortless and very laidback. Hiring is quick usually within a few days. Once you are an employee though, things change. Stimulating interest seems to be difficult, but the work is fairly easy. Business constantly fluctuates and directions constantly change making the business very fast paced. Management is poor and confusing as the managerial organizational charts are not followed and are poorly developed. Pay rates are lower than what is expected, but there is room for growth and development. Mass layoffs happen every few years without notice, followed by mass hiring when they reorganize. Because of all this a good number of employees are bitter and do not put in the necessary effort. Communication is not great causing data to be ignored or lost and work having to be repeated. So in summary, the work is fairly easy, but extremely frustrating with small internal conflicts always impeding progress. The company needs a lot of work to organize their management and retain employees, but the market they are in is solid so who knows what the future will bring with some changes."
good,Con el actual gerente de planta no hay un buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,"Over all the job wasn't a bad one,  back when I worked there they had poor management skills when it came to what they promised the customer leading to mass hiring then mass lay offs"
good,I took this job as a temporary worker and overall liked my time there. Unfortunately they went to continuous operation (12 hour shifts) which did not fit my life style otherwise I could have stayed there.
good,"while working for this company it was good experience and I learnt new skills, I made many new friends and very much enjoyed my time working for this company."
good,"High pressure"
good,"pay was fair. excellent benefits."
good,Bonne entreprise mais plus d'opportunité d'evolution pour ma part au sein de cette société
good,"Learned using tools for my product manager role: road maps, business cases........."
good,"Great people, great product, great teams in the Winston-Salem, NC facilities. Work hard, play hard atmosphere is very enjoyable for those who can handle the stress. Very competitive wages and PTO packages."
good,"Amphenol Printed Circuits is  ok place to work."
good,worked for them for 7 seven years out of Endicott NY  worked many hrs and had great co-workers.  management was for the most part pretty lean and seemed to try to work with everyone. Learned alot of different jobs and had fun doing it.  It was over 30 years ago so very young and willing to get all the hours and knowledge allowed.
