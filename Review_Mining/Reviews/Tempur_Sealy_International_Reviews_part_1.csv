bad,"After being a contractor for over 2 years, promises of permanent employment promised and never fulfilled my contract was not renewed after I had my child and was planning on coming back from maternity leave. Was not informed that my contract would not be continued till a week before I was planning on coming back from maternity leave."
bad,"wouldn't recommend to anyone, pay is average, companies sent to as prospective long term employment were bottom of the barrel and it seemed that my representative at aerotek had no clue about the companies or the job at the companies so your thrown in with no idea of what to expect. No info about lunches, breaks etc. Your blind."
bad,The facility I worked in closed down shortly after they did a management change.  We went from an awesome manager that cared to a horrible manager that went out of his way to belittle people.
bad,"It was a horrible experience.  After 2 and half years of working there, I was let go because of something my manager did. I had never been written up or gotten any warnings."
bad,Overall pleased with my time at Sealy. I came in at a time when the company had recently been bought by Tempur Pedic so the company was experiencing numerous growing pains in the process and trying to find the right balance of leadership. The hours were long during the summer and were mostly half days the rest of the year due to fluctuating sales. Enjoyed the experience I had there despite some management issues that seemed to always be influx at positions from the production manager up through the regional leadership. Always someone new and expectations were constantly changing.
good,Good place and great people the benefits are top notch.  Several things are changing with new CEO to boost the stock prices.
good,The Tempur brand is a great quality brand.  The people there are amazing to work with.
good,"I was one of the first outside hires after the acquisition of Sealy. The toughest part of the job was navigating the corporate organization and systems in order to get things done.  As the cultures of the two organizations merged, I found a lot of fun and nice people to work with."
good,"In Brenham the management has a bigot way of managing. All the minorities are to stay associates. They practice nephatism there. Husband & wife teams, cousin teams, all of which part take in management."
good,Must be willing to work as a team while possessing a openmind to positive and or negative criticism. Punctualism is required. Maybe subjected to fluctuating work schedules durning busy times.
good,"Moderate travel, management in my particular region over scheduled meetings and micromanaged however this was not true in the past.  I enjoyed the inter-relations with the store owners.  Compensation was good."
good,The Brenham plant is a good place to work. There is still room for improvement as it goes through some changes in personnel and management it will continue to improve.
good,Overall the company is wonderful to work for. I do feel i was given a lack of training and I feel like I dont have a great opportunity for advancement without having to travel
good,"Extremely flexible, which allows great work/life balance. Company invests heavily in its people, and provides great benefits and  perks.  Conversely, demands hard work, planning, analysis and flawless execution."
good,"I am responsible for driving revenue growth and cost utilization with some of our largest retail partners. I focus on Product Merchandising, Marketing/Ad strategy, Category Management and Industry/Market analysis.  I work closely with internal territory rep in their respective markets to focus on sales presentation and training skills"
good,Career Advancement at TempurSealy is a plus at a company that is continually growing.  Fast-paced and challenging.  Managers were always helpful daily
good,"It was a fun, good shadow-ship opportunity for a college student to learn and see the inner-workings of a major, global company. Fun and exciting to see behind the scene, real world work."
good,"An excellent organization with a focus on consumer's needs in the helping people sleep.  World class, global organization constantly driving to become the global leader."
good,"When I came into work, I always knew what my job was for the day and I always kept myself in the loop with what was going on with the company. All in all, good company to work for."
good,"Sealy was a great, laid back environment. Projects moved along quickly and progressed in a timely manner. Management was typically willing to listen to new thoughts and ideas. Flexible summer working hours. Opportunity to travel on occasion."
good,"Great flexibility with this company!  They offer a lot of perks and incentives, and trust and empower employees to drive their own goals and schedules to achieve targets.   Unfortunately, job security was amiss in the sales side, as dealer relationships were in jeopardy."
good,"Great Retail Sales Culture and People.  "
