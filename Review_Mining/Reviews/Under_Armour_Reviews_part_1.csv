bad,Under Armour sucks big time it under pays its workers. And the managers at the Pearl location at that time sucked. All they wanted is someone that would kiss their butt
bad,"Ik heb in totaal 1,5 jaar bij UA gewerkt bij de Brandstore, en ik heb veel mensen zien weg gaan. De management is lui, zit de heletijd op hun kantoor en komt bijna nooit op de winkel fleur. Hun proberen je te motiveren en pushen en vragen veel van je (mag niet eens naar de wc als je hebt geen pause hebt, je MOET in je zone blijven.) Maar verder geven hun geen goeie voorbeeld om te laten zien hoe het moet of om gewoon motivatie te geven an hun collegas. Verder worden taken en verantwoordelijkheiden die van de management zijn, op de verkoopmederwerkers neergelegd, zodat ze kunnen netjes vroeg op tijd (16.00 elke dag) naar huis. Daarom worden wij gevraagd om de winkel te sluiten met soms niet eens 3 mensen. Er wordt alleen gekijken om posities te vullen met extern mensen ipv collegas. Wij krijgde ineens een nieuwe manager die was niet eens 2 maanden aangenomen als assistant manager, en die wist niks en toonde geen interes in ons of de brand. Heel slecht ervaring, en de qualitei van de kleding is veel minder dan vroeger, prijzen zijn ook duurder dan in andere landen. Ik zou niet aanraden om hier te gaan soliciteren, zoiezo willen ze alleen maar goedkoop, tiener kracht ipv ervaren en professionale mensen. Zeer telergesteld en verspil van mijn tijd en initiatief."
bad,They didn’t have work of us when we came in of work and we was not getting paid a lot and people was always high on the job they told us we had to be work at before 6
bad,Extremely toxic! I have never experienced such blind arrogance in management and favoritism with associates at any work place until working at this store. I would say the brand is fantastic but stay away from seeking employment at this location. No matter how hard employees worked it wasn’t good enough and zero support from management. They also cut hours to give to other employees of their liking. Highly unethical!
bad,"Drama filled place, the management is a joke, and you slave and dont get paid much for it. Mangers were sleeping with employees and a guy was literally bullied everyday he came there and eventually quit."
bad,管理層作風有問題，啲同事都唔正常，跑半公私同事爭蹦頭，底薪低，福利差⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯
bad,This company I wouldn’t refer anyone to work there manager are prejudiced the have a lot of foreign there that don’t do anything the clothes are over priced don’t work for 1st team staffing they are very unprofessional to I didn’t leave anything I hated working there
bad,when you go to first team interview they will make it sound good but when you exactly star working there they will make you come all the way out Curtis bay just to tell you there are never no work and you have to stand on a dark bus stop alone
bad,I didn't like the lack of management..long hours and long days.no real break time and awhole lost of work that needed to be done.and also long drives from my home
bad,"nothing is professional, management does not help in regards to sexual assault claims. overall bad place to work because of  the clients and co-workers"
bad,"If you want to hate your life and be sad every second of your life then join the team, HA team... What a joke. I am shocked they are still in business. Treat your team like trash.."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and stay away. Workedy begins off for a month only to have shifts cut completely with no explanation. They want you working at a pace that burns you out within an hour. Highly recommend that you don’t work here. Store manager was alright, other managers were awful."
bad,Not a good job .... lack of supervision ... low pay short breaks we don’t get pay fair the job is just out of order you can’t grow at this company it’s just not a good place
bad,The management was rude and not very understanding when it came to the national guard. I would not recommend working here to anyone. Very stressful environment due to unorganized management.
bad,The management here sucks they look out for themselves and if you ever try and go up into management they will find a reason to fire you.they expect you to only stay as a worker
bad,No opportunity for advancement. Pay is terrible even if a raise is given. Short hours. Managers are very biased for hiring internally. Hated working here even after a year.
bad,"This Place is A complete Joke, DO NOT WORK HERE! UA is a younger company but with the amount of progress they have made they should be able to pay their associates more than $10.50/hr. I worked at the Orange location, and helped built that store, and what a waste of time. This place is a mess and will only give you about 12 hours a week MAX. IF you're lucky you will get 20-25 hours spread out over 4-5 Days which is a joke. One week I was scheduled to work one shift for 4 hours, how can anyone make a living like that. They expect you to be flexible with availability but that won't matter you'll end up with bad hours and will most likely close. There is a lot of folding and cleaning for this job and not worth the 50% discount you get. You have to be dressed in all UA so your paycheck will go to your work clothes. Very micromanaged and expect you to annoy the customers in order to make the daily sales plan. Also Side-note, Every one is Part-time except for management. Management's favorites will average 20-30 hours a week."
bad,I appreciate the way the managers work with their employees to ensure a good schedule is in place to make the company appear successful at all that they do
bad,boring and wasteful. don't waste your time. wouldn't recommend to anyone. Manager is spiteful. paid pennies on the dollar. can't prioritize responsibilities.
bad,"This place is a joke when it comes to work. Management needs a big overhaul. They tent to coach people on the sales floor in front of ""athletes"" management trys to coach while only hearing one side of the story. If they dont like you they will only give you 8hrs aweek. To make you leave. Not worth the drive not worth the time."
bad,"It sucks, it makes you feel like less than a person. Worst job I ever had and I love to work. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
bad,"awful work environment. untrained, unknowledgeable, imbecile better yet vacuous of managers. The store is equivalent to a day care. The store needs to be under serious investigations."
bad,"Relocate you, tell you your doing great, then cut you out of the blue.  Lots of gossip and cliquey people.  If you don't fit into the culture, don't even think you will be able to make a wave of potentially good effort here.  Because you will be exiled and looked down on."
bad,"Terrible you will work as a temp in a warehouse standing the whole entire shift no benefits unpaid holidays after two years some people are still temps the super visors are petty and show favoritism "
bad,The hours were too long. They only offered 12 hr shifts. You had to stand on your feet all day in one spot. I was mostly placed at station with people who didn't speak English. The temp inside was either very hot or very cold depending on the season.
bad,This was one of the worst companies I've worked for. Management does not car about their employees only about production & numbers.
bad,You get no respect or support from upper management. Problems don't get taken care of in a timely fashion..
bad,"Empresa no preocupada por el trabajador, pocos beneficios mucha rotacion de personal por lo mismo  pocas herramientas a los vendedores para mejorar en venta o capacitarnos ."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"I worked here at the building in Sparrows Point Maryland through a temp agency which is just as bad.  I started working at this facility months before their grand opening in February and all of my hard work was pretty much ignored for nothing without regard for a full-time position through Under Armour.  They give you a bunch of broke promises about how you can go from temp to hire but you never can. They're more apt to keep bringing in Temps and work them hard just to get rid of them whenever they feel like it.  When things come up like meetings and events come to appreciate their accomplishments you are disregarded like you didn't help the company work towards their goals. "
bad,"After 3 years of working here, I received one pay raise when I was promoted to a lead which only had me making $1 more than regular employees just being hired in. When I tried to move up to manager, they did an interview but never told me I did not get the job before bringing someone else in. And they still expect me to do manager shifts and run the store when our store manager doesn't want to work weekends."
bad,"Hard days work, not for the lazy minded...they dont pay extra for working the night shift, but they do offer 4 day work week. Id rather work the extra day to be honest"
bad,"This place is not where you want to work. People are miserable. Work is very intense, same thing everyday. Especially during peak seasons multiple times throughout the year. Work is eventually going to ruin your body , neck feet etc. This place is good for about a month. After that go to other green pastures. But they do help you perform your job better. Money is the cause of all the pain and suffering. Break room is filled with dirty electricity ,cell phones etc. U might like it, I hated it. Better off hiring robots. Get rid of all warehouses, 10 11 and hour joke."
bad,"I worked here for a few months and it was terrible. They kept promising to move me up because they were impressed with my work ethic, but never did. They had me doing the work of a lead without the pay. It is one of the most unhealthy work environments I have ever been in. Employees are disrespected and yelled at constantly. The store manger is horrible at his job and a bad person in general. I raised my concerns about his perverted behavior to Human Resources and nothing ever came of it. I quit because of how uncomfortable I was in the store. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company because they do not care about anything but numbers."
bad,"Stressful, no communication , boring , does not pay good for the amount of work it’s done, cuts too much hours , not fair with sick days, wouldn’t recommend"
bad,I did not like the job at Under Amour. It was a very stressful work environment due to the unprofessional management and employees. They have bad work hours and I feel you're under paid for the work labor.
bad,"People you work with are amazing, however management needs a total overhaul.  Consistant calls on days off and getting told off everyday from upper management is the downfall of the company.  Favourtism is well spread throughout the store amd ruling with intimidation is how they run the store.  They will never support you on growing with the company if they feel you are a threat to their position."
bad,"management,is ,vindictive ,mistreat employees on a regular basis and refer to it as a game ,very unprofessional.It is a seasonal  shift job with irregular hours and availability requests are not honored."
bad,"I would advise not to go here; not because of hard labor, that will be everywhere but because this organization is not up to date on what employees need to get the job done."
bad,"I've been working for Under Armour for less than a week and from my short time there it has been terrible. It's a sweat shop!! You are standing, walking up and down the steps, bending, lifting, pushing and pulling for 11 straight hour, NON STOP. You are not allowed to sit at all unless you're in the back office sitting in the AC or a supervisor. You only get a half hour for lunch and 2 20 minute breaks. The breaks really turns out to be 10 minutes because it take you 2-3 minutes to get to the break room and 2-3 minutes getting back. Keep in mind that this is 12 hour shifts. Not to mention that its no AC. They have these fans but that don't do much. The pay is ridiculous. Under Armour pays their employees next to nothing while raking in billions in profits yet they think its perfectly fine to pay their employees $10.58 a hour. If you're thinking about applying or working for Under Armour, DONT. Find another company to work for."
bad,it was ok just to slow in there alot of times there is nothing to do but just stand around
bad,"DONT DO IT!  New management has ruined the good and friendly work atmosphere that we had prior. Now everyone’s miserable, hours and requirements caused most long time employees  (3+ years) to quit. They don’t value their employees AT ALL.  They dropped the discount that they offer and they pay less than every other store at Tanger outlets. Look elsewhere I promise  it’s not worth the drama."
bad,"Bij UA worden salarissen vaak te laat uitbetaald, of komen soms helemaal niet.. althans bij het winkelpersoneel. Hierdoor hebben wij de slechtste kerst gehad die je je kunt voorstellen...Je moet er zelf achteraan bij de salarisadministratie. weinig communicatie met management. HQ is een regelrechte puinzooi! incompetente mensen die gek genoeg wel hard werken, maar dit absoluut niet slim doen door sterk verouderde systemen en software"
bad,"I would say if your looking for a fun, fast paced store this is for you. Buuut I wouldn't recommend this store, they set ridiculous standards that are impossible to meet. With all those high standards they will cut your shift for a whole week then turn around and say we need to work faster, tf don't cut the shift so we can get stuff done. Poor management and poor time management when it was time to clean the store up. Wouldn't recommend this location."
bad,"I came here from Ohio from another apparel company having loved the UA product. It was the worst mistake of my career and am trying to find a new home quickly. All of the passion is out of this place. My managers are new to UA and only seem to be interested in padding their resumes. 70 hour plus weeks are expected but mostly needed to fix the mistakes of management who have little understanding of the product or brand. I do work with some great people who have been around for a while. They have told me that it was much better in the past but most of them are actively looking to get out also as there is no confidence in current management. All the talk of team is just fluff. I understand that the retail stores are much better places to work. Needless to say, I would not recommend Under Armour."
bad,HR made everything difficult when it came to being in a management role within the building. They were never there to assist management when it came with employees. Management is young and sometime inexperienced with situations.
bad,i worked for the colorado mills location for about a week i was bullied by the other employees about my physical apperance and told the manager and she did nothing about it i didnt even get paid that week as well no all my hard work was a bust never work for this location or maybe another location is better than the one at the mills in colorado
bad,"An absolute horrendous place to work, full time that is. Upper management roles are all ""revolving doors"" and they will hire anyone, literally, with multi-unit experience whether it's retail or not. Very rarely do they promote from within. Policies, procedures, and duties change almost on a daily basis. Very little training is provided, and most of the District Managers don't even know how stores run operationally. Colleagues of mine have gotten fired for the tiniest mistakes. They try to treat factory stores like specialty stores, too much ""fluff"" implemented from a merchandising standpoint. I sincerely urge anyone looking to work there as a manager to reconsider. Part time isn't bad, as the hours are flexible and you're not given much responsibility. "
bad,Communicate with other stores as much as possible. Participate in your district. Don't challenge the process.  Trust the team to do the work. Stay in tune with FOH and BOH
bad,"I use to like come in to work at UA back when I first started it was everything I expected & more, Bonus every 6 months, Supervisors and managers used to come to building to building Introducing themselves u would be on first name basis with them, now Supervisors write u up for anything & every thing u do , & they don’t even tell you, it’s sad how they treat the Employees now"
bad,"At first I was excited to join the group as I was part of a different brand than Under Armour at first but as time went on, I notice that I wasn't getting any hours during the first week of January and I had to call them if there was any hours available but I had to join their stores private Facebook group to get someone's hours that they couldn't make or due to being sick or had plans on that day. During around the middle of January, I again called if there was any hours and the manager told me that I wasn't going to be sticking around by the 20th. The managers couldn't have told me during the first couple of weeks of January before I was let go. Some of the employees are cool and all but as time went on, I notice that they weren't as 'cool' as I thought and next thing I knew was that I was that they were talking smack behind my back. I would never go back to that store as long as I live."
bad,"Well, if you want managers that push you and embarrass you in front of customers, this is the place. They act like you're making commission. AND YOU AREN'T. Managers are childish and pick favorites."
bad,they work their employees to death with overtime and do not pay hardly anything. they let management run over the employees and treat them badly. They let the minorities get away with break rules because they are scared they will get sued.
bad,"Depending on your shift, the Sups and HR choose when they are going to give corrective actions. They will not forewarn you that you are close to pointing out. They will blame system errors and then term you. There is no consistency with their progressive action process. If your timid and allow people to disrespect you... this is the place."
bad,"In the beginning working under armor was so much fun, but as time went on things got disorganized, and the management didn’t seem to care as long as their sales were up."
bad,Avoid at all costs Nike and adidas pay better than under Armour does even for a normal sales associate you can make almost $2 more than a ua employee will
bad,Working here wasn't a hard job in fact it was very simple and fun. I learned a lot of new ways to fold and hang clothing and learned how to respect every store because people tend to be in a rush and make a mess.
bad,Site management was not supportive. Site management was very unprofessional in the way issues were handled. Site management did not treat all employees fairly.
bad,Never enough hours and always gives hours to the new hires and don't really care about the ones that have been there for a while if the store manger don't like you she won't give you hours
bad,Good company at first not many hours available after holiuday ends.
bad,"The management is awful."
bad,Retention rate is ridiculous. In the past 2 years there has been 20 different managers and leads at my store alone. Pay is horrible. Leads with keys start at 10 and assistants around 15 per hour. Work/life balance is nonexistent. 4am shifts and overnight shifts are mandatory and you aren't given a heads up. Store manager and district manager have favorites. Good luck trying to move up if you aren't best friends with management. I've seen so many hard working part timers get denied a new role just because someone else that wasn't great at their job was good friends with the store manager. Culture is the worst I've ever experienced in retail.
bad,They could offer a better pay for the workers and a more decent lunch  area and also parking they could better it more for there associates.also the discount on their merchandise.
bad,"The work place at under armour was great and the break room was wonderful ,manager was great .some employees were disrespectful most of the time but other than what I said under armour was ok but 12hr every 4day's"
bad,"If you’re a lead at the Woodbridge location, unless you’re a yes-man to the store manager, you’re definitely going to feel that your job security is being threatened. Behind your back, he’ll have the other leads on your back. They’ll text him every little thing you do wrong and then you’ll get a text going off on you. Another thing to note is that the store manager openly stated he didn’t want to hire any other females for leadership positions because they “argue” back. There’s no compromise. He wants it his way only."
bad,"The company was forced to layoff hundreds of employees all due to poor leadership (including from the CEO), and yet nothing has improved.  Workplace culture is a joke and non-existent, and almost everyone is overworked and underpaid.  People are dropping like flies!  Hardwork is neither recognized or rewarded.....its still all about who you know!"
bad,I worked here for 2 years. Overall the job was easy. I really enjoyed working for this company. When the new manager came in things changed drastically. He didnt give all employees a chance for advancement who actually wanted the advancement.
bad,"Shifts can be flexible. No set schedule. No room for advancement and managers are constantly on your back. New employees didn't last long. Very underpaid; there is a store discount for employees. Not very good training. Store cleanliness and customer service relied on few employees; there usually aren't enough employees to help. Most of the registers are always closed. Absolutely no help for the kids section. Managers stayed in the back, all the time."
bad,"I worked for under armour for 3 years and in that time the management severely deteriorated. When I began the entire management staff worked together to make the workplace a collaborative and fun environment. In the last year of my tenor, they switched management and I felt like I was being taken advantage of. No matter how hard I worked I was offered no raises and people who were hired after I was were earning more. The low pay was in no way worth putting up with the stressful and backbiting environment."
bad,work was low income communication on the assembly line was horrible because Koreans was the supervisor they could not speak much English break was 15 mins for 12 hour shifts and i learned hoe to sort clothes for different companies.
bad,"Under Armour stresses rapid growth and expansion, trying to grow 30 % year over year.  the problem is they sacrifice their employees to get there.  there is no team atmosphere for remote team members and employees are drastically over worked and under appreciated.  i was working 60 hour weeks, 7 days a week and i was told i wasn't doing a professional enough job.  management doesn't care if the employee needs help, makes statements and then lies just a few hours later.  the stress was off the charts high."
bad,"Schedule was changed almost daily, and they would say that the needs of the business had changed. Made it difficult to work there and attend classes. My education had to take priority. Many working there that did not speak English at all, so that put added responsibility on others to get the job done quickly and on time."
bad,"When I started at UA it was a part time which was fine, I was getting about 20 hours per week at $11.00 per hour then we be a test store for KRONOS and my hours were cut to 8 per week. In the last few weeks I've had shifts cut short or cut out completely and store conditions have suffered.  When KRONOS rolls out to all store (and it will) Teammates beware, you will lose hours and your store conditions will be rough considering you only get one hour to close regardless of budget. Its barely worth the 30% discount to continue working."
bad,There is no good communciation with the management or with HR. This happened after the first store manager left the company. My co-workers and I all got along very well.
bad,"Management sucked"
bad,"Very stressful sometimes."
bad,This a good job for someone who can work on weekends and late evenings. Not very flexible job. Customers can be rude. It’s Get paid very little for doing lots of work. Black Friday is the worst time to work there. You have to work a 9-10 hour shift for 3 days straight in the evening/night.
bad,Was very disappointed working here. I got hired here recently in their Ajax ON location store and it was okay at first but eventually there were some managers that was completely power tripping. And favouritism was showing a lot to other employees making others felt so discouraged working there. It’s been a month and the whole atmosphere most of the time negative and discouraging. I really wanted to enjoy working there but it’s just not working out...
bad,"Poor leadership and management. You have strong and honest employees working for years and years, but they hire your bosses cousin to be your boss and make you train them."
bad,"Most co-workers were good, but the store needs much more competency from management, and using the Kronos app for scheduling proved to be a disaster. There were usually not enough people to help close down the store. Management allowed lazy people to get away with doing nothing. Floor changes and markdowns should be outsourced. Commission should be included. Store can easily afford to pay more."
bad,"The coworkers are great, however the store manager is awful. She has no idea how to do her job, and treats the employees like children, even those who know the job inside and out, who know the job better than her in fact. Do not work here getting paid like trash to work with her is not worth your time."
bad,"This is a great place to work if you can ""drink the Kool-Aid."" In my experience people were over-worked and under-paid. Many management roles were filled by people with minimal experience and knowledge on how to lead a team. Campus also seems to be quite “clicky”. Although my experience with UA was not very pleasant, I believe it can be a great opportunity for some. Working at UA can be a great (short term) experience when placed in the correct position and on the correct team."
bad,"Under Armour is a highly energetic organization that prides itself on being fresh and innovative.  It is a youthful organization driven by many teammates who are under the age of 30.  But recently the brand has lost its mojo. Recent leadership upheaval and turnover has created doubts about company direction, which has been a huge blow to the overall morale of employees.  It is a great place to spend a couple of years and good to be able to put the UA line on the resume, but don't count on it being a career destination.  Despite statements to the contrary, there is very little advancement and promotion from within with the exception of a very select few.  Great place to be if you're young and looking to build your resume."
bad,"I would not work here again. My employment was full of favoritism, management bending rules wrongfully, poor working hours. I did learn from my time at under armor though, I worked in on floor set and learned how to inventory."
bad,The hours weren’t great and pay wasn’t the best but it was a decent place to work if you are able to work in fast paced places. The discount was good. But you had to wear only Under Armour all the time and even with the discount stuff was very expensive. The managers were all best friends and everyone talked trash about each other.
bad,They didn't understand my mnetla health issues and when I tried to talk to them about helping me with it they brushed it off. I worked in a large outlet mall so it was my first fast paced job.
bad,"Under Armour Chicago Brand House is a convenient place to work if a person is looking for a well paying part time job that is also flexible. The management is not great, explaining the high turnover rate."
bad,"I don't think UA has to be a bad place to work. However, my overall experience was pretty poor due to some extenuating circumstances. Its just the way things go in large public firms growing at an exponential rate."
bad,"Management (including executives) don't have or give clear direction.  They advertise an innovative, take control of your career culture, but to get something done, you need approval which can take years."
bad,Under Armour was very understanding of my issues when i was working there and helped me a lot . Although i feel as if pay is a little unfair. Managers and leaders should be more involved with associates.
bad,"This is a good place to work if you want minimum wage, terrible management, and no room for advancement. Management does nothing, while expecting part time associates to clean up after them and make sales so they can get an extra bonus. The store manager talks up internal promotions and opportunities for advancement, and yet I have watched qualified candidates from within the store get passed over for promotions for people who turned out to be very lazy."
bad,the work here was easy nothing too hard just working with a lot of boxes and clothes. had to stock everything. my main complaint was the lack of hours.
bad,"I was not a good fit. After, really looking at the culture of UA, it did not align with my personal or professional goals. I would suggest that anyone reading this, try working there for yourself. There are great opportunities, they just were not there for me."
bad,"UA looks great from a far but when you get up close there are many cracks in the ""Armour"". The management has no power and they hire young to get fresh outlooks but sacrifice experience in the process."
bad,The company as a whole is awesome. The store i worked in wasnt so much. Store manager had no drive and was not reliable. I dont really have a review for this company due to the fact i was only with them for a short while.
bad,"I work for a staffing agency called BBSI. They have me as well as hundreds of other BBSI employes there. The work is very simple. As long as you do what they say, you will be ok. But as far as getting hired on by the company, forget about it! You would be better off flipping burgers at McDonald's than do the work there for what they pay. They pay their employes $9.00 for what it at least suppose to be $10.00, that is nothing to live off of. There are a lot of hard workers, like myself, that have been there for roughly a year or more, yet not even hired on by the company. I'll remind you, we are team leads, and forklift drivers, yet not hired on and being paid $9.00/hr. How it works, simply, is if you are not their personal 'favorite', you simply do not get hired on, that is no matter how hard you work. There are young kids that haven't been there a month, yet they are given the positions instead of working for it, which is why I ended up leaving."
bad,"I agree with this quote,  they have Too many Relatives DESTRORYING The Company from inside: ""I worked here at the building in Sparrows Point Maryland through a temp agency which is just as bad. I started working at this facility months before their grand opening in February and all of my hard work was pretty much ignored for nothing without regard for a full-time position through Under Armour. They give you a bunch of broke promises about how you can go from temp to hire but you never can. They're more apt to keep bringing in Temps and work them hard just to get rid of them whenever they feel like it. When things come up like meetings and events come to appreciate their accomplishments you are disregarded like you didn't help the company work towards their goals."
bad,"A typical day would be: clock in, get sent to a section, clock out. Most of the time, you have to figure out the promotions and check which section you're in yourself. "
bad,"Management in my opinion was poor. Two young women as the managers, both with a lot on their plate inside and outside of work. I understand this job is retail and there is a lot of stress that comes with it, but never once did I feel comfortable or like family there. It is truly a part time job, and don't expect more. The discounts were great. I worked at the Clearance store, so our discount added to whatever the store had was nice. Just didn't feel connected with the other employees, and it wasn't a very ""fun"" or engaging job. Again, it is just a part-time job. When I was here I also had awful hours. Though I was a college student athlete and made it clear I was free the majority of the week aside from certain times or days, I worked maybe 4-8 hours a week. It was pathetic."
bad,They dont like to promote you unless you are buddy buddy with the management but they treat you well and expect a lot from you from what you get paid it isnt really worth it unless you sell out and work a lot then you get treated the best
bad,Under Appreciate. Try to squeeze everything from the employee. So much new technology yet they do lots of manual work like pen and paper. To cheap to invest in employees
bad,"This is not a good place to work if you want to make your way up the management ladder. Although, the people are extremely nice, there are more cons than anything. You do not get raises other than your annual raise (which is guaranteed under $.30). The pay, hours and discount sucks!"
bad,Everything in the beginning was wonderful and I loved my job. There was too much going on with the entire company which is why I'm in the situation I'm in. I'm not certain if I even have a future here. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.
bad,"Under Armour is not understanding, and they have poor management. Under Armour's work hours are harsh due to the long hours and intense labor. It is not worth the minimum wage pay."
bad,Under Armour Brand House is a cool place to work without the management. The managers are greedy and money hungry. They only really care about making sales goals and not so much about the employees. They have a poor system in place when it comes to switching shifts and calling off. You only have 48 hours after the schedule is posted to swap shifts which doesn't always work if you are a college student or have another job. The employees there are pretty good people working throughout college or just graduated so everyone around you has something going for themselves. It is a very easy job to have while in school and pays decent hourly. If you want to advance good luck cause its almost impossible as a president running for a 3rd term.
bad,"During orientation, it's like you're about to work in a high scale business, but once you begin working everything changes immediately."
bad,"Fast paced and stressful, but very manageable.  Learned a great deal about the industry but it was not helpful towards advancement.  No Retribution for whistleblowers depended on what subject was being exposed.  Hiring practices could benefit if moved to an outside source."
bad,"I was only hired as a seasonal worker and the other employees and assistant managers were amazing and great people to work with everyday. However the store manager was the complete opposite showing personal feelings and vendettas towards employees, and being a complete jerk rather than give you constructive criticism if you messed up or had a mistake on the job. Apart from that, the half off benefits on all products is wonderful to have as it is an expensive company, and the most enjoyable part was meeting so many different people from all over the world due to our location being very tourist attracted."
bad,"You can move up in the company if you are, a snitch, a suck up, and the color of your skin is white..so be prepared to work like a slave and not have enough money to make ends meet."
bad,The management team is wanting you to things they are not willing to set you up to be successful at. It's really about who you know and the buddy system when trying to move up.
bad,Verdadeira carruagem de abóbora. Pode parecer mais não é.
bad,"The team my peers were a part of were all based out of Austin with leadership in Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco. Management had the entire media team, account managers, project managers, data analysts, ad-ops, creative (copy and visual design) all take nearly a year of expensive, time-consuming, and ultimately hollow sales training to help secure media partnerships. This involved flights for 50-70 team members, catering, hotels, and the work of a third party sales training consultancy. Once we made it through all the training, leadership gave it about 3-4 months to watch those numbers skyrocket. When they didn't since less business was in the pipeline because of all the training, they laid off most of the team. Time wasted. Money burned. Myopic leadership who all kept their jobs. They also had no transition plan for high paying media partners who were already working with UA. Plus, internal teams that relied on our group had no knowledge of the strategy shift and were left wondering what was going on, because a poorly rolled out series of cutbacks in 2018 extended to 2019 and they were supposedly done. What a mess. Just check the stock price. Oh, you get discount shares there."
bad,"Come into work, do the same thing over and over again for only $10 a hour when 90% of other retail stores in the area are paying more. Work is not hard or tedious, but the pay for the job compared to other similar jobs in the area is much lower. Employees here often complain about the pay that they receive but know that if they ask for a raise they will not get one. Employees with more experience and a higher leadership role are sometimes paid less than coworkers with less experience. Agree with the other review, many employees only continue to work here due to the discount, if it were to change many would leave. No real threat of job security because many people decide to not even show up to the job their first day. The reason for this is because Under Armour forces you to buy your own uniform. That means multiple pairs of pants/shorts, tops (shirts, hoodies, coat) and a pair of shoes. This can be quite expensive for the normal person working minimum wage. While the big discount helps, it still is quite expensive."
bad,Enjoyed my immediate coworkers and fostered good friendships. The management is allowed to skate by and throws lower-level employees under the bus is needed. Upper level management not reprimanded after harassment complaints and discrimination compliants against female workers.
bad,On a scale of 1 to 10 I give working at Under Armour 80 because it is a very stressful workplace and things change all the time and they take a lot of things away from the employees that employees should have for working in such a dangerous environment and the salary should be more
bad,The company is very cut throat. They throw alot of rhetoric around but never actually fulfill their promises. Managment are ego maniacs who do not take outside ideas as valid.
bad,"Pros: They give an awesome employee discount, they are very flexible with your schedule, and a fun work environment."
bad,I had a very positive work experience until a different Manager was brought in who did not fit the work culture and reported the store for absurd things and targeted specific genders and cultural backgrounds attacking persons beliefs and demanding respect for their own.
bad,"Under Armour is a decent job, however if you're looking for something with good steady hours this is not the place. They keep anywhere from 20-30 sales associates on staff and that makes it so everyone only has 1-2 shifts per week."
bad,it was an ok place to work but wouldn't give any hours just your basic retail job
bad,Working with the teammates to ensure maximum productivity. Typical retail job.
good,"If your a person of color they will be very racist to you, treat you very bad, management is unskilled/ racist to people who are not white, they do pay more then nike"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of folding clothes, keeping the floor neat and organized, providing customer service both on the floor and at register, helping on register when required, restocking, cleaning, and associating with customers. I learned a lot about the product as well as different ways to sell an item. The management was a bit of a mess but it all pulled together after a little bit, they were all young and weren't really understanding with situations. My co-workers were all really close with one another from working together so much. The hardest part of my job would have to be finding a customer a product similar to something they wanted if we didnt have the exact one in stock at that moment. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to have been the atmosphere as well as the people i worked with."
good,"I work there now team 4 distrib, sorting with rf they gave me three days 11 hrs a day overtime after 33hrs wich we never get get called off once a week checks come out to about 200 if your lucky"
good,"I was mistreated as a worker. I wasn't fully respected for the role I was in. management was very rude and took advantage of my kindness. I would drop what I was doing to support them, but never got the support back."
good,"You clock in, go to work. Work four to five hours then take a 30 minute break. Go back to work then head home. Put clothes in a box. It is a very hot place to work in."
good,its very hot and very long hours. I learned a lot of skills and management experience. every person for them selves a lot of room to advance in company
good,"Under Armour was an exciting company to work for. The brand is growing by the minute and it was fun to be a part of the growth. However, the hardest part of the job was their expectations of sales associates on the floor. I disliked having to jump on customers the second they walked in and push products on them. I also disliked having to follow them around. There is a fine line between being helpful and being annoying. It felt like we were being asked to cross that line too often, all just for a sale."
good,"I worked there for two years. While there, it was a revolving door of employees, most people did not stay over a few months. Even if I finished my assigned jobs they would make me stay late until all the jobs were done. This meant that if you were working with other employees that did not care you had to do it all yourself. I once got out at 3 am when my shift ended at 11 pm, without any additional breaks. Lower level management was really good; that was one of the reasons I stayed so long. However, they two turned over and the ones they replaced them with were nowhere near as good."
good,"Work environment is very fast paced. Not recommend for those who are used to more relaxed environments, but they keep you busy which is a good thing. You never feel like you are just wasting time on meaningless tasks. Pay and management could be better. The starting pay for stock is very low compared to other stock jobs that are less demanding. Management can identify what needs to be done in the store, bit lacks the leadership abilities to teach employees how to get it done."
good,Typical work day is to engage with customers and no one else. Asking questions to other teammates is not encouraged by management. Most enjoyable part of the job is recomending something to athletes that shop at Under Armour knowing that they will enjoy the product as much as you did.
good,"Work life balance is non existenent, not for people who want a family. "
good,There are a few things that's good and bad about under Armour.. False advertisement is one those things... I thought in big company's if you come in and work hard as a temp... Than Under Armour will hire you.. But to make a long story short theirs pretty much no advancement as far as a career in that particular field.
good,"Starting out, working there used to fun, fast-paced, and enjoyable. Before leaving there, working there was not enjoyable, the pay was barely above minimum wage for the work performed, raises were unheard-of, and the store manager was not the best to work for. Normally after working for 60-90 days, most employers will give employees a pay increase, not this company. After working there for almost 1 year I saw nothing but empty promises and lack of hours with an open availability. The company claims that they hire from within for management positions but many managers and former ones came from other companies and the store manager has no intention on hiring great workers who they even recommend apply for a higher position."
good,"hardest part of the job the schedule: 4 days a week, 10 hours a day from 4pm-2:30am."
good,Under Armour used to be a fun and innovative company.  Over the recent few years as sales have dipped they have taken to putting more processes in place which in-turn has slowed internal innovation.
good,"It was a very hard place to work unless you were with the company for a long period of time, "
good,"Its fun to work with people who are fun and make work exciting. Occasional laughs and helping each other out is nice and makes work enjoyable. However, management was not very good. Micromanaging employees and being passive aggressive to workers was one of the things that made coming to work unenjoyable. The managers did not know how to properly manage their employees. They weren't reasonable when it came to having a death in the family and not being able to take off a day or two from work. Giving certain employees working at the same level as other different priorities and allowing them to do things others get caught for."
good,"When I first started with this company is was excited and motivated.  It was a great place to work with great benefits.  I learned alot from my initial manager, built my skill set, and gain much technical knowledge.  When the company went public and I was appointed a new supervisor things changed drastically."
good,"Right people in the right place for success. Something heard a lot from upper management and wasn't a problem really until someone in upper management was no longer the right person. Previous managers were focused on growth, development and a healthy life/work balance. This shifted with the new management that seemed focus on creating their own new team, instead of working with the one inherited."
good,"No major difference from working here than other stores. Obviously, procedures in processing and merchandising are lacking due to management guidelines but all places have those problems. If you are looking for a place to work where you don't care about the place past the time you clock out then this is for you. Hhthhybybgy"
good,"Just another gloomy warehouse. It's a place to get quick cash to survive. If anyone ever work at a warehouse, they would understand. Under Armour, Amazon, etc., they are all the same"
good,Management is not good at all. Job is great for college students or people looking for their first job. There is no on the job training and no room to move up.
good,"Not a bad place to work for at all, especially as a stepping stone. It allows for advancement in the company, or is comfortable for those at ease with being an associate."
good,"The only thing good is the benifits. The pay is not that good, just like the management team. They could be a really good company if they would change the culture, which promotes over the top egos."
good,"An average day is pretty much like any other retail job. It is a pretty fun work environment and there isn't too much pressure put on the associates. The discount is a really great perk, 50 percent off. We get to wear workout clothes to work every day which is awesome. The pay is pretty bad, though, especially for such a big company. Anyone over the age of 19 or 20 cannot survive off of 8.30 an hour. There is a lot of turmoil within management, quite unprofessional and petty."
good,I got paid pretty well off the start. Management was great besides one person. I would recommend working there for someone who is really into sports and athletic wear. The employee discount is really nice.
good,"It was whatever nothing like wowwww just the average like any other job I guess wasnt much to complain about in my opinion, overall it's a decent company to apply for"
good,"When I started 2 years ago in July the culture there was so peaceful and fun, everyone got along with eachother and everyone got fair hours. The store manager took every concern into consideration and was always willing to listen to suggestions to make things run smoohter. He even promoted me to a lead position. After the store manager had to quit do to some person reasons the enviroment at the store changed. We went from 6 managers to 2 for 3 months. Then we got a new store manager and 3 more new managers. A lot of drama started and HR had to get involved. (lets just say they brushed it aside and did nothing) so I left."
good,"every job is what you make it. you can focus on the negative or the positive. If it's not what you are wired for it will seem negative, if you look for the good you will find it."
good,"Not a horrible place to work but suffers from extreme nepotism.  Employees are treated as a commodity and one's worth is only determined by efficiency numbers and of course ""connections.""    Most management has little to no training or experience due in part to extreme nepotism and cronyism.  The pay is below other warehouses in the area and retention is extremely low for most of the above-stated reasons, which management doesn't seem to care about."
good,"My time at Under Armour was short, and could be a but hectic at times. I was given a lot of responsibility with very little direction. Some times, it worked out, other times it did not."
good,The hourly team are some of the best you'll meet. The leadership staff did not communicate well and did not always appreciate the hard work put in daily. The company did not live up to hype of a great place to work.
good,great perks...like taking everbody to a Sounds game..cookouts...full gym and basketball court.... work is hard and pay is decent..alot of favoritism for promotions
good,I enjoyed working here. A typical day is 4 hours and spent with a combination of cashiering and assisting customers trying on clothes or showing them gear they are looking for a specific sport.
good,Fun team to work with and has flexible hours. Managers willing to work with teammates that have multiple jobs or really busy family lives. Hours are decent and work isn't that hard.
good,"Considero que faltan incentivos para los empleados, y reconocer que la experiencia y el estudio también cuentan a la hora de tener un salario."
good,"It was an easy job, but it would have been better if they would pay us more. But overall the job and people were good. It needs to be managed better."
good,"Overall Company Culture is amazing. CEO is inspiring, campus is updated constantly with all the amenities and preaches a work smart, not work long mind set. Unfortunately this mind set is lost within each department. Upper management acting only to advance and employees bear the brunt. It is disheartening as an employee to work for such and amazing company but no accountability at the manager/director level. Management will actually block you from applying to other positions in the company in order to keep you from leaving their department."
good,Good for a young person between 16-20 years old to work at. I learned a lot about the product.
good,"learned how to complete what I started,great place to work co-workers was fun to work with."
good,"Great place to work, met many co-workers who are considered very close friends now. Fast-paced at peak times/days, customer service, physical labour etc."
good,"Company is big on external hiring and lacks internal promotion opportunities. Dress code is great and benefits are good, you can accumulate a lot of PTO time."
good,"Great benefits, discount on product is good. You have to be sports minded. Not for everyone. It is all about the Brand, the Brand, The Brand. Get it done Done Done"
good,The employees are great people. I enjoy working there but only as a part time job as their rate of pay isn't great but they do compensate with a great discount as the employees must wear their clothing to work in.
good,"Although the products and discounts that Under Armor offers, is amazing... The management team makes you regret going in for your shift. The store manager never cared about anything, but would instantly yell at the staff if the conversion was down, as if it was their fault no one was buying anything. None of the managers really knew what they were doing and still don't. They suck up to all corporate employees, but then treat their team like trash once they're gone. Typical day at work is standing and being told to fold, but then being yelled at for doing exactly what you were told. And when the goal of the day isn't made, you instantly feel like YOU personally did something wrong."
good,"Very fast paced warehouse, the day included but not limited to packing, unpacking boxes, counting,scanning and packing boxes to be shipped. Made sure the areas were straightened for the next shift."
good,UnderArmour is a great retail job. Part-time and lots of employees. Management was organized and settled. I learned sales techniques and how to sell a popular brand.
good,"Starting out this company has got a ways to go, however as time goes by they are growing to meet the need of not only their consumers but employees as well. Managment still seems a bit unstable."
good,UA is a company driven to find the next great product to help athletes achieve their goals.
good,Under Armour is a great place for first time retail workers that want to get experience.  A typical day at UA could be very stressful at times but you could always make the best of it.
good,"Under Armour was a great place to work when it was expanding rapidly. As growth slowed they went through layoffs and a lot of management turnover, made it a tough place to work."
good,The only thing that I had a problem with was the management. I quickly learned that if you communicate your schedule or any problems with with a manager they will work with you to maximized your productivity.
good,"Always cared more about shipping quantity over quality "
good,"I would work at the warehouse for Under Armour. Most of the day, if not all, I would hang apparel. If people were needed in other sections, we would be sent to help. I would be sent to put some stickers on some boxes or help workers from other sections to pack orders."
good,The team is dedicated to keeping the workplace clean and fun for all employees. Management does a great job of helping you with your work hours if you have to change or if life happens and you need time off or a shift change.
good,It's like any other retail job location. The hours were horrible as the shifts are never consistent each week. Good employees but the management can be a mess at time.
good,"I am currently working as a customer service rep for Under Armour.  The experience varies on a day to day basis, you learn a lot about the history, culture and products.  They provide you with extensive training for the SAP and interactive customer data systems.  It is a great experience of speaking to different customers and understanding their needs."
good,"Alright, feels like a highschool football team if you're into that sort of thing, too competitive and hoo-rah for my taste. If you like getting dirty looks for not wearing under Armour colors on armour day than this is the place for you."
good,"Hired as a salesman and stockman. Was moved to shipment processing at hours of 2AM-7AM three or four days a week Just unboxing products, hanging garments, and security tagging them."
good,it was a fast paced job that forced you to stay moving and to keep working even if your job was done;there wasnt much traing maybe an hour the you were o the clock.
good,"Relacionamento/treinamento Comportamental"
good,I enjoyed the people I work with. I did not like the environment for someone just beginning their career. It was hard to learn since it's so fast paced and no one is willing to mentor you. Communication gaps were detrimental. It was hard to be a woman there since it had such a frat house mentality. If everyone would let go of their egos it would be a much more successful company.
good,"The culture at the start seems good but after working there for months you see it's not all that it lives up to be. It's basically UA or die example you must spend every moment of your life dedicated to UA coming in on your off days seems mandatory, staying late is looked at as mandatory."
good,Constantly watched by the managers when there was nothing to do. Didn't get a chance to learn anything new because they didn't have time to teach the newbies.
good,"A great company to work if you are looking for the latest in athletic clothing innovation, a fast paced environment, and to expose yourself to a high volume of customer service related problems/solutions. I was fortunate to be employed near the Canadian/U.S. border so we always had a myriad of diversity in people compared to other retail locations, but at the same time it preps you for the numerous situations that arise from high traffic, large volumes of product to sell, and even language barriers. I gained a lot of experience in dealing with sales and people that has helped me mature. If you want to know the latest in clothing for an ever increasing athletic culture, work at Underarmour, but be prepared to have the company almost never be accommodating to the employee, always the customer."
good,"no a great career move with high turnover"
good,"It's a good place to start your working career.  the turnover is to be expected from a retail standpoint, but it also allowed for more team members to show their leadership skills."
good,Ienjoy working there and meeting new people from different back grounds and cultures . Its a team effort working there
good,"Good discount, poor lower level management, good products to sell"
good,I really cant remember anything about this job since i worked there 2 years ago and i had 2 more jobs since.
good,"Under Armour is a fun, entrepreneurial company with a great campus and a good energy."
good,"Solid benefits and advancement opportunities. High stress environment, constantly changing schedule. Tough to balance life at work and home if you are not single."
good,Under  a okay company. Ok environment  good job if you’re just coming out of high school and starting college. The discount from the company  is well  Management is OK
good,the energy of the brand was amazing! always looking to be inspired by what's new and how to be the first to the market through innovation and technology - management just did not know how to make a decision/ direction to take most times.
good,"New company as far as retail stores go.  Need to be flexible to needs of business.  Pending volume, work life balance can be a bit tricky.  Building a great team is the key to success."
good,Nice place to work at very clean nice workers i enjoy coming to work there long shifts tho pay is really good also but in the summer time it gets really hot in the building
good,A typical day at work would be trying to meet a target given by store  manager. This gets very competitive within the work place and not always for the best.
good,As an Under Armour sales associate in an outlet mall the volume of customers was constantly high. It was a fast paced environment that required attention to detail.
good,It's physical job I put the things in boxes. first I scanned the all things after that I regulate the things in the same boxes and after that I printed the labels and I stick the labels on the boxes.
good,Great place to work as a part-time college student with the opportunity to move into full-time work. Fun work environment for athletes who still want to stay involved in the sports world after playing days end.
good,"The job is whatever nothing really good about here. benefits are paid are included, but the management is horrible. when people become supervisors/managers they really switch up. they will work you to the bone if it means making the company look good."
good,"This was just lie any other sales associate job, the people who you work with during your shift we'll probably dictate what kind of day you're going to have"
good,"A typical day you would come in and look at the playbook to find out what section of the store you were in. The culture of the store is okay most of the teammates were friendly. However, management is terrible. It is clear that they all hate their jobs, so they take it out on employees and customers. If a manager was in a bad mood,  be prepared for them to ignore you, while they walk around grumpy. The most enjoyable part of the job are the teammates and how flexible they are with scheduling. The hardest part of the job was dealing with attitudes from management. I think the store needs a team of new managers."
good,My time at under armour was eclipsed by scrambling to pick up shifts to make a decent dollar with the amount of employees just working for the discounted clothing
good,"It was pretty laid back for the most part. I would basically help out customers with their wants and needs, and help them decide on what was best fit for them."
good,Under armour is still your classic workplace in retail and the sporty atmosphere makes it better.  The only thing that killed the vibe for me were some of the employees were just unbearable
good,"I worked there for 2 years and only got a 25 cent raise. This was not for lack of effort to advance or get higher pay.  Store managers were not permitted to review salary with sales associates, so chance s of advancing at the company were low. Overall it was a fun environment but I got tired of long hours and little money."
good,I loved the hours. 
good,"Working at Under Armour definitely has its perks: the generous employee discount, the innovative technology they are building and ability to acquire great talent. The cons would be that it's difficult for them to keep good talent since the job advancement is so limited and competitive"
good,"I worked at Falls Road Animal Hospital during schooling.  it was a great experience during my education.  I had the opportunity to meet many clients, and build relationships with the staff."
good,Worked in hanging coats and putting stuff in boxes. I was not there long to learn too much. Learn something new. Fast pace working environment. Eight hour work week.
good,a typical day at under armour would be alot of walking this job wouldnt  be ideal for one who is used to being relaxed it is a very fast pace work place
good,"it was fun labeling the items and working on the assembly line,  I didn't like having to place clothing items on the hangers the clips were a little hard for the Dickie's jogging shorts. but somehow i managed to get through my days of working. it was so far out Curtis Bay from Baltimore city traveling. I was working through a temp service at that time so some days I drove out there paying a toll, only to be sent back home because of group fulfilment, they had three other staffing agencies hiring temps on daily basis.."
good,"Nothing to say the rating says it all does it not?"
good,"Under Armour is a social place. It is a place to work and also a place to talk to your co-workers, sometimes even more than the customers. The attitude in my workplace is negative. No one is happy, but no one seems to want to leave due to the great discount. Raises are hard to come by and are not earned by how good of an employee you are, but what corporate decides to give to you, based on random selection. I have work for 2+ years and I finally received a raise. Other co-workers who were just hired in were making more money than I was right off the bat. It took months of complaints to finally get a tiny raise."
good,"Shifts were hard to come by but overall the job isn't too bad. I have gone weeks without shifts and then I'll get near full time hours for one week. Also, the work culture isn't too bad but sometimes it's horrible."
good,its retail. you work all the time. the discount is great for the employees. again management was not good. it took a few to finally get the right one.
good,Not a bad company to work for.  They do seem to care about their employees and you get a discount.  There aren't a lot of opportunities to advance though.
good,"Working at Under Armour kept me busy. I also liked the fact that they placed me and the person I was carpooling with work in the same area. Working with this company was easy because I was working on the same this everyday, so when I got to work I already knew what to do with no questions asked."
good,"I enjoy working at UA however the company over hired sales staff for the summer leaving many with less than 20 hours a week of work, resulting in myself and a few others in search of a new job."
good,"Fold clothes and keep customers happy"
good,"Clean display cases , shelves , and aisles "
good,"you interact with costumers for 8 hours long and many of them dont speak any english, the management was very good with working with my internships and with school."
good,Everyone was cool for the most part but the pay was horrible and the warehouse is always hot which is expected at most factories but their were places in the factory where they could of had fans and didnt.
good,this company is fun to work for i loved how comfortable i was able to be at work. we used team work everyday and it was a fun place to be
good,It's an ok place. But the pay is great and a chance to advance in the workplace are very low. But there are really good people and good enviroment.
good,het leukste van de baan was dat het een nieuwe winkel was en dat je zoiets leuks kan meemaken dat je bij een opening van de winkel erbij bent!
good,"very exciting to learn new things excel in customer services"
good,"Under Armour has a fun work environment to work at, but the managing staff is the only down fall.  Policies are only enforced by managers towards no-management staff.  Management staff is not held accountable."
good,The people was what made the place fun to work at. It was hard at times when you do not have great communication with between managers. Love the product!!!!
good,I love the people I work with. I feel like a part of a team. There isn't a hard part of my day. I fold and hang clothing all day. Management is willing to work with my schedule.
good,"Only worked a couple times the whole while I was hired. The people were nice. The discount was more nice. Liked it, and I would work there again if they called me because a job is a job at the end of the day."
good,"- fast paced retail store"
good,"A day at work would include stocking the floor, greeting customers at the door and working the shoe section of the store."
good,The company is pretty good but for entry level employees theres not much incentive to do your best as a lot of the work is mindless. There are great people I work with and that is why I have stayed at the job for a while. There doesn;t seem to be job advancement unless individuals have worked there for at least two years.
good,"Working at UA is a lifestyle more than a job. We have a strong emphasis on culture which can be a dual edged blade sometimes."
good,"always changing and never had consistency. changing wasnt the problem, it was how the changes happened.  Communication wasnt good and was last minute."
good,"I spent 4 years with UA in a 7.5 million dollar (sales) store.  LOVE the brand and the staff. Management / Corporate demands a lot however, very task oriented. The sales comes first, and the people come second in this industry.  Policy regulates everything vs. common sense.  Stores are very structured, so there's no 'owning' your store, by the book in all areas. FT Benefits were amazing, which is what kept me there. CONSTANT turn over in management all the way up the Corporate ladder made being a 'team' culture impossible. I would avoid this company as management, but as a sales associate, if you love the gear and discount, it's a fast paced, but fun environment."
good,"Enjoy the job, but pay was really low compared to many other sales associate jobs in the outlets. Coworkers are helpful. Management is very knowledgeable about the entire store."
good,A typical day at work is looking for spots on the floor hat are empty as well as working with the stock team to make sure all new items received are sent straight to the floor. I learned that teamwork in this job is essential a lot of people try to go lone wolf and it never works out and slows everyone down. Co-workers are okay people that like to hangout after work. Hardest part of the job is trying to communicate with mangers your ideas and plans for the week. Unless you have a manager who likes you a lot getting what you need or assistance is no easy task.
good,"12 hour night shift 7pm-7am packing clothing, scanning boxes, hanging clothes. You learn how to work as a team and to multitask at a fast pace. management is ok and the co-workers are friendly and help to get the job done. the hardest part of the job is the long hours besides that everything is ok"
good,"A Typical day at Under Armour was base on making sure the store was clean, treat every customer equal, and make sure you reach your sale goal. I learned to have an excellent customer service. Provide customer with the best experience when buying the gear with Under Armour. The hardest part of the job was not having holidays off or working late hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have the discount when purchasing the gear."
good,Overall a great company to be a part of. Great culture and a fun environment with a lot a young employees.
good,An amazing culture to be apart of.  A lot of team building exercises.  Wonderful  people to work with.  New challenges everyday and new adventures to conquer.
good,"Job is easy and relaxed but you are on ya feet A LOT. My schedule is  Mon.-Thurs. 5 AM to 3:30 PM; 30 min break and a 30 min lunch."
good,"Pretty chill place to work.i we"
good,"I loved working here had a great time with everyone I worked with, one of the most annoying things was not being able to do returns and exchanges without a manager"
good,Under Armour distribution house in Rialto is very unique. It is nothing like other dusty warehouses. It is fun for anybody who does not have experience as they cross train you in all departments.
good,"Working there was okay. Theirs thing that could be better with management, but other than that is okay. The culture there is very laid back and chill. Not much of a hard time. Most days are very easy."
good,"I worked at Under Armour for over a year, and I was one of the higher paid employees at $8.50 and hour. Young employees are now making barley more than minimum wage at 7.50-8.00. For a booming company they really don't pay you for good work and long hours."
good,Underarmour is a nice place to work at the jobs are easy the hours are long and its a nice environment to work in. I really liked the weekend schedule because it allowed me to work on weekend and be a farther during the week. I think only downsides are the expectations they want a lot from u. So if u don't plan to do a lot of work than underarmour is not for u. I worked in picking expectations was to pick 1 tote a min for 12 hours u do the math.
good,"Scheduling had a few issues where they scheduled me on dates that I had stated I was unavailable. Other than that it was a good work experience, a very laid back environment, easy to help the customers."
good,"Under Armour was a fun place to work, but you have to be there for a long time to move up anywhere."
good,It gets the bills paid the pay just sucks through a temp agency. Employees are really diverse at under Armour. The work is East they don’t expect too much from one person. The hours aren’t overly long and the warehouse is accessible through the bus
good,"The work is not hard and you are expected to meet production, but are given time to adjust to your position first. Just hope you don't have to deal with the office, because they take their time with everything. Took 2 weeks to get my badge"
good,"Working here was very flexible, but some times management was not good at all. Especially when trying to get hours. The pay wasn't that great as well."
good,"the job itself is cool and fun to work at. As far as the Grand Prairie location, the Management team could use a makeover but the company compensates great, and they make it fun to want to work there. ONE Team ONE Dream"
good,"Under Armour is a great company that challenges  their employees to be the best person they can be. We were always asked to, innovate and create any ideas s that would benefit the workplace and the company."
good,"Focus on customer, store presentation"
good,I loved working there and the people I worked with just didn't like being told I was being kept on after the holidays only to get zero hours. A job isn't much good if you're never scheduled to work.
good,"fun place to work great discount and you can stack discounts with sales items, not many hours for part time employees. The store I worked for had GREAT management."
good,enjoyable place to work at. very enjoyable pace and workers. unload and load trucks was my main specialties in this area. management was acceptable. the employees was very enjoyable to work with
good,"Good for part time work. Managers are great, a few hours a shift then your out. fun place to work. Hard to move up to manager."
good,under armour was good opportunity for me to build up my work experience & grow in the community field.i would recommed this to people who are unexperienced  to get good work skills that will qualify them for warehousing experiece.
good,Love working at under armour very friendly people and mangers  everybody get along no drama everybody work together and get things done like it supposed to.
good,A typical day i would come in to work go about job duties. I learned many aspects of the job. I loved working with my co -workers. The hardest part was there wasn't real good communication between managers and employess.  The most enjoyable time was with friends and co-workers and just being able to joke around with them.
good,everybody was fun to work with and the management was more of friends then managers. just really fun place to work.
good,"Under Armour was a good experience, its a relatively new company, but definitely up and coming. The staff was lovely as were the hours, fun work environment. One bad thing though management could sometimes lack a backbone."
good,Its fun and fast paced and has good benefits and the managers are cool. the hardest part of the job is the 12 hour shift.############################################################
good,its a real easy job to do working 4 days 1 week and 3 days another week 40 hrs or more i was working there with  a temp urgency called 1st team staff.
good,"It's not a bad place to work at, but you better have another job because you won't get enough hours to make a good living. Also there are only a couple full-time positions, so don't expect much out of moving up."
good,"I was very busy, as it is a very busy store.  I loved working with the public. I am a definite people person, love being busy all of the time. And I love Under Armour"
good,"Under Armour isn't a bad place to work, sometimes it can be very stressful, with Black Friday or Christmas season. I do love a good challenge but corporate doesn't plan well for hours."
good,it was a OK place to work at the store managers are mean and talk very disrespectful to employees they work atmosphere was bad and manegment always had attitudes with employees
good,this Is a great company to work for if you looking for a part time job. Love how you can dress really comfortably and always smile through your day...
good,Shedule was 5 am to 3 pm. It was stressful. I have a bad spine. The job was easy but the bending and standing really takes a toll over you and they only give you two breaks that are a hour apart.
good,under armour is a fun place to work. they really strive for great customer service and sales. they do commend you on your work when you do well. however they are not always so appreciative of the hard work given by their employees. management is pretty self righteous.
good,They tend to be strict on you aboutdays you take off and if you are a productive person if you are not they will find a way to fire you. I dont recommend it unless you dont have any other choice
good,"Overall working at under armor was very fun and a great experience all though they  never kept the same manager , each week we had a new manager..only a 15 min lunch break after working 8 hours"
good,"Fun place to work and a great brand to be apart of, except taking advantage of the staff and not treating employees in a professional and appreciative manner."
good,"Under Armour was a good place to work, with long hours and not much time for family."
good,A typical day at work is quite busy and the job itself has its ups and downs but there are only benefits for those who are recruited to managerial positions.
good,"Good job, nice coworkers, just needed more hours. Management could be better, but they are great people to work with. Great discount, usually spend your paycheck on clothes though."
good,"The job was easy enough, but the pay was pretty low. All the other associates were super easy going and easy to get along with, but there was an issue with management."
good,I was young when I started and finished working there. The hours were short shirts and not many days given a week. it would of been a better experience if it was not in the sales department.
good,"Under Armour is Great. But the brand ambassador role is new and still has a lot of kinks to work out. The work life balance is 0 because you work Wednesday to Sunday every week. I cant say anything about the corporate side, but field servicing has a lot of room to grow."
good,"The coworkers were great to work with and the store manager was very helpful and nice. It was nice to get a discount for the clothing that has to be bought as uniform, but it can be hard to continue keeping up with the changing styles. One hard part of the job was not being able to be more active within the shoplifting aspect. I learned a lot more about the manager side of retail and was able to be an associate manager for a short while. My supervisor was a great mentor."
good,"This is a great, albeit, young company. I loved working with this company. It was fun, energetic, and always changing."
good,"Not enough hours, too many employees. Good company good managers, nice employee incentive just wish there was more consistency in hours available for people."
good,Great store discount and I enjoy my hours. They will work with your schedule if you come to work. Its an easy job. The holiday season is always tricky but those discounts help when you want to buy your immediate family presents.
good,It's a good company great benefits. Long work hours good management. Learned a lot of good skills. Great discount on merchandise. Got to meet a lot of good people
good,"it was a consistent job where long hours/days were required then in turn turned to fast days at work, enjoyed the work atmosphere and the great group of individuals that were involved"
good,The job itself was pretty easy but the hours in the pail no natural light environment made me feel depressed and like I was working my last days with no other option in life
good,The temp agency that u guys have working with y'all let go a lot of good workers. They dont play fair and they pick their family over good workers. Love to come back and work with u guys. Just not under first team.
good,Working at Under Armour was fun because there were a lot of pretty cool customers. There was never a dull moment with my co-workers. I honestly loved coming into work!
good,This position is great for first time/student who want flexible hours. This place of business helped build teamwork; trust and sales associate experience
good,"Great place to work!"
good,I find the atmosphere at Under Armour to be great and the mission and statements are all superb to follow. The main complaint I have is the limitation on hours. I am currently a Sales-Lead there and I am being paid just a few cents more than the average Sales Associate and only getting between 22-27 hours even though others are getting more.
good,"Most enjoyable part of part of the job is being able to lead and assist  team mates in achieving company daily goals. Also,very impressed at  how such a diverse group of people were  able to refuel, regroup and come together as a whole for a great team effort daily."
good,Nothing bad to say would’ve like to known that the temporary positions would be so quick was expecting 2 months instead of 1 but overall good worksite
good,It was a decent work place to work in its a very busy place but the work was reasonable for an 8hr job and this warehouse was my 1st warehouse I worked at
good,Some days To hot some days to cold fast past lots of moving parts and people's. Warehouse management thought me how to operate folklifts n pallets jacks
good,Love the team members and management at Under Armour. They made it feel like I was part of another family. Loved being able to go to work and feel comfortable.
good,Assisting customers by answering their queries and ensuring that their visit at the store was pleasant and satisfying. Also ensuring that the area or zone given was maintained.
good,"met a lot of people and learned a lot of valuable things. I gained a lot of experience but I did not like the pay, it was way to little for all of the things that I had to do."
good,Wonderful organization with smart and strong employees. Very fast paced and great benefits. The best part of the job is being connected to an awesome growing brand and the amazing people. Worst part is very competitive and management is all over the place. Also no work life balance. I work an average of 60-70 hours a week in the corporate office.
good,Employees were always happy to see each other. Management at my location was wonderful. Store was always kept clean and straightend. Very cooperative work-family that enjoyed helping one another. Comfortable work-place uniform and had a relaxed environment.
good,"Under Armour is a Productive and Fast Workplace. It all Depends in what department you work in, But in Most you work on your own don't have to be team up with someone which is one of the Pros. Management is okay i do think it can be better. There is a lot of preference with the team members. But if your a hard working person, and can put up with the job and show them you can do the job that shouldn't be an obstacle to reach your goals.. Co-workers can be rude and mean at times, I guess it all depends. My Department in this Warehouse was Processing and what i liked about this job as soon i clocked in i was on my own doing my job, and just worrying about trying to reach the daily goal, didn't have to worry about no one and no drama. it was just me and my scanner, Reaching my daily goal...."
good,"I have learned a lot about working in the retail industry. From learning how to deal with customers to how to learning to work with others. A typical work day consist of me clocking in, making sure the store is organized, helping customers by providing ideas and knowledge about the brand. I also help in visuals where I make sure the store is kept up to standards. Management is a tad difficult. The most enjoyable part about my job is the people. I love working in an unpredictable work environment and this is one for sure. Working with different people is great and I get to learn a lot."
good,"-A typical day at work was very busy at times."
good,"I really like the management and how everything was organized in the work place. They were able able to let me branch out in other departments like cashier, shipment, etc."
good,A wonderful company to be a part of with great employee benefits. The only downside is that part-timers are not allowed to work over 25 hours.
good,"A typical day includes:"
good,Each day was different which made my job more interesting.  I learned the whole product creation cycle from the best in the industry.  Management had a clear vision and there was a lot of room for advancement.  My co-workers became some of my closest friends.  It truly was a family.  Hitting tight deadlines was probably the biggest challenge.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being fulfilled when you saw one of your products in the market.
good,"Co workers are very supportive, while management drives us all to be the best in the competitive atmosphere."
good,"The coworkers I am around are never always the same for every work day. Every one of them have something different and interesting to talk about, whether it just be about their weekend or last night's football game and who they were rooting for. There is no real hardest or easiest part of the job, we always have to keep ourselves busy doing even something simple like putting misplaced items away so we are never just standing around doing nothing. The store managers are relaxed with everyone that works there, getting along with everyone."
good,"awesome peers/co-workers and great benefits.  Work hard, play hard.  Humble and Hungry Cafe and Combine Training center are great additions to round out the benefit package."
good,It was a great job with a crew that got along very well.  Had fun with my coworkers and managers and it helped that I was obsessed with the products which made it that much easier to excite our customers about our products.
good,"Fast paced environment, I learned speed, management is great, co-worker are easy to get alone with, and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the weather and the most enjoyable part of the job getting the job done in a timely manner."
good,it is a job. there isn't healthcare provided to hourly workers.
good,"I like this job because there is always something to do: whether it be folding or hanging clothes to be put back out on the floor, help guests at the register, or keeping up stock, there was always something. I learned a lot more about how to interact with customers on more of a ""sales"" basis."
good,"Was a great place to work at. We received great discounts and the staff worked with our schedules. The store could get very busy, especially on holidays, but overall all it was a good place to work."
good,"It's been awhile since I worked there so things may have changed, but while I was there the culture was one of open competition. While this isn't a bad thing, in this case it led to unhealthy work habits and cross-functional tension."
good,Paid well and worked well with me being away at school. They would rehire me when I returned home and give me as many hours as they could before I head back to school.
good,"Typically it's who you know not what you know, you don't have to be educated to move up in the ranks if you know the right people and when people move up without the correct supervision background they tend to make poor choices"
good,"The hours for Stock Team were uncommon but they were steady and incredibly flexible with your day. You also always stayed busy. However, it felt like the rest of the store (including the managers) really didn't like the stock team. It also seemed like the managers had a hard time with almost any confrontation and communication with each other. As a company they were very strict and corporate about their rules. Understandable.  However, they lose some insight and care about their employees."
good,"great benefits"
good,"Good pay.  Time off.  Paid weekly because I was under a temp agency.  Started off making 10 dollars per hour.  Bus accessible and paid holidays.  I didn't like the fact that I was moved around a lot, or that I never became permanent but, other than that it was a great job to have."
good,This job was definitely enjoyable. Very big on team work and a sense of accomplishment when a goal is met. Management was really good on making us team members feel comfortable and prepared on knowledge of the merchandise and the company it self. Hardest part of this job i would say was the different personalities with the customers.
good,"Typical day includes processing incoming shipment, customer servicing, ringing out customers. What I have learned is that you have to be patient and curteous no matter the situation. Management is great. Culture is fun. Hardest part is remaining calm when customers give you problems. Most enjoyable part is the people you work with."
good,"Good company, growth and opportunities based on companies values and outlook of single departments value to company. Many opportunities if your department is valued and inter-company politics."
good,Friendly employees and good work environment. Hours are good and the management is great! The workplace culture is excellent and the training was provided.
good,"Great people to work with, corporate is out of the loop as usual"
good,"I guess it depends on what area in the warehouse you're working in that will determine how much you like working there. It's a huge place so you won't know everyone. But most of your coworkers will be pretty cool and easy going. If you're new, expect to be looked down upon by those who work for UA (not any of the temp agencies) and been there longer. After a while, some will lighten up, but others won't. The mandatory overtime is unnecessary. With 3 shifts and UA bringing in so many people weekly from the temp agencies, there's ALWAYS employees there and having 1st shift work mandatory OT on the weekends is absurd. The work ends up getting thin and then you're blamed for not doing anything. Anyhow, like I mentioned it's ok. It can get hot in there, and you'll sweat a lot, but you're allowed to wear shorts, a t-shirt and sneakers, so that helps."
good,"L'entreprise de Mirabel est un Outlet, ce qui fait qu'il manque souvent des grandeurs et articles et qu'il faut tout de même faire avec. Il faut tout de même remplir les chiffres de ventes mais le magasin même ne peut pas contrôler ce qu'il vent, c'est plutôt le bureau chef qui décide des articles que nous auront."
good,"Typical retail environment, fast paced and sales driven. Fun employees to work with and company overall is willing to help with advancement. Management changes store to store"
good,Its  a great place to work they pay is not the best and you have to stand for 12 hours with only two 30 min breaks but the people you work with are great
good,"The job was fun at times just being associated with the brand but supervisors and management were required to work very long hours, causing many hours away from home."
good,"This was a fun place to work. The pay isnt too great, but what can you expect from an entry level job?"
good,"This job is quite enjoyable. I particularly love working with the people there and customers. Unfortunately the Under Armour corporate structure prohibits any macro development. Most managers are stuck in the highest position that they will hold at Under Armour. Communication issues are the only major downfall for Under Armour's corporate structure. On a micro, every day, situation the job is enjoyable and everyone gets along quite well. I love working there."
good,Okay job for retail. Employee discount is great and the people are nice for the most part. Scheduling gets annoying sometimes if they constantly keep you later than you were supposed to.
good,Working at under armour taught of things from being a good leader to doing my job the best way i can in stay humbled i kno from experience the next job will be a blast for me
good,employees wear under armour to work and it is a casual environment with group bonding activities scattered throughout team schedules. Need to stay in position for 1 year before switching roles
good,Company focuses on the bigger picture and if it's meeting overall goal. It's to know people that are up the chain of command in order to move up in the company.
good,The benefits offered are great low premiums. Most of the management is awesome and over all we are given room to grow. they provide company sponsored work life counseling.
good,"UA is a great company if you enjoy retail. It's fast-paced, the product is great and there is occasional room to grow if one really wants to. The greatest part about the job was getting to chance to grow with a company that continues to hit market milestones."
good,Good to work for higher position Not as a teammate on the floor.  Most of the teammate workable but some don't. Some senior manager try to force you to work more. before they got good benefit but not right now.
good,Fast paced and you everyday is different.  Best part of the job is you learn different and new things everyday.  Great working environment and everyday is different
good,"It's ok, not a very stressful job, however, you don't get paid enough for what you do. Dealing with disrespectful people and having to clean up after them gets very old for pay this low."
good,"Lots of fun things happen at UA.  Good perks, but the salary and room for advancement are not the greatest.  Promise lots but don't actually see the results of those promises.  Overall enjoyable place to work just wish the salary was better!"
good,"Empresa ambiciosa e movida a desafios, motivando constantemente funcionários."
good,Great managers and work associates. Face-paced on weekends and slow during the week. They teach you and dont expect you to know anything to begin. Promote from within.
good,"Working for Under Armour helped prepare me for a workplace that was busy but relaxed. The job was fast paced during the summer but slow during winter but that didn't mean that we, the staff, didn't keep busy. There is ALWAYS something to be done in the store whether it be cleaning, folding clothes, putting back tried on clothes or resizing shoes/apparel. Such an exciting and fun place to work."
good,I’ve been at UA for almost 3 years now and I love it. I love the people I work with. It can be overwhelming at times especially during the holidays but that’s retail for you. Overall it’s a great company to work for.
good,"Working at UA was great. The only problem was it was in the retail field. No holidays or weekends off, and never a set schedule. Those are probably the worst part. The pay wasnt bad but the best part was the discount for employees."
good,It's a family oriented company but some people in power make stupid decisions and they've never or probably will ever experience how hard we work and how impossible it is to meet most of their goals
good,Working in retail isn't always the most exciting but there is always something to be done and you often have great encounters with customers. You get to build a good bond with coworkers and hours are very flexible around school.
good,"A very well organized business, fast paced work days, a lot of organizing, and making sure the sales floor is stocked, and easily accessible. Managers are friendly, and coworkers are hard working, and friendly also."
good,This started as a part time job for the holiday season but I liked working there so I stayed on and kept it as a second part time job while I was a musician in a local band.
good,"Great benefit package. Fun place to work lots of opportunities to take part in work place bonding activities. Armour Day, volunteer in community, free lunches on occasion."
good,"It's a unique place to work in the regards that you get to see some interesting types of apparel. Although, at the same time you barely get any hours on some days and it doesn't come with benefits because of this."
good,"Fun and culturally balanced job with great teammates and managers work and life balance could be a little better but otherwise a great place to work.,"
good,"The days are typically very busy and hectic.  The workers are friendly and environment is fun.  I learned how to fold and organize clothes and how to take care of incoming freight.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demands of the customers on busy days, especially with the low pay rate.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between the pleasant customers and the interactions between the workers."
good,Must have patients with customers. Must have great persuasion skills. You will alway have something to do. This job can teach you plenty things that you may use in your everyday life.
good,Under Armour is a great company for anyone interested in athletics and sports. CEO is very forward thinking are they are at the front of combining technology and sports to make all athletes perform to their peak.
good,"During the off seasons, there is not that much that can be done. During the busy seasons, folding, cleaning, attending to customers, and shipment are a boggle of time."
good,"Underarmour is a solid establishment with many pros, solid staff and good training. Fairly easy to ask for time off or to ask for more shifts."
good,A typical day at work involves maintaining visual standards and optimal customer service. Management is fantastic and coworkers are mostly college students. The most enjoyable part of this job is building a relationship with customers.
good,"Very easy going, fun, interactive environment.  Learned a lot of product knowledge and it's actually pretty impressive. Flexible with school schedules. Management and payroll needs tremendous work."
good,It is an easy place to work and you get a great discount. Your coworkers are fun to work with. There isn't a great chance for advancement.
good,"Loved the people I worked with, just no room for advancement, being as it was the only store in Oklahoma. I did learn a great deal, which I can use further in my career, just not at Under Armour for the reasons stated above."
good,UA is a great company with great employees . There is a team atmosphere and every department works together for the greater good while understanding company goals.
good,"productive work environment, was able to work on a project and help customers at the same time. Co-workers are fun to be around. the hardest part of the job was dealing with management at times."
good,"I only worked here for a month, opening a new store, but got a good feeling from the environment."
good,Keep appropriate records and reports.
good,"Overall good place to work. Great benefits, good teamwork, and pretty flexible with time off."
good,Store itself is an easy one to work in but the management makes it largely unable to work there due to their mismanagement and stressful communication.
good,"Good place to work, good atmosphere.  Employees and management are nice.  Can get very busy during peak hours, and is sometimes understaffed during that time frame."
good,"A good company to work with; however, the salary was a joke.  Benefits were outstanding and the people at UA were very helpful.  "
good,It’s more of a seasonal position if anything. There’s always someone new leaving every week. You have to get use to introducing yourself to someone new almost every shift!! (no exaggeration)
good,"The team at under armour were welcoming and were willing to help out when they could. Me being the college student at the time this help when finals, testing and projects came around."
good,I would walk around and talk to the customers and address their needs. I would sort through our inventory in the back to find what the customers were looking for. I would make sure that they store was kept neat and tidy. I would assist in ringing out customers at the cash register if needed. I would interact with other employee to make it an enjoyable experience. I learned valuable customer service skills while working here. It taught me good work ethic and how to be a responsible individual.
good,"Great discounts on clothing, shoes, and accessories. Relaxing environment to work in, can get busy at times, weekends and before Christmas, back to school. Flexible schedule."
good,"very productive and fast paced working in under armour warehouse. Decent work scheduling, as well as shifts. Management is very helpful, and flexible with scheduling."
good,Always the same thing at work learn to back and ship the management there were perfect they treated everyone the same and made sure everyone was good the hardest part of the job was the hours
good,a typical day at Under Armour could go either way depending on the attitude of the manager. When the manager and/or managers wasn't happy neither was the rest of the team. When they don't feel like talking they would ignore you pretty much your whole entire shift. The discounts were amazing and the clothes were as well. Overall the day can go good if the manager was in a good mood.
good,"I was employed at Under Armour, Inc. as a season worker through an agency. The job itself was fairly easy to follow. They were tight on safety. I was a lumper and sometimes if they needed workers somewhere else they would send us away and vice versa. If we finished our assigned work before our shift was over we were allowed to leave early."
good,"As a first job, I learned very valuable skills that helped me grow as a worker such as teamwork, time management, and it helped me get a better feeling of a warehouse worker. A typical day would be just signing in and getting assigned a job to complete by the end of the day whether it be unload 5 trucks or load 10 pallets. The management were never rude or mean in any way and tried to explain things in the easiest form possible. The workplace culture is very straight forward and focuses on the task at hand and getting it done. The hardest part of the job would be having to learn how to organize the boxes in a very quick manner. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the way the workers interact and the way the company treats the employee in a good manner."
good,"Well, a typical day at work consists of 10 hours of straight labor. The whole warehouse is loud and active from the conveyor belts running, forklifts operational, to general workers (like myself) continuing with their daily duties. I've learned a lot from both starting as a temporary worker through the agency to being a full-time Under Armour employee. My experience expands virtually throughout the entire warehouse except for areas that I am not certified in. Like anyone, I can load and offload trailers, RF scan and palletize boxes/merchandise, RF scan and picking orders, and very basic of the computer functions. The hardest part of the job is working 4pm to 2:30am and get up within only a few hours to do it all again with minimal sleep."
good,Working for the Under Armour brand is a fantastic brand experience. Corporate partners are amazing! Growth is there but I am wishing to pursue other careers.
good,"Worked in the Inventory department for team 1, had a great team and got along well with my immediate supervisor and leads. Received lots of training which was a plus. Day to day activities varied on the priorities of the tasks at hand. Under Armour makes an effort to show the value of their employees however the pay rate is not very competitive. Overall was a good experience."
good,Work was fun. I enjoyed doing stock in the back. I also enjoyed helping people when they needed it. My co-workers were passionate about the brand and what it stood for which really helped with sales and helped me better myself with my customers.
good,"Management is always there when needed, They were very informative and enthusiastic to teach and lead. Work was steady which made time go b very quickly."
good,An enjoyable work atmosphere with fun people who are passionate about the company and the product.
good,"No work day is ever the same at UA.  Constantly evolving and growing as a company.  I have made many friends here over 6 years, and because we are growing so fast, I am always meeting new ones as well.  Hardest part of my job is finding time to do the necessary work in the systems and on email as I am constantly in meetings and traveling.  Under Armour is notorious for getting one person to do the job of three! Most enjoyable part of the job is having an affect on the product.  It is awesome to be able to walk into a store and see product on the rack that I have had design or construction input on.  One confirmation of the popularity of our brand is the insane amount of resumes UA receives on a daily basis, but this is also the reason that UA is able to keep the compensation levels lower than the industry standard."
good,"I love working for this company but as my life advanced I am starting to seek better opportunities. Everyday I learned something new about the product, customers, and employees. The management staff is fantastic and they were a great way to improve myself in the retail/customer service field."
good,A typical day working at Under armour was just being a Regular sales Associate i.e folding clothes etc. I learned how to be a better sales associate. Management was very great I had very good relationships with all of my managers who treated me with the utmost respect. The co workers that I worked with at the time were like family actually the hardest part of working at the under amour was the crazy hours. The most enjoyable part was the discounts we recieved
good,"I liked working for Under Armour. The work made the 10 hour day fly by but the pay, when I was there, just wasnt enough for what you did. I worked 4-10s and loved having Friday's off and I would have stayed if the pay was better."
good,I was part for two years one in high school one out of high school. Fun company good employee discount. Even more fun if you are into sports and pay attention to sponsored athletes.
good,Ambitious  and hard working team. This is a great opportunity to get into this company and move forward. I won't say negative things because everyone's experience is different.
good,"great entry level job for young/college students who want a job beside retail/fast food. The work is super easy, just the hours are long. The pay is good for people who don’t solely rely on paying rent, water etc. by themselves. a regular day for me was clocking in, stretching, going to my post(compliance, which is just hanging up clothes for hours), and if its a slow day, theyll send you to another department to help which was actually great because its new scenery and you meet new people for the day. overall, definitely would come back."
good,"I have worked here for over 3 years now, and I am extremely satisfied with how much support I have received from the management team. I started out as an associate, but was able to ascend to the leadership team in a rather short period of time. The opportunities presented by UA have greatly benefited my personal life, as well as my professional life."
good,"Although the pay is nothing spectacular, the atmosphere is very laid back and fun. You will catch yourself laughing multiple times a day at the thing your teammates say over the radio and closing is a blast."
good,Not a single day passes without a reminder of the company's goal and mission. I love the passion my coworkers exhibited for their job with Under Armour. The people are awesome and is very well managed
good,Under Armour is a great brand with the opportunity to grow beyond its humble roots through diligent focus on creating a full portfolio of innovative product.
good,"-Maintained attentive to daily goals"
good,Under Armour locations allowed a lot of free thinking opportunity.It also provided you with the information to help make you an informed and therefore more helpful sales associate.
good,"This job is something I enjoy going to each day. I love the people I work with and picking the pace at which I work. For the most part, the customers are very friendly but sometimes difficult to share information with when the store can't provide what they are looking for."
good,"Very fast paced, company functions, save company money,   process,, shipping product, management  great different cultures language barrier, Love my Team"
good,I love working here. The team I work with is like a family and we always have fun. The company is dedicated to charity which is why I was excited to work there initially. There are expectations that they expect you to meet but they create a fun environment that makes you strive for success.
good,Under Armour has an awesome environment and amazing coworkers who are there to support with on and off the clock. I wish my training could have been a little better when I started but I learned everything eventually.
good,Start the day with about five minutes of stretching go to station stock work materials hang or pack items as requested by customer look for damaged goods and replace as needed.
good,"typical Warehouse, Punch in and out"
good,Great place to work at and great people. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were some parts that I didn't like but at the same time it was easy work so I can't complain.
good,typical retail store. drive to reach daily goal is always important as well as excellent customer service. great teamwork as well as great coworkers. very busy work environment where we were constantly moving
good,"a typical day at under armour would consist of given that you were  in the pick mod coming in and pumping out orders  via wrist rocket, maintaining a clean work environment, hitting hourly units per hour. i was given the opportunity to advance in my position and grow as a leader to coach and train fellow workers."
good,UA is the fastest growing brand in the US. It's overall appeal to job seekers is spot on. a great place to work for. Being in the field is tougher to move up unless you are willing to relocate.
good,"Positive and upbeat work environment that allows the team to work seamlessly. The company, as a whole, embodies the practices and mind set of an active person such as myself."
good,The hardest part of the job is finding new challenges to push yourself to the edge. I learned that if you don't find things to help you be productive there will be no one to do it for you.
good,"Busy, busy, busy. There is always sometihng to do and always room for advancement if you are determined to move up."
good,"A typical day at work I would clock in and quickly find myself work to do weather it was greeting customers, filling shelves, sorting the clearance rounders, making sure tags were tucked, making sure there was no trash on the floor, to ringing up customers when needed, that would take any where from an hour to an hour and half then management would finally see that I was there and give me the daily business and put me in my assigned area or on a specific task."
good,Good Job but pay isnt competitive. At UA they overload you with work but when its time for reviews and evaluations they never reward you with a good raise.
good,"typical work day was cleaning, customer service, working freight that came in, restocking on the floor with freight, and work register. Learned more about the products and system that under armour uses. Co-workers were fun to work with there were some that were arrogant. Hardest part of the job was pressuring customers. It was a laid back place to work and I enjoyed my time there."
good,The management and workers are friendly and helpful. You will feel appreciated at your job. The work is boring and tedious at points but there are plenty of opportunities to help and engage with customers.
good,"Leadership encourages all teammates to share new ideas and find creative solutions to problems. "
good,I worked in the warehouse for under armour.. Within the business you had plenty of opportunities to advance in other areas. It was easy access to and from work.. Clean and friendly atmosphere.. It's always a lead available to assist you. I have worked as a temp over the years with this company.. All I can say is it was an amazing experience
good,"El trabajo, y el Team era excelente, la calidad de los productos y la tienda en general también, pero lo que incomodaba era la gestión por parte de la jefatura. Ya que en los 6 meses que trabajé, 8 compañeros fueron desvinculados, por lo cual todos trabajábamos en la incertidumbre, de que algún momento nos llamarían a la oficina para despedirnos."
good,It was a great opportunity working with under armour IT team. Eveday was a new challenge which we as a team resolve in a timly manner. Enjoyed and learned alot of new infrastructure while setting up all the IT equipments to new site. Testing all the team hard work sucessful the project was all over awesome and great.
good,its a good place to start for beginning a new job or just a part-time for anyone. during weekdays it's very slow but weekends they do pick up. co workers are nice and friendly and helpful. management is ok. they can have there ups and downs on how they feel that day.
good,Placement agencies will post you where management needs you but there are opportunities to move from department to department for cross-training and familiarization. This is valuable.
good,"It's a great job when you're in school and need a little extra money. Also, management works with you when it comes to your schedule. High energy, co-workers are definitely a blast."
good,"I worked at Under Armour for about a year. I worked many different shifts anywhere from 5:30a-10a to 3p-9p. It didn't matter the shift for me it was always enjoyable! The other sales associates, leads and managers were professional and friendly to be around."
good,"I had been there for two years, so I got a lot of customer service experience. I worked the morning stock shift as well as the mid-day or closing shift. I am an athlete so it was a great environment for me, the people I worked with were great too which made coming into work a lot easier."
good,"Good part time place to work with a energetic crew and positive management, however it lacks competitive pay and opportunities to earn other benefits and perks"
good,"buen ambiente laboral, con muchas regalías, como la vestimenta cada 6 meses, bonos y buen sueldo."
good,At times it could be busy but it was usually slow. The Hours were inconsistent. If we did not meet a certain sales quota most of the blame was placed on the workers and some managers would rarely help on the floor.
good,"Once you bleed UA, you always WILL! The experience working for UA is incredible. The only downfall is that it can be very difficult to balance work and life with the demanding hours and schedule."
good,"Working at Under Armour was fun. Talked about sports a lot with coworkers and customers. And I'm pro-UA so it was really easy for me to sell a customer a certain item or help them find what they were looking for. Just helping customers with sizes and restocking and folding as the day goes, really easy. The only downfall is the miscommunication between managers/employees."
good,"I liked working there for the summer, they are really sloppy with scheduling and really tight on the budget they give stores to pay employees. Not enough money to pay the amount of people needed to work daily."
good,Everyone at Under Armour is fun to be around. As soon I started to work there I felt welcomed by everyone. I would recommend anyone to work there. I stop working there because I received a scholarship to play basketball at Limestone College.
good,Fun work environment. Its fast past paced on a busy day. It's nice interacting with customers. Discount on clothes and shoes are awesome. I would recommend working there.
good,A typical shift at Under Armour consisted of assisting customers and providing excellent customer service along with collaborating with co-workers and managers. We would have weekly online training sessions to learn more about the products we offer and all the materials that go into making the clothing so that we can better evaluate the customers needs and describe why the products they choose will benefit them or not and recommend other products if needed. It is a very fast pace environment and we are constantly on our feet ready to help our customers. The co-workers and management make the store enjoyable to work at. We all get along and work together well.
good,"Typical workday was 12-16 hours for two weekend shifts, looking for better accommodating work life balance environment. Prefer 8-10 hour work day that is suitable."
good,Good place to work if you enjoy working in a retail setting. Good discounts. You meet a very diverse group of shoppers. The food court isn't the greatest though.
good,"Typically, clock in around 6:25AM and clock out around 3pm. "
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, de caracter distendido pero con objetivos y compromisos claros."
good,It's a great place to work and you get to wear comfy clothing. The store manager is very flexible and willing to work with other jobs and school schedules. When she's not around there is a power struggle with the 2 assistants...one being very grouchy and negative. The over all team is great to work with and you get an average amount of hours but still Need another job to make ends meet due to somaNY employees.
good,The people there are great and all of the employees like to have fun while working.  management does its job well but still allows fun in the workplace as long as it is not counter productive
good,"I like the company until I moved down here, the co workers friendly and love the job I never complain one day about my job I was enjoy it but I have to quit because of my kids school choice."
good,Co-workers are really nice. And the company culture is felt from the ground up. Company is growing rapidly and opportunities are available.
good,the lunch rooms where nice the management really helped there workers i just didnt like how they didnt really have opportunites to get hired
good,"I was only there for a few weeks, but the atmosphere was such a positive place. The employees were so friendly and easy to talk to. It was hard to go into a new environment and try to learn the way they work in such a short time, but everyone was very helpful and friendly."
good,it was a good company to work great people in my team to work with  great company to work for i learn to be a team player with my coworkers what i learn was to work fast my coworkers were great to work with
good,Under armour is a wonderful place to work with quite a bit of room to move up. new stores are opening daily. management in store to corporate all reach out and listen to ideas from associates. shifts are manageable from 4-9 hours with breaks included.
good,A great place to work and gain sales experience. Learned how to handle certain situations and how to relate products with the guest's needs.
good,"Working in retail is an exciting/unknown adventure each day. The possibilities of each day are endless. There are good and bad days for everyone working in retail. We must deal with customers of all sorts. Some happy with their experience and some openly unhappy with their experience. It is our jobs as managers to ensure that all customers receive the service they deserve and making sure that all of their needs are met. A typical day at work starts our by opening up the store which includes: counting registers, counting safe, typing up an action plan for the day, putting sales associates where they are needed and updating any supply orders. Once store is open, we continually manages sales floor, making sure all of our associates are where they need to be and doing what is necessary to drive sales. We handle any issues throughout the day, including register malfunctions and customer complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job is having satisfied and happy customers who let you know how great of an experience they had."
good,"Its a very fast pace productive warehouse. The Management here are very good they make sure the warehouse runs smooth and they get the job done. I learned a lot from this warehouse , they trained me how to drive mostly every forklift. Very good company."
good,Good for part time job seekers or college age kids still in school. Real flexible hours with Sundays off. People can get pretty annoying though and you don't get paid enough to put up with them.
good,"Decent place to work. Management understands young kids and gives some freedom in schedule and working. Can be unfortunate if you get call outs during your shift. with a small payroll, hours can get cut hard and be understaffed like crazy at other times"
good,"I worked as part of the shipment team and my shifts were 9pm-2am which was very hard physically, but the great team members and management made it much more bearable. As we were in the store after hours and there were no customers around it was a pretty relaxed environment, we got fair breaks and were able to stay hydrated and eat as needed throughout the shift."
good,"Typical day would be more of restocking UA products, helping customers in professional manner, and learning something new."
good,"UA is a fast growing company with plenty of opportunities at the retail level.  Like many companies, unless you are willing to relocate, your upward mobility will be limited by the spots available and you often have to wait for someone to quit, be fired, or die before you can move up.  If you are willing to relocate, there are tons of opportunities for promotion."
good,Under Armour took great care of there employees.I learned that if you put in the time and hard work nothing is impossible.The Management was great with working with its employees.I didnt get much time to talk to my co workers due to the fact i was always on the go from the time i clocked in till the time i clocked out. The most enjoyable part of this job was the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.
good,"Under Armour is a fun, young company to work for. Our day revolves around managing our people to team success. We work on perfecting our product presentation and going above and beyond for every customer. We work together as a team everyday to create a fun evironment not only for our customers, but our team members as well. The hardest part of the job is keeping our visual presentation to standards of perfection. The most enjoyable part of the job is turning new customers on to our brand."
good,"Great Teammates & Good Work Enviroment, Everyone Works As A Team, And Just Seems Like They Really Care And Take Care Of Their Employees"
good,"Excelente trato, buen ambiente, salario justo y oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"The job is very simple go in do your work go home. They have short shifts if you want more hours just ask flexible on changing your availability. Takes 2 weeks to go into effect keep that in mind, able to trade off shifts if you ask in advance. Very team based/family style. Discount use to be really great but a few messed it up for the masses."
good,"Goede werkgever, mooie gebruik van voortgezet techniek tijdens je werk."
good,"THEY ARE VERY KIND PEOPLE  ,GOOD skills and real teamwork spirit . good managers and supervisors. number one in sport 's cloths and  shoes companies in the world "
good,It is a nice place to work on the side of school or another job. I like everyone that I have worked with or interacted with within the company. Great culture for anyone who loves fitness or sports.
good,Rare place to work with exciting and challenging opportunities. The culture is like no other and can be compared to some of the great organizations. The future of the company is unmatched and creates a sense of being watching the journey.
good,"one of the best jobs I've had, worked with a lot of good people and the management lets you work together or independently."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Very hard balancing 2 jobs but they work around schedules well! Nice change of pace, and a great mall to work at."
good,"Walk in, say hello to everyone, see what sales are going on, go to the back to see what manager is on duty and see what they'll need from you for the day to make sure everything goes smoothly and that every customer is taken care of."
good,"After clocking in, reporting to manager for daily task(s).  Process freight and either back-stock product or place on sales floor.  After store opening, greet customers, provide great customer service, ring up transactions, and maintain sales floor.  "
good,Some times it can be slow and other times it can be overwelmingly busy. Just about everybody gets along.
good,Had an overall good work experience. Very energetic atmosphere. Great people and fun atmosphere. Amazing discounts for employees. Not much room for advancement or enough hours at my location.
good,"I enjoyed the product and the level of dedication the brand had for it's product. I'm a firm believer that the company should stand behind it's product. I learned several aspects of the retail world from Under Armour Retail Stores. My co-workers were fun but sometimes lacked motivation. I believe that is a reflection of the managers. Managers should represent the brand well, be leaders amongst the associates, and work harder than anyone else."
good,"My location was very understanding, I had to leave to focus on school since that is more important right now.  They're willing to work schedules. I can't say everyone at my location had the same experience, but overall it's not a bad part time job"
good,"Typical day of work was helping different customers on a basis."
good,"A lot of folding clothes, managers are cool, hours are horrible. Everyone that works there is laid back.The pay is very well for a sales associate. Management shifted more than once."
good,"I loved it there, I would come in and the music would be playing. everyone has a smile on their face, it had a great vibe in the store at all times. I usually just helped anyone that need it, rather it be a costumer or a fellow employee. the hardest thing to do on the job was tying to make every costumer's experience there a good one, so they will come back in the future."
good,"My work day starts out gathering the materials needed for the task ahead. During the course of the day, I may assist in other areas of the department as needed."
good,"a typical day at under armour consisted of recovering a designated department, providing customer service, and cooperating with co-workers and managers to maintain department standards. from working in this job i got first hand retail experience and found the significance of customer service. management was extremely welcoming, goal oriented, and helpful. my co-workers were overall great fun people and make the  staff what it is. There is no difficulties with this job, if you are a efficient employee and use your common sense. the most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with both the customers and the team."
good,Busy work environment. Learned key skills working with cross-functional teams. Fast -past atmosphere. Hardest part of the job is hitting deadlines. Enjoyed the output of the projects in the marketing place.
good,"Depending on the day it is busy or slow. The employees are so nice and everyone gets along well, managers are incredibly nice and understanding, get along well with most employees."
good,"a good job, but ""part time"" means 4 hours a week to them... it started off i was getting 12 hours a week but they started giving more hours to the ""brown nosing"" part timers, and took time away from myself and a few other workers."
good,"Typical sales job, but the clothes were easy to sell because their product is excellent. Top of the line quality of clothes."
good,"A typical day of work involved processing shipment, housekeeping in the front and back of the store, and presentation of clothing. Management is excellent. They are demanding, but easy going at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-worker relations."
good,great company that started with the most humble of beginnings and turned into the billion dollar powerhouse that it is today in a few short years. even met the owner and his family... truly honored to say i worked for his company.
good,"Family like atmosphere but even with family there is lack of communication and sometimes poor communication. Other than that this is a great place to work, very easy going, they will work around your schedule. Hours vary but as long as your worth ethic remains consistent you will be top of the crop when they distribute hours."
good,"Una empresa que desde el principio te pone facilidades. Da oportunidad a gente sin experiencia y las jornadas de trabajo se hacen muy amenas. "
good,"Absolutely love working here! Quick paced, but good hours. Usually no extra hours, they like to keep it under 5 hour shifts so they don’t have to give you a break. Great discount on everything. Overall, great place to work!"
good,I learned a lot at the beginning and throughout my journey with Under Armor. We provided great customer service and assistance with customers and also when it comes to my coworkers
good,Its a great place to work. You get along with everyone. Its about speed and how fast you get your job done. You can take a 15 min. Break if needed other wise you dont get one if its not in tended.
good,"secure work environment, steady hours and good pay. friendly environment where everyone works as a team to ensure customer satisfaction. good management."
good,"When I Got Employed With Under Armour I Had Nothing But Great Vibes They Allowed Us To Wear Their Clothes For Half Price Off And Make U Feel Like Its Just Another Average Day. The Managers Were Laid Back Nice And Just Like Any Other Employee There."
good,"Manager are great, great coworker, works great with schedules, great communication, working as a team means a lot to them. they are not just coworker, or manager, the have created this family welcome feeling, I think the hardest part about the job is, on a busy you're always on your toes, but at the same time need to keep moving around because the store is such a small store you just feel like you're in everyone way but other then that working there is so much fun, and exciting."
good,"good starting place for retail work, little opportunity to advance though"
good,"I really enjoyed working at UA. All the managers were so down to earth and friendly. They’re always willing to help. Also, it was really fun to work around the other associates; it just seemed like a home away from home. The only things I didn’t really like about working there was that the customers were a little nasty towards me- probably had at least 1 rude customer a week(but that’s anywhere you go), corporate was quick to change the discount from 50% off everything to 30% sale items and 50% regular priced items. For me as a struggling woman, I felt as though I couldn’t afford any of the clothes I was representing especially being paid $9 an hour(then again, it’s retail) and also corporate had us hand out armour cards: every $50 you spend you get $10 off your next purchase and the rules on how to redeem it changed everytime and the wording on the back was very confusing and I often had customers argue with me saying “that’s not how it was pitched” so I kinda wish I had a good experience with those cards before I left. I only left because I had to relocate for personal and financial reasons."
good,Great employees. Wonderful management. Wonderful workplace. I really appreciated the opportunity there. I learned a lot being there and also being the outstanding people there.
good,"Día típico de trabajo: divertido y con mucha comunicación"
good,Good company. Not enough pay for the work we do. If you work for a temp agency don't expect to get hired at under armour. They want high quality work for the lowest pay.
good,"Easy job 12 hour shifts, Transportaion is needed, employees are cycled through out 4 different warehouses on 12 hour shifts"
good,Fun place to work but there is a lot of micro-management from mid-level manager's who need to learn to lead individuals instead of bossing them around.
good,working at this job have given me a new experience because I have never worked in a warehouse and I have just learned so much by just doing different things.
good,"e?"
good,The job is a good job for someone in high school to have a little bit of cash in there pocket but for someone looking for to have a stable way of living i don’t recommend it. It doesn’t pay enough
good,The job was a fun environment to work in with lenient dress code and great co workers. Under Armour Brand House in Chicago is a great store that just opened so there is a lot of energy in the store.
good,you always learn something new from the customers and the people you work with. You meet alot of different people. Different places to work for.
good,"Promote the brand"
good,While being a full time student and resident you are expected to have the highest degree of self dicipline as well as organization and work ethic.
good,"-Great managers "
good,"Uma empresa na qual a gente se apaixona,cria um vínculo  maravilhoso que levamos pra vida toda."
good,"A EMPRESA É BOA ,"
good,"Under Armour Youth in Sevierville, TN is a great place to work! I knew the Store Manager and he hired me over the summer as a seasonal position. I would still be there today if I did not move to finish college!"
good,It is a fun place to work. My supervisors are very helpful to me. I learnt a lot from them first is time management better communication skill and most important is how to give an exceptional customer service.
good,"I worked for four years as a sales associate at an Under Armor factory house. I still believe that my time at Under Armor instilled the hard work ethic that i possess. As a college student, it was a great part time job for me and offered great discounts on gear. I also really liked the manager at my store as she possessed a great work ethic and did not put herself above anyone else at anytime."
good,"Allowed me to learn the ins and outs of the sports marketing industry"
good,"Nice place to work, but most of employees are 25 yrs old or younger.  The atmosphere is definitely not conducive for seniors.  The music is loud and current.  Under Armour should make more size clothes to fit all types of people.  My wife and I wear their clothes everyday because they make a great product. Marketing should expand their sights past athelites and sports.  I think it should be worn by everyone for all occasions."
good,It's a fun environment to work in and the workers are friendly. It is very quick-paced just like most retail so you have to be ready to move and get things for customers
good,under armor is the best. staff is amazing and everything is well organized. working there seems fun and friendly. i will be returning to buy more items in the future
good,Very decent place to work managers are very Friendly and always willing to work with you.Very Teamwork oriented.Hours are Flexible if needed.Learned alot working there

good,Although I just started working for under  armor it is a great company to work for the people that they have on our sales team are enthusiastic and really down-to-earth people. Everyone has a smile on their face with positive energy and is always willing to help a customer.
good,This is one of the biggest warehouse I ever work the work is super easy just real long shifts that you will have to get use to
good,"Great place, treats you like family and always there fun place to work. Getting task done with a great attitude is what they teach you and they are willing to welcome you in!! Great place to work."
good,Slow to warm up but eventually steady flow of people through the job. Staff is usually upbeat. Learn to move quickly due to trying to meet goals from previous years.
good,I like it when there is something to get done other then sitting around doing nothing. What would be better then being around the game of golf all the time.
good,Under Armour is going to be the leading sports apparel company. Currently sponsoring the best of the best in sports across the globe. Under Armour  is a great company to work for.

good,• Opportunity to evaluate and improve current processes
good,I enjoyed my time at Underarmour and made a lot of friends.I had a great experience working with all of the co workers.The job was fun to do and not difficult at all.
good,"The work is easy fun, depending on your coworkers & managers your experience may be great. Working holidays and tax free weekends were fun. Opening, closing, and setting up for the stock team were sometimes stressful due to who did not fulfill the opening or closing check-offs (arrange items by size orders, take out the trash, sweep, wipe down mirrors & cash register)"
good,The daily work was based on scanning boxes during the shitf . Working there was a great experience to learn how to use scanner and to work on fast pace . Working 11 hours a day 3 days of the week
good,The company was an excellent company to work for. The employees and management was nice. The assignment I was on was a temporary one. It was an extended assignment and I enjoyed my time.
good,"Typically, from the beginning of a shift all the way through to the end, you would not stop moving once. Things were in constant need of doing and some employees would slack off and leave the rest of us to compensate. However, management did a good job of weeding out the unwilling to work."
good,Being a sales associate at Under Armour is very helpful because it develops patience and customer service as well as gaining experience from the business administration side.
good,"I learned to help customers and to work with others to provide the best customer service possible. I like interacting with my employees as well as customers. Your always on the move doing something whether is ringing people out, cleaning,helping customers, or stocking the back room or floor. I loved working with the people in the company."
good,My co-workers are an amazing team to work with. Management is awesome and great to work for.
good,Usually a day at work will consist of replensishing the floor putting all the go backs back updating yourself on the new sales as well as becoming comfortable with them so your able to share them with the customers
good,"Great job for someone my age. I’d recommend anybody to work there who was anywhere from 18-25, you gain valuable experience and it was a good group of people."
good,"Typical retail sales associate job. Great place to work, environment culture and staff were always helpful. Fast paced, very busy on weekends but slower during the week."
good,"Working at Under Armour was very fun and relatively relaxed. While some days we would get a large influx of customers, many days we would just clean and organize the store. I personally learned every position (sales, back of house, and cash register) In order to increase my experience. This was my first job, and it was the perfect introduction to the work world."
good,Absolutely love working for this company I would never leave if it weren't for the lack of pay. The group of people you work with become like another family in a balanced enviornment.
good,"Greet athletes as they enter the store and help them locate what they are shopping for, if not available suggest another in store product with similarities or tell them about the online ordering option through the store.  Keep the store clean and organized to company standard.  Make sure the athlete found everything they were looking for while ringing up their merchandise."
good,"I really enjoy working there I just don't get a lot of hours so I have to get another job but overall it is a really fun job, the company itself is great it has great benefits and there is always something to do"

It is fun and not stressful. If you can talk to people your in the right place. If you cant then why work retail? Everyone is pretty nice and gets along well. For hours its up to you. If your available then they schedule you, if your not then you dont get scheduled for when your not available. Its a pretty nice deal especially if you have a busy life and work other jobs or are still in school. Overall its a great place to work in my opinion and my favorite job ive ever had.

good,"Under Armour is a very busy environment and really keeps you motivated. I have learned how to interact with costumers effectively and put their needs first. It's important to realize that you are there for the customer, so find ways to help them as best you can. The management is really supportive and truly cares about each teammates performance. The workplace is a very upbeat beat because you are always moving around and assisting others as best you can. The hardest part is not being able to help foreign costumers find exactly what they are looking for. The most enjoyable part is being on a team and working together to reach a goal."

good,"Everyday I worked I would look forward to it, with the music playing in the store and all the employees having fun. It is an amazing environment to work in. Everyone loves helping you out and showing you the ropes of the store and the managers are willing to work with you to accommodate the schedule if needed. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was remember where everything was on the floor and in the stock room, especially if they changed it because then it would be super confusing. Also working in the mall there was a language barrier between some of the customers and employees because of the tourists, so you have to be open minded and try to help in the best way possible. "
good,"Looking for a great personable, laid back company. Under Armour not only stands behind its products but their employees as well. Starting off part-time is the way to get in the door, your own motivation gets you full time or even promoted. They love to promote within and provide you all the necessary tools to do so."
good,The culture at the Under Armour Headquarters is like none other. A typical day at work you may run into a celebrity or see a full blown free throw competition in the middle of the office space.

Under Armour was an excellent place to learn all my skills from, since it was my first job after all, I found it really comforting that the mangers hired me despite it being my first job because no one else would hire me without experience. Under armor shaped me into the worker I am now. The management team was very professional and always had a positive attitude at work. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job was the busy weekends and busy holidays because it is nonstop lines at a very quick pace but it was pretty easy getting the lines down without getting frustrated. The most enjoyable part of working at UA is the team, everyone is so friendly and nice and you can always count on them for anything you need help with."

As a part time Spin Instructor, this was an awesome outlet to not only, to be able to speak to like minded customers, but also give positive feedback on the merchandise UA has to increase their efforts.  The associates are always excited to come to work and the customers feel that when they come into the store.  The hardest part of the job is difficult to determine, simply because, the atmosphere the team creates.  Collectively, as manager and associates, everyone had something positive to offer in order to complete tasks. Their individuality created a 'team' with the same goal.  Everyone respected their differences and it never caused division.  That was the most enjoyable part of the job."
