bad,"I honestly don’t even know where to start. Please look elsewhere as here the people are disrespectful, managers pick and choose who they want to succeed, very high turnover rate, disrespectful customers, training does not prepare you, and horrible schedules. They pay us pennies, especially when you can do every ones job. HR doesn’t know our job but yet the first ones to come and see you. This was the first place I worked where managers were pregnant by one of there team members."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for, no support, extremely clicky, don’t pay their staff correctly, expect you to work all the hours under the sun no work life balance at all"
bad,Stay away!!! You are less than a number. I was told that if I left when a tornado hit my home (with my kids there alone) I would be fired! Horrible!!!
bad,Management is terrible. They treat all workers very badly. They look for ways to fire you. They constantly try to make you do tasks outside of your job description.
bad,Lack of advancement opportunities. Need more diversity in senior management. Need to increase minimum wage for employees. Need to improve high turnover.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Theres no respect, your right get violated.  They treat people like a waste basket. I once was told if I used the restroom in the main building I would be fired. Eventually I was fired from trying to protect myself and even though I was in the union , my right was still violated and I was fired for asking people to leave me alone.  If you know better, you'll do better. You've been warned."
bad,Nothing at all the pay is terrible and the no cars on Monday’s and Tuesday.. We have Preferred members who wait. When the have reservations and they are so upset
bad,"Pay is garbage, District manager has too high of expectations & the staff is unsettling. No reimbursement if you've got to use your personal vehicle if you've got to run an errand. District manager is a cheap skate"
bad,"I am a current employee of ABGroup and  staff are always exploited with unfair work culture especially at the Sydney Airport. Management will push you to do upsells and sell insurance but will hold your bonuses and entitlements and give it to the managers. There is continuous discrimination and staff at the domestic Airport are NEVER given a fair chance to work at the International Airport. "
bad,"The reality is that there is too much office politics in the workplace. No matter how much you work hard, you will never progress since there's obvious favoritism going on."
bad,I worked for AVIS Budget for almost two years and it was truly a waste time and energy. The starting bonus was nice but after that is was all down hill. Favoritism and immature managers made it not just miserable but unbearable. After only being there 3-4 months I was thrown on the overnight shift 12am-8am after being told this would not happen. Every night I was stuck with long lines with no cars and very angry customers. This resulted in no sales and no personal life. Despite all that I stuck it out to try to get a transfer to stay with the company. After giving my two weeks notice after being denied a transfer more times than I can count with zero explanation I drove over 100 miles to complete my notice. I reapplied like instructed to another location only to be told i was blacklisted . Stay away from this company.
bad,"Worked there for a year before I couldn’t take it anymore.. managers only hire old people in order to take advantage of them ...cut my commission and work hours for no reason and out of no where.. pay is terrible... switched positions hoping it’d be better but it was the same bs... was often held 2+ hours (against my will) after my shift ended and and was paid nothing more than minimum wage for the extra time "
bad,"Arrogáns, bunkó management. Felkészületlen, tapasztalatlan HR."
bad,"Company clearly cares more about their shareholders, executives, and senior management than their workforce. directors and above do not take any feedback from subordinates."
bad,"There are four shuttlers at this location who are horribly verbally and physically abusive to new employees, that's why they can't keep new employees.  At this location, I was verbally abused by four drivers/shuttlers that work here and physically assaulted by one. The management does absolutely nothing to these individuals.  The drivers have been there for years, apparently dislike their jobs and the climate is the worst I've seen in all of my years of employment.  It does not have to be this way, but it is...for $8.46 an hour.  This place needs to get rid of all of the old drivers who complain and hate their jobs and abuse new employees and get new people.  The women drivers are the worst, not driving but how they treat others, it's not worth it, don't do it.  Many of the drivers don't take care of themselves so they smell bad, look bad, imagine shuttling with unkempt people in small cars in the summer time.  I will say it's absolutely not what I thought it would be.  The old drivers who have been there for years get away with horrible treatment of new people because management just doesn't care, honestly, I've never seen anything like it.  All management cares about is moving cars, aside from the old drivers killing the new employees, they don't care.  I will say management is incredibly overburden, the scheduling is the worst I've ever seen, you can't plan anything ahead of time, there were times when the schedule wasn't even available and employees had to wing it, this is not where you want to be.  There is no professionalism, imagine the worst case scenario you would ever"
bad,Avis Budget Group was a wonderful place to work. Checked in vehicles when returned and checked vehicles for damage.  Processed credit card payments. Answered in-bound calls and made reservations for customers.
bad,"The work environment was very toxic and stressful. They hire anyone off the street, and treat their employees with total disrespect. Not too mention, staff members are very racist too."
bad,Management treat you like garbage. They expect you to go above and beyond for less them minimum wage when you calculate that you don't get paid for opening the store or closing. They see the 15 min that you have to be there earlier for opening as extra that you should do for free. They will work you down to the bone and not even say thank you. That is unless you have a special relationship with management that allows you go move your car every 2 hours and be gone for 20 min plus. If you don't and if you ask for anything more they will make a the problem.
bad,As a manger you are on call 24/7 ON TOP of being scheduled for 50 hour work weeks which turn into 10-15 hour shifts depending on how busy the location is. The location is always busy too because they overbook and you have to turn customers away. Would be much better if only 40 hours a week and on call.
bad,"not the best either, I wouldn't recommend staying here for too long, it can be very depressing. pay is not that great either, definitely would suggest looking elsewhere."
bad,"As many other places, you are just a number. They preach well but act bad. The only thing this company really cares about is $$$."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked. Super toxic environment. Really bad management. No raises ever. just a absolute horrible place from the top boss on down.
bad,The company rips the customer off.and did won't to take care of the customer problems at all . when you are short card that won't you to Clam the customer down
bad,"Hours were horrible pay was awful co workers were lazy. Constantly having to work desk, shuttle, clean all alone, customers, co workers and management never appreciated the extra work i did."
bad,"Four years making less than $10 I am a full time employee, if you're looking for a good job dont bother applying here, work you like a dog with no pay"
bad,Management are a joke they have no respect for their workers will bad mouth about other colleagues to one another an other store management. They will hang you up to dry in situations. They will pick an choose who can have nice free upgrades if your a woman then your lucky you'll get best car on fleet as the desk staff are just randy old guys
bad,Blanket management. Mansgerd take hostile customers side.  No loysltu to employees.   To much of a sexually charged placed. This place is stressfull.  They over book and make customers suffer.
bad,"Très mauvaise expérience! Je déconseille."
bad,Very unprofessional seems to not care about no one but their self stay telling lies it’s always the customer over the employee even when the customers be wrong
bad,"they don't care about you ,or your family,as long as its not their job being erased. they don't stand behind you , they use the cars for their personal benefits. so if you are low on the totem pole you're treated as such. you give 23 years and one day they just call and say we know you're close to retirement but........"
bad,"Ho resistito solo qualche giorno c/o i loro ""uffici"" di Fiumicino Aeroporto. Manager incompetenti, che ti trattano malissimo senza farti andare neanche a mangiare o in pausa videoterminalisti 15min ogni 2 ore o in bagno. Trattano male anche il cliente. Permettono che si mangi in postazione o si usi il cellulare in postazione.Ti schiavizzano pensando che sei un robot. Ho una importante esperienza professionale alle spalle e sono stata trattata come una ragazzina di primo pelo che hanno pensato di schiavizzare a portare le bevande, risme di fogli. Nessuna formazione e i colleghi che si capiva benissimo essere nella maggior parte raccomandati anche loro come 6 manager (tutti con accento napoletano..non aggiungo altro..), non ti spiegavano nulla perchè avevano paura che poi diventavi troppo brava e gli fregavi le vendite. Lentissimi, incuranti di clienti che venivano da 24 ore di volo dall'Australia e li lasciavano in coda ad attendere che fossero ""comodi"" e poi un'ora e mezzo con figli a seguito, per avere le auto. Lavativi e menefreghisti verso i clienti. Con me hanno pensato di trovare la loro schiavetta, ma dopo 5gg gli ho detto ""bye bye"", avevo già capito dove ero capitata. Non sono corretti nei contratti (basti leggere i commenti negativi dei clienti ovunque in internet), le percentuali sulle vendite sono fake in quanto ti mettono target irraggiungibili per non dartele così Avis incassa, ma tu non vedi soldi. Pessima organizzazione anche basilare, trattamenti schiavistici al limite (manco in bagno). Hanno capito male con la sottoscritta. Ho una dignità e do molto valore alla"
bad,"customer service sucks, rude manager, really dont understand how they get any business. I would never get a car, van, or anything for that matter from them they are unorganized and just a mess"
bad,"5 days a week 10+ hours day. Every weekend. Ops Manager gets paid 40k plus commission that I NEVER SAW. The company car and gas benefit is good but not worth wasting you time here. If all you want to do is work and have no life, this is the place for you. Management is poor and could careless about you as an individual."
bad,this company tells you what you want to hear but nothing ever changers I was a driver here the others drivers I worked with were a superb bunch but that was the only good bit about this company
bad,"If you crash a vehicle, you are subject to drug test & will most likely be terminated whether pass or fail &/or if the car accident was your fault or not. Union does nothing on your behalf and serves no purpose to employees. They do nothing to save your job. A number of Cars were stolen bc lack of security system and armed security guards."
bad,ALWAYS laying off. terrible morale.   Employees not able to make their own decisions.   CIO only cares about saving money.   Uses yesterdays technology.
bad,Must do the job of several people by yourself and deal with customers. Learned to work a DOS type computer program answer phone calls for making reservations. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers when the company can't provide a vehicle for their reservation.
bad,"Avis and budget does not offer any benefits it is poorly managed the manager decides whether he wants to pay your or not he trains you for 2 days and leaves you on your own. No respect or consideration for personal life matters. No paid time off , basically you are a slave and belittled & you get nothing in return for it."
bad,"Poor training, outdated computers and programs, cut-throat employees, employees not valued, lack of leadership, antiquated systems and procedures, too many chiefs not enough Indians,weak management"
bad,"I worked here at the airport for almost a year, almost every white worked there has said a racist comment towards me or about a group of people that share my ethnicities. Management doesn’t nothing to hold the parties accountable. You can show up whenever you want leave whenever you want and never get fired which gets annoying when you’re waiting on someone to show up so you can leave for the day. There are two old ladies there that dodge work so you will be taking majority of the customers resulting in no commission.  Do not take this job seriously"
bad,This is one of the worst companies in existence to work for. The management will falsely accuse you of something you didn't do and then will yell at you when you try to go and talk to them about it!!
bad,This is the worst job ive ever worked for. The employees were so unprofessional. The management was extremely unorganized. For all the work we did the pay was very low. Only good thing I can say is that I had down time during slow hours.
bad,"Cutbacks layoffs low pay working there is a high turnover rate biggest turnover I’ve seen in a call center, they don’t really know what they are doing, running on a thread"
bad,"Terrible place to work employees lack supervision, drivers hiding not working taking  extended break lunches leaving  early punching in then not working."
bad,"First and foremost they use you and take advantage of you until they cant no more, oh and dont let you be a great worker they only pick on you and let certain people slack they will stress you out so bad you might end up in the hospital oh you definitely wont grow here at all management sucks they let people harass you and dont do anything about it dont trust none of them but if you need a quick check for a few months go ahead feel like being lazy, and doing what you want to this job is for you."
bad,They dont care about the employees nor the customers. The supposed Union does nothing to prevent the mangers from taking advantage and breaking the contract. Sucky sucky sucky sucky sucky.
bad,"Over worked under paid, management is a joke. As long as they get there money they don't care about employees or customers. The area and regional suporvisers are just as bad."
bad,Staff not trained properly and when you asked to be transferred the just laugh. Managment needs replaced. Horrible treatment of employees. No respect.
bad,company was trash. nobody knew what was going on. Managers never bothered to learn your name. nobody took accountability for anything. zero training. terrible schedule.
bad,"Originally Cendant Corp. Now dissolved. Company had many legal issues 2001-2006."
bad,They can never keep staff. The little staff they do have is overworked. Several managers giving you orders and not communicating with each other. Not explaining the rules to you then punishing you for not doing something you didn’t even know you weren’t supposed to be doing.
bad,"As a former supervisor I have to say they company is one of the worse but why should they change. The employees milk the clock by being at there post 15 minutes and taking 2 hour lunches so they could be with there friends. When you mention this to upper management all they want is good labor relations. If your looking for a place that doesn’t care and pay employees to do nothing and have you have no say in it then it’s a perfect fit. While all union companies are like this, never seen one this bad"
bad,Worse job ever !  Have to clean cars too often if service agent unavailable.  Not provided with cars needed for reservations way too often.  Having to deal with irate customers on a regular basis.  Low pay and high pressure to sell the car insurance in order to keep your job.  I do NOT recommend Avis-Budget group to anyone !
bad,"This job is not worth the stress. Management is poor, work requirements are high while pay is low. Management will tell lies about raises to trick employees to work harder. Promotions are minimal and they hire from the outside making it impossible for the hardworking employees to move up in the company. All the tools you need to work are always breaking, equipment is 20+ years old. Management tries to employ new strategies with poor equipment, causing efforts to fail. Corporate forces the use of a system that works poorly. Corporate also visits on the easiest days, and gives poor advice on how to do your job better. If a day is needed for family or academics is needed, your best bet is to simply call out rather than ask, you will get told no unless you’re on managements favorite employees list. To contact corporate is impossible, to quit is the easiest way out. There are days that there are no cars, even when a customer books their reservation months ahead and prepaid, the employees who have no power get to tell the news to the customer just to get yelled at. Corporate is very much aware, apparently this is a norm for this company. Not only the regular employees but MANAGERS have quit due to the stressful requirements and inadequate pay."
bad,"Put add in job portal so that it can hire H1b "
bad,"Incroyable, mais on a essaye de me balader pour un salaire de misère, le pire c 'est que le compte ne correspond pas à la réalité  ! "
bad,Never been treated so bad In my life. Started as an apprentice I was really excited to get started . On the first day the manager called me useless and made comments about the way I looked. I was made to feel inadequate on the first day of me working there. However I overcome this and started hitting sales targets (never got paid commission) and began growing more and more utill I was top of the leader board in the midlands for my sales and service given in the first few months. However this was still not good enough and was making employees that worked there previously look bad. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS CONPANY. Was humiliated by staff and made to clean many cars and vans in a cold basement
bad,My role was working the midshift from 11 to 7. Staffing was always an issue. The manager did not really care if we were short handed.The atmosphere was as long as the work got done well then that was all that mattered.
bad,"The very bad atmosphere at work. Sometimes wages not on time in the bank. Very small rate - minimum rate for hard work. "
bad,A lot of illegal activities go on here and management sucks too  much work for low pay rate. No benefits and a very sexist company to work for. Relocation is no point
bad,Non era assolutamente l'ambiente adatto alla mia personalità. Lavoro noioso ripetitivo ed alienante. Zero possibilità di inquadramento in tempi brevi e scarsa  possibilità di crescita professionale.
bad,"Do not ever work here. The hours are terrible, the pay is worse. The company never ensures that you have the vehicles that you need for the reservations they allow customers to book. They will short hand your location and tell you to ""figure it out"". THE MANAGEMENT IS AWFUL. Stay far away from this company."
bad,Avis budget group is a hit or miss company. Some may enjoy and others may find it stressful. Company needs some improvements on the security side and customer service side!
bad,"When traveling, please be kind to whoever it is behind the counter.  It is their job to get you where you're going, for whatever reason.  But, if something went wrong, THEY DID NOT DO IT TO YOU ON PURPOSE!  And they will do what they can to get you on your way."
bad,I would not work for Avis again as the hours were not consistent or available for change. Not a great place to try to make a little extra income. Not recommended for even part-time work.
bad,I don't have much to say other than their a lot of work for them ahead. They need to focus on their people and work on increasing their wages for all departments.
bad,"No integrity and support  from the top (DM)  means none from lower management!!"
bad,Avis Budget ist Firma die ich keinem empfehlen kann.
bad,"Terrible place to work at. Basically it's a paycheck until something better comes along.  Management is abusive and the customers are abusive.  Managers play favorites.  Terrible pay.  Long hours and mandatory overtime during peak season.  Because it's customer service and a call center the company is systematically running the place into the ground. Everything is being outsourced to Tijuana. The workers are good people but get no respect from upper management. The company continuously rips off customers by lying to them when a contract is signed, adding things that the customer does not ask for like coverage and upgrades. But if the customer yells loud enough it is able to get to the top you can generally get their money back. Outdated systems. The company is dying a slow death and Uber and Lyft are the way to go."
bad,The company was not a good company to work for. They were to worried about their sales instead of their employees. I would never go back to work for them.
bad,The supervisor staff is inconsistent with communications to the workers. Outside conditions are terrible. No special rewards for hard workers. No free healthcare
bad,people was lazy and to many want to be bosses they act as if you was going to steal the cars .they had favorites . they would take days away from you if you said you could not work those days
bad,Not good. Bad culture. Needs improvement for employees and customers. Bad communication and operates corruptly. No ethics or morals at all. Needs culture change.
bad,"When I was hired I applied on Saturday and had the job by tuesday. Training was a breeze and they then dropped me and left me alone in 4 days to work on my own. I was so curious as to why was this position open and why didn't the last girl stay at the company. They made it seem like they didn't have anyone in the position before but I was able to find out that she ran as far as she could away from the company because it was so badly managed. "
bad,"Apply at your own risk. This location is always running out of cars. Even when a customer has a reservation. The overselling on rentals  is ridiculous and reoccurring."
bad,budget is a great job the problem was the managers in ft laud .commission was good no room to grow but a good pay . i heard miami location is better to work at .
bad,As above - they are a terrible company and offer no support or training. They expect the world and give nothing to support that. They tell you to be on call every day all day and also have favourites which is very clear and obvious.
bad,"In my year and change working there they cycled through 5 managers and none of them really knew what they were doing. "
bad,Reagieren auf Bewerbungen nicht. AVIS Braunschweig!!!!
bad,"This was by far the worst decision I made in my management career. There was 0 work life balance, the culture and the environment was stressful and unhealthy. The hardest part of the job was managing the employees as they were unionized. If they wanted you out of the company they would plot and scheme to get you fired. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home. Management was inappropriate in their speech and actions, and there was no room for advancement."
bad,"management can’t organise "
bad,I appreciate the years I had with Budget. The benefits were good and it provided for my family. Great vacation time off to assist the employees with a work life balance
bad,Company biased and racist and the union is a joke have to meet sales goals and the goals are technically illlegal sales of fraudulent insurance predicated on lies and deceit told to traveling customers with limited knowledge of their rights and options spent seven years with company
bad,"South San Francisco/SFO = Absolute joke.  Work 55+ hours a week in all hours of the day and night including weekends and holidays.  Pay is terrible.  Management is horrible and never transparent - they will lie - they will try and do everything they can to hustle you out of hours of work, days of work, and pay.  Salary is poor.  Company culture is nonexistent and terrible staff environment.  This company is not for serious professionals.  Great for people with no education, no experience, no options because its a step above working fast food.  Do not waste your time."
bad,if you don't work for a corporate owned location... look elsewhere. The agency locations are not supported at all by corporate management or franchise management. The corporate owned locations offer benefits and far better conditions.
bad,"Unfair treatment"
bad,"I loved the job, but the manager treated me horrible! He had his favorites and would communicate with them with politeness, but to me he wouldn't talk to me and if i tried telling him something he would walk away as i was telling him something! Very disrespectful! I busted my butt for the company and i got no appreciation for what i did! Never work for the idaho falls Avis."
bad,I have worked in the car rental for 10+ years and I just left the business with a poor taste in my mouth. It has changed from being an enjoyable experience to it being all about sales driven place to work.
bad,"The worst management you ever going to meet"
bad,Do not ever work here. This place is awful. The manager is horrible and doesn’t know how to be a manager. The company is greedy and does not care about you at all. They don’t pay well and don’t care about your safety
bad,"After starting and being told my training would be 6 weeks and that I would not get off later than 8pm, 2 weeks in I was required to go on to a regular schedule that I was unable to keep because I had to take public transit and the buses stopped running.  I told two managers when I started what my situation was and was told that it would not be an issue until after training which by then I would have had enough  money to get a car.  I was also left alone to assist customers when I had yet to be trained on the companies systems completely.  There was little to no support from superiors to assist us in providing a good customer experience and we were blamed for that poor customer experience by both the customer and our superiors.  Managers would frequently allow agents to become overwhelmed by heavy customer flow and would actively avoid stepping in because so many people have quit or won't apply"
bad,"Stay away from this company. they treat their employees very poorly. they hire very young managers who have no experience. I had to teach them how to do things so as they manage me later. how fun is that."
bad,"If u like to be screamed at on every call then this is the job for you."
bad,Working on zero hours basis for minimum wage to suit their needs with zero job security while me and the family lived in poverty.  Legal slavery backed up by an inept government steeped in the traditions of greed and  corruption.
bad,"There were too many days that I was forced to come in and work from 8 am to midnight and they expected me to come into work at 8 the next day. They do not pay well and management was never there, she was rude and crude to many people including certain employees. They fired several people in their history that were pregnant, I also was fired while was pregnant."
bad,Culture of getting over on the customer. management and sales coaches instruct you to lie to customers and squeeze them for every penny possible. what you permit you promote and they promote unethical sales practice.
bad,so stressful but good pay. WATCHOUT for poor MANAGMENT! if you're a person who can deal with long lines and really rude customers then this place is the right job for you.
bad,"privately owned franchise, manager was the owner who never took responsibility and blamed everyone else. Was not a nice place to go, manager was not fair, bad communication, would tell me to come in and then say he didnt tell me I was supposed to be there but i could stay for an hour, even with proof that he did tell me to come in."
bad,"the double standards make it hard for some people to want to stay because, I could get in trouble for something like dress code but if another girl was wearing my exact outfit no words would be said. When they say they're giving raises they should stick to their word or not offer a raise at all. This place is like a highschool, full of drama and people sticking their nose where it doesn't belong, everyone should just go to work to work. Not play games"
bad,"The manager didn't share and wasn't forthcoming with information.  While the manager could finesse the upper management teams, the manager didn't care much for the other folks who worked there.  It was hard to make a boss look good if the boss didn't share goals and objectives with the team."
bad,"This was one of the worst places I have ever work at, didn't care about staffs at all. Upper management was the worst, the work sitting was the worst and they work you like a dog."
bad,Hated the back stabbing within the company.  Avis has a good selling pitch but doesn't live up to it when they are recruiting people. Management is border dictatorship.
bad,Then managers that ran the branch that i worked for which was locally owned. where terrible people and extremely shady. If you love getting yelled at day in and out from not only your bosses but your customers to then this is a job for you. i would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,Extremely toxic atmosphere with absolutely no organization. Avoid at all costs. No opportunity for advancement. Employees do not feel valued. Very minimal pay job for physical labor outdoors in the elements. Strongly advise looking elsewhere.
bad,No room for growth. Management was never there. No lunch or breaks because I always worked from 8am-6pm alone. No water or water fountain provided. This particular Avis store was a joke.
bad,"Worked as a service agent and hated it. They hire u just to have someone to pick on basically. They have favorites no matter how hard u wrk, it will not be reconized. The counter manager was very dirty and had an attitude all the time.  Too much drama, they talk behind ur bk. They very unappreciative.pay is horrible, no benifits no holiday pay, nothinggggg. The service manager spend most of his,time with the counter manager, then pops up with drama. U can and will get fired for absolutely nothing."
bad,"La société Avis budget group est une société qui est empreinte d'illusion dans le sens où tout est réalisé en sourdine. "
bad,"Cette société est une honte en ce qui concerne le côté humain. Vous êtes un numéro et vite remplacé si vous ne correspondez pas au ""mouton"" qu'ils recherchent. Ce poste d'agent commercial et opérationnel est tout simplement un mensonge car vous allez la plupart du temps nettoyer les voitures et rester des heures sur le parking dans le froid à attendre les retours de location. Ils n'ont pas trouvé de solutions (type cabine chauffée en attendant les retours de location) donc vous aurez à disposition une voiture chauffée à la place."
bad,It is a bad place and the workers are very disrespectful.It is the worst place a person can work.I worked for them for 13 years and they still were bad.
bad,"good at all agent and worker  they are family , management they far away form the worker .good  jobs is good at all agent and worker  they are family ,"
bad,"This is the most poorly run company of all I have seen and/or worked for. Never enough staffing to handle the call volume, peak season seems to surprise them every year and due to p*ss poor staffing plans, mandatory OT is a requirement meaning you give up any plans for an outside life. "
bad,"They promise advancement, growth and fair treatment. When i was there, I found out growth is only available in big city locations, your growth is very limited (payrise offered after a few months service, was for less than the paper it was written on -literally) and fair treatment was for those with a bigger, better job title."
bad,"The Agency owner has no honor. He does not care about the vehicles, nor about the locations, nor about the customers and definitely not anything to do with the staff. Keep away and work somewhere else. For your family life, your professional life and your sanity."
bad,"You do not receive support just constant pressure "
bad,"Learned some while there, but not enough to their standards. Needed to be sales orientated and I was more of a people pleaser or liked customer service more. Pressure to sale at every opportunity, but your opportunity could be taken by co-workers."
bad,"Typical day at work id fair enough"
bad,"Emploi dans le cadre de la validation de la formation de teleconseiller"
bad,"In the corporation there is a great amount of time they require you work overtime, so there is no work life balance with the company at all."
bad,This job is mostly washing cars and very little if any service work. Pay is $10.00 per hour. Expectations is to clean up 6 - 8 cars per hour for 12 hours with no breaks. Company worked me for 12 hours in high outside temperature and got only one break to barely eat a sandwich. Owner is elderly man whom I felt was disrespectful by comments made.  In my opinion job duties (work load) for pay amount is unrealistic.
bad,"High activity, No structure , constant change in management, profiling, no consistency,  protocol constantly changing"
bad,Drive the clean vehicles to airport and park into stalls. I have learned the different models of autoes and relative knowledge. The company encourage people to work with a self-motivated working style. Staffs are support each other. The hardest part of the job is winter's road conditions. The vehicles might slide on the slippery road. The most enjoyable part of the job is traveling to other towns such as Banff.
bad,There is no support from management! You can work all day and still feel that you have not accomplish anything! Management knows that employees are overworked and underpaid!!
bad,The CHS location has to be the worst place to work in america. Management has no clue and there isn't a happy employee to be found.
bad,"No degree was necessary for this job, or investment in the success of the individual.  Encouraged deception to get the sale.  Sat at a computer terminal and had to ""advise"" the renter on how to rent a car and insurance."
bad,this job was not too bad. the thing I hated was working in the cold and the rain. my coworker were fun but besides that there was nothing else to rave about.
bad,"ever since it became avisbudget group, the company has gone way down! in the job description, it says you can make up to $75,000 at the okc location. truth be told, it's more like $30,000 to $35,000 and that's if they have the cars to rent!"
bad,"Making sure you are meeting the needs of the business and satisfying the customers to highest level in customer service."
bad,i hated this job and everything it entailed. they do not care about their employees and they put a tremendous amount of pressure on the sales staff.
bad,"No advancements, pay was not good no raises in two years, management always looking for everything you do wrong even if they have to set you up"
bad,"Was called in for a interview and the man I interviewed with was so hateful and just down right mean. I could not figure out if it was because I was white, over fifty years old or because I was not dumb."
bad,Hope you don't have a life because your schedule will change all the time. Ranging from 5am to 12 am.
bad,"Horrible place to work, not like it use to be. Commission is minimal if any. If you don't work at the airport or corporate they will treat you like step children. No growth opportunity. Everything is done half way. They do not care about their customers only profit. Word of advice fire everyone and start fresh. The company has turned into an abyss of repetition. If you managed to bring in corporate accounts for them you get 0 compensation. District manager literally told me "" No ones ever done that in years"" Now you know why."
bad,"When average rent in traverse city is 600a month, bills up to 200 and gas around 200 and food around 150. THIS MANAGER NEEDS TO RETHINK WHAT HE/SHE IS OFFERING! PATHETIC!"
bad,"The way that Avis pay structure works is lets say a customer walks into avis with a reservation for a little cheap car for the day.The more you upgrade that customer to take expensive insurance or more expensive ""cooler"" car than what they are reserved in, gps systems etc,the more you get payed on a commission check every month."
bad,"Works in partnership with clients, advising them how to use information technology in order to meet their business objectives or overcome problems. Consultants work to improve the structure and efficiency of an organisation's IT systems"
bad,"Awful environment, Awful management. It is now out of business."
bad,I meet new people everyday. I enjoy cleaning cars and transporting them to customers. I really meet nice people that are willing to help when you need them. That is the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Poor management. There were a lot of things that didn't really add up when I worked here. I'm not one to down talk a company but the time I spent there really didn't amount to anything. I never planned to pursue any opportunities in this company and there were not many opportunities to pursue to begin with.
bad,A typical day consist of renting about 40-50 cars to customers. Management team sucked badly. Never felt like they cared about their employees and the few that did was never able to speak out about it.
bad,"nice job, no aggravation to deal with, management was fair to all employees"
bad,Okay place to work at different people to talk too and nice enviroment
bad,I love working at this job but they would not recognize hard workers. They do not give raises. The do not shot their appreciation their employees. It was kind of like we were slaves.
bad,The worst working enviroment: Forget about your promotion!. The company will lie and trick you in regards to your promotion. Corrupt District Manager & Regional Manager who treat employees like animals. Unfair reviews. HR is controlled by the District Manager with no voice or opinion of its own. Operation Managers doing the work that hourly employees should be doing so the company can save money on payroll. That's the perfect model of how a company should not be ran!
bad,"Lack of communication, horrible management team, starting from the head, unrealisttic expectations and so on. Working there is the worse nightmare and looking forward to find something good."
bad,Over worked & under paid with little progression opportunities.
bad,Stressful sales tactics.
bad,"Job downsized and went out of business in 2009, and is now owned by Avis Car Rentals"
bad,i think this company needs lots of improvement with the way they handle situations with coworker.
bad,"Poor communication to employees about changes, not flexible with schedule when trying to go back to school. Some co-workers didn't care what subject they talked about even if it was inappropriate and nothing was done to change it."
bad,"By far the worst place to work, we started with a group of about 20 and at the end of two months nobody was left."
bad,They are a disgusting company to work for. Very unfair horrible training and management they will embarass you and stress you out until you get ulcers
bad,"Worst job i ever had in my life, would never return to the company ever again, gives little to there employees and works them like slaves. A horriable company"
bad,The company did not give a opportunity for advancement. They were slowly taking hours from me monthly.
bad,Toxic culture . Everyone there is miserable . Hard work doesn’t count . Kissing up is encouraged . Schedule is unreliable . Long hours forced not much flexibility
bad,I would not recommend this as a full time gig. It way too stressful for the amount they’re paying. If you’re in school and just need something for now. This job is for you. Managements horrible and unreliable. The retention rate is poor (for good reason). At this location we seem to have a new manager every year who is undertrained and can’t help the employees. I’m just glad I’ll be leaving soon. So save yourself some trouble don’t apply here. Go somewhere else literally any other car rental place in Lafayette is in a better place to work.
bad,"Poor service, dont care about employee, and only care for the ratings.I was an employee their and you had to kiss their  for them to leave you alone.."
bad,"Underpaid for the workload."
bad,"Avis Las Vegas is a horrible place to work, but just like a lot of places it lacks the 2 most important things for a business to be successful, leadership & communication. I can rant on forever but in a whole I’ve never met a bigger group of idiots in my life. They can barely make a schedule let alone run day to day operations. It’s senior managements fault, they don’t get involved enough to make the decisions that effect people’s lives, customers & employees."
bad,"M anagement was atrocious at this company, I was out sick for several days at one point, kept in contact and updated them on my doctors orders and availability, yet I would still wake up everyday to a call from management threatening to fire me when I returned if I didn't have a doctors note I had already i nformed them I had. Upper managemn\ent ignores the day to day needs of the facility, and they only hire part time and change your hours every week. DO NOT WORK HERE"
bad,Hard work in different weather conditions for little pay. The management team will treat you bad. They most promote white employees in the city of Milwaukee.
bad,"Great for temporary jobs/opportunities. There is no structure far as scheduling, position, work placement. A typical day is filling in for someone else, not getting any breaks, very very fast pace and you will be working alone or little to no help. Management is VERY rude and will not tend to your break needs, schedule needs, and or relocation/work placement. This job has a LOT of turnovers! If your young and need to get your foot in the door of the job industry this job will be decent. If your looking for promotions, hiring within the company, set schedules, work place structure this is NOT the job for you."
bad,"There's alot of things that unfortunately is wrong with this company. How they treat their employee's directly applies to how we treat our customers. Managers are worked to the point of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion. You give up everything for a pay check."
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees or give you tools to do a good job. Very high turn around and burnout. High stress level, be prepared. A lot of internal chaos."
bad,"this company doesn't care about your life outside of your job.they are very open about giving favor to employees. only place to move to is lead, and that is only if the manager like you. not if you care do the job. they don't pay you for all the work you do."
bad,The management at Texarkana office is horrible. They show favorites and if you speak your mind the manager will try her best to get you out the door!!
bad,"Avis bugdet que dire de cette entreprise. Elle cultive déjà la notion du turnover. 4 mois de période d'essai en cdi pour vous dire qu'au bout de 3 mois vous n'êtes pas assez bon dans vos chiffre alors qu'auparavant aucun  retour sur les chiffres et aucun conseil de la hiérarchie.  Ils ne vous lacheront pas sur vos chifrres, ils vous mettent la pression en permanence. Pas évident de prendre sa pause déjeuner surtout quand vous avez 35 départ et que vous êtes seule. Bref si vous intégré cette entreprise réfléchissez avant de signer"
bad,"Rental car sales, expected to sell counter products."
bad,"unethical, unprofessional, low pay, associates make more than management. Union ruined the place"
bad,"This company will tell you how much you will make on commision there is no way to make that happen. Management are liars and Dirty I have worked in the car rental industry over 20 years I got suckered in to this clown of an outfit and it was just a nightmare. Lies on lies proor management, If you are a pro liar than this company is for you because that is what is EXPECTED of you you have to lie to customers every day. My adivse is RUN dont apply You will reget it i gave up 35k a year to this company and went down to 22K a year and then let go after a year, I am now I am unemployed and dont know what to do. If you have a job keep it. It cant be worse than this company. No one that works at the location that I worked at like the job and is looking every day for other work. so just dont do it save your time."
bad,Compensation and any opportunity or advancement is very low withing this company.
bad,"This is about the worst place you would ever want to work. You are always understaffed and most of your co-workers are poorly picked and have no interest in even being there. They just take the job until something else comes along. Top management has no idea as to what goes on in the field and should they ever come out to review the location they are unsupportive and negative. Basically management doesn't want to do the job, just collect the returns from your hard work. I have learned that Budget teaches you to be on your guard with management as things are not what they seem and that they can and will turn on you without warning and an investment of your time for your future and the future of the company is unrewarding at best. Most people with any drive don.t mind working hard however if Owners dont care then why make the effort. Management should talk to the ""right"" people before making the wrong decisions about peoples lives who have invested their lives in working for him. Stop being fooled by those around you. They have been fooling you for years. Management knows who those hard working people are and is capable of fixing these concerns, the question is -- Will it be done? Or is this request for a review just another one of those time wasters? What have you got to loose by investigating ????? You know what you have to gain."
bad,"Prefer not to share. This was not a good fit for me, but it could be for others. Company going through a lot of changes which includes elimination of some positions."
bad,"A typical day at work is answering calls from customers around British Columbia, generally dealing with reservations and complaints. There is poor management, with little to no education in business management. Advancement is earned through friendships, not on merit. High turnover with same bottom 5 positions as they are over worked, underpaid, and undervalued. Expect to work weekends with no time off, ever. "
bad,"You're underpaid overworked and never enough help to get the job done."
bad,"I work for a contractor for Avis. Called Fleet Logistics. They Don't pay worth your time to work hard. We allways have openings, people come and go like the wind. We even do re-hire because the lack of anybody wanting to start at $9  an hour."
bad,The management is not honest and cruelly discriminates against women in managerial/franchise owner positions. Unfortunately the work ethics of the top management is questionable.
bad,"Was brought in at the desk, never given enough time to make commission, only 4 or 5 people get enough time, manager is the most miserable human being I ever seen, assistant manager is just as bad with a smile, 2 horrible human beings, they will constructively dismiss you if you question anything they say, "
bad,"Sconsiglio vivamente a chiunque di lavorare presso la Avis Budget Spa! Soprattutto la sconsiglio a chi viene assunto come stagionale. Lo stress a cui si è soggetti non è neanche lontanamente ripagato dallo stipendio da fame erogato. Premi vari/componenti addizionali variabili dello stipendio irraggiungibili poichè collegati a risultati di vendita e di soddisfazione del cliente irraggiungibili. Non fate fede alle parole di chi è dentro da molto tempo nell’organizzazione, non dirà mai la verità su nulla. Diffidate di tutti a parte di voi stessi, ogni giorno potrebbe essere un giorno da dimenticare! Nei wend dovrete lavorare con disponibilità di veicoli estremamente ridotta rispetto alle prenotazioni e dovrete inventarvi balle x non far infuriare i già infuriati malcapitati clienti che si troveranno a fare lunghissime code prima di essere serviti.In poche parole, se l’offerta nei vs. confronti da avis budget spa è limitata ad un contratto a tempo determinato stagionale andate a farvi la stagione da qualche altra parte con meno stress e magari con uno stipendio migliore."
bad,"Worked for one of their independently owned locations. Treated awfully, not paid fairly. As in 'why should I care about this fleet of cars?' unfair. Fired over an injury."
bad,"Avis Budget is the perfect place for lazy frat boys to fail up. If you are a woman or are outside of the friend group of the managers who work for the company, you don't stand a chance of succeeding. They will harass you and treat you poorly and make it seem like it is your fault. HR does not help, they rally around the boys club."
bad,"La culture d'entreprise chez Avis Budget Group est inexistante.  Autant l'accroche lors de l'embauche est bien faite, autant la vie de tous les jours est d'une médiocrité sans nom.  Le Top Management cherche encore sa voie, une méthodologie stable et pérenne.  Malheureusement, le Turn Over plus que conséquent empêche toute stabilisation de la structure.  L'on semble ne pas savoir utiliser les potentiels humains correctement : l'évolution se fait de manière politique et pas managériale.  Le travail en direct avec les équipes est cependant le plus valorisant.  Le personnel est réceptif et compétent; ce qui semble opposé avec l'encadrement hors opérations.  En résumé, Avis Budget Group est une société qui ne sait pas manager les managers et tirer d'eux le meilleur."
bad,"From my experiences and those of my colleagues too:"
bad,My manager passed me over for a promotion that could have gave me the chance to still live in the area.  I do not know the reason why but a false rumor went around that I was purposely throwing car keys away in the trash can.  This was not me.
bad,"Poor management, lack of training. Nice location, clean and modern."
bad,France car à été racheté par Avis il y a 2 ans . Depuis le rachat toutes les valeurs de l'entreprise ont été piétinnées. La course au chiffre . Marche ou crève.  Des responsables d'agence et responsables régionaux qui ne respectent rien ni personne.  Hypocrisie coup dans le dos et j'en passe... vous avez une vision différente ? Ne postulez pas vos jours professionnels seront comptés...
bad,Eisenhüttenstadt ist das letzte wo man anfangen soll hier werden sie nur verarscht Std werden nicht richtig bezahlt usw
bad,"Hiring and Firing is rampant at lower and higher levels, no clear job roles and responsibilities, abrupt changes in management - the company - Now known as Bright Spark Auto Repairing is not a professional business unit to work in anymore."
bad,This company is a company that ive done business with in the past as well as worked for. My experience there wasn't the best but I learned a lot while there.
bad,"Processus de recrutement effectué pour un CDI, le jour de ma prise de poste en agent de comptoir on essai de me faire signer un CDD de 3 mois avec un salaire ridicule ( pas beaucoup plus que un SMIC)."
bad,"If you do not fit in their club, you will regret it. Too many favoritisms, horrible training, i was supposed to learn a higher manager position but he refused to train me. Many times i was on a phone call getting yelled at because i was not trained correctly, or following instructions from my manager that was improper company policy and then getting thrown  under the bus. I was told to work hours that no one else in the department wanted to work."
bad,"Worked as a mechanic in the East Elmhurst shop by Laguardia.If you need a pay check then work here if not don't apply,waste of time!! They lied to you"
bad,"Hurt on the job means what when your medical leave is over you are immediately expected to preform your job better than when you left."
bad,I would'nt go back for the world. The manager didn't do her job. She made you do it. If you didn't she wrote you up. She lied to several people to get her way. Even if you have medical documentation of how much you can work they don't care. They make it very hard to balance life between home and kids and there. Seems like all they care about is the budget. Money money  money that's what they care about. Not the people who could make that company great if treated way better.
bad,"Good company with good qualities to all the staff and environment."
bad,To put it simply two or more employees have walked out in the last two weeks without giving advanced notice.  The company is managed poorly.  It is an uncertain and high stressed work environment.
bad,Every department has a manager that doesn't care about employees and demands results while providing no training or clear instructions and not paying an acceptable wage to perform what they expect to their standards. Would not recommend.
bad,"I work at Orlando airport , this location is the heart of the company but they are running to the ground , we never have enough cars to much the reservatio. Very stressful work environment, poor management , especially the general manager who is targeting employees, u don’t know if y are going to have a job tomorrow or no , it depends on management mood that day . . The company talks about family , unfortunately no such things there are there to get u , doesn’t matter how hard you work . Because u just a number to them . I hope from the ceo of the company to come down and check the mess that going on in Orlando airport and the poor management. Average wait for a customer to get his car is 1 hour in a good day ,usually is 2 hours that what make our job hard and make a sale impossible. Also we have couple managers that harassed employees but the employees are afraid to come forward. The Hr is absolutely absent. There are unlimited issues and problems. From the bottom of my heart I want the upper management to come and take look ."
bad,No respect for fellow co workers upper management does not know how to talk to employees they also did not utilize feed back from the staff to make the job more productive
bad,"Stressful job where customers are the rudest, company doesn't follow thru with product that they advertise on website making the job unpleasant. Other employers are snakes and will throw you under the bus at any given opportunity."
bad,"A typical day would consist of prepping vehicles for the days reservations, processing the days reservations as well as walkups and completing the days deposits and paperwork. MY experience with the company was little different since it was a franchise so it may differ than that of a corporate employee."
bad,constantly running out of needed supplies and takes weeks or more to receive with constant reminders from employees. Management blames Corporate for everything
bad,"The corporate level executives making operational decisions are so far removed from the operation. This causes the decisions to be based on promises to share-holders yet are actually terrible for those working directly in the operation. Even though we are supposed to get 30 minute lunch breaks, we get looked down upon if we take 30 minutes, especially during the busy season. Although we get a car, gas, and insurance, it does not make up for the ridiculously low salary and 50+ hour weeks with no overtime pay."
bad,Management sucks at this location under staffed under paid no management support.... commission sucks bad very stressful work environment would not recommend this to the devil
bad,"This company may be international but in Britain it is under resourced in management levels ,skill base and dare I say car stock ."
bad,"I had no personal life working for Avis. It was all about being available for their purposes. All managerial meetings seemed to be on a day that I needed to rest. I had ten hour shifts, when I was only getting paid for eight hours. The worst thing was, when my father had passed, they only let me have three days of bereavement time. They knew, that religiously, I was required to mourn for 7 days. Alas, I was given an ultimatum, and had to return to work."
bad,"Payless Ontario is a very small location, poor management and no room for growth. Everyone that works at this place will end up quitting within 4 to 5 months. Its a okay place to work if you are just looking to make some quick money but not long term. it's not a job you can take seriously."
bad,"Certes ils managent autrement (dans des beaux bureaux, lumineux, des espaces favorisant l'échange) mais il ne faut pas vouloir une vie en dehors. "
bad,it was hard working at the Memphis location. management is too messy. Felt like high school all over again. I guess that's what happens when you hire immature individuals to supervise others.
bad,"Management not only poor but, in fact, absent.  Salaries just a micron above minimum wage without so much as a whiff of a raise for, in many cases, years.  No training whatsoever and yet employees are expected to make good decisions based on...ESP, I guess.  Facilities are a disgrace.  No benefits whatsoever, unless you count the free hat you MIGHT receive."
bad,"so much favoritism"
bad,"Micromanaged everyday, no job security.  Management lacked accountability.   If they think you won't fit they will harass you into another position until you either forced to take it or they will eventually find a way to fire you.  Never gave you the opportunity to learn or improve the skills they feel you were lacking. They literally told you to lie in order to  make a sale.  Hardworking and a great attitude is not rewarded."
bad,"In the brief time I worked there (a little over 2 months), I found that the people I worked with were great.  Thank goodness they were helpful in answering my questions and helping me learn the ropes.  I found that you received very little training before being left alone to fend for yourself.  Although the owner expressed a desire to be very professional, her solution to training involved my standing in front of the customer and calling her to walk me through screens I hadn't yet learned.  Although effective, it appeared to me to be very unprofessional and quite embarrassing.  At my interview I expressed to the owner that I was NOT a salesperson and not comfortable with sales practices.  I was told it was not sales it was more of a numbers game.  NOT TRUE.  By the time I was ""laid off"", I had learned most of the screens used (there are like 20) and had the all the reports and procedures down.  Unfortunately I was not producing sales to the owner's satisfaction.  Exactly the thing I told her at my interview that I was not comfortable doing.  I ALWAYS asked the customer if they were interested in buying the supplemental products/coverage.  However, I didn't possess the ability to fancy-talk or trick them into paying to upgrade their vehicles (especially when I was required to give them the upgraded vehicle because we did not have the vehicle they reserved).  I'm not comfortable lying and I did not like the idea of being caught in a lie.  However I do think the worst part of the whole situation was not receiving any type of warning or training to improve on what she thought I"
bad,if you do not value your personal life then this is the place to work.
bad,Opening and closing shop. Hiring and firing employees as needed. It was my job to make sure all fleet were accounted for at all times. I was responsible for making sure all vehicles were up to code and safe to rent. I reviewed all logs and camera activity. I made sure all employees followed all safety precautions and rules.
bad,"Management does not care about their employees at all. Constant fight between union and management. You will get mandatoried(forced to work additionaly hrs.) with no heads up. Most employees there are VERY VERY lazy and don't do their work. In fact, they avoid customers, so their numbers stay up and yours go down. then they get praised for their awesome numbers. IAH location in Houston."
bad,ABG seems to be hanging in there by the skin of it's rotten teeth. Managers are ill equipped to manage a team. They have no experience although they think they are the tops.They will place inaccurate notes in claims files after they made huge mistakes and then point a finger at the claims examiner to cover their own screw ups. The lies are endless and H/R will concur with the lies of management to cover-up the managers indiscretions.
bad,"Horrible company. No one cares about employees. Corporate should be ashamed of themselves. RSW is horrible to work at. No cars, always unhappy customers."
bad,"Leadership weaknesses, Poor Integrity, Lack of Adaptability, Little visión for future, Lack of Accountability and Poor Communication Skills.  The Manager should receive the “Worst Manager of All Time Award”"
bad,Terribile il rapporto con il lavoro fatto di forte stress e pressioni per obbligare i clienti a comprare i prodotti aggiuntivi. Terribile il podio dove viene scritto chi lavora bene e in rosso le persone sotto performance.
bad,"Keep looking,  not enough $ for the time or stupidity. "
bad,"new manager incredibly rude "
bad,I do not recommend working for this company.They try to force you to sell a lot of high priced extra insurances and products no one wants or needs.Customers have to wait in long lines and wait for their cars to be cleaned. This makes for a very stressful job.
bad,was only wash bay for over 31 days had to work 16 ours days . no days off. upper management was not interested in getting me help saying one person was enough.
bad,"Fixed Scheduling is horrible."
bad,"All returned cars are gassed and washed then delivered to different locations.  I learned not to sweat the small stuff.  The owners of this location do not treat their employees well, they get mad first then ask questions.  it's a casual work atmosphere and the other employees are fun to be around.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the owner and all their chaos, very stressful.  I enjoy doing the trips all around Oregon, it's relaxing when I drive all day."
bad,Management has no education or experience to resolve customer or employee issues. Employees cheat customers and management cheat employees on their commissions.
bad,I've seen employees get into physical fights as well as verbal altercations with other employees as well as management without them receiving any punishment. It is very close to impossible to get fired from this job the only employee i had every seen fired got arrested on the lot. If you are more than a minute late you lose the hour of pay and get marked as absent for the entire day. Lots of employees just wouldn't call in sick and just not show up. Very stressful i quit when upper management told me they forgot to look into the only issue i had while i was there. Union is also very expensive.
bad,Long work hours and low salary. Operations managers are required to work 10 hour shifts. The only perk of is that operations managers can drive a different car from the fleet each week as part of their salary package.
bad,"harassment, bullying, backstabbing, not enough employees, extremely long hours, no help ( you literally feel alone) begging coworkers for help. They do not stop the reservations from coming in when there are no more cars to rent. You are told to give body damaged, high mileage, cracked windshields, bad tires, and out of service vehicles. People have 10 to 25 years of employment and never given the opportunity to move up. This place taught me the true meaning of dishonesty and corruption."
bad,"You will have no life, management are hypocrites and judgements, no training and you never have vehicles and you will get cursed out for it and management will do absolutely nothing"
bad,"To many bosses. Not enough communication within associates, not enough workers on each shift, I felt like my employer never really appreciated my work."
bad,"In the beginning it's a great place to work, especially at the airport. Then after your training you will realize how everything works. If you don't make an upsell, or sell coverage the rental days on the contract counts against your commission pay. The more days you accumulate without any sales the lower your commission will be. So you are being penalized for the sales you have already secured. You will see your coworkers avoiding rentals by running to the break room or talking on the phone too long. It gets to the point where it upsets you. To top it off, you will be dealing with stressed out customers who been traveling all day taking their frustrations out on you. Then having to deal with micro managing, phone calls from customers disputing their bill, lost and found issues and whining coworkers who complain everyday about how they hate their job. It is a vicious cycle that will stress you out! To make high commissions you have to be willing to take advantage and manipulate your customers. International travelers are the main ones who get taken advantage of. Many of them have no idea what their daily rate is or they understand very little English and you can stick it to them. When they have full credit vouchers you can load it up on them. Rental Associates at the Indy Airport have ran the well dry. Most of the vouchers now have upsells and coverages blocked leaving you with little or no opportunity to make any money. My advice is if you have other employment offers, I would consider looking into those offers. Avis Budget Group at the Indianapolis Airport is by far the worst"
bad,"The best part of my work experience here are my co-workers, everyone is very friendly and trustworthy. Management needs a LOT of work, there is a lack of communication between them all. I've learned how to handle very hostile & delicate situations when there is an indifference. The hardest part of my job is dealing with very rude and unkind but I've always overcame their disrespect."
bad,"i was lured in by promises of career advancement, lies. "
bad,"Don't work for this one.No Breaks, low pay, lack of management, no benefits. The Agency Operator does not communicate with you on what days to work."
bad,"First of all, if you get a job here, anticipate making $15-$20,000 less than any other claims job in the industry. ABG Human Resources is convinced their payscales are in line with the rest of the industry. Haa!!!"
bad,"Very stressful enviroment. Never enough vehicles to accomodate reservations. Very long lines with frustrated customers. Bad communication with management. Competition between managment. Working in outside, including harsh winters and scorching summers."
bad,There were fun moments but overall the main problem was management and the way operations were handled at times they wanted too much for a little pay and it felt like a chicken running around with no head. I feel they can do better for their dedicated employees and be a little bit more organized then the company be worth a better rating
bad,"Industry standards seem to be overworked and underpaid. No family/work balance. Managers typical work week was 70 to 80 hours, mostly renting cars at the counter because of no staff. Hard to perform your daily duties when your having to try to balance Operations into renting cars"
bad,Been working here for 20+ years and every year it gets worse I waisted a lot of years I should of left when it stopped being employee owned but I will stick it out now until they do another buy out or shut the center down I know it’s coming they outsourced everything and customers and employees are not happy! The outsourced folks takes customers credit cards and info and then hang up on them or transfer them to US then we get cussed out
bad,"don't work for avis in vancouver, worst place of work. i've never seen that. avis is a strong group, but this location is a joke. "
bad,There is so much workplace violence it is unreal and they are always yelling at you and even on the walkie talkie and they do not like you to ask questions.  If you did you would find their mistakes.
bad,"This place is Horrible. Airport Managers are a joke. They don't care much about your success or their regular employees. Gossip is terrible at this location and could put a toll on your life. Employees are disrespectful because of their unionship. Highly unethical practices at this location. "
bad,I’m so shocked how they can allow some managers to be managers . Someone who can lack in their employees or always wish they were else where and not care about the actual company . Always brings negatively to the office everyday and not to forget but how they can talk to customers.. and think arguing or treating customers horribly and think it’s ok? They favor here . They don’t care about  other coworkers harassing over coworkers ..
bad,"They wont tell you that there a force policy which is working 2 hours on top of schedule time and they force depending on management mood. The union is no help at all they are with the company. The schedule are all over the place and it picked buy seniority which is but people who been here for 13+ year are still stuck in nights, because when when someone retire they remove the shift. Management does not care about employee morale, they dont even care if the cars are properly clean (they tell us frequently that they dont care) . And the safety is a joke we had someone blow up a gas pump and they made us go back to work without calling fire Marshall 1 hour later. Also no maintenance on anything. What I'm trying to say is just apply anywhere else they more then likely pay more."
bad,"really stressfull,most of the time we have no cars,customers really rudes,managers no good,it was really good company ,but now they just wants partimes and is been a stressfull,job"
bad,"Maintain to yard clean up, wash windows and car wash bays, check lighting, patch potholes in parking lot, prepping new cars to be rented out. Coworkers were fun to work with."
bad,"This is a worse case scenario job. Favoritism is definitely a problem here. The employee turnover rate is ridiculous. And you have many bosses telling you different tasks and won't admit to it if confronted, so good luck to you."
bad,"En Alicante hay una manager que no está capacitada para serlo ni de lejos. Mucha desigualdad en el trato a sus empleadas. Esta señora, por llamarla de alguna manera, se dedica a menospreciar y malmeter contra grupo de trabajadoras no afines a ella. Debería tener más de una denuncia por acoso laboral, pero la gente tiene miedo. Parece mentira que una empresa como Avis tenga a una persona así como manager de uno de los aeropuertos más importantes de España."
bad,"The job was alright, but the branch I worked at was small (just 2 employees).  My manager and I didn't believe in the same business practices and had a falling out."
bad,my coworkers helped make my job more pleasant. the company when i started cared about it's employees but when i left they didn't seem to.the wanted more work for less
bad,"It's already hard enough to please customers. No cars that have been prebooked are never available. They overbook with knowing that customers will have no choice but to take whatever we have. It you upsell a car to try to make a sale that they feel you understood you will be written up, when at times they're giving the same card away at no charge. Management hides and let's there front counter get the stressful part of it all. They take your commission apart by strategically offering card we don't have to bring in clients but with that comes loss of revenue for the sales agent. They are thief's yet they talk about our integrity should be of greatness...."
bad,Management was horrible they didn't know how to talk to the employees. Work consists of cleaning and parking cars mangers never let you communicate with other employees just a horrible place to work
bad,"Working for Avis Budget Group was an experience that I will never forget. Although it's one of the largest rental car associations, employees did not obtain great benefits. While we worked 8-12 hour shifts daily, we received the same rates as customers for vehicles and had a limited selection of vehicles we could choose from.Lunch breaks were extremely limited, if there were no other employees available to cover your shift, then you wouldn't be able to take a lunch. Most importantly, there were no security on site for the aggressive customers."
bad,"Everything is done in secret. There is a pushy sales culture where every year the environment gets worse. You improve, yet they want more and more. They max out on yearly bonus, yet the managers push for even more. Once you have made enough money for them-they secretly push you out the door. Ive never been a part of such a secretive company where HR and upper management thrive on turning everyone against everyone else. The operation managers do there best, but most things are out of there control."
bad,You will never make any money here the way the tiers are set up
bad,"Management has no clue on what to do especially night shift.They hire new managers & don't train them properly.  "
bad,"Not the best place to work co-workers are nice but some of the supervisors are rude, their shifts are sometimes unreasonable and they often change last minute."
bad,"Pros: meeting different people with delightful personalities, friendly environment from most staff members, "
bad,I worked at night and at a certain time everyone besides. me was  in the parking lot sleep they treat new people like dogs -- dont recommend  the working conditions are not worth your time the lot to park the buses are not up to par they need a better area
bad,Fast paced on busy days but when it's slow it's really slow. ..a lot of standing on your feet.in and out rain or not....alot of cleaning... Best part is the customers.
bad,"Expected to clock in 5 mins prior to shift, breaks, lunch or required that you are late & get an occurrence. 7 mins a day allowed off phones, this means to go to the bathroom, get something to drink, get something from the printer. Super strict. Only allowed 2 occurrences or your terminated. High turn over rate. Never get any bonuses. Paid less than any other car rental place. Cell phones/electric devices not allowed on floor. If someone needs to get in contact with you, they must call the director & they will decide if its necessary for you to answer. Management is awful and does not care about you as a human but as a robot to push numbers."
bad,"Mandatory 10 hour shift for managers plus unpaid OT. Always understaffed, high turnover, and no inventory. You will be a glorified hourly employee. No value placed on employees. Very low pay for the amount of work and stress you deal with."
bad,It was stressful job ever and bad tools and poor customer services and poor job skills and not enough hours to work and other drivers from different locations don't tell us if they brings cars down
bad,Avis is the N**i party and we independent operators are in concentration camps with no help or compassion for our needs...they flat out don't give a care about any operator.
bad,model of inefficiency poorly run  must join union in this area. managers play favorites and only care about numbers on a report while never have any hands on knowledge of what techs actually do in the shop they are managers not mechanics who have done the job before being promoted
bad,"place has bad management that only care about customer satisfaction. "
bad,"At the sales counter, you will have to deal with crazy long lines of angry customers all while still being expected to answer phone calls and handle multiple issues at once while being cursed out for things that you cannot control.  Location is extremely short staffed due to the fact of almost every agent getting so fed up and just walking out. Because of this,  you will often be stuck working alone.  Management refuses to do anything to fix the issues here despite being told repeatedly why everyone keeps quitting. "
bad,You all should try this job out for yourself I had fun meeting a ton of people it change my way of living highest expectation customer services
bad,"ENTREPRISE A EVITER! Travail à portée de tous et agréable à la condition que les managers soient absents car objectifs imposés trop importants de leur part car si nous vendons, ils ont des primes comme ils savent si bien nous le dire mot pour mot. Manque de respect de leur part parce qu'il est inadmissible de la part d'un manager de dire à ses employés que s'ils ne sont pas contents, il n'ont qu'à changer de travail. Turn over impressionnant et de grosses difficultés pour cette entreprise à trouver de nouveaux employés, de quoi se poser de grosses questions!"

bad,"Lavoro a provvigioni, ottimo per studenti ma col rischio di non guadagnare nienre perche non c'è un fisso."
bad,"Seniority based when comes to schedules, but never do you see the schedules get posted. Management sees issues with certain employees and never confronts them or the issues. If you try and talk to management about another employee you will get blank stares, if you go to upper management he will turn everything around as if you are a horrible employee. I did my job very well!"
bad,"Awful Awful Mgmt.Favoritsm is a big problem and a lot of "" not on the same page"" answers from different managers. Mgmt isnt truthful and there isnt a solid HR  department."
bad,"Colleagues were amazing and loved my time there but managers /upper management was horrible and racist and are threatened by individuals whom don't drink their kool-aid. Old management staff were great but after years of turnover caused a major rift. New management threatened by veterans, no room ever for advancement. Just shuffled around the organization, making it look as if you were important to the organization."
bad,I believe that Avis budget is a good job to work at. Its a relaxing environment. You really learn to work with people on a one on one basis. The hardest part of the job is driving the speed limit
bad,This company doesn't care about employee. Treat employees like trash worst company to work for. They lay you off then call you back then lay you off three months later. I was laid off twice some people laid off three or more times. Don't waste your time working for this company they will treat you like trash.
bad,No chance of progression in your career. Management do not realise that zero hour contracts work both ways for the company and the employee. Never get paid correctly. No one seems to know what rate the sick or holiday should be paid at. Management do not understand how or when you can take holidays or at what rate you are accruing holidays. The place is an absolute shambles and this is nationwide as a driver!!
bad,"Since I am still employed by them, I would rather not put up a full review. However, I will say that I am not happy there and would much rather move on to a more fulfilling position."
bad,"Good place to start after college and gain some corporate experience, but not a good place in my opinion to build your career. Compensation is terrible. Been there for 3 years, and new hires are making what I'm currently making. Tuition assistance will barely get you 3 credits now. Biggest frustration with this company is their inability to keep up with others in the field of compensation/benefits. Paternal/Maternal leave is considered a ""short term disability"" - it's 2020, are you kidding me? Benefits are good, 401k match is high (6%). Be advised that eventually, when you reach a certain position, you are required to work holidays and weekends (not advertised when first applied). Work life balance is good, generally flexible with time off. Otherwise, I just was not happy here. Glad I got the experience but even happier to be moving on."
bad,"It's called Avis Budget but there is little synchronicity in this company.  It's as if they work against each other instead of together for a common goal.  That goal should be excellent customer service for auto renters AND truck renters.  "
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked.  They steal commission from their sales people.  They hire in people who don't want to work, because that's all they're willing to pay for.  You have drivers who constantly disappear.  If it didn't effect my job I wouldn't even care, but when they do it, it just means you'll have to work even harder, then you'll tear up your body even more picking up luggage.  They hire in people who start hiding from work within a few weeks.  Then if you complain about it, you're the problem.  I haven't had a raise in a year and a half because we're union and they can't seem to get the new contract done, because ABG wants to be able to force you to stay 8 hours after your shift, pay you the lowest wage possible, and refuse to give us a break down on how they figure out how much of our insurance plan we cover.   They literally refuse to tell us, which lets us know they're doing something underhanded.  They bought the cheapest buses they could, despite the drivers disapproval of the buses.  The buses constantly break down, and then they want you to use a passenger van to pick up customers.   The design of the buses they bought are not conducive for repetitiously getting up and down, which has led to hip problems for the taller drivers.  The only thing upstairs management cares about is getting their bonuses.  There is supposed to be at least 8 buses in operation during the busy shift, but you'll rarely have that.  I have been left by myself to run the airport on several occasions because no one called for overtime.  All I want is for them to get the"
bad,"Upper management is very disconnected with day to day operations.  They say the customer is most important, but thier actions and policies say otherwise"
bad,Working at Avis as an office assistant was one of my favorite jobs. Co workers were friendly .Very demanding when our customers requirements an expectations aren't met. Avis is the top competitor's in the rent a car business. if you have leadership skills an great a attitude Avis would be a good job.
bad,The work was fun and it was easy to do.whould go back to work for them again.poeple was so fun to be around.we all work as a team.We got the job done.Avis is the best job to work for.po
bad,"Salary pay is less, due in need of a new good job soo I can shuffle up with a good pay."
bad,scanned upc codes for rental cars and put information into system make sure same cars that left lot are the same cars that come into the lot. very good coworkers i worked with. hardest part of my job was having to be there until 11pm alone. most enjoyable sometimes got to drive the cars and park them.
bad,"Δούλεψα στο τηλεφωνικό κέντρο,αρχική εκπαίδευση ελάχιστη, σχετικά παλιά συστήματα στους υπολογιστές. Η συμπεριφορά της υπεύθυνης εντελώς χάλια,ειρωνική,με ύφος κ με παράλογες απαιτήσεις κ ελάχιστη αρχική εκπαίδευση όπως είπα.Επίσης κακοί leader.Οταν ρωταγες μια απορία στη λέγανε μόνο αντί να σου εξηγήσουν.Μόνο πως θα νοικιάσουν κανένα αυτοκινητάκι παραπάνω τους ένοιαζε.Μισθος ο βασικός της εποχής. Μακριά ούτε να ξανακουσω για αυτούς."
bad,Rules apply to only certain people! Sales mgr need to understand her job and role. Never have the equipment we need to do our job! Managers suck they are lazy and need more training!
bad,"I felt that they didn't care about their drivers, because of the low pay and how long it took 4 them to consider 3 more dollars added to 11.00 and how the buses is unsafe for it's drivers it has a metal bean over our heads which I have hit my head on twice. I am too old to be hitting my head, that can cause me medical problems. this is why I don't care to work for them. and they fired me while I was on medical."
bad,"Avis is definitely the best place to rent a car, (their products are better than the other rental car agencies) but it is not a good place to work, at least in the Bangor Maine location.  The management is terrible and honestly don't know how to properly manage people-the play favorites, they have harsh punishments for mistakes made, and are overall not very good people.  I would not recommend them as a good place to work."
bad,"I had flexible hours and days, my manager was awesome but no paid vacations or any type of benefits. I learned a lot there but being a head of household I needed some type of benefits which the company did not provide; only regular discounts at time of renting vehicles."
bad,"Lack of workers, poor management, competitive for cars, just overall lacking in advancement. Management cares only for herself. Not enough done for workers."
bad,There is a new airport manager and he is terrible. All he cares about is driving fancy cars home every day. He is definitely one of the worst managers I have ever worked with. He doesn't explain new policies or show any interest except to say work harder. He is not in the right position. The Colorado Springs airport location was  better before him. There is also an older employee there who is a bully and does whatever she wants with no repercussions.
bad,You have to join a union that no one told me about . Minimum wage plus union dues not worth the pay structure. The associates were good to work with and the managers were OK also
bad,"Tried several times to get rehired as a shuttler, but I kept getting turned down for employment.When I asked why, they refused to tell me. I got disgusted and didn't bother with Avis-Budget anymore."
bad,"Group leader for drivers, making sure that cars were cleaned and gas up for customers.Taking cars to and from airport to garage to get them cleaned.Making sure that the customers were taking care and satasfied with there needs."
bad,"Company doesn't care about its employees . To them you are just a number. Come in do your job, get paid. Now if you have any questions or concerns you get nowhere with human resources."
bad,I was a customer service rep checking in the cars and printing out contracts parking the cars making sure the customers got all their belongings out and no damage was done to the cars.
bad,"late hours"
bad,"Je suis rentrée en 2008 au début tout va bien bonne ambiance au boulot, travail intéressant et salaire motivant , puis la boite est rachetée par les Americains et deviens Avis Budget Group , c est la que le cauchemard commence : nouvelles procédure, règles, méthodes de ventes en gros on t apprend à arnaquer le client et surtout on t y pousse fortement en te mettant des objectifs de fou et si tu n y arrive pas tu es convoqué toute les semaines ... mais si le client de plaind c'est toi le seul responsable!  tes nouveaux managers qui ne connaissent rien à ton job te presse comme un citron pour que tu démissionnes! Le mot d ordre sur l aeroport de Marseille était il fait renouveler l equipe qui était sans doute trop solidaire! Beaucoup de managers qui aiment faire des réunions pour se sentir important et cacher leur incompétence. A fuit absolument car tres néfaste pour ta santé et ton équilibre psycho!"
bad,"great place to work as well as progress and develop. however, it is to far to travel and requires you to work long hours which are not set .The hours are not flexible and is difficult to maintain a work life balance."
bad,young and relatively immature crowd. management promotes drama and poor judgement. I have since heard the bad seed was expelled. Otherwise very easy repetitious job.
bad,"ouverture de l'officine à 08H"
bad,"It is a pleasant Place of employment.  I love it here but I would love to work in my field of studies.  I have learned a great deal about the car rental process and details of what goes on behind the scene."
bad,It could be very challenging at times. I worked alone. Telling people I couldn't rent them a car because I didn't have enough cars.
bad,I worked here for nearly one year and the problem was that they let anyone who happened to be handy manage the shift so you were never clear who was in charge.  It led to a lot of narcissistic behavior from co-workers who had little idea about how to handle people.  Spent most of my time fighting off ridiculous supervisory practices that others would try to bully through.
bad,thsi was a high stress workplace with not the best values and organization set forth by the leadership.
bad,"I am not sure how it is now since it was Cendant where I worked before. Cendant was a horrible place to work at, people were very unpleasant even thouhg they had good benefits. People were quitting like flies."
bad,went back to school lost all my hours went from 40 to 14 a week
bad,Great place for a starter career. Lack of management support and empowerment can lead to no empowerment or fear from leadership.
bad,Great coworkers and great pay for the responsibilities.  Enjoyed meeting people from all over the world.  It was great experience and a lot of fun being around all differnent makes and models of vehicles.
bad,"Was quite a good place to work until Avis sold us down the river to regal rentals. It was all downhill from there on.   First they took away the paid break without telling us, then they tried to short change us over our holiday entitlement. Eventually they changed our contract to a bare bones one. Glad to be out of the place working for a decent employer who values their workforce."
bad,"The amount of work to pay was ridiculous. You were told you were a number even if work conditions were rough. Someone had to threaten legal action to have things changed. Even then it was half-done to avoid trouble. Some managers were incompetent. And some only cared about customer ratings while throwing you under the bus publicly. Managers who did want to help couldn't help knowingly without risking backlash from upper management. "
bad,This by far the worst company that I have ever worked for. They promise you career advancement but there is little to none. The management staff does not do a good job supporting their employees.
bad,This company is not that great to work for since the managers put alot of pressure on your sales and make you feel horrible if you are not up to their expectations.
bad,In this job I had to transport multiple cars throughout the day to different locations. My coworkers were not very nice Management was worse.
bad,job was eliminated no more bus driving jobs its a 24 hour operation and schedules are hard
bad,I liked traveling to Ottawa Ontario and seeing the different things on the way. I liked to try out new vehicles and not having to pay to do it.
bad,Really bad management and workplace culture. There is no support from management at this location. There is a culture of passing the buck when things do not go right. Lack of communication at all levels at this location.
bad,would be a good company if you work for corporate which is only the airport. if you work for any other location they are private and mis-handled poorly.  if you aren't family expect to be treated differently and like a slave
bad,this was my first job and I was young and I felt I was wasting my time. I wasn't making no money and I didn't even have a schedule I was an on call person
bad,Self employed business opportunity; managers control your business and want to decide who you hire as an employee; totally dependent on them for supply
bad,Poor management. Favorites and employees related to each other that got special treatment. Poor wages and poor working conditions for 10.00 per hour.
bad,"I go from washing cars outside to being inside the office answering phones constantly, and at the same time helping customers with either creating reservations or checking in their rental car."
bad,"open the office up"
bad,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and immediately start on a rental. You may run into a disgrunted customer who didn't know they were upgrading to a nicer vehicle on they're initial rental at the counter days before their return. I learned to be patient with customers and show empathy while conducting a rental to see whats best fits for the customer. Management was always looking over to see which employee was the right things. But, most managers didn't want to help and threw others under the bus. Co-workers are easy to get along with but most got jealous of each other sales. The hardest part of the job is upselling a customer indirectly by saying ""we have a great rate on that vehicle today"" without sharing the price difference. Another will be that the work schedule changes every 2 months and if you are working overnight you will get less opportunities to get upsells and more scammers that want to rent cars and the company does nothing about it. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you got an upsell the right way and the customer liked their rental."
bad,"you are treated like a child 90% of the time, "
bad,Bottom line means more than keeping an employee or training an employee who exhibits a sincere interest in advancement.
bad,"A lot of work, No Benefits, Mediocre pay. The hardest part of the job is washing cars in 100+ degree weather by yourself."
bad,"A typical day at work is trying to find a good shuttle bus. The buses should be sold and new buses should be purchased. I have learned that they do not appreciate you as a driver with all the problems you encounter with the deteriorating buses, equipment on board and the communication system."
bad,"I preprint contracts for preferred and fastbreak members to insure their vehicle will be ready when the customer arrives. I greet the customers with their keys, update their infomation and do walk around before they leave."
bad,Strictly a hire and fire organization without any loyalty to employees.
bad,Worked at budget many years was good then upper management keep changing making it worse Everytime it changed to the present management which is the worst out of all that came through they think they are better than everyone else and they are never wrong. Everyone is on edge stressed out and worried about losing their jobs if they say something the manager don't like I could go on but I won't.
bad,"Not a good place to work, the training you must completed before staring the job, is"
bad,Need to be prepared to work 12 hour shifts with little support for the management team.  Unions are difficult and you will need to come with a balanced life.
bad,I recently quit this job as I found it to be very toxic for my health with unexplainable health conditions all related to stress. The company cares nothing for its management team. Always differing time due to coverage. There was more protection for the hourly union members than salaried management. I enjoyed the staff but hate the overlook and treatment given shown by the top leaders
bad,"Unless you are looking for something as a stepping stone, majority of people who work as a sales performance manager do not make it through a year. I would not recommend this job to anyone to be honest especially at the DFW airport"
bad,"They give you unrealistic information about how the job will be, you never will make 3000 dollars out of commission if you are no willing to SCAM CUSTOMER INTO BUY PRODUCTS, if you try to be an honest person and you value the sense of honesty never try to be a rental sales agent. Otherwise you will feel frustrated every day watching the other scammers making money out of customers pockets. Management is poor and always pick sides. Big company but is just an empty name."
bad,"Only thing enjoyable at this job is the commission at times but you better be an award winning seller to see success.Other than that the staffing is horrible,management is poor.You bid for your shift based on seniority so you could possibly be doing evening and graveyard shift for along time. Ohh not to mention if you can make it past the training which is horrible and lacks any structure. A long day with dealing with customers you get only 1 20 min break."
bad,Managers are bias and dont want to work with you the moment its no convenient like you dont have a life outside of AVIS. The unions are in bed with the company and barley fight for the employees.
bad,"Do not apply JFK Avis will do everything to hold you back. There is no room for growth . Management  is very rude, lack emotion , and just no care for the employees well being . Your check comes in the  mail every Saturday. You won't feel welcomed by other workers. There's a super long wait just to receive uniforms. The locker rooms are always flooded and bathrooms are disgusting . All in all if you reading this  and you got the job be prepared for the most fake and insensitive group of managers you've ever met."
bad,"Manque de personnel, manque d'organisation et salaire à revoir. Les managers et tous le reste sont à bout dommage"
bad,The typical day consisted of drama from sign in to sign out.  Management was poor and mostly was given to favorite employees. When problems were brought to managements attention they were often totally ignored.
bad,"At this particular location, you could work day in and day out putting your best effort but I will still get paid the same amount as the guy who did barely anything. Your efforts will go appreciated with a pat on the back and a ""good job!"", but when it comes to your paycheck they won't give you a cent more. The job itself isn't difficult, but when you begin doing other jobs that aren't yours, such as customer service and taking the initiative on busy days to do your best so everyone has an easier time; you start to feel under appreciated. There are people here you'll meet that are great and basically the only reason you won't quit."
bad,There was little communication from management. There was no ability to take a proper lunch break. The management was trying to change the job requirements after hire. Dirty and unorganized.
bad,"Fast paced environment, constantly working with coworkers and clients on providing excellent service. Conditions have improved for outside workers but pay and benefits have been cut"
bad,It's a good job for young people that are starting off ! The pay is awful for the amount of work we do here at Rdu ! Lack of communication/ managers don't have our backs customer have nasty attitudes - and no fleet - and they want you to work here for bare minimum and want to load you with there responsibility !
bad,"very low income, they aspecting from you to stay at work to the end, so you will start at 7am and finish even after midnight...and back again at 7am. Make pressure on you to stay to the end, they don't care about your safety"
bad,"Unfortunately for a company as large as ABG there is absolutely no structure to the company management which often leads to a number frankly embarrassing scenarios."
bad,bad customer service.. and poor work  efforts.. just not living up to there agreements..and were rude to there employers and didnt treat them fair..
bad,"Not a bad place to work , management is friendly but not a job where you can depend on a pay cheque due to lack of work hours ."
bad,"too much management, poor compensation. crazy hours and not enough time for anything. i wouldn't stick around working here for too long. theres isnt room to grow."
bad,This was a great experience to learn more about the rental car industry. I learned I did not like it at all. Yes I excelled though it was challenging to say the least. One thing for sure I now know that this industry was not for me.
bad,a typical day at work would be real stressful seeing how they are under staffed and not everyone is on the same page some i learned that no matter how hard you work you can still go unnoticed but you have to remain level headed and always give 110%
bad,"Subcontractor with avis rent a car."
bad,"The only thing thats good about the place was other people that i worked with.  You wont advance very far as here in Alberta budget is owned by a private family which basically means top jobs positions go to family. hours long, also I worked for another car rental company  and thier system is more advanced then budget.. budget is very OLD school.  Somtimes its the ol ""we dont know our selves.. so you figure it out on your own"" mentality."
bad,"Again, as with my previous reviews the title says it all.  AvisBudgetGroup was my first real job out of the navy and it was good for experience only.  There are no advancement opportunities as the company is battling to stay away from chapter 11.  The unfortunate downside is that with diminishing opportunities you have an uphill battle just to keep from being downsized yourself.  It was a miserable work place with little reward aside from experience."
bad,After working for this company for 3 months it is obvious that the management is letting this branch down by not listening to staff concerns hence the low morale and high turnover of staff throughout all areas. The lack of management has led to good staff leaving and new staff not getting training as required for each role in the branch. There is also a lack of judgement when it comes to staff that do not have the mental capacity to perform which leads to disharmony in the workplace
bad,"Empresa exercia suas atividades da mesma maneira de 15 a 20 anos atrás, nao tinha tecnologia e estruturaçao, era tudo bem manual, o sistema mais avançado que tinham era o Excel."
bad,"Increase rental sales to boost commission,computers were out dated,management was lacking,I really enjoyed the customers and the other employees."
bad,I'll never work again for Avis or recommend to anyone. Treating of management salaries are very poor not getting paid on time it's a problem if you sick that you can't take off you must be nearly dead.
bad,Bad management under paid .....horrible working conditions.....and I work for them for two years as a lead services agent ........  need to improve the management for a better working environment
bad,"My interview was great it was mainly with management that's offsight!!  But then I was left to actually work for a white male who's half my age (younger).  He seems to have control issues and the (Asian Woman in the operations) is in on it because the micromanaging I've had to endure is excessive & out right abusive.  I was talked to in a hostile manner until my 3rd week he had finally yelled at me, with no good reason to behave that way.  He  He"
bad,"The managers don’t seem to care about the work integrity. They are more worried about making money. Teamwork is not here. Everyone is out for themselves. If you want a job that is secure here is the place, but you won’t enjoy it."
bad,"No room for advancement."
bad,I do not want to leave a review but this website is forcing me to. Doesn't make any sense and you will lose a ton of potential customers. This should be an option...not mandatory.
bad,Didnt love working over nights. The pay wasn't the best unless you could sell something to everyone that walked through the door. Which is very hard to do. Then they will change how they pay you the commission. Some how the company is always making money and your not.
bad,Very very stressfull. It’s hazerdous to your health.. The emploees cheet slap coverages on cutomers contracts without telling them.......................
bad,"The company can't provide the basic tool you need to do your job, cars!!! We were always short on vehicles and many times the customer  would leave either without a vehicle or wait for half an hour or more with a vehicle that they hadn't requested. It was the most stressful job I've every had in my 30 plus years of work. The client would get very upset at the agents and held us responsible for the failure of the company to provide what was needed."
bad,"The lack of maintenance on the vehicles puts the drivers in a hazardous situation. No one in power seem to know how to do their job ( lack of training or just don't care). They offer no benefits, if you're injured on the job you have to go through workers comp."
bad,"Typical day consisted of retrieving rental cars, cleaning and fueling them. Occasionally drive cars to outlying rental facilities. Most of the drivers didn't appear to be overly excited about the job"
bad,Avis is a fast paced work environment. I learned the best ways to multitask while working at Avis. Avis also provide a diverse group of employment which is always GREAT !
bad,The direction the company is going is really scary.  They don't really tell us what is going on until to late.  It makes it very difficult to do my job.
bad,This was a fun place when I first started here we were only Avis when we emerge with budget this company went down. Because it divided two companies Avis and budget and that’s how these people would take it is my Fellow employees and it was hard to work with bolt Avis and budget people there  was so much stuff going on between all of them.  Because I lost my weekends because of the budget people had more sonority than me. I lost my job because of my health issues I exceeded company policies at the end of December The manager  Who let me go had no remorse of my health whatsoever.
bad,"I wouldnt go back even if I needed a job ASAP..... Unorganized, no benefits, or holiday pay........ But if your looking for something just to have something..... There you go"
bad,"I completed a training program to operate an independent off site neighborhood car rental location. Shortly after completing the training, the program was discontinued."
bad,"do not work there you unless you want to be 1099 with under minimum wage with bad hours and high stress on weekends. the only part that makes this place bearable at the murrieta/ temecula area is daisy, she is the best"
bad,"Was a good company to work for but times are changing new management new rules"
bad,"Low wages,"
bad,"This job alllowed me to learn excellent customer service skills."
bad,You never know what to expect as a typical day working for Avis. It's hectic as far as there is no organization by any means.
bad,Avis/Budget is a pace not for someone wanting to gain a career and advance in something. Avis/Budget is great for teens coming out of high school or retired people to stay out the house. Management advancement is not likely to happen and pay is definitely underpaid. This job is really easy for those who like and know how to work and perform leadership roles. A hard day at work is when there are no vehicle to provide customers and complaints pile up. An easy day is when cars are available and coworkers want to show up. Management usually watches everyone work from the parking lot while smoking and just talks about non related work material. The managers do not empathize for their employees or fix the hours when suppose to. I'm still missing over $1000 that is piling up since January of this year.
bad,"Horrible, not fun, very stressful, no time for family. Foreces overime.  Rate of pay is very low for what is asked of us. Lot of work for little pay"
bad,Working for a rental car company was always very busy. I learned that dealing with people from all walks of life was interesting. My manager at the time was very understanding no matter what the situation was. I loved my co-workers we had a good time all of the time whether we were outside or inside. The hardest part was when we had flight delays and not many cars to rent. Overall I enjoyed every aspect of the job.
bad,this is the job that opened my eyes on why i enjoyed sell things to people. i why i enjoy people in general. i was just great at what i did and made the company alot of money.
bad,"I've never had a job where I felt so beaten down and stressed.  The customers are horrible, the management is cold. Training goes pretty well but then they get you on the floor and the unit managers do not care about you at all.  HR does not care about you. "
bad,"Avis was a telemarketing company.  I paid for college using telemarketing, but Avis was starting to transition over to computer-generated calling.  Management was difficult to work with---they did want to listen to other ideas.  It was ""their way or the highway""."
bad,"A typical day of work for me would be completing my daily functions as efficient as possible. Working for my employer, I have learned how to define the terms in billing claims for a major rental company. On a personal level, I have also learned that great things are not always accomplished alone. As for management, I will say that I have never had a problem. I did my job at all times and remained professional. My opinion, co-workers are extended family members because of the many hours you spend with each other. Some you love and some you don't but its always best to keep it professional."
bad,Managers do not work with you on any issues and are constantly writing people up for ridiculous things. The pay is great but most of the time not worth the stress and uncomfortable work place.
bad,"This Company has great potential, they have great staff but a poorly run management team. The company has a strict ""SCRIPT"" policy they cling to that does not allow for sales agents to utilize their talents. Their Computers still operate on DOS that has many glitches and unexpected shutdowns. The company preaches sales and quotas but then undermines the agents when they give products away to customers for free. Good luck getting paid properly. the companies payment system in so messed up. The DOS system can only show you portions of your penetration and a lot of times doesn't credit you for commissions for specific customers. so you spend a lot of time trying to track every customers records to submit to finance at the end of the month just to get paid. And that's only if they decide that they want to pay you for it. I could go on but you get it."
bad,It is a pretty mundane job. Very predictable. Management plays favorites alot but I did learn how to interact with my customers and listen to their needs and concerns.
bad,"This company is a decent company to work for; however, the management could improve. One manager in particular has been with the company for almost forty years, and its almost like she expects the employees to work under standards that are old. This particular location I worked at did not encourage higher learning, and in fact would badger the employee about hours, when in fact the rental care business did not stay steady year around. This company may be decent for those individuals who are older (retired) and looking for something to do, individuals who are not trying to do any better with life, and individuals who just want some extra pocket change."
bad,"Having been employed by the company for a year, I can easily and honestly say it was not good.  The management is dishonest, they cheat you out of money, and do unethical things in the back.  It's also not good for someone who wants to be in a positive place."
bad,"Not a good place to work. They are only interested in number, not in people. There is very little training for the job you are to do. Also the expectations are not realistic."
bad,"Other employees rude and judgemental. Talk about everyone and cut you down."
bad,A company that was unfair to their employees and had no issues with it. Was a long time ago so I can't speak for them now. Hopefully there's been improvement!
bad,No advancement no set time on raise some people do a good job some you can tell just dont care mangment is really scatter brained no benefits just a job not a career
bad,"I am speaking on my location specifically in the midwest. We were extremely short staffed in a moderately busy location. Their was no communication between the agents and upper management. Their were times were I would come in at a Saturday and my shift manager would let me know we are out of a certain car class and the upper managers never shut down the system. This would be around 9 AM by the way. Now you have to deal with extremely mad customers that pre paid for the vehicle and you are the one that gets the blame while the upper management is at home relaxing. Also, certain locations contract a company to come clean and service the cars to save money in stead of hire within. Problem there is that they are also limited in staff get no benefits and work outside and are on $8 wages so they just leave when they get mad at us calling for cars because we have 15 people in line and their is only 2 of us at the counter. They are also not very good with scheduling. I would send texts months in advance to announce I will not be at work for a school event or such and they will agree to it and the time comes and you will get in trouble for missing the day even if they agreed at the time. I know it dose't makes sense and yes I showed the text they don't care. Their was also times where you could be working days for certain time and randomly they put you on a couple nights and switch you back around with no reasoning or warning. Seemed like every time we saw the schedule we would think of it as a randomized game to see which shift was given to who and hoe different it looked every time."
bad,"expect long hours, minimal breaks if any, poorly staffed and poorly managed.  always out of cars. if your a counter agent its base + commission.  average counter agent makes between 30k to 40k...the top sales tend to earn 50k-60k."
bad,"The management has absolutely no regard for you and your life, they just want to make sure they have enough bodies on the clock. Employees constantly get away with inappropriate behavior and actions with zero repercussions due to management turning a blind eye. This is the type of place where if you get in a car accident, they ask for an ETA before knowing if you're okay. I know because this happened to me."
bad,"Une journée typique d'ACO (agent de comptoir) : Soit un début de journée tôt le matin vers 7h jusqu'en milieu d'après midi ou en milieu d’après midi jusque tard la nuit. On est amené à travailler au moins 2 voire 3 week end par mois."
bad,"-management does not care about staff."
bad,"I went to work for Budget Truck as a part time Maintenance Coordinator. I expressed a need for full time employment with benefits and was shortly promoted into the role of Tire and Glass Manager for the Western region of the United States."
bad,"a typical day at work consists of renting cars to customers and upgrading them to different vehicles and offering insurance based upon their needs. i learned that a lot of customers are different and should be treated kindly and with respect no matter their background."
bad,"Considering short-staff everyday and not employing new people, it makes the job very busy and you have to cover all the positions in a branch where you deal with loads of different tasks which it can be frustrating if there is no one to lead you or when you are not entitled to lead but overall I took it as an advantage and I learned so many new things that I never expected to, it`s good place to discover your skills and realise that will never end. Every day it is different, people are friendly and support you.The most enjoyable thing it is that you challenge yourself on every step and want more and more."
bad,"The job requires 5 to 10 working weeks with 10 to 12 hours shifts. The scheduled shifts changing often and there's no stable schedule.  "
bad,This is hands down the worst company I have ever worked for.  The equipment they expect to be used is severely outdated. They literally still use a green screen for their computers.  There is no consistency between locations.  Upper management does not care about the employees.  They are not engaged. The turnover is high for both employees and managers.  10 managers turned over in 3.5 years.  The employee turnover is even higher.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Their idea of occasional overtime is 8 hours or more per week mandatory from roughly the end of April to the end of November. "
bad,"Managers it is mandatory to work 10+ hours a day. The Milwaukee APO location was a family atmosphere, but management has driven that into the ground. They do not hire new managers and now it is so understaffed in order to complete all tasks asked of managers we would be there a minimum of 15 hrs a day. There is no remorse for a lack of a work life balance. The only way to move up is if you are re-locatable. I have had many talks with the airport manager regarding staffing, and during my time in Milwaukee, we have had the same talk for the past 3 years! Things have only gotten worse."
bad,"I HATED working here. Four 10 hour days and three days off seemed awesome. Over $20/hr? Yes please."
bad,"They employ drivers via subcontractors who get self employed people which leads to very low pay and long working hours. day starts at 8 am and finishes at 8 pm"
bad,You have the opportunity to make a lot of money working for this company but there are too many things that count against you on the way to make the money.
bad,Looking for more Negeative feeling associated rather keep it to myself
bad,This company has a revolving door. The commission structure is designed so that you can reach a certain level despite what they tell you. Highly stressful work with lots of managers and they micro manage all you do.
bad,"Its all politics. If you can play the game, you can succeed. I don't know how. I was raised on hard work pays the bills, but this position deems a lifestyle that demands your time and is inconsiderate of anything else. Your chain of command at each location is different. I can only speak from what I have seen, or through another managers experience as told to me directly."
bad,Avis is a great company to work for would possibly like to go back & work there again.
bad,A typical day at work involves supervising over 75 employees which is mixed between union and non-union workers. The oldest of the employees require constant supervision and reprimands. Every 4 hours an inventory of your entire lot is required and depending on your shift you may have to do both avis and budget locations. No one in upper management is around or approachable for help when needed. Human resources is never available until something is wrong and their response is biased. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free gas for your car.
bad,Na.   As it does not make a difference!!  The level of fairness is not there one person can be late all the time but if they want to get rid of someone then it becomes an issue. That mentality is pretty much so the same all the way through all things.
bad,"It was a lot of busy work but I did enjoy working for them, I had so many different jobs I could do during the day so I was never bored. Decent company to work for."
bad,Beaucoup de challenge qui vous pousse à sortir de votre zone de confort pour donner le meilleur de vous-même
bad,No recomendable a gente que no le guste que le den prisas ni que tenga que ir rápido.
bad,We detailed cars. It was fun working at the airport. Able to see the different aircraft coming and going was nice. Sometimes a VIP rented from us and made sure their cars looked their best.
bad,Totally rushed all the time. Management doesn't listen to employee concerns. Management has no desire to keep employees long term and claim you never told them about work issued.
bad,"Management was absolutely terrible.  Arrogant and unresponsive.  "
bad,no structure within the company only being recently turnt in sales had 5 general managers within the short period ive been here and very unprofessional
bad,Very high number of calls with high pressure sales.  Targets need to be hit as well as conversation. Very harsh work environment to work in and mentally draining.
bad,"Management had their hands tied due to seniority of the workforce and their union. many people working with minimum output and getting paid more as worked longer time but newbies got pushed to limits and abused by the others. No motivation towards staff from management."
bad,"Management was over the shoulder literally threatening you with write ups and termination if you did not follow the script word for word. And they were very elusive when you needed them the most. There is a lot of pressure to sell optional items such as car chargers, insurance, gps systems, and prepaid fuel.. Some coworker even added items without permission due to the pressure and intimidation from the head manager. And scheduling was horrible. It suppose to work to have weekends off with seniority that only worked with favorites."
bad,"I worked at Avis for about 5 months. Those 5 months were awful. They were always low on cars which as a rental agent, made it hard for you to do your job. So customers are always mad at you and it can get pretty intense and scary sometimes. None of that is helped by management  because they all hide unless you specifically call them up to the counter and even then it takes them forever to show up. This also get competitive with the other workers because they are fighting for the customers they know will buy coverage of it their rental which helps their commission. Overall it was a very negative and soul sucking place to work. I did make a few friends but it was not worth the misery of working each day."
bad,There are good people that work here. Very hard working individuals but the environment is made too stressful for employees and hurts the culture. The turnover rate at this company is too high for a company like this.
bad,"Management needs to be improved"
bad,This company is always short staffed in all work groups. They take more reservations than they have vehicles on a daily basis. They do not seem to care that the customers are unhappy and the turn over rate for employees is high
bad,"Very stressfull place to work. Company says they provide the tools and means to succeed but dont majority of the time...no cars available for upsell. The management side is virtually non existent. They dont know how to perform job tasks. Seems to be there for ""hall monitor duty"" only. Or post notifications. Customers are extremely rude and feel as if they have the right to talk to the rsa as if they were garbage. Plus the sales skills taught by the corporation is to lie to the customer to make money. Very deceptive means used to make a living. Overall, corporate should pay more attention to what is going on here...they smile and wink at ya while their hands are taking out your wallet and stealing your cash. Anything goes to make a buck. Also always understaffed except in the manager dept."
bad,This is a highly paced job which entitles long hours and multi-tasking.  The company does not work well with each individual office and did not give you the proper vehicles to work with the customer.
bad,I believe the location I worked at created more problems for itself by reacting to problems instead of using the resources available to them to prevent those problems from occurring.
bad,I enjoyed my location at the airport and my coworkers.
bad,I maybe had 4 territory managers come and go. Fleet is a nightmare and this company can't even get step one right. Any Airport location is the primary concerns and if you are a satellite location tough luck.
bad,"My whole experience has been awful, 9/10 times the pay is wrong and takes a month to get sorted. The turn over of staff is so high you feel like you are never settled within a team. Avoid Avoid"
bad,"I was employed there 12 year ago and cant remember and dont know what the standards are like now, back then I enjoyed it for a short while only and I did not enjoy shifts"
bad,"Position to fill in for clerical help needed before year end. No real role was ever defined as the opportunity was offered as free accounting assistance as a bonus for contract work provided during"
bad,"Very Stressful environment to work in, management is incompetent and totally out of touch with daily operational needs. Employees are consistently put in between management and customers and left to fend for themselves."
bad,i dont want to write a review for every job i've put on my resume just to complete this process.  Monster... this is bad business considering it's all the same company
bad,It is never dull but long hours in operations and sales.  Management varied throughout the country.  Avis tends to have the highest rates in the industry and their services to not justify higher rates.
bad,"The hours are long and you get a 2-hour lunch for you can stay at the store all day. The shift is 8 hours usually and the store closes at 6 pm opens at 8 am. The day starts with opening and setting up the cleaning equipment and working outside even in bad weather conditions. Management is very poor and there are no benefits or bonuses, yearly raises are the best thing to get any sense of promotion. Also the job very detailed and even the simplest mistake can be costly, so the job can be very stressful and overwhelming at times. The system for the agents is very old and dumb down, making the job easier but there are no manuals on what everything does in the system, so it feels like learning the system as a whole is like walking in the dark. Usually, work 38 hours per week as a driver as an agent 50 hours per week with no lunch or break. I only recommend this job if you want job security for a few years well-attending school or as a summer job also you have to be a very hard worker and self-motivating."
bad,not very organized and very fast paced. not very supportive of your own priorities. Not very nice and respectful to coworkers. They are very strict and must have everything done a certain way.
bad,"Typical day would start off with registering vehicles and assisting customer with questions, concerns, and quick driving lessons. what i learned was additional  problem solving skills. Management was poor because of high turnover in management as well as other positions. Hardest part of job was fatigue from high volumes of customers and demands related to the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that i fulfilled the needs of my job and satisfying customers."
bad,"always work to be done. long days. various schedule. 24/7 operation."
bad,"I really enjoyed my time there at avis for the years. I did not like the upper management due to the way they treated hispanics/african americans.  This was only a licensee company based out of Shreveport, Louisiana.  You could tell that they were prejudice and looked down on others regardless of race at times also."
bad,"Le travail de convoyeur est très bien cependant le management était quasi nul. "
bad,"I'm a part time customer service representative and primarily deal with our Preferred customers and checking cars back in.  So far, I have seen our branch go through about 10 operations managers, a parts manager, numerous drivers and counter agents, 5 rovers, 4 city managers, and 5 or 6 airport managers.  Moving up here is impossible.  You have to be willing to move to another location to even be considered for a management position.  Most days, I feel as though I'm doing to job of two to three people while getting paid for one.  I'm almost never have help, and I've been the one training one of our newest managers in our computer system.  Management is very hard to find when you need them, so there are times that I get no lunch break because of how understaffed we are."
bad,The Company policy is to overbooked all areas. You will ended up covering  and doing the work of two people or more as the company is always short of stuff. You will have to work weekends as well.
bad,"Less upper management, implement learning opportunities with room for advancement and pay increases to bring up morale, work the jobs a while before pretending to know how things should be done"
bad,"Lowest paid job at the airport. All the other rental car companies make at least $1 more per hour. Wouldn't be a terrible summer job, for a high schooler."
bad,"Supportive staff but the management is not really supportive."
bad,"Very stressful place to work.  There is very little support to the employee by the managers.  It was hard to work there. You knew more about what you did that was wrong, than what you did that was right."
bad,"The job itself was easy and mostly fun, but the overall ineffective management, favoritism, and haphazard style of employee and resource management made every day a fresh disconnect from efficient business management practices."
bad,"I was a CSR REP in a union.  First union job that I had.  Makes people around very not motivated!!  Management does not have much control over those individuals because of the politics of a union.  Union benefits are inexpensive but the compensation make up for it.  You work outside so the winters get cold! Or if you live in the south summers get really warm.  "
bad,"This job had no security, was poorly managed, and overall very unrewarding."
bad,This job is for people who are very thick-skinned and dont mind sitting for extremely long periods of time.  Also must be able to handle a wide variety of customers and be able to talk and type while still capturing the needs of the customer
bad,There is no career advancement at this job. You can work 10 years and will only ever be what you are when you get hired. They do not offer raises. I have worked for 3 and a half years and only ever got one raise after my 90 days. I would not recommend this job at all.
bad,I drove rental cars to and from various locations. I will return to this job if the pay was worth it
bad,"hard work"
bad,"Days at work are what we make of them, I've learned to accept each hour as it comes and that way I produce more positive results. Management cannot break your spirit, humans are meant to treat one another with respect, therefore I have good relations with all managers, junior and senior. Teammates, employees are the support system of the organization. Employees are friendly, helpful and know what is best for one another. The most challenging aspect of this job is irate customers, yes we do see people who are generally miserable, tired and bored with life and I am the target for these beings. The part which is most rewarding is that smile and satisfaction on a customers face and that they know their monies were very well spent."
bad,"Me gusto mis colegas del trabajo."
bad,A typical day have make sure the equipment is in tack then was a meeting in the mornings tell the employers what was in the meetings.What i had learned no playing around infront of customers and co-workers.No time off hardley
bad,"Renting cars to customers & moving cars in the car park"
bad,"Rather not say anything bad, however I'm glad we parted ways!"
bad,made car reservations and the hardest part was sitting all day. Very easy to learn and accomplish.
bad,"- Einfach nur stressig der Job"
bad,The union there is useless. The number of dishonest employees is astounding. Lack of professionalism and nepotism is widespread. Very depressing atmosphere to work in.
bad,"As a part-time employee who gets the job done faster and more efficient than some of the full time workers,I believe that the company could have hired me full-time or paid me what they,(full-time employees),were paid for doing less."
bad,"Troppa pressione e insistenza sulle vendite , ambiente molto competitivo"
bad,"Pior empresa que já trabalhei, a gerência não sabe lidar com os funcionários, eles acham que somos animais."
bad,A typical day at Avis was a busy day. Mostly cleaning of cars after clients brought them back from using them. It was a very physical job and you have to work outside most times.
bad,"Not a good place to work."
bad,Es una Buena compania pero el problemas es que esta afiliada a union. No te valoran como empleado y todo se deja llevar por seniority. Yo era uno de los mejores vendedores pero como era d elos ultimos me sacaron por el seniority.
bad,The experience in Avis Budget Group in London was not as expected because of the poor management and disorder in the station. No training and neither help in the beginning
bad,There is a high turnover of staff both permanent and contractor which makes running a project very difficult as there is no constancy.  Management did not offer support nor fast decision making which was also very frustrating.  However the people on the whole were great to work with.   Would I work there again?  Not with the existing structure.
bad,"Poor management, lack of support and effective communication by HR. Great benefits! Poor pay scale if not management. Micro management and ""manager's discretion"" on everything to keep HR from having to hold any manager to unfair management policies."
bad,Managers work long hours. like 10 + hour days for $35k /year maybe $45k if you're lucky.  There is no life balance.   My home suffered a lot when I was gone.  Just wasn't worth it to me.  If you're single have no kids and can devote your life to this job with low pay $40k or below to start then this job might be for you. Might be.
bad,"Enjoyed working with the front line crew, hard workers and very dedicated.  The health benefits provided were very good for my family.Hiring process very thorough."
bad,"Everyone expects you to do the job of 10 people with getting a horrible pay. No coverage for breaks or for people on vacation. Job advancement is nonexistent. Managers don't do anything and let the hourly employees do all the work. And forget getting any support from the supposed ""Human Resource"" department and Union"
bad,"Avis Budget Group is in the midst of a transformation.  With car rental demand declining, rates dropping and fees to outside parties rising, the margin has slipped in recent years.  The contraction of the margin has resulted in multiple years of layoffs and retirement packages being offered to higher salaried, older employees.  Also, the departure of key senior leaders in the past year has brought on a feeling of uneasiness to the company.  My suggestion, wait to see what happens in the next 18 month.  This company could be very different by then,"
bad,"Was once a nice place to work, and competitive, however change in management, has implemented poor compensation, medical benefits, unfriendly working environment, job-security."
bad,"Rental car customer service for US, Canada, and abroad. Explain company policy & negotiate billing adjustments. Higher than average CSR pay & awesome benefits."
bad,They pay $9.85 an hour in Louisville for a rental car return associate. Apparently I wasn't qualified to work for them when I have 10+ years with customer service positions. When I found out how mich he pay was. I stopped the interview right there. This company is a joke. They made $800 million in profit last year and expect their entry level employees to be able to live off of $9.85 an hour?
bad,"My experience with Avis Budget Group had it's ups and downs. I learned a lot being my first job out of college. The pay is not best for the amount of work that you have to do, but as management you do get benefits which include: a vehicle to drive, gas, and coverage through the company anywhere in the US. The hours are insane, and they like keeping locations understaffed. Primarily sales based job with customer service coming in second. Overall the staff are good, but make sure you take care of them because they will not take care of you if you don't. Like I said you will learn a lot, ranging from: sales, hospitality, inventory management, product management strategies, coaching, communications, team building, and operational management."
bad,"Great company for fast pace and keeping busy,"
bad,this job help me with a driving position and to help me learn detail and clean up skills it also gave me a since of pride to beadle to give a customer a clean and safe ride to there destinations
bad,People are snippy.  Coworkers are petty.  Shift bids are wrought with favoritism.  All management cares about is their own hide and NOT training you.  They expect your peers to train you with no compensation for doing management's work.  Some people hardly show up on time and stay in the back collecting a pay check.
bad,"I found overall this to not be a good place to work, constant contradictions in the way the business was run."
bad,management is horrible not a fun place to work at all coworkers are ok management really sucks
bad,"Company has no clue how to grow their management team. While there is a training system in place, with demands of being short staffed you get tossed into it without knowing the business. "
bad,this is a very stressful place to work. I hate this place.they are not flexible at all. Stay away.
bad,Renting cars . Up selling insurance on cars . upselling cars to better models. Offering GPS as an extra incentive.
bad,"More contradictions  between many managers finally you don't know who's who ? Who's the top manager and who's the last."
bad,I really enjoyed my job here.  I lived our customers and the managers were good to us.   I got burned by another employer stealing my commission  by filing things she shouldn't when a customer is swapping or returning a car and she switches it into her name.  It was very disappointing.
bad,"Productive, fun, team player, gets along with everybody. Follows orders, works hard, concentrates on duties given.-enjoys working-Listens to others opinions."
bad,"Assisting customers with there needs."
bad,"Well I wouldn't recommend this as the first job on my list two potential employees, it is a job nonetheless that will help get you to the next level and your employment goals."
bad,"When I worked there, they never had enough employees. Constantly having to train new people because of high turn over. "
bad,very stressful place to work at expect alot out of you and your co workers. NO pay raise. schedule system is very poor. Also very hot enviroment to work in.
bad,"After a year, I got 20 cents per hour raise. The increase is lower than than inflation rate that year. Despite of having a great boss, I left to look for a greener pasture."
bad,"The job is straight-forward; your main responsibility is to sell products/services to customers.  Essentially you are there to bring in extra revenue for the company, fair enough.  The best part about the job is the people you work with.  One place the company succeeds in is bringing on fun sales agents and managers.  My main complaints are that the hours are rough (if you're new, expect to work nights) and the customers are often times rude."
bad,logged in to computer when i got there was on the phone most of the time and did not do a lot of interacting with other associates  and just made appt fpr truck rentals
bad,"Long hours, angry customers. Out of touch management. More reservations than cars available. No one to back up when customers lie about everything. Unable to train new employees for requirements."
bad,"OMG, it's a mind boggling job.  I knew it was time for me to leave when I started laughing uncontrollably at a customer on the phone who wanted to rent a car but had no credit card.  There's nothing funny about being an unqualified renter, but i was losing my mind from all those calls.  Call after call. All day. Every day.  By the way, the man on the phone had no idea I was having a meltdown, because the headsets have a mute button you can quickly activate.  All he heard was silence as he was explaining what a good driver he was even though he didn't have a credit card, and assuring me that he wouldn't wreck a luxury car rental.  It wasn't a prank call, either.  These are the kind of legitimate challenges that you must deal with when answering dozens of calls per day.  The prank calls are the easiest ones to.deal with, because it's an automatic disconnect.  If somebody asks what you are wearing or whatever, then you push the disconnect button, and click ! , they're gone. Immediately, a new caller is automatically routed through for you to answer.  It becomes extremely monotonous very quickly.  I worked there for about seven months before I quit.  The call volume is overwhelming.  I was at the bottom of the totem pole, so I worked the evening shift.  The people with seniority got the day shift and the night shift.  (Yes, the graveyard shift is a promotion from the evening shift.). The day shift employees are busy getting all the really good callers who are professional, experienced, corporate based, or are travel agents. These callers know the ropes and don't ask 100 meaningless"
bad,"Difficult business for sustained growth.  Very economically driven.  High turn over at non-airport locations.  They have cut back as much as they can to stay afloat during recession and seem to be growing again or at least showing the potential to do so.  Not seeing much advertising so maybe that is still not in the budget. (Pardon the pun).  When the work was available it was busy, fast-paced and even fun at times.  The longevity of sustained business is the difficult trick."
bad,Difficult to work for company contracted to do a job.  Not willing to accept suggestions to improve effectiness  and moral.
bad,"A very difficult and hostile environment during Holidays and Summer time. Very difficult transition, but once you get more acclimated to the environment and work structure, it gets better. Must have a will for a fast pace environment."
bad,Don't have anything to say about this job they are just not fare when it comes down to employee medical health no type of concern even when you try to go back and have a talk with management
bad,"Two shifts twice a day and have to be very multi tasked in a small town. Job involved a certain dress code to serve customers at the airport but after the cars had been contracted out you had to "
bad,"It was overall ok. There was no work life balalnce. The employees ran the company not management. Unfortunately, though they had plans RVP didn't have the backbone to follow through. He didn't want employees at his door. Knowing the past and what we were aiming for."
bad,"As an Operations Manager you are scheduled a min of 50 hours per week in reality to actually get the job done it's more like 60. Have to be able to work with having your schedule changed on the fly, and usually with out any notice that it was changed. "
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was driving the cars back to the parking lot and talking to the customers and assisting them with any enquires.  "
bad,"A typical day at work would be doing around 30 morning reservations, modifying contracts, filing, cleaning vehicles for the next plane. I have learned how to be patient with customers and how to not stress out so easy. The management of the business is very unorganized, lazy and just never present. My co-workers are wonderful to work with, it really makes the day better knowing that we can work as a team. The hardest part of the job is the management and how unprofessional it is. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers, the cleaning and how busy it is because the day goes by faster."
bad,"I enjoy my work and we get along well with my colleagues."
bad,"A typlical day at work inclded:"
bad,"detail car all day, management was very lenient. co workers were all young and wasn't a good fit for me"
bad,This employment is centered on sales. Selling of additional coverages and navigational devises. The hardest part is allowing people to completely understand the benefit of taking coverages.
bad,"Working here I had to work out in all kinds of weather. Rain or shine. Very uncomfortable working in the heat of Phoenix. Also worked inside at the counter and this is where I learned how to deal with very different people. Since it was at the airport, we worked with many people from around the nation and world."
bad,"Its an ok job but not enough to make a living. Its good for students just getting out of auto school to start off or part time but you better have a sugar momma, wealthy spouse, or have a full time job along with this. Management ok,"
bad,good company salary time to get leave anuval everything perfect but no salary engriment that was I am not happy because I can't manage my family maintenance
bad,"Some days you have to find work, some days you have more than enough work. Management doesn’t back you up and some days you’re left to your own devices!"
bad,The workplace environment and benefits were the only positive factors of this job. Everything else such as the job itself was absolutely horrid. I would never recommend it to anyone unless you were in management.
bad,Avis Budget Group can be a great place to work but the willingness of Senior Level Managers to turn a blind eye to the lack of professionalism of their peers and allow the mistreatment of subordinates is appalling. Instead of fixing the problem the option is to remove the employee if he/she complains too loud.
bad,"Procedures and policies were enforced for customers on a losse basis.  Different rules for different accounts.  Sometimes maxes consistancy an issue.   Some employee policies were murky, other clear"
bad,They do not value their employees. Management is for self and does not fight gor staff or what is right. If you are looking for a place to work i would not apply here. They over work all staff from managers down to agents. you will be in a very high stress environment. Not to mention being under paid. scheduling is very inconsistent. Always short staffed and short on cars.Promises never kept and always guilty until proven innocent not innocent until proven guilty.
bad,"The job is easy. The computer work is hard to get used to but you do eventually. The pay is not that great, but at least it’s a job. You clean cars and have a lot of down town it’s a fine job."
bad,"management does not schedule accordingly based on predicted rentals in and out. Commission tiers are hard to climb but extremely easy to lose. Customers that come with a preset rental, government funded,or business rental are not allowed to alter,upgrade,or take coverage meaning their contracts count against your commission tiers because your not adding any of the extras to the rental. Unnecessary training that takes almost 2 months and does not at all make you comfortable or familiar with the flow or operation of business."
bad,"Job could be so much better.  Need to offer more money.  Need better working environment.  If you offered this, more employees would stay with the company."
bad,"your opinion does not matter, you do not have a voice, there is no support from management. its a do as i say environment."
bad,"Thirteen weeks of training will not cover up poor management, employee misery, and low pay. Commissions are pitiful even when you're at the top, 5-10% max. Extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"extremely toxic work environment that I'm in. The job it's self is yes physical and yes it's very hot in Yuma. However my issue is the my co-workers that are majority men, specifically the service agents, who are all men. I have worn many hat's in my life. I've worked in many positions with men and women. Never in my work life have I worked with a team with absolutely no respect for women. No work ethic, no team work, no communication, no integrity or dignity. I've witnessed unbelievable acts of behavior with no consequence or accountability."
bad,"they only want part time drivers no benefits,low pay cant live like that ,its dangers out there on the highway  sometimes you go get out of service trucks bring them to shop for repair not nowing what's going to happen on the highway bad tires thats about to blow engine fumes coming in the cab,no left side rearview mirror so you cant see just dangerous"
bad,Management (Qatar) is not friendly with the employee. They only think about their profit and treat employee very badly. Although the uk management is very nice
bad,"You better not have a family to work there, because you will be overnight. Management will not have your back and there is no support system in place to help you"
bad,"Cheking des réservations, gestion client, vente, classement des dossiers. Gestion de la flotte selon les réservations."
bad,"The management down south could not see how their decisions effected the day to day running. Not enough staff, not enough training, unpaid overtime (20+ hours), a sales wheel which tries to rip people off and doesn't work, a system which has not been updated properly since the 80's (Still using Command prompt to rent a car), Absolutely terrible IT systems, Staff are always good people tho, most of them would go out their way to help others,"
bad,They are not a organized group... The Managers Take care of who they want to.....They definitely do not pay enough and because of that employees come and go!!!
bad,Worst company I worked for poor wages lots of bad service bad boss bad hours bad polices lack of experience from the boss she shouldn’t be running her own house let alone a business
bad,Decent pay but can be a stressful environment to work in because of the miscommunication among managers and employers. it has its perks as far as rentals go.
bad,"Managers are pretty nonchalant, unless of course they need you to come in to work. Substandard pay for the work you do, would not recommend at all. The epitome of mediocrity."
bad,They treat employee's like GARBAGE! The motto is employee's LAST! they take and take and take and never give back to employee's they take away what little incentives that were already there. HORRIBLE moral.
bad,Y'a t il dès réduction pour un salarié lors'quil veux louer un véhicule ?
bad,I will say its a lot of work must be in the best shape too perform duties management loves to encourage but co workers lack team work many are not on the same page
bad,Avis corporation as a whole is great company. However the local organization lacks severely in management skills and communication. There are no benefits.
bad,"Really good team, good team building events, nice building but unfortunately incompetent management."
bad,Management doesn't care about workers. Always over working the workers. Workers can not take holiday pay at certain time of year management wont allow it.
bad,above average work/life balance. typical day includes alot of customer interaction i learned a great deal about sales. very good sales training. competent management willing to help and flexiable. maintaing consistently high numbers in both sales and customer satisfaction in limited fleet situations the hardest part of the job. the daily interactions with new people from all over the world definitly the most enjoyable aspect of the job
bad,"everyday I would come in early and wash 25 cars a day if the front desk was occupied with our other sales reps, my manager started to mess with our hours and reediting our time cards without letting us know"
bad,"This job is good if you want to make extra cash but you have to be willing to push yourself, also be ok with working on your own and making important business decision."
bad,"Avis Budget Group provides a great opportunity for those seeking long-term career building with this company, within this industry.  However, due to the nature of the business and the way in which it is conducted, this job leaves little to no opportunity outside of work to better yourself, or pursue more fulfilling goals."
bad,I was responsible for checking in vehicles and inspecting them.  I was able to work Monday thru Friday.
bad,The company under pay their employees. The working environment is not as good.
bad,"answering calls and general dogs body"
bad,City Manager is long over due to be replaced with someone who is more in touch with the pulse of his employees and their professional needs.
bad,This company isnt on the lower half of great workplaces. Pretty unfair company when it comes to equality between employees.
bad,Recieved incoming calls on a daily basis. I was in a cubical all day and had to deal with irrate customers occasionally. The pay and benefits were not too bad and management was involved with the employees.
bad,Management don't care of anything. Very low changes for advancement
bad,Job can become stressful if you do not have the support of your field management. In office management often turns the cheek to wrong doing by the field. Will provide support even when it is needed the most. Can become burned out due to lack of proper staffing.
bad,"Open the office and do morning paperwork. Make sure you have all cars for reservations that day for customers. You learn great patience with customers because everyone is different. Kill them with kindness when someone get upset about their experience. The hardest part of the job was making everyone Happy! I enjoyed the people, the reward and making sure I did my job to the best of my ability."
bad,Enjoyed working around various nationalities and the opportunity to learn some foreign vocabulary was absolutely awesome working at the airport love field was also exciting
good,"Chaotic, stressful very involved. The passengers for the most part are awful. Management allows mistreatment of employees. Won't back employees"
good,"a typical day at work basically, can be stress-ful or stress-free depending on the car situation.. I've learned about cars, the process of a rental place, car count Etc, The management hmmm i can say didn't really care or have your back as much as you would like, they through you to the wolves LACK of TRAINING. Hardest Part working at ABG  was dealing with many reservations with limited cars working outside in the heat snow rain cold. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new faces day to day and also being able to improve on your customer service skills."
good,Not a good place to grow. And management is not good.  The management did not listen to you. And training was bad. And their was no teamwork. With none of the staff.
good,they bend you backwards and still don't pay you enough.they never give you an option of benefits or advancement. they under cut any way they can and most of the time it show with the customers.
good,"Not a bad place to work, just not what I was looking for. We would get the cars people returned after renting them, fill up with gas if needed, scrub front and back of car, rinse and clean interior of all cars."
good,Lots of shady behavior going on at the location I was at. Coworkers were not nice to one another and there was a lot of talking about eachother behind others back.
good,Typical day consists of getting constant derogatory emails and 14 hour days.  I was in the upper 10% of the company in performance metrics but micromanaged like I was at the bottom.  Health Insurance and car privileges are great but not worth putting up with all the chaos associated with my location.
good,the position comes with high demands and stress. the hours are not great for family life and returning to work after family life was next to impossible. there was zero flexibility
good,"working for Avis  was initially very fun and stress free. Once the company combined with Budget it became a stressful environment due to lack of training on how to handle two different companies to oversee. The management became cut throat and the employees became back stabbers in order to get their commission payout. There was no integrity for the good of the customer just the good of the employee, the benefit for the company and their commission."
good,"Managing a rental car company from offsite airport location. Providing clean vehicles to customer offsite airport. Keep up daily reports, cash deposits, keeping track of disabled vehicles"
good,Seniority based work schedule.  New employees will work overnight until more new hires come in.  No support from management after 9pm.  Not enough cars to do upgrades so if you are not a aggressive salesperson you don't make any real money.
good,typical day starts at 8am learned I learned that we had to work together to get job done management was ok until job site was relocating further out the hardest part of the job was dealing with management at the ne location most enjoyable part of the job was the bond that my co-workers and I shared
good,"When I first started working there things went very smoothely. I took care of customer's requests for renting the right size car, cleaned and maintained the vehicles as they came in, kept rental logs updated and helped with any other office tasks as directed."
good,"The corporate structure at this company is very broken, there are people in there positions for over 20 years that have no idea how much the rental industry has changed."
good,Working at avis budget group is like having a summer job in high school. No grown man or woman can make a living there. It was a waist of my very valuable time that i cant get back.
good,I use to love my job but sadly the manager that made it run smooth and efficient transferred out and the guy who took his place has let it go down hill quick. He makes it not worth the stress that you go through to barely make it through you shift.
good,"Falta do produto principal, carro, excesso de reservas para poucos pontos de atendimento, confusão na parte hierárquica da empresa."
good,Lots of late nights. You have to stay late into the night waiting on flights to come in. I often had to sleep in my car because I had been at work for 13 or more hours.
good,"very stressful no help from management , no support when needed, at times the workload was unrealistic for the number of staff , a very high turnover of staff and different Management quite often all with a different sense of direction ."
good,"Management is bad, the only reason I stayed was because the graveyard shift worked with my schedule for school. I worked there for a year. On my one year anniversary, no raises, and they only gave me 5 days vacation (40 hrs). Management does not treat their employees equally. This is a franchise location, so they are not part of corporate, so they run things a little differently."
good,"Sale, sale, sale. Unit Manager was always causing issues with employees. Seemed like she enjoyed the drams. The hardest part of the job was no lunch break. Enjoyed working with co-workers!"
good,I enjoyed working for Avis/Budget for the most part. The pay was okay. I enjoyed the environment and my co-workers. From the airport manager on up you are just a number.
good,"There is no job security there, they are always outsourcing.  Benefits are great! Work and home balance is great! The workplace culture is also great!"
good,"fast moving customer services constant typing, running reports, checking for car availability and answering phone calls. Poor management do to no team work."
good,"Very quick-paced working environment that included opening, cleaning cars, having cars serviced, customer service and closing the shop. Nice place to work for."
good,"Great for someone fresh out of college without a vehicle. Your first day you are given a company vehicle which includes free gas, insurance and tolls. Great incentive but trust me you WILL work for it. 50-60 hour work weeks, fluctuating schedules, no scheduled lunch breaks if you are a manager, 10-12 hour shifts at a time."
good,Many locations don't operate well. The management is overworked and the workers are overworked and underpaid. Definitely not a career choice in the long run.
good,Nice and relaxed place to work but the shift are too short and you have to fight for hours because there is too many people working there as a part time.
good,"first working at avis, I had a great time. and then the lot guys continued to do poorly and make my job, miserable honestly. time went on. my manager at the time switched me to night schedule, which i did not ask for. "
good,"Management is untrained and do not understand that there is a way to handle customers impossible complaints without destroying employees morale. "
good,"training is not consistent, go go go environment, never know if you'll have someone to cover your breaks, management policies varies, no one listens to the no personal cell policy while on shift"
good,Team leaders act in deference to A/B published codes of conduct..  Hours are very long and demanding.  Some team leaders treated their (all mature adult groups ) like a small heard of cattle.
good,"If you like to get paid little to no money with out benefits or incentives, then this is a job for you.  Working for Avis is not a good career choice unless you work for the actual company. Most of thier locations are individually owned and those owners are complete penny pitchers. This leaves you without any room to grow within the company."
good,"Empresa em fase de reestruturação, muito a melhorar, inclusive gestores/líderes."
good,"The co-workers at Avis Budget were the only good thing about this company. Management is terrible. Station managers were more often than not, not available. When they were available they were not qualified or authorized to attempt to solve any problems. Nothing but yes men to the company hierarchy. Constantly changing shift requirements and frequently called in to cover other shifts or absent workers."
good,"Operations managers are worked heavily, with no stability to their schedules. Upper management stays too focused on sales, and the bottom line, rather than the happiness of their employees."
good,"great easy job, co-workers are ok for the most part. lacked in management payroll sent my check late twice managers didn't communicate the situation went 4 weeks with out pay after reminding management several times."
good,"Aprendi a realizar procesos de evaluacion de proveedores, y a relizar multiples tareas en tiempo limitado y de manera critica."
good,"A typical day at work will be to come in, clock in and find an empty shuttle bus, get on and start using your radio codes in picking and dropping off passengers to and from the airport."
good,Job was not what we thought it was going to be and not profitable.
good,"-Atendimento a clientes com reservas de locação e walk in; abertura, fechamento e prorrogação de contratos; digitalização de documentos (CNH, passaporte, contratos de locação, check-lists e termos de multas)"
good,hardest part of job is following a word for word format to customers. Not allowing any personal input.
good,"Typical work day would start off slow. then it would pick up .An managment was alrite,coworkers the same an it was just work ."
good,Working in a busy appliance store with chaos around every corner. Doing your best is sometimes never enough when your boss leaves and can't gin tough with him because his phone is cut off. Family owned business with a lot of come and go. Work long hard hours with no benefits.
good,"not a big competition compared to other rental companies,the pay is minimum but work is maximum,no benefits,decent management"
good,"Sell out rental contracts, do inventory of cars, process payments and handle any concerns or complaints."
good,I’m only happy when I know I’m appreciate at my job and when my manager shows he cares about his workers . It’s an easy job but a lot of time a simple issue will turn into a catastrophy
good,"It’s a good spot to get a foot in the door for a steady paycheck "
good,Steady work - senior co-workers followed different work rules - co- workers foul mouthed and rude - typical day - drove cars to remote locations and shuttled back in van that was foul smelling and loud - other days moved cars around three parking lots - best part driving newer cars to out lying locations- worst part riding in the van with other drivers
good,"Typically we are lead by the lead to take cars down and up the garage. "
good,"Company is a franchise, seems to run very disorganized.  You never know when you will have cars at your  in town locations for reservations.  The car's have to be hand washed got the most part which  means that they usually are not that clean.  There is no consistency on how things are done and no heirararchy at the locations do no one is held accountable for each location"
good,"The Avis and budget I Currently work for is independently owned and operated. Although it flexible with more schedule, I haven’t had a pay increase in 2 years.I work about 4 to 5 days a week. 11 hr days. Lately I been overwhelmed and over worked."
good,"Smaller locations are generally run by a few people. Seniority rules so the new person gets all the bad shifts and holidays to work. No communication between day and night crew except to complain. Self-managed by employees with pop in from manager who ran 2 locations hours apart. Down times were frequent at small locations. Fast paced once planes came in. Commissions great especially for day shift. Not enough pay but sometimes you work with someone who makes the job awesome, then there will be others who make the day drag on forever."
good,"Hiring was surprising easy, computer systems were extremely SLOW!! workplace was really laid back seriously supervisors acted as your friends instead."
good,Some days it can be busy and some days are slow. Your guarantee hours but not working for below minimum wage. And if you did your hours that's on your schedule they need trying to get you to stay late.
good,"There wasn't enough structure so many days werent as productive as they could be, but they let me work 70 hours a week which gave me enough take home to provide for my family"
good,ambiente dinamico e stimolante ma altrettanto stressante
good,Worked with local market stores/managers to ensure the correct supply of vehicles are delivered or removed as needed based on reservations. Coordinate deliveries/Pick up of vehicles with mobile shuttle crew drivers. Assist with creating reports to show reservations to project vehicle availability. Work with fleet managers to bring in new vehicles or turn back old fleet.
good,"Generally a good place but very poor advancement opportunities within the IT group. Although there are constant technological changes, management of change is not very effective."
good,"fun job with lots of people friendly activities around as to deal with "
good,Not much supervision but it's not needed. Sometimes the department that cleaned the cars was short staffed and I would get to drive the cars to gas them up or bring the cars to shop to be cleaned. Was nice being able to drive cars I normally wouldn't. Management (at the time) was not always professional though.
good,Washed returning customers cars inside and out. Returned customers cars on the rental check in operating system. Dropped customers off to there houses and picked them up when requested. All around general service driver.
good,Liked the people I worked with. Management was not good. Long hours lots of mandatory days had to work 16 hour days. Liked what I did and the customers were good for most part.
good,"Self starters thrive.  Learned many different departments.  management is approachable."
good,"When working at a local office, depending on the manager, the hours can be pretty flexible which is a good thing if you're a student. However, the salary is not worth the amount of work. Corporate has a tendency to blame the local store for everything even when corporate is actually responsible for most of the issues that occurs at the local branch. Some of the regional managers seem to never have worked behind the  desk; therefore, they're usually are not able to understand things that occurs at the local level. Overall it is an okay job, however, customers can be very rude and very demanding at times. If one does not have patience and calmness, I would not recommend this job for him or her."
good,"ABG used to be a great company to work for.  They no longer care about their employees.  Decent salary, management works 50 hours a week minimum.  If you are in management you get a free car which is great.  I worked their for 14 years and the companies upper management continues to downgrade as senior leaders retire.  Glad I got out when I did I see this company moving in the wrong direction.  They will have to continue to buy competition to succeed."
good,"Work was hectic daily"
good,"I have worked for this company and found that this position,does not tell all you are required to shuttle cars and budget trucks and equipment all over. NY,CT,NJ and parts of PA. For the grand sum of $9.00 hour and near the end of the year they cap your hours from a max of appopx.30-32 to under 29. Also you may be required to load up moving pads and hand trucks to bring to other locations."
good,it was hot alot of days working in the sun. rarely provided drinks. always rushed employees and asked unrealistic goals. would move you around regardless of anything else. switched scheduals very often with no  warning.
good,Any business savvy professional would pinpoint hierarchy issues and overall weak business fundamentals within a few months.
good,"Typical day would be starting at 13:00 get to work 12:45 have a look at the work load for the day, cars coming back and vehicles needed for the day and plan my day accordingly. I've always wondered what the Car Rental Industry is like and I enjoyed it very much, I wouldn't mind finding work in this field. "
good,it day review the two cities check with my employees check with the needs for day meeting with co worker. The hardest part covering both cities the workers was the best thing
good,I enjoyed working for the organization.  During my time there I had the opportunity to learn and grown from some of the most intelligent people in the industry.
good,review all reservations for the day and make sure all the car reservations are available...I found out that management and the location already had a bad reputation..my co workers were helpful and encouraging.. hardest part of the job was management... most enjoyable was developing relationships with customer and coworkers alike
good,"It was a good place to work ,the employee was very nice. the hardest part of job is we working outside with hot and cold weather but the tim work was perfect"
good,"A place to become complacent in. Says that there is room for growth, but if you're not a rental sales agent, not really. Long hours and stressful. Not the ideal place to work if you have young children as a single parent or you're trying to go back to school."
good,"You apply online, take the typical personality assessment (choose extreme answers so you can remember your position), take a common sense sales scenario assessment if you're going for RSA, and follow up with drug test.  They offer paid training for 3 months with a performance review at the end (never consistent unless managers can remember to do so)."
good,"Made thousands of business-to-business and ancillary sales. "
good,Its a very steady and fun job but i'm ready to better myself i know i can do better tha'ts why i'm looking other places. I have been in customer service all my life and just ready to advance my experience.
good,"A good company for retirees to work at."
good,"Typical job"
good,"This company was great at customer service, however I was unable to really get a feel for the company because the department I was working for was closing down. The staff was very professional and business driven. As a temporary hire, I did not experience the perks of their benefits package or retirement plan."
good,Busy place if sales are not made your job will be in jeopardy.
good,"cleans cars everyday from 6am to 2pm checking tires, cleans windows, the hardest part of the job to prepare new cars,the most enjoyable part to do my job was working listen music ,good coworkers."
good,This was my first job i ever had. I like working here because it was my first job and got alone with everyone there. I was only 18 years of age when i first started working for avis budget group. It was kind of hard for me at first simply because i was still a senior in high school and i was working the night shift going straight to class right after work on the week days. But after i graduated high school it was pretty easy for me. It was a good experince though.
good,"if you are promoted, upper management say they will help you to get adjusted in your new role but once there is an area of opportunity that comes up, it is counted against you."
good,"I have been with this company for about 8.5 years at Avis Budget group."
good,"Nothing fancy. It's just a job. Don't expect it to help you advance in life. Not hard work. Laid back. Driving one big loop eight hours a day, five days a week."
good,Great if you are looking for part time work. Very flexible with schedule. Will not get anywhere near 30 hours a week which works out well if this is a second job.
good,"Team are friendly and welcoming to new employees. Dynamic atmosphere working around the airport."
good,"Day to day work is typically the same.  The enjoyable part was meeting and interacting with new people every day.  Some days were busier than others, and meeting the customer demand with available vehicles was sometimes a challenge but it was accomplished."
good,"Routine car count, run numbers, check daily and weekly rentals, input payroll info, check on employees work performance, collect money, walk grounds, rent vehicles, wash or clean vehicles, speak with higher ups to give feedback of how the day goes. As a manager, we were able to take a vehicle home."
good,This job is ever changing and fun for quick thinking people. Problem solving is the best asset you can bring to your day. Have the ability to work with all different types of individuals and cater to each persons mindset.
good,La compañía como franquicia rige por políticas de una empresa agena a la del rubro y los beneficios económicos son mínimos. NO recibí capacitación ni inducción al ingresar al puesto.
good,This job was is very stressful. Management sucked!!!!!! youre outside so depending on the weather you have to dress accordingly. big facility. slows down during the winter picks back up during the summer.
good,Es wird zu lange gearbeitet und es wird nicht entsprechend bezahlt.
good,"Always the same, no matter how hard you work, no opportunity for advancement unless you are a part of the in crowd.  Management will promote new hires, rather than train and nurture long time employees. Very unfortunate because they’ve lost a lot of good employees."
good,"In the interview they don't tell you it's a mandatory 10 hour workday, even though most days your there at lease 12 or 13. You're salaried so no overtime to go along with those long hours. They offer you incentives in the interview only to tell you months in they don't/can't give them to you. Most of the people make the day bearable and enjoyable. The customers are self absorbed and entitled, but that's what you get working in customer service. Direct leadership is great, but upper management is so so. This could be a dream job for someone else. Avis is not a horrible place to work for, my experience although hasn't been what I thought."
good,"Overall Avis-Budget isn't a bad place to work, but I feel there is to much emphasis placed on the upsell and counter product rather than customer service and engagement. In my local market the management isn't supportive"
good,I enjoyef working at Avisbudget it fid give me the opportunity to deal with different customers..I just thought the management team could have been a little more on hand with their employees..
good,"Good company to work for. Looking for a change of career owing to my age, vast knowledge, skills, experience and Excellent Customer Service Skills. Was happy in my work."
good,increases good conversation with customers but less management of providing the needed cars on time and have conflicts with the customers most of the time.
good,"Une solidarité dans le travail d'équipe, Bonne ambiance"
good,needs better pay and treat employees better. it takes 30 years to make 20.00 per hr that is way too long.you have to work some week ends.you are working in the elements all the time.
good,"They removed almost all the most productive staff in their roster with no remorse, including those handling posts without replacement (such as my boss who handles marketing materials for the entire asian team."
good,"It is a good company. Overall it was certain workers that were pleasant to work with.No free lunches but a nice break room and breaks were short They made us work in the brutally cold weather during the winter. Sometimes without any break times.i love working on cars but not with frozen hands or feet.Overall I don,t have any hard feelings.The company need workers that are more of team players than haters. The company is very productive . ther will always be car renters.I wish I could have staye but there was a difference of opinion.I"
good,"If you're going into this job it's very stressful. You have to be in first or second shift to work days. If not be prepared to be at the airport until the last flight. When I was working it was corporate, so you could make a lot of money. Now it's not a corporate location!"
good,"A fun job, yet sometimes boring or stressful when their is no need for it. It is only part-time with no benefits. Very unorganized company. Company needs an overhaul top to bottom, messed up internally."
good,"Typical day is assigning customers to cars, checking for special products and reservations. depending on your shift you may have to be a agent/preferred agent, check-in agent, shuttle cars and that's all depending on a busy day without cars. You may have a day full of angry traveling customers and you might get lucky and have friendly customers. Work and home life is very hard to balance because they go with the ""shift bid"" method which only benefits if you have been there for 10 years and can pick a descent shift."
good,"VERRRY CUT THROAT!!! High pressure and NO management support!  Good Money, but you sell your soul to the devil to make it!  Bait and switch at its finest!!!!"
good,"When i come to work, i'm checking the load for 12 hours. Normally, i am calling our chauffeurs and giving them a pick up all around U.A.E. I learned how to manage time very well and how to handle pressure. The hardest part of the job is at night time and when we are having 1,400 pick ups for 12 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my colleague is teaching me Urdu."
good,Get in around 8:15 am and check in with my supervisor and start with my first work assignment. Team up with another driver and drive a car from the yard to another Avis location in the tristate area. Drop off a car and either pickup a car from that location and take it to a different location or check in with my supervisor and pickup a car from another location and bring it back to the yard. This continues to the end of the day which is around 5:30pm or if the runs have ended for the day.
good,"This place is an Interesting place to work at. This job is not for everybody. Lots of daily challenges for low pay. Understaffed, unorganized & disrespectful management."
good,fun place to work with access to all the sweet you ever wanted to sample or not.  Great place to meet people from all walks of life the every day man or woman to some rich and famous.  Co-workers friendly and helpful.  Being exposed to delicious Asian cuisine.
good,I assisted customers with their vehicle rentals and ensuring positive customer experience. and also promoted additional products and services.
good,"Check the board for assignments of work location - location/airport"
good,"The one thing I do personally love about this job, is meeting new people every day. At this job you get the chance to meet people in every walk off life. That would be local and foreign. A typical day I would either be renting the rental cars or assisting customers with everything else that occurs. I learned the best way to handle angry customers. The management team at this job is far from the best. They don't relate to the people and are not really helpful. Love the co-workers at the job, they are some extremely great people. The hardest part of the job is doing the work of three people. Because they are so under staffed. Like I stated earlier the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the new customers and building a bind with the ones who come all the time"
good,"10 to 12hrs of work a day"
good,"tedious,"
good,"While as an organization overall, ABG is an awesome company and if I was anywhere else in the country I would work for this comapny.  This location is just in a position that is not is condusive for a person attempting to take advantage of what the company has to offer, such as the education reimbursement program. When your payment stubs indicate you work 8 hours a day and in reality you work 10-12 hours you know there are issues, including communication, that need to be fixed."
good,"We operate a fleet of about 4,500 vehicles in both rental and leasing in the UAE. Our fleet is comprised of the latest and popular makes and models ranging from economy to luxury sedan. It also includes 4*4 and commercial vehicles. We offer bespoke leasing options and competitive pricing for daily, weekly, monthly rental vehicles"
good,"The management team is never on the same page they have poor team effort, lack of communication an never organized."
good,"This is a face passed commission base income driven job. I learned the ins and outs of the rental car business, and how to increase commission by up sales and other products. Management when I was there was helpful, but they were also sneaky and would give your sales to employees that they liked, so you would have to pay attention to what you were doing so you wouldn't get cheated. Co Workers were decent at times disrespectful and rude. Hardest part of the Job was getting sales in a recession. and the most enjoyable part was the ability to make unlimited income during busy months."
good,It wasn't a very hard job but the scheduling wasn't so greatfor me.there were bogus dress code policies such as hair color and you couldn't wear hair pins
good,"A typical job nothing too hard, coworkers sometimes made the job worth coming to although the pay and overtime pay was nice. One racist manager ruined the entire experience for me and blocked me from ever returning to Avis."
good,typical day was chasing down lost and broken trucks. Hours expected were not worth the pay. Spent more time looking at reports then actually managing the shop.
good,Avis Budget is a work in progress.  Avis Budget is not the place to work if you are looking to make a better life or if you are expecting a good salary.  You won't receive nominal pay.
good,"Good job for an older, retired disabled veteran. it was fun to get to know the other drivers, and be off the couch and out on the road. But, there is a generation gap between the drivers, and the car washers in general. Most of the car cleaners are in their 20's, and most of the drivers are on Social Security. In my case, for some reason, there was a problem with hostile workplace when not out on the road, which caused stress."
good,"A lot phone calls, I learned how to be professional. The management is okay, the people there are nice.The hardest part is the customers. The people there are friendly."
good,"Nice helpful colleagues, but very poor management. "
good,"Don t understand why drivers no have same benefits like others employees from AVIS ?"
good,Ok place to work. Worked more then forty hours a week was never paid over time. The building need things they never were. It is close to home. I deal with customers everyday.
good,"not better SSC as all other, same problems, same stress and big fluctuation.Very poor communication flow,ad-hoc decisions and last minute changes of processes.The colleagues are very kind,most of them with high level qualification.Bonuses and benefits are missing.Modern environment but frequent IT-issues,and often angry customers because of a long processing/solving time."
good,"renting cars"
good,"Management expects you to be at work at least six days a week as the Agency commission is so low that you cannot afford to hire people. This role is a multi skilled role, one person doing all the jobs to run an agency"
good,empresa diferenciada no ramo de estacionamentos e transporte de passageiros.
good,"Good company to work for, Management had some issues with certain employees and liked to play games and joke around. Inconsistency with policy and union. Lack of opportunity to advance."
good,"It is good organization for all people who just started their career."
good,"Independent work as a rental sales agent is fun, You meet and help many people. The agency operator is very good and understanding. Learned about all the rental of cars and trucks. the hardest part is not having cars for already reserved cars. I enjoyed helping people having a nice rental experience with the vehicle and protection they required."
good,"There are a lot of different kinds of opportunity to learn and excel, and a lot of very good people in key positions.   Personnel are knowledgeable and well versed in the products and services."
good,"Need better communication between distribution and locations.. can be very hostile, especially because I worked alone most days at my location. It was very stressful at times"
good,waited 1 1/2 years in that place as a service agent and parker i did almost every job in that place mangers suck they just sit around no pay you get over worked it might not be the job maybe just the jfk 305 federal circle location but its not the job only if u want the discounts on the rentals
good,Avis BudgetGroup is a great place to work if you have if your a self starte but the is No employee appreciation at this location for any employee and is always under staff
good,work hard and try your best everyday. dont let the customers get to you when they get upset about something your explaning to them repeatedly. get as many sales possible so you get your comission.
good,"Customer Service made calls to customer to extended car rental."
good,J ai vraiment adoré une très grande partie de ma carrière chez Avis Dommage que cette ste est de moins en moins proche du personnel et se déshumanise de plus en plus
good,OK job while career searching management throws you on the sales floor without properly training. computer systems are extremely difficult and out of date. lose system connection atleast twice a week. management cannot schedule
good,The management team is great. However the employee compensation makes it difficult to commit to the company especially with work hours that are so time consuming.
good,"No comment. Was working for a franchise, Not part of Avis corporate. When I left, company had fired or fired 26 employees in a single year.  Management the major cause."
good,"- It was huge operations to handle"
good,"Work all kinds of hours no set scheduled "
good,"I enjoyed working with my previous coworkers, it always felt like a family base environment. It was a fast paced environment that had you on your toes."
good,"My coworkers were like family, but the job was very demanding.  Seeing thousands of customers each and every day and providing for their needs is very challenging"
good,el ambiente de trabajo es bueno por el equipo en el cual he trabajado. La direcci'on esta cerca de los trabajadores. Pero no hemos tenido mucho apoyo con Zipcar
good,"A typical day at work for Budget was sometimes calm, busy or crazy. I learned how to multitask due to the different demands of the job. Management was usually okay as long as things were flowing smooth. Co-workers for the most part worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was, keeping customers 100% satisfied when it got really busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working indoors and outdoors, which gave me a balance."
good,Outdoor work in all types of weather.  What management needs to have done with little communication.  Co workers are all part time except for a few.
good,"Attivita commerciale e di sviluppo rete, poco contatto con la struttura aziendale se no con i vertici-dir.commerciale, amm.delegato-e principalmente legata a visite quotidiane sul territorio italiano finalizzate alla creazione di un network nazionale di affiliati come grossi concessionari, grandi carrozzerie etc."
good,checking vehicles in for damage and fuel  washing and prepping also do paperwork for damage deliver cars to customers address on time also pick up vehicles from customers check vehicle for damage and fuel return to base
good,fun working with co-workers and the customers that may come threw. after all it is only shuttling cars. hardest part of the job is the weather may change and we still have to work/walk and endure it.
good,"very busy location at DFW airport, and usually shorthanded staff. need to be able to put up with a lot of stress. coworkers are nice and easy to get along but it all depends on what department your in. management are willing to help you with your schedule."
good,A typical day start by dispatching drivers to pick up/bring hotel guest at the airport.
good,Long hours and stressful place to work. Avis have to upgrade to new way of working
good,"Wonderful company to work for and my coworkers are great, but there is just no growth opportunity. I have worked in alot of customer service positions over the years and dealt with all different types of personalities and customers. I hate to say this but the Avis Budget customers are the worst I've ever had to deal with. Especially the Budget customers. The job is very stressful, and its back to back phones all the time. No time to even take a breath between calls. The overtime is great but it just wears you down. Sometimes its even mandatory overtime!"
good,"A typical consists of greeting customers renting and checking in cars. During the rental process, the goal is to sale the optional services and not to just rent cars. The hardest part of this job is staying late because of the delayed flights. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people from different walks of life."
good,"fast environment, many people to work with.  Ability to work in different locations."
good,"If you have a moral compass, this job is not for you. You have to upsell people into ""nicer"", more expensive cars and you reap little to no benefit from doing so. Even when my sales were up and I was being congratulated by upper management, I was severely unhappy."
good,"Expect to work from 12 to 15 hour days, life / work balance is practicably non existent. The good, your fellow employees and the use of in the lot car with gas. Local management thinks union employees are there enemies and that they are always trying to sabotage the operation."
good,Company could have better incentives and benefits for workers
good,"Coworkers are great, love helping the customer but little to no opportunity for advancement."
good,Driver helper and package handler. deliver packages to peoples door steps.
good,When I worked there they did not get the supplies that we needed to do out job. I worked at the pumps detailing the cars that came in. I liked my job but I was laid off when the economy went bust. So I am probably not a fair reviewer. But I gave you my opinion.
good,"Avis Budget Group Management is very good at motivating staff with talking but they do not act upon what they say, which leaves you very stressed at work when you are looking for supports and fleet which impacts business. I learned that you have to work more hours than advised to ensure your tasks are completed. Hardest part of the job is getting support from managers and doing ridiculous amount of work for not enough pay and then not getting paid correctly. Outsource staff are the most enjoyable part of the job as they will support you more than anyone else in the company."
good,Great Beginning job just keep working hard very flexible with hours you have the chance to grow with the company u might love it I would recommend if u where fresh out of high school
good,"We all get along for the most part and except each others individuality."
good,Great company however affect personal lifestyle due to shift schedules and holiday work. Helped me to grow in the customer care knowledge as I was directly communicating with clients from all over the world.Cr
good,"There is opportunity to define your sales process and become consultative at Avis. Commission structure changes, managerial staff and scheduling are the most difficult issues."
good,"Working for this company use to be fun. Everyone there is friendly however big headed. I have not learned much, except to be more social with customers. Culture there is multi. Nothing hard about this job. Just wish things were different."
good,I learned a lot here. Management process could use work. Training for all employees sucks. Compensation is poor but the benefits are good. The culture can be okay when the business is slow but it can get very toxic.
good,I loved the job but they lied on the contract about the pay only problem and some managers it sucked for only that reason if they payed more I would’ve stay.
good,One of the most hardest part of the job is telling a customer that they don't qualify for a car rental. Most of the time our customers are given wrong or half of the information that would of helped resolve or correct the confusion.
good,"Schedule changed every month. Set schedules and not being able to get request off that much. Car discounts, no vacation time. Mostly only part time opportunities."
good,"Very fast paced job, you always have to be on your toes with constant reservation changes and new incoming flights and passengers. I learned how to manage 2 different locations and oversaw our airport kiosk."
good,"Working as a Rental Sales Agent (RSA) at ABG is a demanding job that requires a decent amount of competency. The environment is usually fast paced, but usually slows down seasonally. "
good,You are better off getting a Manger job if you are a stranger off the street. this company does not want experienced internal employees for promotion.
good,"its ok, the first day I started it was a cool decent job to work at, after two years of working here, its a constant battle w customers and they're rudeness behavior towards the people behind the counter helping them out with rentals ."
good,"clean cars none stop"
good,Budget Atlanta needs to go back to the days that the employees mattered as well as the customers. The last several years they just want to change policy to the extreme. It's hard on everyone. They put out the feeling of we just don't care. If someone leaves there's always someone else to step in. Crazy merry-go-round
good,The hardest place to work sometimes commission is great management not so much. I cannot understand why they don't appreciate good workers and its so not understandable that people don't have life.
good,"kind off a good place to work till we had our team & management too."
good,"This is an easy job if you enjoy being active and constantly moving on the go often - washing, drying, waxing, and cleaning vehicles as well as parking."
good,In my time time unfortunately the manager only appointed the people he knew before or just the ones under his umbrella. Disappointing for others who also put their energy and will to get a promotion.
good,"Room for improvement, major changes needed to see the benefits. Stuck to old ways of doing things and not willing to accept new ideas, non confirming to any change. Set in the old school ways."
good,The management is not concerned with accommodating your schedule to assist with your family life.Rotating Shift work is required even when employees could cover the schedule on mutually convenient plans
good,"I was there approximately 11 years as an Owner Operator. Was unable to take much time off.  Was paid a percentage of total revenue. The percentage was minimal so it was almost impossible to hire reliable employees. Most of my employees were college kids with restricted hours.  Also, there system is very hard to learn, taking minimum a month or more to really learn the system, costing quite a bit in training. "
good,"Good start up and nice place for part time job. Manager is nice and supportive."
good,"this job was fun only for part time work not a full time job, the job duties were very easy and you work at your own pace. the managers were always around"
good,management and co workers were easy to work with. the pros were that hours were flexible and could work around your schedule. the cons were that there were no benefits or much room for advancement.
good,The management is good but there is definetly favortism between management and certain employees. There is no room to advance in the company and no benefits other than a weeks vacation after a year of service.
good,"The compensation for a customer service associate needs to increase drastically due to the volume of work, and the amount of insults and foolishness you deal with on a daily basis."
good,"El enlace sindical usaba su título para disfrute personal y familiar"
good,My day consist of meeting with management on a daily basis and communicating with my other manager and local agencies. Meetings consist making we have the correct amount of vehicles as well as the correct type of vehicles for our customers.
good,Avis provided me with a lot of managerial experience and allowed me to show I could Manage a large amount of employees and  help run a large location with little supervision. i was trusted to take care of the daily customer and employee needs.  I worked hard to make sure each day ran smoothly.  i loved working with people both employee and customer and enjoyed my time there each day.
good,"I worked for a locally owned location, not a corporate location. There is a difference in the workplace culture between a corporate store to a locally owned and operated store. There were certain compliance's we had to follow in order to do business as Avis but overall, locally owned locations have their own rules, policies, benefits, etc."
good,"Avis and Budget group is good for build up your experience for a long run, management is very poor. Depending on what department you in it's very stressful. Overall the co-workers makes the job fun and meet a lot friendly locals out there, give a lot aloha and never back you down."
good,"Avis was an okay place to work, as long as you enjoyed condescending tones from managers while they berated you for not completing jobs that weren't your responsibility."
good,J'étais en remplacement d'un congé maternité d'un an. Plus trop de souvenirs
good,"I enjoyed working there, I just did not like the long late night hours. I prefer to work dayshift hours.  You have to start at the bottom and earn seniority"
good,"The day stars with a quick staff meeting before everybody heads for their posts."
good,Good company to work for. Very busy environment. Fun to work with others in your work group. Very competitive. Not much time for life outside of work and you can get forced overtime on any given day up to 4 hrs past your shift.
good,fun fast pace company. you got to meet new people every day  from all around the world. but the company was more worried about having more employees for less they could have two for the cost of one with over ten years envested
good,This company is a decent company if you don't mind working long days alone and traveling across your region to get vehicles for your location.
good,"It's okay to work there as a supplement to a primary job; however, there is no room for advancement. However, the coworkers are good to work with"
good,"En stage de fin d'étude: 9h30 - 18h30 (en théorie)"
good,A typical day for me at work is that i would open the store around 7am and get all my keys set up and the reservations printed out so that when the customer arrives i am ready for duty. Getting ready first thing is very important so when the customer gets there you are ready for them. I really enjoy speaking with people and leaning new things from them from trips to life to just how there days is going. I was a leader so i would be the one who took it upon myself to create new ideas on new situations such as a good experiences and bad if they occurred. I learned a lot from this job on how to deal with difficult situations. I really appreciated being around different people from around the world. It made me want to learn new things all the time. I had awesome coworkers. We also had a chance to move up in the company and make more money.
good,"Its car rental, nothing more to say if you need a job and you like to deal with problems every hour of the day its for you! Great first job for people needed pocket change."
good,"Typical work day consisted of checking in cars, and working in the kiosk. In the kiosk I would answer calls, comply with the costumers needs, and deal with payments."
good,"Good company overall, career progression not great, poor management, salary levels low for the responsibilities. Location not ideal for people living in London"
good,People you worked with were awesome. Management was great also.
good,i worked as a casusl driver when i was needed i took cars to where they were needed and cleaned cars the job was only casual on a 12 month contract
good,"Fellow employees were a pleasure to work with, great managers were hit or miss. During the summer months expect to work 8+ hours of OT per week, zero tolerance for any reason work might be missed regardless the severity of issue. Hard work and long hours receives little appreciation from management. The paycheck is nice, though."
good,"- Management doesn't know what they are doing"
good,"I enjoyed working at Avis. There was always something to do to keep me busy. Management was a joke, talking down to the employees and blaming us on things we had no control over in front of customers. My co workers were awesome. There wasn't anything very difficult about working there. I enjoyed the ""busy work"" of it all, I don't like when there is down time because it makes the time go by too slow."
good,"A typical day for me is to organize the day for the drivers that i have in to deliver and collect the cars. i have learned to work better under pressure and to stay calm, the management within Avis are reasonable and fair, my co-workers are trustworthy and fun work with, hardest part of my job would be when i run out of cars and i need to find them from other locations, the people work with"
good,"least enjoyable- working outside all year round"
good,"It was a fun environment to work in."
good,A typical day at work as a distribution manager consist of in fleeting new vehicles in the system getting them ready for customers to rent.
good,"I am very excited if I work this company. I heard that it's a nice and big company. So, I want to be a member of this company."
good,"8AM-6PM shift."
good,"Budget was a nice place to work in an attractive, well-supplied office with current technology and nice co-workers and managers."
good,Freedom to change procedures to run my department more efficiently.
good,"It gave me good skills to use for future jobs, but overall didn't agree with the way the company supported higher management who should have been fired long ago."
good,"There's always something to do at this job, be it assisting customers, or managing cars. I learned that car rentals is a big business, I had no idea so many people rented cars. My co-workers each have their own assignments. I am mostly the one who just washes the cars. The hardest part of the job would be washing the cars out in the texas heat, it takes alot from you. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to try out and learning about all of these new cars, especially the luxury vehicles."
good,repair all local box trucks . learned differnt stiles of engines / lack of management . hard part of job working with management . work was all ways busy
good,Clean and detail cars and manage garage employees. Rent and deliver cars. I learned how to detail cars completely and quickly. I had a cool manger for a long time and then she left the company. I had decent co workers. The hardest part was trying to please every customer. The most enjoyable part was I met alot of people.
good,Tipically Driving Vehicles..Droping them of at Locations etc.
good,"molto impegnativo ma con tante soddisfazioni, si impara ad interagire con persone provenienti da ogni parte del mondo"
good,A typical day at work starts off with servicing all cars and transporting them to various locations. I was able to interact with a lot of people at work
good,Great place to work hard and pass time. Get to drive a large variety of vehicles. Lots of great coworkers. Flexible hours. Sadly looked down upon by other positions within the company
good,"Great place to work as an employee or manager in corporate atmosphere just be wary of contracting with them as a contractor, adjust expectations despite what your told in training."
good,It is actually a great job to work at very flexible and a great area to work but its the co-workers and managers who might actually make you dislike the job as a whole.
good,It's a good step for anyone with not much experience and you can use it as a stepping stone to move onto greater things. People come and go but if you have a good team anything is possible. If they can only match salary with what staff do people would have no complaints
good,The standard workweek is 50 hours. The company shows a constant lack of concern for its management team. My time here has shown me that the upper management in the company views each location as dots and names on paper. The couldn't care less about the actual people doing work for their company.
good,New management set goals with NO interaction with workers. Desk work and field work are not connected. Field work is overlook and managed with poor reports with no physical verification.
good,"Career growth are always available."
good,"Management was cool, the job itself was interesting because you can meet new people, new travelers. There are 2 types of customer service rep positions-one is indoors sedentary, the other is outdoors in the weather year round. So make sure you specify which position you want."
good,The hardest part about this job is being able to deal with customers and trying to please everyone management customers coworkers.What I’ve learned is the ability to handle stress
good,"A typical day opening up the wash bay would be doing car control making sure each car is accounted for, putting out the keys on each car and starting to put down the cars the front staff needed"
good,"In Avis Budget Italia S.p.a. ho trovato un ambiente lavorativo positivo. Ho dovuto gestire lo stress, ma ciò derivava piu' che altro dal fatto che ero inserito nell'ufficio legale, di diretta collaborazione con il management. Diverso è l'ambiente amministrativo, dove ho trovato anche una discreta collaborazione dei colleghi. Le retribuzioni sono sinceramente piuttosto basse, considerando che si tratta di azienda che, incorporata in una multinazionale, ha proceduto a diversi licenziamenti sia a livello dirigenziale ma anche impiegatizio, anche con discreti importi a titolo di buonuscita, e alla delocalizzazioni di diversi uffici"
good,each day depended on the orders for the day and the intake for the rest of the week if we had early or special rental reservations. everyday day no matter what I took the time to learn something new about the ends and outs of my position and the companies policies all around the board to be ready to answer or handle and situation I may encounter. management was well handled most times with new policies being placed things transitioned pretty well. biggest thing to deal with was the fumes I encounter daily from the engines in the garage and the cleaning supplies. greatest about the job was the different people I seen everyday the planes overhead the knowledge of new car getting to know the vehicles and driving them
good,if you're good at selling then you will make a lot of money. management is the worst that it can be. They always over book and when customers come there are no car and you have to tell them to wait while the management hides.
good,"It’s a good job, but pay isn’t the best, management is not on the ball and don’t usually keep they word. One great manager (kelvin) but the rest are ok at best."
good,"Trained each employee in customer service and sales to meet company goals and standards. Insured the rental counters were manned appropriately and managed a fleet to insure reservations were met. I monitored competitive pricing to insure profitability was met."
good,"Avis was an alright place to work.  But what was good at first sort of went downhill as my time progressed there.  Management really didn't think highly of you no matter what position you were in."
good,"Company will ;limit you from growing your business if you are an Agency Operator. You can never give 100%. Very limited in terms of what you can do.  If they see you going up in number of cars rented at your location, they will raise your rate and lower the airport rate so that customers will go to the airports to get their cars. They also close your location on Travelocity and other sites so customers do not reserve at your location. Fleet manager only wants to grow the corporate locations and never sends cars to the Agency locations. You will always have reservation failures even though the cars are just sitting idle at the airports. You will get the oldest fleet of cars while the corporate locations keep the new cars."
good,This job is fast paced and requires a lot of moving around. I advanced through the company and learned a lot about the business throughout the years. I have enjoyed working with my fellow employees and some of our customers are great. We hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were dishonest. I enjoyed it when customers left with a smile on their face and they knew they had received excellent customer service.
good,"Great for a part time job for extra cash, some work colleagues are welcoming while others are the worst which is just like every other job. Great location to work salary not the greatest."
good,"Entré por mi interés hacia los coches y poder ofrecer a los clientes el mejor vehículo que se prestara a sus necesidades y posibilidades. Te forman para ésto en la empresa. Pero al final lo que encuentras es una gran presión para vender seguros y terminas tratando con clientes que a la vuelta se sienten engañados. Algunos managers son cercanos y de intenciones orientadas a la satisfacción del cliente. Pero terminé muy descontenta y decepcionada al trabajar en un sitio donde los mánagers consideraban ""un buen día"" cuando un cliente había tenido un accidente serio y no llevase seguro completo, porque suponía un gran beneficio para la empresa."
good,"management is not good about taking suggestions. Lot of back biting among fellow employees. Traffic can be a real stressful part of job. "
good,"Everyone did a little of everything; it is a team based environment. dispatchers would help return agents, return agents would help the gate, etc. Your coworkers are your best friends, because they help you get through the day."
good,"No need to! Just get ready for every thing you have been through with a company but worse! If you have a family that depends on you severely then this is not the job. If you need some extra cash in desparate need then yes, it pays great, as long as you know how to sell!"
good,I loved the associates and how helpful the trainers were.  The building was very well equipped and updated. Team leaders were strict and not open-minded to other ideas.
good,"Trabalho tranquilo dependendo dos horários de vôos, pois atendia no aeroporto e dependia das escalas dos aviões."
good,"Company has been making poor management decisions at the highest levels for the last several years due to pressure from the board.  Focusing on short term financial goals rather than creating policies that will promote long term success.  This has led to significant decline in employee satisfaction, retention, and quality.  Work/life balance is difficult for managers, regularly required to work 10+ hour days.  Company has been decreasing size of work force while increasing market share putting strain on remaining employees."
good,IT was not a bad first job. I originally  worked for CUC and it became Cendant after the merger.  The pay was not great but the work office was fun.  Not sure i would ever go back because of the low pay
good,During the time that I was being trained as a new city manager with Avis Car rental they were undergoing some internal purging to remove some of the stale and too comfortable managers that were not pulling their weight. With this huge task taking place I was caught in the middle of managers that were training me and regional VP's who were slowly weeding out the sick and their disagreements as to how the process was taking place and trying to remain neuteral as a new hire and having those you are trusting for accurate training pressuring you one direction and then on the other side having your soon to be boss the regional VP asking you to spy on these managers training their replacement. The whole situation was a disaster.....
good,"Good culture and good support from corporate teams,  fleet management gets very difficult in peak seasons so be prepared to deal with a lot of angry customers."
good,easy work.  Nice environment  but some employee`s are lazy. you have to stand unprotected in the rain and other elements. needs to pay more. Management listens but not to many results.
good,"layoffs and more lay offs.  There is no job security. However, this is a great place to work if you have a family and are looking for work life balance."
good,"Prepared vehicles for car rental, washing and slotting the vehicles in their desired areas, took the vehicles to QTA to be cleaned. Assisted the patrons with finding their vehicke."
good,"It is an okay place to work, the higher up managers just care about money and don't give a crud about the employees, the department managers cared about the employees and they were more fun to talk to."
good,"The job of a driver shuttler is laid back and the pay is terrible.  The management is terrible, they expect you to go to Jackson Tn, Brinkley AK, and around Memphis for 7.50.  They give you part-time work so they want have to give you on the job benefits like health insurance and etc.  They can not keep employees long because the pay and the hours are not worth you getting up for in the morning.  Working with the other driver shuttlers are like working with children they don't enforce the rules and the employees mouths are filthy, they have inappropriate conversations on the job that are not fit to be talked about in the workplace.  If you work at Avis work at the airport not at the Center on Democrat."
good,Avis was a place that allowed me to hone my network troubleshooting skills. Avis had a good mentorship program. It gave me strong network services retail background.
good,The management at the time was a joke. The one guy kept after me and he was cheating on his wife. I don't recommend Avis to work with. But they could of changed.
good,"The job itself is pretty fast paced and easy and enjoyable. Great co-workers to work with, but management is lacking communication."
good,"handle Dispatch check in cars , look for damages and also greet customer making sure customer know where their car is and just having fun."
good,"THe company and management were great. THe employee benefits , pay ,and hourly rate was not good. You never got hours, company did not want to pay insurance so 20 hours was all you got."
good,"Long hours and average pay. Not that exciting for a college grad and no opportunity to advance at the location I worked at. Staff is okay, agents are overworked and don't look to stay long term, esp all the young recent college graduates. Decent starter job, don't get sucked in."
good,"Working at Avis Budget Group was very consistent on a day to day basis.  This position taught me how interpersonal skill when communicating with customers.  Also at Avis Budget Group I learned how to add value to a sale by offering additional products and services to a rental agreement.  This job required the ability to communicate bad news to the customer professionally, politely, and in a way they could understand."
good,"Worked for Avis for 3 years as Operations Manager. Perks- free company car (pay for no gas/ insurance), travel to a different state can fill up at Avis Airport locations, good medical insurance, good 401k, can get your schedule 2 or 3 weeks in advance. There is room for promotion if you are brown nosing or know someone of higher level in the company. Cons- long hours. Management is expected to work 10hrs only paid for 8 (feel like they compensate that with the company car) and as always the airport doesn't close so doesn't rental car. Turn-over is high due to employees conditions of having to be outside in all conditions of weather along with managers."
good,"The pay is the main reason most people stay. Hourly plus commission. "
good,"La parte más interesante del puesto son las múltiples tareas que se desarrollan, ya que al ser una empresa pequeña en cuanto a trabajadores es necesario ejecutar todas las acciones que conlleva la empresa para poder prestar el servicio. Siendo completa la experiencia y desarrollando cualidades en todos los aspectos del servicio, ya sean las tareas administrativas como las organizativas y de gestión."
good,"Good environment only problem was you will not receive your check on time, Most enjoyable part would be driving the different vehicles and being able to meet different customers that come from different countries"
good,"Mejorar la motivación del empleado, para mayor implicación en el trabajo y mejorar la calidad, aún así existe una buena plantilla."
good,"I enjoy the customers alot, most fly in and out alot, and are very gracious! management confused me, first impressing me, but ultimately they dont care what kind of job your doing until it causes them a headache. A very fast paced work environment, which I like. But no pay increases, and no reviews after 45 days. they care more about negative reviews both from customer and employees....I guess that makes them reactive and not proactive, drives me crazy."
good,"positiva,Renta de Vehículos,buen ambiente laboral,manejo de horarios,capacidad instalada acorde al negocio,plataformas y medios tecnologicos"
good,"start every day washing cars for a few hours, dealing with customers in-between, answering the phone. every time a moving truck is returned after checking it in i do an inspection on it to make sure its good to use again. Managing is not too hard i usually only have 1 or 2 people under me we've always been understaffed which makes things hard on the busier days. hardest part of the job is definitly all the juggling i have to do, i wear a lot of hats in this store but i manage to get everything done most days, i most enjoy dealing with people, always have liked human interaction."
good,"As a team member here you may wear many hats throughout the course of the day. One must be very flexible and have the ability to think quickly on their feet. Advancement often requires relocation completely. The team members are great people with various backgrounds, that make for a great work environment."
good,The present company where I am working right know it gives me more experience in transport field .But I would like to enhance my experience
good,"More of a call center than a traditional insurance company. Great benefits, over the last couple of years they have down sized in the Norfolk area."
good,"Typical day: Processing and organizing data in a friendly clean environment.  Quiet and peaceful.  I enjoy the environment."
good,"A typical day begins with planning.  It requires gathering data on what vehicles are available for rent, projecting the total reservations for the day, and ensuring that there are enough employees to complete the rental transactions successfully.  It involves coordination with several departments that complete the rental process."
good,I was a csr and also had to complete the workers schedule and finish reports on montly books.
good,ABG was a great company to work for.  Benefits were good.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Being a rental sales associate at Avis Budget group can be a great opportunity for the right person. The sky is the limit on sales and the benefits package is great, Unfortnately, the structure of scheduling is lacking some compassion, For anyone who has a family or responsibilities outside of their job, the management is unwilling to work with their availability."
good,"Typical day at work varies to the amount of rentals due during the week. Working at Avis, i learned more about the fleet vehicles that we carry. Management i have to say, needs more improvement. This job lacks management. Most of my co-workers are good people and are fun to work with. The hardest part of this job has to be the amount of people who arrive late to their flights and their reservation and gets upset with the workers due to their frustration. Most enjoyable part has to be the amount of customers you encounter and learn from all over the world."
good,Getting transportation prepared for customers daily. I learned my way around the city very well. management was very  professional  and my co workers I still communicate with even today. The hardest part was meeting the high inventory demand of customers. The most enjoyable was seeing them completely satisfied with there rental.
good,They have poor management.  Only one of are three manager work. They dont care about your family life . Never have a weekend or holidays off. Always working late shifts. Never have a steedy schedule.  They put out the schedule 1to2 days in advance.  No organization.  So much favoritism.
good,it was a job. Most the other people were lazy. Some of the people were great though.
good,"Great Place to work, When you come to work, do your Job, and  Leave."
good,"Checking in and out new/regular customers, doing daily paperwork, dropping cars off to locations for customers, cleaning cars, and making and cancelling reservations. I learned better organization skills and being as helpful as possible to customers. It wasn't a very hard job. The most enjoyable part was driving the cars."
good,"First thing was to ensure all cars arrived and groomed on time to be contracted out on time, airport clients to meet and greet on time, was full on. Worked after hours at airport to greet clients on late flights. Was always prepared to work extra.  Boss was an organised lady, and always had her finger on the pulse of things,  Hardest part of the job sometimes was keeping up with her, I had a great respect for both my manager and my team mates as we all had our roles to fill and we were a happy bunch of co-operatives"
good,At Avis hours can be very long.  You must be extremely dedicated to the company since it's a 24 hour operation in most airports.
good,Very good place to learn work experience and customer service. Ive learned to handle very intense situations here.
good,they just didn't pay very good. the bosses were very nice though
good,This call center was the first I worked for and I found it to be overall a positive work environment and enabled me to acquire many skills over the period I was with them
good,This San Diego Budget location was always on the go.  We had lines that would be for 2 hours and outside the door.  I was so fast at processing rentals that I went and worked for the Fastbreak Department and could process rentals in 6 seconds and less.
good,Working for a rental car company was always very busy. I learned that dealing with people from all walks of life was interesting. My manager at the time was very understanding no matter what the situation was. I loved my co-workers we had a good time all of the time whether we were outside or inside. The hardest part was when we had flight delays and not many cars to rent. Overall I enjoyed every aspect of the job.
good,I was able to work on cars and clean them and was able to see the new cars coming out and drive them to help the customer on any issues they might have 
good,Avisbudgetgroup is a good company to work for however Im looking for more of a call center job.
good,Lowest wages compared to other companies for similar job title.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty steady. The things I have learned is the proper procedures on how to rent a rental car as well as other products. My management are pretty cool and laid back for the most part but everyone has their days. I love my co-workers, I think they are awesome. The hardest part of my job is when we are short on cars and we have a line of people who have reservations. The most enjoyable part of my job is my early morning shift."
good,Walking in and viewing the lot to see how many cars are in and management are great people as well as the co workers except for one who just on everyone from there on the hardest part is simply not taking a car home.My biggest dislike is that i don't see it as a career and its not for me i want to grow with a company and see my skills and realize they made the best decision because i will be giving my all.
good,A typical day at work is your very busy making sure the right cars are on line to satify your customer. I learned very quickly to work with different personalties quickly. My co workers all work hard to get the job done profiently. The hardest part is working with different personalties. The most enjoyable part is meeting peple from all over the world especially during the holidays.
good,The hardest part of the job is working in ALL weather conditions.
good,servicing customer needs cleaning cars staffing employees
good,"You come in the morning open the location deal with customer and staff issue's I manage 3 downtown location so time management played a big part. Hardest part of the job was not having the support for Senior management specially when you're dealing with multiply issue. I did not have a great expirience when it came to management given the tools and support I believe I would have succeded more. The part I like about it was the customer service I enjoy being able to help everyone. I like the challenges that we face on a day to day basis. I liked the company, and the people who owned it. But unfortunately the operational management sucks!"
good,"Well, I worked 2nd shift starting at 3 30 pm to 11 00 pm. At first, it was easy training, as well as, an easy going job. I come in on time to start my day off. First, I reported to the base which was located in Elk Grove,IL. Next, I was transported with other co workers to start our day. What I actually did was transport company cars to and from O'hare Airport. Sometimes, it required me to go out of state but, I did not mind because i was an okay job. Then, I begin to notice that I was doing too much work for the pay rate the company was offering. in Result, I registered for school and left the company. However, I did not complete proper paperwork and was unvoluntarily terminated."
good,"Working from a list of accounts, following up with customers regarding outstanding bills. Managed an acd line."
good,"Avis Budget Group was at one point an enjoyable company to work for, but somewhere along the way they lost sight of what really mattered... RENTING CARS. They did this at the cost of their customers as well as employees. Nothing has a value there anymore, there is no loyalty to anyone besides the extreme upper management."
good,I was able to stay busy through out the day by taking trucks to their desired location. No day was ever the same. It was nice to drive all over the city and country side.
good,"todo bien, ambiente agradable en algunas locaciones."
good,"Semi decent company, however the corporate hierarchy has no concern for not operating employees (anyone that isn't a franchise owner). The franchise I worked for a a busy one and kept me on my toes but got a bit much because we where understaffed."
good,"Good work life balance, plenty of people there who have deep industry knowledge.  Needs more infrastructure around data collection to help the field and globally understand how and what is spent."
good,Good place go work part time especiallyfor those who are students and seniors. As a shuttler its an easy and active way to pass time and be productive
good,"Le travail dans cette entreprise était agréable, en même temps palpitant."
good,very productive workplace i learned a lot with timing people skills speaking to customers from everywhere around the world a great responsibility will be placed in your hands
good,Great people to work with. Pretty fun environment. Everyone helps each other and the workers are outgoing. Sometimes customers can get upset for multiple things but other than that it's a ok job for a person looking for quick cash.
good,Depending on your work ethic is a decent job or company to work for this company is pretty fast pace depending on the area both working in and outdoors in all types weather
good,i like working for abg sometimes there can be some difficulties at work. if you are a rsa and not the best at selling then it an be hard but when you get the chance to drive the cars it is really fun
good,"Good culture, although there have been many re-organizations within the company over a short period of time. Lots of good people work there, so good atmosphere."
good,"Avis is a good job for people that’s in need of one. You work 10hr shifts but you work less days. The pay is not that great, that’s the downfall of the job"
good,Learn a lot about working since  it was my first job. Learned how it is to balance work and school with the acceptance of other life things. Fair workplace.
good,Average place to work. Management is sub par and manages by intimidation/ fear. Poor health and safety standards throughout the organization. leadership is transparent at best.
good,"Well it's a basic summer job."
good,Staff reductions create overworked and unhappy employees.  Remaining management is ineffective and unskilled.  Operating system is old and inflexible.
good,I really enjoyed working with fellow employees because of my joy and love for wanting to help people. Customer service is my passion and I get a great satisfaction knowing I have made a difference in someone's life.
good,I learned so much about cars(which is one of my first loves) I love driving and learning all different locations. I enjoyed being a Lead because I am a leader.
good,"Company culture is riddled with too much politics and favoritism. A restructuring and repositioning of managers will refocus company goals clearly and reduce complacency."
good,It's an okay place to work jobs not hard you just have to be able to getting work an you really have no sick time off..there is a 90 day probational period an don't miss any time..an don't come in late or your fired
good,General call centre job. Managers were pleasant but the job is monotonous.
good,well a typical work day is that in the morning staring your day you get your assignment from your boss its a fun environment to be around so after getting to assignment. go and get a vehicle write up the information on the car and go to the location to drop of the vehicle and go back to the location to an another assignment.
good,"I move around a bit for the 5 years I was at Avis. "
good,"Good work environment, great benefits, opportunities for advancement. 401k, paid time off, paid sick days, opportunity for yearly bonus. M-F schedule with weekends off."
good,"The company is just ok. My department was horrible. They use temps before promoting within, they will fire you because of hear say & shows no compassion towards employees if they have an emergency or family situation. Again, the entire company may not be how I describe bet my department was a doggy dog world. Oh the encourage you to tell on other employees to move up."
good,"I worked at the Portland Airport which I enjoyed, it was fast paced which I liked, I learned how to handle stressful situations, I learned to do DBR and paperwork, closing out the day, I enjoyed working there."
good,I learned many skills and it definitely was both fun as well as challenging. My time was definitely a fine balance between working under pressure as well as understanding various roles within the department.
good,"8 hour work day"
good,The amount of knowledge and skills available to learn was amazing. I have grown so much from what I have learned from working here. There are many different roles within the configuration lab and you are able to work your way up through all of them and learn many different skills.
good,"It provides one of the best services when it comes to Car rentals, I enjoyed my time there even with the long hours, they personally deliver and collect their vehicles which makes them more convenient"
good,"Awesome company to work for. Very fast paced and everyone working for Avis Budget Group undeniably works for meeting the common goal of success; however, management is all over the place. No structure whatsoever. Nepotism is apparent. For example, an employee in the Social Media department was upset for having to take calls (a required job duty) and walked out. Since management loved her, she was able to keep her job. Had someone else that management disliked did just that, they would be fired."
good,"Fast-pace. You always have to think 5 steps ahead of you. Not everyday is the same. The volume of people you meet is unlimited. Fun, motivated staff to work with."
good,I did not like the upscales the company required you to do. I felt that it was unnecessary and deceitful. The management is all about sales and not customer service.
good,Buen servicio un ambiente divertido alegre sociable.
good,bon relationnelle clientèle et bonne enrichissement
good,I will go I didn't have personal things going on in my life I will go in at 9 and get off at 5 they offer all the time and pay a dollar or two more if I stayed over
good,"Being very busy is a typical day for Avis/Budget. It required making sure you had cars to rent, clean cars. Taking on new customers was always welcomed. Dealing with insurance companies on a daily basis, calling the airport to order more cars. I managed the office myself, cleaned the cars as needed, made phone calls approving rentals. I needed help, begged for help, never got it. It was myself alone that done the work. The best part of working there was making customers happy and return customers."
good,"i would always come in a little early see what the flow will be like for the day look over all inventory. Get to work people was OK do to coming and going dropping their cars off and picking them up. staff was get new policies and changing the process of the clock in so to say the least the staff was all over the places trying to get learn and teach the new rules. Everyday was different depending on events and weather. hardest part of the job was dealing with the fumes of the car, planes  and cleaning chemicals i had to pass all day, i loved being able to drive new fast big, small and colorful array of vehicles."
good,"Not getting trained properly, lovely staff, poor management, very long hours, loved helping customers and learning new cultures and language's from tourists, also you get some real horrible people well which can get quite stressful."
good,The hourly employees and customers have a real connection with other. The management seems to be out of touch with both. Upper Mgmt and Corporate is the cause for the disconnect.
good,"Smiles can go a long time ,the atmosphere is what you make of it .stay focused on the job conduct. Promotions are always  there after a period of time with the company. Then you are free to apply for whatever is opening  position is.the job isn't hard at all put your all in everything you do.its about  getting it done.so many job positions there,there's no hard task because you will be shown how to do things"
good,"Its a easy fun job. You have to learn the system before anything, but once you get over that learning curve its easy. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers."
good,"process the vehicles that were returned.  Also, deal with the customer and their complaints. Must check the car over when it was returned for scratchs, dents. and any thing you see."
good,"Changes neeeded in management process to make job more of a enjoy climate to work at, minior changing in the process of hiring. More paper work less computer, more inter action and opinions from workers on improving the process of the job."
good,"I worked the counter and rented cars my whole shift."
good,Answered calls for customers that needed to rent cars. Learned the different size cars for different size families. Not being able to help customers when the location was out of cars. Talking to different people and being able to assist them in their needs.
good,The union made this job very difficult for management to do their job. Older employees were more focused on getting new employees fired. Management doesn't have much control.
good,Avis is fine. I worked mostly at Payless and it was slow on most days.  They seem to put the cars at Avis more than Budget or Payless.  I would recommend this job
good,a typical day was trying to upscale your customer to meet you daily goals.  You were driving by management to meet or exceed your goals.  Often times stressful dealing with late flights or sold out fleet.
good,It was an okay job with some benefits to it. Usually fast paced most days but it would have relaxed ones as well. It was nice meeting and talking to different kind of people and management was alright as well.
good,"Usually working at a location with little to no help. Especially after 5pm. Can get very fast paced so patience is key. Things WILL Go wrong, outdated computers, cars unavailable, no upsells, etc. but patience is key. It pays to know other employees at other locations."
good,"Good and Productive Company, I felt comfortable there and I learnt a lot of stuff and but I want to learn more new stuff about the Automotive world and they can't give me that."
good,Long hours per day.  Depending on what season you start it is constant work.  Great for summer jobs and first business for management experience. Empathy workers are high at this job placement.
good,"The atmosphere wasn't very active as far as interaction with other employees, I always like being able to talk and interact with others and wasn't able to do that at the place"
good,I was on the phone it was a call center.  People were supposed to be calling to get rate quotes and booking car reservations but some people treated us more like 1-900 number operators it was obscene
good,"Working at Avis taught me a lot about the travel industry.  You never knew who you might talk to.  I got a chance to talk to a few well known people, and help with their traveling. Who knew famous people still wanted to make their own travel arangements"
good,good place to work laid back good people the management works with you pay sucks its almost like volunteer work the brain wash you the corporate way try it
good,"Avis is a OK company to work at if you like a fast pace "
good,Car rental  is very easy the upselling can be difficult when they don't give you the necessary vehicles to do so.  there will be some down time and then all the sudden you will get swamped when a big plane comes in
good,Had a fun time with Avis sometime it can be very demanding place to work at but than again the pay sometimes isn’t worth the headache. It’s always a demand with car when there aren’t cars to go around
good,"I did not enjoy my time working for this company. I felt that I  was not appreciated. I gave 100 %of my time, but it was never acknowledged. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Nice job to work at long hours working at the airport, also have good working shoes you'll be standing on your feet for 8 hours. Also you got to watch out for the other employees there they would try to trick you to take other customers who do not want to take upgrades."
good,"Can't speak much to this job as it was a very long time ago. "
good,You work fast paced and the objective is to sale cars to customers and service them. this dose mean if they must return a car you make those adjustments to help.
good,"To much upward advancement based on seniority and not on qualification nor job performance. Company retention level is very low, training is nonexistence."
good,"hung out all day smoking cigarettes and driving cars, washing cars, transporting cars ,  changing out the model cars in lobby and in the parking lot to"
good,it was a learning process. had great co-workers. the manager was kinda uptight but we always pulled through as a team to get the job done for the day.
good,"Went to work with promises of advancement and increased compensation.  Great benefits, but very slow to react to market conditions.  Great concept, but weak execution."
good,The first job I got to experience what it meant to really provide customer service. I started this job straight out of high school. I learned to drive my first oversized vehicle here.
good,the company does not require UAE experience so if you are new in UAE then you have chance to be hired. Reason to leave is that over work load and management is not hands- on.
good,"Much more learnt  in pressure. Friendly and helping Culture. Helpful Management. High load in Chauffeur drive. Great experience in customer service."
good,only was a summer driver. The location of where I worked was good. Manager was nice and coworkers are helpful. I would recommend to someone who wants to have a part time and the job expectation is fair. All you have to do is drive and dont crash
good,Avis was not the main thrust of what we did; an add-on at the end of the call.  The main subject of our calls was not car rental but getting a room booked.  The car rental was an upsell at the end of the call.
good,"While Avis Budget does give great opportunities for salesmen to make sales and connect with new potential clients, the work culture and the treatment by management is truly subpar for a company based in the customer service industry."
good,The management are fair and provide good working environment to all employees.  Salaries are just but long working hours are required and overtime are not being paid fairly to labor workers.
good,Transported crew & vehicles throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. Management was at least adequate. I enjoyed the interaction with others. The culture was fast paced.
good,"a typical dat at work, what you learned, managment, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job and where it all"
good,"Ensure that you're in a secured role and you will never have to worry about looking over your shoulder, unless you aren't performing at all. If you're working in the call centre or as a salesperson in the stores, as long as you do your job, your job is secured. It's a great company to work for with great benefits and decent pay."
good,"Good work place . fun, exciting but tiring and long hours is required. This is a full time workplace and needs more improvement in tha management. God bless!"
good,"I would recommend working here if you get paid enough. You get to meet people, make customers, learn how the computer still run on dos, LOL. It's a learning experience."
good,"in general is a great company for a summer job, schedules are bad and management dont help you accomodate your school/work schedules and time paid is not that great"
good,I assisted in preparing property damage and injury claims documentation for claims representatives. I processed incoming and returned correspondence to include sorting and distributing to the appropriate individual or department.
good,"The people here make your day go by fast. The environment between the drivers and people who clean the cars are family like."
good,"typical day would be opening up , logging onto the systems and start planning the morning ahead . do all morning reports going through them and filing away , answering customer and office calls, getting the cars prepared for the customers and drivers to deliver, plan and send routes for the drivers and giving them the correct paperwork. hardest part of job is being without enough cars/vans to cover said bookings. most enjoyable part is the customers."
good,"I've worked for Avis Budget Group for 4 years. They have great benefits such as health care, dental, vision, and 401K match.This is a fast paced environment where you get the opportunity to interact with travelers from all over the world! Great place to learn customer service skills, sales, and operations. There are opportunities for promotion."
good,somewhat fun place to work at. you get to drive new cars. meet some celebrities when they arrive at the airport. only bad thing was working out in the sun or working when it was cold and rainy.
good,"crecimiento, ventas, habilidades de mkt, es buena empresa"
good,In meiner letzten Tätigkeit bei der ABG war ich zufrieden
good,"I actually worked for Cendant Corporation as a Customer Service Representative. It is no longer in operation. It was an okay job, but I don't really like sales."
good,"Its been a long time but most of the times to deal with union employees was hard but like avis says we always try harder.Had to deal with a lot of absence"
good,The management is very shaky there are days where its great and days where it is not so great. It is very hectic there is no good balance its mostly up and down
good,Willing to let people grow within the company or outside the company. Friendly atmosphere. Management was understanding of developing personally and career.
good,"days can be long, just be ready to wear different hats. You may rent cars, check in cars, clean cars, hike cars from different locations and expect to solve many customer problems in between doing all that. you learn a lot."
good,hectic and busy  the during the winter its dead noone is picking uo but its still alot hectic in the summer time. reservations do not close out causing everyone to panic
good,"This is very similar to the previous position, with the difference being another layer of management above you.  The hours are long, but the people are great."
good,atypical day at work was fast pace. I learned about the vehicles I was work with. Management was great. Workplace culture was great. The most enjoyable part was work with the customers.
good,Renting cars through this company will be fast and easy. Submitting contracts to insurance companies and collecting for fees was the typical day at Budget rental car.
good,Typical day at Work you have 6 people that you manage 3 customer sales representatives and 2 service men that handle the vehicles 1 return check in rep. Your constantly battling rates of all rental car company s and trying to keep all reservations guaranteed by the class car that was reserved. The CSR are great  and supportive as longs as management keeps the lots and reserves of cars on the lot moving smooth. You will experience some rough times during holidays when cars are sold out....also if you work for a stand alone location you have to have cars shuttle to your location which may take hours to receive. the hardest part as a manager is when employees call out.  you have to clean the cars and take care of the customers on line.
good,"Working for Avis was good, that was my first shared service center  experience."
good,a typical work day can be kinda stressful if you don't have cars what I learned is that you should pay attention to any contract you sign management contract there selves when it comes to work place rules the hardest part of the job is not having cars to take care of reservations the most enjoyable day is to make people day with ungrades
good,You work outside all year long and you just clean cars the whole time. The drivers bring dirty cars down to get cleaned and take up clean cars to get rented.
good,"I would to supervise and assist the car washers and check-in agents "
good,"The job was enjoyable learned alot always busy none stop.  Learnt alot in the job when I was there."
good,"A good place to work if you need extra money. The management team is awesome and there isn't any micromanagement. A good second  part time job,however you can not pay your bills off the hourly pay."
good,Good place to get your foot in the door and learn about different pricing strategies and techniques. Not a long term solution and the pay and benefits are good.
good,"Falta motivacion al empleado "
good,Loved the store location and the regular customers that would come into the store. They'd brighten my day and the working conditions were far as I was kept out of direct sunlight.
good,"Me gusta que es un lugar muy relajado, el lugar tiene un ambiete muy bueno, tienes apoyo, el proceso de trabajo es muy rapido y sencillo"
good,"It was ok company to work for. In the customer service department you work independently and learn a lot about currency conversion. When I relocated, I was not told the accurate information to properly transition to the new state."
good,"Exciting place to work. Flexible work position. No pros or cons. Great place to work part time, okay pay. Management was good, and they treat their employees with respect."
good,i would suggest it for anybody who want to gain customer service experience. working here you will be dealing with a lot of customer during your work day and it almost very busy every day
good,Washed rental cars at the airport.  This was an icredibly easy job but was very hot in the summer.  If you can detail cars you can easily do this job.
good,"Checking in vehicles, keeping inventory of vehicles, directing traffic. Job was a stationary position in all outdoor elements. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people."
good,As a dispatcher I would have to check reservation on the computer and the get service agents to clean vehicles. So they can be ready for the customers.
good,"In a typical day I usually do the inventory of all the paper supplies thought out the facility. Call for overtime for the employees that are scheduled to work but did not come in. Call vendors out to fix the facilities where need be, from the gas pumps to broken toilets. Answer phone calls to help with any customer service issues, and solve them."
good,Working for an independent location was nice. Owner was a very nice man. He was the first person to give me a job when I  moved to San Antonio.

good,Transport coordinator ensure the deliverance of vehicle returned to be prep and the readiness of the entire fleet of automobiles including their realignment for customer pick-up.
good,The management was a little sloppy and catty but other than that I enjoyed going to work everyday. The pay was decent and I would suggested working for this company
good,"Já foi há muitos anos atras, não tenho forma de dar um parecer justo e correcto sobre a Empresa"
good,This is an ok company to wok for. I wouldn't stay here forever but It isn't a bad place to start off. Alot of work for a little bit of pay. I wouldn't stay fever.
good,"Though it is an international company, the day starts with lot of pressure due to limited resources.  Often we are unable to meet our target despite my best effort.  My experience with Budget Rent A Car taught me not to offer anything what you cannot meet.  This issue was updated to the management but due to their own reason it was never fulfilled.  The unsatisfied customer and their issue were the hardest part of the job.  But at times,  I learned to deliver more than their expectation."
good,se trabaja bastante bien en el puesto que yo desempeñana pero falta compañerismo
good,"Start at 7.00am. Check in cars which have returned overnight. Check the days manifest/collections, organise and prioritise the delivery and collection of cars for the day. Ensure correct car groups are cleaned and ready for delivery or Customer walking in. Manage Drivers hours, ensuring they are in when required.(Zero hour contract). Always being available to clean cars and be on the road to help when necessary."
good,"Short term position due to me being involved in a serious motor car accident."
good,Cost cutting driven company in a challenging industry.  Company has not been willing to invest in marketing at levels that enable sucess.
good,Very busy and active work environment. Hectic at times with crowds and lack of vehicles. Teamwork is the only way to function in that position.
good,Ok place to work at if you don't mind working with the crazy weather. Ok place to get some customer service experience. they do not really give any chances to grow if thats what you are looking for
good,"was a god experience although I did not really enjoy working here. I was out of my comfort zone and away from family and friends. I feel I was given to much responsibility early on and I was only a student placement. In addition I had to work under 3 different managers in the space of 6 months and this was not good for me, although I did adapt to them."
good,There is room to grow as there is a very high volume of customer satisfaction. I did not work here very long due to a inconsistent schedule.
good,"works well if you are a student and only need part time work, pay is ok, but the hours are long. doesnt work well if you have young children."
good,"I learned a lot from Avis and I loved working with them my day was always enjoyable. I worked with a great team and everyone loved what they were doing, it was a very happy time."
good,Had to work long hours with little or no help. Management was in another state and owned the franchise. Enjoyed helping people who were stranded. Very seldom saw co-workers because of the shifts.
good,"every day is unexpected, fun place to work , get to drive brand new cars every day, can be done for the day by 1pm, great diversity place"
good,working for this company was great. I loved compleating the work orders. braeking down and rebuliding the machines when needed.
good,Management was at times abrasive and unwilling to be flexible. The work was tedious and often under appreciated. Worked in all weather conditions.
good,Ability to negotiate effectively in difficult situations. Able to work with all departments for a effective  solution for all parties involved. Maintain sales goals and performance standards.
good,It was a very low stress job.  Was sorry to leave it but went on to better things.  I was laid off when the center closed.  No possibility of advancement in the job that I was in.
good,"fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally growth and develop. decent amount of politics, but this expected a big company."
good,"Typical Days Varies "
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. decent amoiutn of red tape and politics.
good,"The particular place I worked at had a somewhat negative culture and it was hard to get anything done."
good,"Job wasn't the same every day,different route, how to deal with a whole different customers every day.  Management was balance. "
good,"Fun work place, great team environment if everyone does there part.  Lacking in employees need more workers.  Commission is great if you really try and earn it."
good,Excellent position to gain sales and product knowledge. Managers and fellow employees are helpful with sales and product knowledge training.
good,"As a Rental Sales Agent, I can get to meet different people everyday. I learned to be patient, to listen and do whatever I can for them to enjoy their vacation or to get them where they are supposed to go with less hassle. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes, client and sales people do not see eye to eye, a booking mistake, car availability or a discount not given. But nevertheless, we still do the best we can to give them the best service and experience as our clients.  In our day to day activity my co-workers and I rely on effective communication to have a smooth daily operation. Sometimes there are misunderstandings, but we learn from mistakes. Our manager held regular quarterly meetings to ensure that he hears our concerns, suggestions and extend help as much as he can. Though one of this job's perks is sales incentives, nothing can top the feeling I get when customers are happy and appreciates all our hard work, leaving our location satisfied, even going to our customer service to commend our location."
good,"Finais de Semana eram sempre Cheios, aprendi muita coisa que eu não sabia por exemplo identificar um para brisa trincado com marca de pedra."
good,"A typical day is very active with a variety of skills required.  We have a very happy team and all work together to achieve the highest customer service.  The most challenging part of the job is coping daily with the loss of some of our IT tools, which we rely on to complete our work.  The best part of the job is getting a 10 on our Net Promoter."
good,Typical day of work I will move an average of 40 cars under different weather conditions.  Hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy on a slow day.
good,This job taught me to speak up and take control or a situation and to deal with various personalities of my coworkers. The hardest part of this job were the crazy and unpredictable hours.
good,"Great work atmosphere, just terrible HR team and customers are not friendly when they hear no vehicle is available."
good,I loved working here but it became too far of a commute for me to take on a daily basis. I loved all of the customers. It was a great place to also learn new things at.
good,"The company used to treat people better but, like most companies the dollar takes top billing now. You can still find good locations until some new manager comes in that only cares about their career and saving money. There are good people hear. Pay is not great unless your a Rental Sales agent but then you have to deal with pressure to sell."
good,The service industry is always a challenge but the job itself was very easy. Company laid out guidelines for everything very clearly. Opportunity for advancement was extremely small though.
good,"Avis provided a steady work environment.  I enjoyed working with the other employees.  When I was not working with the vehicles, I enjoyed interacting with the customers that came in.  The most challenging part of the job was the repeated bending over to work on the vehicles.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to visit with the customers when they needed to be shuttled to/from their destinations."
good,The job was indoor/outdoor job experience. this was my 1st management position after college and I absolutely enjoyed it!! Life changes made me leave but if I could I would go back.
good,The most demanding part of the job was dealing with the weather while servicing returning vehicles.
good,Un secteur d'activité complexe qui se révèle très intéressant
good,"Employees are not compensated enough for the work they do. CSR's work outside in the elements, sometimes without proper gear. It's a good job to work while you're looking for something else."
good,A very high paced  and very distinct job. Handling different customer's car rental needs and handling all the operations at the rental counter.  Everyone is easy to get along with.
good,"I was a tow truck driver, easy simple work anyone could do. I drove a tow truck to pick up cars and bring them back to the rental location."
good,"Not enough hours, agencies are independently operated. Wasn't fond of my boss or his policies. Never received full time schedule."
good,"> usually works 7-4 am ,good training ground for customer service,difficult part is handling irate customers and dealing with customers complaints.most enjoyable part is customers interactions everyday single day and treat them the best way you can."
good,"Great co-workers, long hours, learned a lot. Management was not organized and that made it difficult to do my job. We had wonderful customers."
good,this place was okay to work at. there were many opportunities and benefits in place and the coworkers were reliable and nice.
good,"I currently work at Avis Budget group located at Bush Intercontinental airport. When I walk into work on the days I'm scheduled I wonder how the day will turn out. For example; the environment at the airport isn't like your normal local rental car branch, its more of dealing with high end companies that travel all around the world. You deal with all types of people from different countries."
good,My Typical work day is arriving on time with a positive Attitude and ready to work hard.I love learning different things on my job to help me better myself and the consumers.
good,Productive place to work.A place that you are constantly gaining knowledge and always challenged to pursue firther.
good,pleasant place to work at . Great company. Good Management.
good,"At Avis I worked alone and did all work necessary to run a car rental agency. This included answering the phone, creating reservations, renting cars, insuring adequate car fleet, picking up customers, etc. I also kept cars cleaned with updated maintenance. At times this job was extremely busy and stressful which was not enjoyable. At other times things were manageable and I had a chance to enjoy the customers. The best part about Avis was helping people with something as important as transportation."
good,Lots of room for advancement.  The pay is insufficient for the amount of work required.
good,Not a bad job. Met a lot of great people. Learned how to manage staff and how to deal with certain types of employee relations incidents. Loved being outdoors.
good,"Worked with good people"
good,A great experience as a young man learning the rental car business for the first time. I started for parking cars in 1995 to being a Airport Manager in 1997. Went to Oklahoma City in 1997 and at the time they was renting 40 cars a day. When I left in 1999 we was up to 300 cars a day. I love the employees there.
good,"Updating system for vehicles that damaged by renters and sending the claims to a collection agency."
good,"Leading projects at multiple locations in 3 states. Using Lean and Six Sigma, identify opportunities for process improvement, cost savings and revenue generation."
good,its great place for you too learn great customer service skills
good,"the job is fun but, some weeks go by with no work and others go with work every day."
good,"I shuttled cars returned to the rental station as well as detailed.  I feel the management team could have managed better that would have eliminated unnecessary issues.  Overall, the job was easy."
good,It was a very calm place to work at I learn a lot that I could take with me
good,"the training was very rushed  being a fast learner is a plus, be prepared to be hands on as well as computer ready"
good,"Rent cars, schedule employees.  Forcast amount of cars rented every 4 hours.  Review Kronos."
good,High pace environment and team work is a must. If you like cars this is the job for.
good,They worked with me and gave me some flexible hours around school.
good,Boa organização e equipe excelente. Entrei como estagiário e cheguei ao cargo de Agente de Locação Pleno segue algumas funções que realizo na empresa:
good,"people friendly, can brighten a work place up, keep a smile, very hard worker, and will work from clock in to clock out"
good,I absolutely loved traveling throughout the country and training the staff in different hotels. You get to meet so many diverse people as well as the perk of seeing the country.
good,Started off moving vehicles to and from airport as a shuttler. Loved been with co-workers and around managers.
good,nice place to work.  Did not ejoy working outdoors when the weather was bad.
good,Great scenarios to finely tune managerial skill and decision making ability.
good,"A typical day consisted of getting all of the rental trucks prepped for the day.  Which included washing the outside and cleaning the inside and bed of truck, checking the tire pressure and fuel level.  Learned to be fast and efficient with this job.  For the most part all of the co workers got along well.  The hardest part of the job was working both the inside and the outside of the store sometime by yourself."
good,"Great place to work for a part timer or additional income. Bad prospecs for full time employment. Hours were suitable, and location in close proximety. Company atmosphere very downbeat due to the lack of hours involved."
good,"Transfering cars between stores"
good,"You literally have to get customers to buy more than they need or its your job coms the next month's employee review."
good,"collect and deliver rental cars,the rental procedures,good manager,on my own driving,getting around the south west,the driving of new cars."
good,Provided customer service to new and previous customers by setting them up with a rental car that will best suit their needs and at price affordable for them. Assisted in transporting and cleaning vehicles.

good,estuve poco tiempo fue buena la experiencia otro tipo de docuemtnacion archivo y metodo de trabajo
good,"Office was moved from Orlando, Florida to New Jersey following a buyout by Avis.  "
good,cleaning cars and learning different things about each car wether it was a foreign car or not
good,"The only good thing I can say is, the people I worked with were amazing co-workers as well as friends."
good,"Good work/life balance, not much growth opportunity. Good place to start out of college if you have no experience"
good,"Working with Avis was a experience, i love the customer contact but was really upset that i couldnt not have a life outside work. With your hours being based upon whenever a late plane arrives was not so enjoyable"
good,"Checked customers in and out, took payment, verified reservations and identification of customers, helped customers that were unhappy."
good,veru fast pace environment. very busy atmosphere. Great way to deliver good customer service
good,"Providing customers with a pleasant rental experience while obtaining monthly sales goals which includes sales of car coverage, gps units, and xm radio etc."
good,Avis Budget gave me the opportunity to grow with there company for over 7 years.
good,Alot customer interaction and a lot of mutitasking. Ive learned to help customers by listening to their wants and needs to make their rental experience the best one. Management is not the best but my co workers are. The hardest part of the job is fact that the help is limited and the most enjoyable part is putting a smile on my customers face.
good,There is never a dull moment when performing my job.  Plenty of opportunities are available to learn and advance.  I have had the occasion over the past several years to manage various departments that have allowed for me to develop and grow.
good,"Management can be more fair. Pick and choose when they’d like to enforce rules. Unfair to certain people so it seems they’re playing favorites. You have to put your foot down. Great health benefits. Work life balance is good. Need to train employees on professionalism. If Management could get things together as far as fixing issues, it won’t be bad. Employees need to be accountable. Can be Lazy employees. Easy job, can be more enjoyable"
good,a highly demanding and fast pace company that is trying to catch up with the times. only way to get ahead is to put your head down and do the work. cannot fake it there.
good,"very good work compensation overall. horrible scheduling, great customer interaction. okay management. good benefits. Little job security though. constant layoffs."
good,"I enjoyed my time at ABG, especially getting to know so many knowledgeable people who are experts in their fields. It's a complex business, with so many competitors and many challenges. Great stepping stone in the corporate world."
good,Its been so long since I worked there all the people have changed as well as the company name more than once.  It would be really difficult for me to give an accurate review of how they are today.
good,"If you have no work experience this would be a good starting point for you. Depending on your manager you may get paid bi-weekly or monthly. Everything is determined by the manager including schedules, pay, etc. There is a high emphasis on selling insurance here. If you are the manager's only employee get ready to work a day or two by yourself at some point (once again it depends on the manager though). This is not a complicated job and can serve your well especially if you are a student looking for work with a flexible schedule and decent pay for a first time worker."
good,"ottimo stipendio con sacrifici, il mondo dell'autonoleggio è cambiato negli anni"
good,Working here was fun and interesting. The work load could get high at sometimes when traveling increased but other than that it was a nice company to work for.
good,"This job is for a beginning Tech, 5 bay shop.  1 A tech, 1 B tech 3 combo techs.  Advancement is limited and everything is based on seniority.  There is always work. But the potential to grow is limited.  Other than that it's a great company."
good,Es una  buena compañía  que te orienta a la función principal que es trato con el cliente.y sobre como llevar una plática fluida con las personas
good,"As the newest driver I feel very unsatisfied as there seems to be no opportunity to advance to a better schedule. I was hired to work day shift but the week I started 2 drivers left so I was given nights , which was supposed to be temporary, until new drivers were hired. Thast was 6 months ago and still no new drivers. My home, work life balance suffers."
good,"Overall a nice place with lots of fun people to work with, Management is great but unfortunately a lot of turnover. People try their best with what they are given in terms of infrastructure and resources."
good,It’s a pretty good job. Sometimes not knowing how to do something is stressful but overall it’s pretty easy and customers are pretty nice. My bad is great.
good,"a job at Avis will probably just be a stepping stone for the next part of your life, unless you get a management position. Working for Avis isn't bad, but it isn't enough to live on really."
good,All in all it is a great place to start someone's career but can be a bit tricky to be seen as competent means hardwork alone can't cut it.their HR need some changes
good,This company is a fun work environment however no room for advancement. I enjoy working here but it is discouraging not to move up. Benefits are good compared to most companies.
good,"I would assume at larger airports this can be a profitable position, however, small airports and city locations are very slow and boring lots of downtime."
good,sok hasznos tapasztalatot szereztem a munkavégzés során
good,"Hard job for new people, if you have done the rental car thing before then you might be o.k  but if not buckle your seat belts and hang on."
good,I would assist customers with their reservations for vehicles.  Would help with any complaints or issues.  I learned a lot about the sales process in the 3 plus years i was there.  The immediate management team I worked with was great.  At times the job would become stressful when we weren't able to provide vehicles in a timely manner.  For the most part the job was laid back and everyone there was fun to work with a friendly competitive atmosphere.
good,In this company what they taught me is that clients are very important.the hardest thing about this job is cleaning. There's nothing I enjoy about this job..Avis is a nice company but I wish I was something more than just cleaner
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, hicimos hasta un grupo de Bowling"
good,"The company culture was good, their employees were happy as company emphasized on overall good working conditions and morale. However, no career advancement within the HR field."
good,very stressful on a daily basis I did learn to multitask a lot faster my manager was great to work with I guess the hardest part of the position I held was that I wore so many hats for this company felt like I lived at my job  I had to work a lot of hours  I guess I enjoyed that I was able to complete all my daily activities and still make the customers feel special
good,"As a shuttler you are in charge of washing cars from the out side and inside, vacuuming and scrubbing down the car until it's ready for the next customer. You work out side in all types of weather which can be fun or absolutely terrible. I must say the hardest part is the weather, whether it is 100 degrees, snowing, raining, or extremely windy, you are still expected to wash a car and bring it to the the customer within a time limit. The job is simple, yes, and getting the chance to drive and test out the newest cars are fun, but the work load proved to be to much in the heat and rain."
good,"Avis and Budget, in general, is a good company to work for but the problem lies in more of the local setting where you have some higher ups that seem not to care and make the job more stressful.Also, a major problem we have been having is fleet and overbooking.I can't count how many times we turn down customers because people at reservations just kept booking when they knew how dire our fleet operation is at times.The hardest part of my job is sometimes not always having some backup and having to do multiple jobs at once and turning down customers.Despite the things mentioned above my boss is a great person and awesome and fun to work with.Then over the years I have come to build rapport with many customers and have built great business relationships with them and have also met people from all over the world and all walks of life."
good,as we come in to work everyday we get on our van and ride out to the car center at the airport. we would get our assignment and ride in the van to pick up rental cars from different locations.
good,"Decent benefits with the company, the position I am in doesn't offer a ton of advancement opportunity. Company gives a lot of effort to try to be good place to work."
good,"Avis is a fun company to work for. I got to see new cars, and was able to operate them. The only problem at my location was the inventory; sometimes we didn't have enough cars available for reservations, and customers would be upset about that."
good,"Working in the airport, it is a good location where it works to cater for customers requests. However, it is casual so position isn't secured."
good,Good place to work for. Not for the lazy person. Always on the go. Must be customer service oriented. Worked with this company for an overall of 12 1/2 years.
good,"Sell Coverage, Upgrades, Fuel, and Walk-Up"
good,"A typical day at work is to create reservations, open and close them for the most part...i've learned the system and mostly about the insurance world when it comes to cars. I have the best manager in the world, understanding, patient, hard working, flexible. The hardest is to deal with angry customers and also trying to get cars on busy day for reservations. the most enjoyable part is to hear from customers how the customer was like no other and that they would recommend the company to all of their friends."
good,"Clock in and assist customers with their rental cars. I learned how to manage long lines of jet lagged customers. Management is great but does put up with the employees deceiving customers for higher commission. The culture on the floor is not very competitive, but highly toxic. Hardest part of the job was dealing with jet-lagged customers, most enjoyable part was making them leave happy."
good,The typical day was spent taking inbound calls to book reservations for car rentals.  I learned how to sell the product.  The co-workers were very nice and very diverse.
good,AVIS BUDGET  was a great job while I was attending school.  I enjoyed  working with  a variety of customers. Co-workers  were  very helpful. Management was easy to work with.
good,"We had old systems but in some aspect it was good so we had to think more than with better systems, we had to learn to focus on tiny details also to avoid making mistakes. This part was really challenging but i learned a lot.The bad part was that during the end of the monht i had to make too much overtime that i could not gain back after. I liked that the working hours were flexible. One day i entered around 10 o clock, next time before 8 so i could plan programms easily. I made good friends there and the management was easygoing."
good,I worked 40 hours a week maybe a few extra from time to time.  You have to work with the public and all sorts of nationalities and be able to control your emotions if a customer gets irate which has happened on more than one occasion. Their wasn't a lot of controlled communication skills within the company so it was difficult at times to get through when things needed taken care of.  In which most of the time I had to make split second decisions and make things better with the customers and anything that would fall through at the counter.  Co-workers are like any family member or friend you either hate them and put up with them or just go through day to day jobs :).  The hardest part of the job was definitely customer service because we all know that it is hard to please most customers and as we all know customers are always right in the work field even when they're in the wrong.  I did enjoy working with a variety of people within the work place and alway loved my repetitive customers who I always gave a hard time with but they enjoyed it as well. It's always nice to know when to be professional but in order to have a great day you need a little sarcasm as well.
good,Helped customers get the right car for them.  The largest aspect of this job was customer satisfaction.  Staying level-headed and understanding of the customer's problem is something I learned at this job and carried along with me.
good,"First.I've been here in this company for a very long time.Fourteen years.A lot encounter ,from your co workers up to your managers.I can say like this is not the best one.That I am looking.Salary is not the same as your prerformance,the only I can say for enjoyable is nothing.They dont have about sport for the employee."
good,"as a driver you shift around the cars. you take cars to and from production. at production the cleaning crew cleans the interior and parks them when the cars are ready to be put online. once the cars have been cleaned inside you drive the cars through the wash and up to the ready line. you park the car at the ready line and pick up a returned car. with the returned car you take it to production to be cleaned or take it to maintenance to have the oil changed or windshield replaced and other maintenance it needs. "
good,Came in early and left late when asked by management or lead driver. Also came in on days off and others drivers appreciated me helping to put up the slack. Most enjoyable part of the day was working and meeting new people. Conversations with employees and passengers.
good,I gained valuable management experience while being able to implement marketing strategies to expand the business. Most weeks I had to work six days but this is expected with busy rental locations open all week.
good,"ABG is Ok. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Bonuses are cool.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbasdfgbasdfbasdfbasdfbdafbdgsgasdfasdf"
good,The company has its advantages and disadvantages very similar to a lot of fortune 500 companies. Car rental industry can be tough working environment as you are balancing company goals with customer demands. Overall company is very similar with peers.
good,"Interacting with customers on day to day basis meeting all of the needs of our customers in a professional and timely manner. How to comply with all aspects of personalities my co-workers are a awesome team. Dealing with upset customers with different types of personalities, having a great management team."
good,There really is no way to say it's a typical job.  Things change day by day.  Some days we have to many cars.  Others we don't have enough.  As far as dealing with customers in general is easy.  Most of them know what they want or what they are getting. The management for the most part is supportive.  The down side is it is constantly changing when it comes to new rules and what cars you can up sell and which ones have to go immediately.  Hardest part of the job is just knowing what you have and making sure you don't send out the wrong car.
good,"work was always busy, I learned to stay true to myself during the type of work. management was 90% of the time unfocused but definitely done there best . best part was meeting knew faces"
good,"Good place to work, provided staff transportation which gave us a little time to unwind and get to know each other while going home."
good,"aprendí a trabajar con mujeres, crear estructuras para ordenar un dpto. de TI que no existía."
good,My work day started early and ended early. I washed and cleaned in and out cars most of the day. Sometimes I lightly cleaned trucks. I learned there is a fine balance between time and output. Management was always available and busy but strong and ready to give oversight. My co-workers had their own tasks which some were quite complex. They always made time to help one another even though they worked quickly. The hardest part of the job was trying to go to fast and working alone. The most enjoyable part of the the job was pay and free time and talking to my co-workers.
good,"Was happy working at Budget Rent a car, worked with a lot of good people on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job eas providing good quality auto repairs and service in a very short time."
good,"The pay is good, however, they do not promote from within. Managers are not always proactive when it comes to running the business, which has affects the employees and the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for budget, I met people from everywhere and I was able to build my customer service skills up."
good,a lot of cheifs and not enough indians. for the most part managment is good
good,"it was a good working environment."
good,"Greet customers as they return their rental car to our lot. Assist customers with remove of their valuables from the rental vehicle, expediting the conclusion of their vehicle rental experience or simply helping them feel valued while they wait."
good,Assist customers with their rental needs. Upsell company's products and services. Disclose positivly to the customer. Provide great customer service. My coworkers and I were very team players assist eachother when we needed the help. Overall its a great place to work.
good,"Work at Avis Budget is good depending on whether or not you can keep your sales numbers up and are good with customers. There are not alot of opportunities for advancement though. I really enjoy talking with the customers and seeing where they are going and/or coming from. Also, co-workers are great and easy to work with. We have been through a few managers so it is hard to base how management was, but I believe that they are doing what is best for the company."
good,"This was a pretty nice place to work. The management was not to bad, somewhat enjoyable as well as the other employees. Being in an industry where seasons help dictate business always gave you ups and downs with your work load. Some days slammed with customers trying to get a clean car and other days you sit around with nothing to do. The location I worked at was right next door, within spitting distance, to a fairly high class gentlemen's club so there were some perks."
good,"A typical day at work would include such things as: Opening the store, presetting rentals for that day and days ahead, starting duty reports, handling customers from many locations with different needs, providing each customer with satisfaction, and finishing the day with closing out accounts, rentals, a duty reports and sheets."
good,"A multi-cultural work place all races, and an assortment of ages. Nice group of co-workers and mangers are nice. Very intolerant of sick days or unexpected leaves of absence. Benefits are basic."
good,it was ok. i got a steady pay check and they offered a lot of overtime
good,"A typical day at work included data entry, repair appointment scheduling. Interacting with other departments. I learned a lot about the value of vehicles. My manager was a super person. We had a good work-relation. We accomplish many new innovations the company had not encountered prior to our teaming up with creative ideas. My co-workers were basically friendly and hard working people. The hardest part of my job was not being able to make overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing it."
good,"Fast paced work environment which is great makes the day go faster, I meet different people from all over the world and make a connection during the rental process. Co workers are a great part of my day we all work as a team to give the best customer service experience to make the customer feel welcome to our great city! hardest art of the day is the tight day which are wednesdays and we are tight on cars and lines are long. Working great under pressure is a great we all get through it with a smile."
good,Great schedule good coworkers great customers management can be better they do not promote from within they want you to make the company money but don't want you to make much on commission
good,"Excellent company i'm sure.  Fantastic work meeting different people from all walks of life, no 2 days are the same.  Fun and enjoyable work.  Friendly team mates and overall environment."
good,"checking in vehicles and cleaning while watching airplanes take off and land. I learned how to accommodate multiple people in a single shift. management was around relied on managers for certain areas."
good,"Araç kiralamaya gelen misafirleri,araçlarını alana kadar eşlik etmek ve sorunlarıyla ilgilenmek. "
good,Great job to have while going to school. Flexible hours. Work goes by fast due to being super busy. Nice employee discount for all car rental wherever a Avis is located.
good,"Typical day at work is to find client to built company production or revenew. "
good,"If you are an hourly employee, the job is great for advancement and benefits. Management is more stressful and forget about having a good work/home life balance for the 1st 5 years or so. You will be working every holiday, weekend and most evenings until you get some ""seniority""."
good,I would go and choose a bus to drive based on the availability.  I pre tripped the bus.  I would radio the code for in-service and was dispatched out on my drive..  I would either pick up from within the grounds or go to the airport and pick up people from the assigned stop.  I stopped and each terminal stop and picked up people and them took them to Avis' lot so they could rent their cars.
good,"I learned a ton about management, staffing, payroll, and onboarding. the hardest part of the job is the constant overbooking and running the reservations to the edge of the cliff, sometimes to the extent of hoping for a no-show percentage just to get by."
good,"Everything's Great, I Was Just Disliked By The Higher Positions. "
good,Avis Budget Group is place for who is only seeking to work between 08:00 to 18:00 with no rush and no enthusiasm to learn more. Avis Budget Group is rarely doing long term operational leasing around the globe and Turkey is on the list but while most of their competitors are presenting more services to their clients Avis Budget Group remains the same with old ways of doing business.
good,"I enjoy working with customers form all over the world, and I like my coworkers, but the pay is very low compared to other RSAs in the same airport."
good,top sales agent promoted to sales manager. increased sales force and revenue. Grew business and customer satisfaction quotient
good,"this is a fun and productive work place and an exciting place to work..  yje the pay is pretty good also, that's about it.  Responsibilities include the overall management of the car rental operation and its employees at an airport location.  Assist in the management of revenue generated by customer service. Handle scheduling and ensure staffing is at appropriate levels.  Maintain the rental facility and equipment and monitor all conditions in and around the facility.  Implement HR policies in the area of discipline, discharge, motivation and performance in a consistent and fair manner. Build and maintain business relationships to facilitate organizational profitability. Including building relationships with union members and representatives, airport authorities and other occupants of airport facilities, and vendors serving the facility."
good,"I have achieved and gained a lot of experience at avis - lots of new challenges - workin on acc pac - "
good,Fun work place with great customers base. not so professional in the management team. The company has a low turn around staffs.
good,"Some of the managers there just don't understand the we have a life outside of work, if i worked my 8 hours that i am scheduled to do. I should have the right to leave, you cant force some one if they can't stay for overtime."
good,"* A typical day at work would consist of management rushing for vehicles to be done with little to no workers on the work schedule."
good,"This was shift work and slightly different from my career as a buyer."
good,"Fun co workers, great pay, managers were supportive but the hours werent that great."
good,"check my reservations, transferring vehicles, customer service!!"
good,"Buena, agradables porque habia mucho compañerismo, aprendizaje en lo que a mecanica de coche se refiere."
good,"Working at Avis Budget group was alright as I worked in the service bay away from the airport, therefore I rarely had to deal with customers. The supervisor was very easy to work with as I needed to schedule my work hours around school."
good,"Long days, long hours, tough staff.  The managers are nice but the employees are tough to work with.  Say goodbye to your weekends as well, and I've noticed that it is tough to get days off that I want."
good,"This company is a good place of business I like wor"
good,When I first started with Avis it was amazing. Bit over the years there have been ceo changes and local management changes. A lot of stuff has just gone down hill. I stay for the coworkers to be honest. We're not getting paid equally and upper management is aware.
good,"Being a Rental agent I learned how to build report with customers, help them and based on their needs achieve my sales goals. In busy pace environment like airport you learn how to resolve issues on a spot, be creative and deal with high volume stress. "
good,"Management was WONDERFUL. Always worked and supported you. "
good,"I have been working here since a year now, it is a very good part-time job option but I don't see any future in it. management is good  but more work is required for the hourly based salary"
good,"Fun job easy, good hours no stress, but very low pay. Manager does not have a understanding of the experience of the people that working there, they have a lot of senior citizen with large amount of experience from all industry."
good,"Great at recognising employees and providing staff development.  Requires extremely flexible schedule, weekends and holiday work required."
good,Good company to work for with benefits. great extensive training to prepare you for what you will be doing on a day to day basis.
good,"Every Thursday and friday are typical at work,i learned from this day is how to handle a preasure in work,ask their superior they have to listen to my stragety and i also listen their opinion as a team to every transaction we face,the hardest part of the is when where running out our cars if the hotel is busy and they need more cars to every guest needed but we can overcome this kind of problem,beacause every problem have a solution just stay calm on this matter,the most enjoyable part o f the are no delayed salary and accepting bonuses."
good,"The working environment is good, the sales team and seniors are very cooperative. the only drawback is the social life in saudi arabia (rules and regulations)."
good,"great place to work, have in it to win it attitude it will get you far. pay isn't the best but company car is a plus. 10-12 hour shifts only paid for 8 hours"
good,"Though it is a daily grind like most jobs can be, the people make the difference. The culture is wonderful. The care within my location makes the job more than just about punching a time clock... people genuinely care about each other."
good,"Work mostly consists of creating contracts for customers and placing them in a vehicle car class previously reserved. And bringing in customers without reservations. "
good,"My shift started at 6am and lasted until 2pm.  It was nice to have almost a full day to complete personal business after leaving the job."
good,"An 8hr work day could somtimes turn into a 12hr work day,for the most part everyone got along quite well with one another I for one am a pretty laid back employee that wants to make the day as stress less as possible,although that's not always the case,but you learn how to handle any and every situation."
good,"   A typical day at work was taking a large volume of calls in relation to car hire in Australia and overseas also took reservations for car hire via email and fax. While working in the corporate car rentals for Avis as a account manager I made numerous outbound phone calls to our corporate clients to touch base and to see if they required any additional information relating to their car hire needs."
good,There a good company to work for overall. I only quit because i moved back to co and there was no job openings for a transfer back
good,"You get to meet a lot of people from different parts of the and the US. "
good,"I left Budget/Avis in 2009 when they actually merged with Avis. They wanted to make the company one with its employees, with 2 different unions. They took away benefits from new hires. The incentive program when I started was great but over time they started making it difficult for you to meet sales goals."
good,Very easy and a good temporary job to have to pass time while you are in school are have some free time to yourself. Definitely reasonable pay fpr what you have to do.
good,"Good place to work to get money and enjoy what you do without the headache at the end of the day. Great coworkers, brand new vehicles to drive, steady schedule."
good,I loved working there for the time that my hiring manager was still employed. He made the work place wonderful and knew the boundaries between friend and supervisor. The rest of the company once he was gone was very greedy and always wanting more sales I quit once he was fired and don't regret it one bit.
good,This job requires 200 percent towards sales and customer service. Training takes one month minimum to complete depending on the agent. Management takes care of their employees.
good,fun workplace with spanish becouse I was the only filipino worker.the  manager and suppervisor treat us pear and all coworker are all friendly.
good,A Great Company with great benefits and major advancement opportunities. This Company has been expanding in the past years which creates a great sense of Job Stability.
good,"I work 3 days a week over night shift, I handle late reservations, return of cars, and paper work from the days reservations. the hardest part of the job is not having the available cars that customer request because we have sold out. I enjoy the co-worker that I work with ,have learned a lot from her."
good,"Avis Budget Group was an exciting and enjoyable place to work."
good,I loved working there however I was sexually discrimminated against as soon as I got pregnant. By not being given the position I was promised and being kept at a position that payed less. 
good,"Responsible for greeting customers, processing rentals and selling optional services, answering and routing incoming calls telephone calls, through a multi line system. Demonstrated ability of multi tasking in a high volume call center setting. Also responsible of up selling of various service packages including extended insurance polices and upgrades on vehicles and warrantees."
good,"busy mornings always, i have just learned that customers'interests comes first regardless of their social affliations, beliefs,culture and race. Inspiring management,strictly but more fair and so motivational. have sometimes differences when pressurized but wonderful co-workers cause at the end of the day we celebrate our achievement. the hardest part is when we are on stop sale( no cars)for customers that do not have bookings cause they believe we are the best rental company with lot of cars. the most enjoyable part is when the customers are all covered from 07h30 to 09h00 and when there are lot of cars in the yard,however full of learning from other people"
good,After seeing the post for a CSR at 50 to 60 K a year it would fall in line with what I was making with my previous employer that went out of business. So I applied and was hired and after a week of training I was placed on the sales team and I'm having alot of fun renting cars. However the pay is no where what they promise in the initial post. Salary is minimum wage plus commission and I can't see how anyone except the manager can make the 50 to 60 k that was advertised in the job posting
good,"Buena compañia,pero la paga es muy poca,se trabaja tranquilo ,buenos beneficios, los, tienen que aumentar el salario por que es muy poco lo que pagan  deberian"
good,"Ambiente internazionale e stimolante, alte prospettive di avenzamento carriera, premiato il merito"
good,"My experience at Avis Budget Group for the last six years was of great contrast. I enjoyed the work environment with my direct manager and fellow auditors, it was a pleasure working with them as part of team. I was also pleased with the job I performed as an Senior Internal Field Auditor. Unfortunately there is a lack of opportunity to move ahead and build a career within the company. The compensation is also lacking."
good,"Creating reservations/bookings for clients,amending,modifying and selling of additional products that client are unaware of,confirming account information ensuring clients get exactly what they asked for"
good,The job its self was no bad and the people were great but the management was not the greatest. The lot managers were great but the upstairs managers make working this job difficult and disappointing.
good,I love helping customer and making someone else smile. I enjoyed being a team player.  The hard part of the day is helping someone that is angry and you are trying to put a smile on there face
good,"i had so much fun in travelling provinces.i love travelling that is why i really enjoyed my job, my family understood when i was not at home because they knew my job was demanding,i have learned that working with people i need to be transparent and be a team player."
good,"This company had great benefits for their employees."
good,"This company has a website that leads customers to think that they are getting a specific car, with specific features and accessories when they get to the counter. Even worse, when they call our help hotline they are not up to date with how things are actually ran so they tell them they will get everything they want when they get to the counter as well. Everything saying that we do not guarantee features or accessories is in the fine print and no customer has ever noticed it when making a reservation. This may be great for the company because it helps them get the sale, but the problem is in actuality is that WE DO NOT GUARANTEE FEATURES OR ACCESSORIES and the majority of the time, you don't get them even if you request them because we have a mixed fleet of cars and we have to work with whatever we have right there and then when the customer arrives.This means that if you booked a car with ski racks and four wheel drive, you are not guaranteed any of that and now you might not fit your skis in the car, and you might get stuck in the snow and ruin your vacation. This situation happens VERY OFTEN and it results in being screamed at by customers at least four times a day, sometimes 20 times a day. It doesn't matter how nice you are, or how hard you try to help the customer, you can't give them what you don't have and they do not like that AT ALL."
good,A typical day at Avis Budget Group is a busy.  The job will typically get very busy before big events such as the Super Bowl or weather related events due to the nature of the job (pricing and yielding).  I learned a great deal at Avis Budget Group.  I was able to walkaway from Avis as an expert in financial modeling and gap analysis.  My management skills also improved and played a big role in landing a higher paying job.  The hardest part about the job is knowing that the job does not pay that much and can be very busy at times.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the work atmosphere.  Management is very friendly and approachable.
good,Avis (DIA) is a good place to work if you have drive and ambition. The benefits are great and FMLA is an easy process.
good,"12 hour shifts, no days off "
good,I was lead driver over on overnight so i had to transport my drivers from base to the airport to either drop of cars or pick them up to take them from base back to the airport.
good,It started out great tell my bosses daughter are assistance manager was shooting heroin and doing drugs and other co-worker was saling out of are wash shop. So I went to the owner and let them know what was going on cause i didn't want them to loss there business so they fired the assistance manager and other co-worker. when the boss found out it was me i was out sick the next day she called me in and told me then didn't need me anymore and i know it was cause her daughter was let go and i was the reason. This was the most shadiest place i have ever worked at.
good,"this could be a very good job, but the company has changed the environment to a sales position with quotas. Instead of servicing the customer, the agent has to watch his back."
good,"Work itself is not bad but what makes it overwhelmingis the fleet!"
good,"the only bad thing is the manager doesn't want good employees to stay, so he can steel as he want, however the work is fun because you can meet many people from different countries."
good,"inserirsi in un ambito diverso, impararlo, padroneggiarlo, essere gratificato per il rendimento di livello, per poi essere scaricato dall'oggi al domani..."
good,"Working for Avis was a fun experience. Enjoyed working with the people that I worked with. The worst part was working out in straight sun, no shade what so ever. Had to wash cars everyday out in that heat and when cold fronts came through we had to wash cars in the freezing cold, it was not fun!"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is we were a big family. the hardest part of job was dealing with the spreqdsheets.
good,My first job in the UK.Was prepared to work at any job to start earning an income and not be a burden on my wife and society.That stage did not know how to seek sales positions so worked at what I could find.
good,"Working at Avis I became a better driver, I helped my higher ups if they needed help. and enjoyed my co workers. I encouraged a get it done now then wait till later type of energy. and everyone co workers or customers were really nice."
good,Had an awesome time working here. Joy rode every single car whenever/wherever. Management was nonexistent 90% of the time which gave plenty of time to run errands and take care of business.
good,When a call comes through to drive sometimes we only have 15 or 20 minutes to reach the yard in town where the cars are and then we receive the keys and paperwork from one of the customer service agents.  We then drive the cars to whichever destination we need to and are then picked up by another driver and driven back to our original starting point.  Great views and each drive is different.  Hard conditions in winter over the Alpine Pass but who doesn't enjoy a challenge.
good,It was rather difficult to work alone all the time with the many tasks I had to endure on my own. And I didn't really like cleaning cars in the cold. But I did get to learn some interesting things like how to use a command based computer system.
good,"filing papers, answering phone, faxing."
good,"At a shift, I would typically clean cars nonstop for up to 4 hours, and then I would have to drive to and from the airport car park with clean and dirty cars to continue cleaning. There were rules and guidelines that had to be followed, which is expected at any job. However it is only casual work, as as i have graduated school, i am looking to start an apprenticeship."
good,"dodgey management, Good solid aussie company, good to work for, late nights, early mornings but if you can sell ice to an eskimo you can make a decent wage."
good,If like to hard this is not the place for you. Other people there ward less and get paid more than they should and management knows about it but does nothing.
good,My typical day at work was simple detailing vehicles. I learned that business is very important on the job. The management was fair. My co-workers were cool people. The hardest part was the weather. The most enjoyable part was payday.
good,"Checking in customers as they returned their vehicles. I picked up my people skills from this job due to the amount of people I encountered in a day of work. Management was not that great. The hardest part of the job was the weather, but the best part of the job was helping those that appreciate the help."
good,"My day starts with a pre-shift meeting, telling us how many cars will be in & out off the airport. Management needs more managerable skills. The hardest part of the job is when we're over booked with reservations. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer is satisfied."
good,"Ok job very slow and boring "
good,Early start; easy workload; not a lot of stress. They allow time for lunch daily and are quite agreeable to altering individual work situations when the employee needs adjustments.
good,"very corporate, no give in personal situations, not flexible in hours as far as weekends.  Pay is very commission based and reviews and raises are based on sales and numbers."
good,Was leuk als bijbaantje om wat bij te verdienen voor het weekend.
good,"I would come in on the week ends which was nice since I had school. I would get in, do all of my responsibilities, and get out. I got payed per car I took care of."
good,"Because I love to interact with people, I've always liked my job very much.  "
good,Great environment love the customers and co workers a real joy to be apart of the culture there. I gained a lot of experience and came across a lot of different walks of life.
good,"Out and about delivering and collecting cars."
good,"I started working in 1986 as a service agent to bus driver to rental agent Agency operator former employee @kc ,mo good people there but moved to diffrent state, family issue came back again worked for an Agency operator learn lot in kc,mo,i have always worked hard ,enjoy customer service ,earned letter of my good service from customers .i always try harder ,Try to come up with ideas and more but you cannot reach to the top people in HQ,Applied again for A/O never given 2nd chance because of my credit ,but this company will hire somebody from the street and give them loc who dont have any exp about car rent .but not give 2nd chance to a person who has the best record with revenue /numbers just because credit ,i know some good RA agent who were not given chance for A/O because of credit but new people from the street left the store mess , and again they will hire someone from the street and a mess again, i wish the top people will take a second look on their policy for agency operator,this company logo WE TRY HARDER will go far better and if they listern to the Agency operators ideas,i am still work for An Agency operator and waiting to see if this company bosses will do something or hear my more stories and ideas thanks"
good,Works hard and repetitive have to be detail oriented work outside learn a lot about driving and time management. Checking when supply need ordered and  judging on if a car is save or not to drive
good,"de acuerdo a los horarios, en este trabajo se puede ir modificando la hora de ingreso, aunque no dan permisos para hacer tramites importantes y personales, se puede modificar la entrada y salida del lugar de trabajo."
good,Great job if you like working face to face with your customers.  I worked at the airport and enjoyed meeting people from aqll over the world.  Long hours and on your feet the whole shift.  The pay was not good enough for the job.
good,"The store is kind of large and small, has a crew room with a couch, and a table for eating. Also the store has a kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, microwave, and a small washing machine for the towels. Plus 2 offices 1 for the manager and 1 for the owner, also a stock room for cleaning materials and other things. But the store I work at has really old and dingy carpets also. The store has a shed for all the cleaning materials to clean vehicles."
good,"The Avis and budget I worked for in San Ramon was independently owned , so speaking of my experience I can only vouch for this specific Avis and budget group ."
good,It is a great way to learn about business and learn how to work on your own. There isn’t much room for growth and I’m ready to keep moving up so I’m ready to move on
good,its ` fast growing company with great benefit but management is very poor. Friday Saturday sundays are busy days hard to arranged car with fleet. hard to work with fleet. always make mind which cars to which cars save. what time what we need what we don't. always prepare. make up your mind early morning reservation and 3 days ahead reservation. 
good,"A typical day in the office changes by the minute.  A lot of meetings and little time to actually do work.  Timelines are very aggressive and IT is the main focal point that drives the timelines.  "
good,"management is good. they care about their employees. i learned a great deal at this job. it is a very customer oriented job. customers come first. the hardest part about my job was the weather. i worked outside and i had to deal with extreme hot, cold, wind and rain."
good,Layer back experience if shuttling vehicles but the washbay is hectic because of high volume of washes to be done. Facility is good though and people are friendly with good hours to work. Salary is poor because of basic skill needed to gain employment.
good,"8 hours a day job.  Learn about different type of cars, there benefit and features.  Attended the front counter direct sales and customer service for there clients.  90% of manager were great.  Hardest part of job was to joggler my personal life with that of the work.  The most enyoyable part was the selling. Love to be able to sell."
good,Nice place to work for bachelors. Helpful administration.very supportive co-workers free transportation and free accommodation.
good,"Avis is a great company but theres' a cost in management. Perks free company car, free gas, (no car insurance or car note). The work hours are long due to airport transportation so Avis never closes. The company cares so much about the customer, instead of their employees. The company shows employee appreciation near voice of the employee survey time (kissing behinds). Potential to move up is slim due to you having to brown noise multiple hire ups which says... ""your making your brand"".  I have learned that its important to appreciate your employees as well as your customers. Your employees are your first customers, it cant operate without them. The most enjoyable part of the job were the perks."
good,"Productive on a daily basics."
good,Budget Truck Rental/Maintenance Shop is a very fast paced company.  The sense of urgency is needed when dealing with servicing/repairing trucks.
good,"fair job fair environmentMicrosoft Office Professional Suite"
good,"Decent job, not really a brain using job. just stay busy management is really dumb"
good,great job to bad hurricane candy came around. i learen alout about customer service and helping them out anyway possible
good,This was a fun place to work no 2 days were ever the same.  The work-Life balance was as good as it possibly could be.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, com ótimas referencias. A Principio com chances de crescimento, porém depois não ocorreu."
good,"I call customers to get their orders for our products, which is the most enjoyable part of my job. My co-workers are great. Fun place to be. Management is ok I feel its very micro managed."
good,A typical day at work was picking up cars from different locations. Being a Rover which was when cars returning I would print out a receipt and give to customers. Being an Expeditor I would help customers check out cars for any damages on vehicles and give them any information they wanted to know.
good,"Beaucoup de stress :"
good,Micro-management at every level. Lead Driver was a hot head with poor management and people skills. Company had no perks or benefits and poor working conditions.
good,"Avis is a good company to work for, however unless you really love being on your feet the entire day, I would recommend any position besides the service agent. That said, between the service agent or working in a warehouse I would take the service agent all day. Days can range from pretty short to grudgingly long, with mandatory overtime."
good,Job is very casual and easy-going the incentive is pretty low and the pay is low! I’ve only been there about a month and they treat me like an old timer!
good,No work life balance. Not allowed to take days off in summer at all. High turn over due to poor management and not valuing employees. Very cliquey and lots of office drama but good pay if you work hard and get good numbers.
good,"Eight years ago, when I began with this company, it was great.  But, as cost of living and prices have increased, it has become both much less satisfying, and less enjoyable.  Customers are a nightmare now.  Car rental rates finally increased after 20-30 years.  It made people angry, and they take it out on those on the front lines - us reps.  I am exceptional at customer service, one of the best (I say this without ego), but because of the rapid decline and shift in customer mentality and attitudes, I no longer want to work in customer service."
good,"The best thing about this job is how quickly you qualify for benefits and the fact that there is support for any question that you have. Sometimes, it felt like the company was quite disorganized, like the left had didn't know what the right was doing, and the job can be super stressful because the company is making changes to the way they approach customer service and reservations, so there's cross training and all of a sudden you're supposed too know everything which resulted in longer call times as customers could call with a complaint, a reservation, and an in depth question."
good,"I learned management and within that there was communication information for speech and hearing-impaired customers, filing an incident, accident, or stolen vehicle claim. I enjoy working at Avis-Budget, but I am looking for something with benefits. You can't make any commission and there is not any benefits for a part time employee. The hardest part of the job is getting out in the cold and rain. The most enjoyable part or the job is meeting customers. Every customers had their own uniquie  ways. There are some much that I have learned from this job and I really thankful for having a job but I just need something better."
good,"Clock in @ 7 am , wait for flights to land for customers to come. check all the cars on the lot, and make sure keys are accessible to rent vehicles out. Be ready to rent out multiple vehicles at at a time, while also checking vehicles in."
good,"Avis Budget Group has been great to me over the last year and a half. It's been a good job while in school, but I need something more serious. Avis Budget Group offers good pay and flexible hours. It's perfect for a second job or a job for a student."
good,"Busy seasons are hectic, you only get help from others in the company when you have been there a period of time. Not organized as far as fleet distribution."
good,"Depending on how big your location was managers were non-existent. Most of the problems have to be dealt with you personally. They're easy, so i thought. My location consisted of an older generation with many complaints. Overall, Management catered to the older crowd because of ""Seniority."" I worked the 3-12pm shift and let me tell you, don't expect a social life after this. Overall its hourly with commission INCENTIVES. So selling is a big deal. If you love learning about cars THIS JOB IS YOUR JOB!"
good,Never ending weeks on call 16 hours a day.  Benefits were really good but PTO hard to take and pay never commensurate with the hours you are expected to be available.

good,"great place to advance your career. they believe in promoting within, management listens to employees concerns and follows up with staff"

good,"The main supervisor is very demanding. "
good,"It is a good place to work most days, but the location that I am employed at constantly overbooks on reservations, prioritizes the Avis lot over the Budget lot in terms of stocking cars.

good,"O ambiente de trabalho é bastante amigável, aprendi bastante sobre o dia a dia da área administrativa / back office de uma organização de tal porte. A gerência é bastante participativa e há uma ótima relação entre os membros da equipe. O fato de ajudarmos as lojas com a manipulação do sistema, com a aplicação dos procedimentos internos e solução de problemas era uma das partes mais agradáveis do trabalho. Entretanto, conseguir manter os números de pendências baixos era a parte mais difícil do trabalho."
good,A typical day would be going into work and the car group customers reserved not being there and having to explain the mix-up as to why the car isn't available. Working with my co workers is probably the best part of my job because of the different backgrounds and you learn something new everyday.

good,Seeking a position with a stable company with room for growth and opportuinty for advancement
good,"I love this company"
good,the job is simple drive around the airport terminals picking up passengers.
good,"A typical day here would consist of washing/detailing the outside/inside of rental cars "
good,"I did like to work at this place, the place as a whole was just me an the manager, the manager was very controlling and always on you even when things were perfect, the manager also wanted us to do things that were not in the job description which I had no problem with, the pay was only part time, the work was the simple, it was a good working environment but needed a little improvement."
good,Everyday was different.Working in an airport it was nice getting to meet people from different countries or just to learn why people are traveling that day.

I learned how to bond with customers and staff, putting business practices to life, how to be the best team player possible, and facilitating all company methods and practices as well as my own to generate revenue for my location but most important for the company. I am team player first, a good leader knows when to listen to his people and employ a educated decision to lead them to positive results. My co-workers are great. Just like a team or family you will have your rough times but the best thing about that is that you learn from whatever mistakes were made and you rectify them so it does not happen again. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your composure through thick and thin situations. A level head is key because you are the leader and you have to lead by example to maintain integrity of yourself and staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is that seeing the hard work of your team comes together for positive results!"
good,Bella veramente bella azienda seria e competente personale preparatio
good,"I worked for avis budget group for 2.5 years. It was rewarding to make customers happy and I was constantly praised for the amount of new clientele that became regular renters at our location. The most rewarding job I have ever had, and the most appreciated I have ever felt as an employee."
good,The work culture is similar to any other work place.  You have your good and you have your bad.  Some managers will inspire you while others will just use you if you let them.  Know your own limits of what you are willing to take.
good,If the managers cared the employees would have a different work ethic. The managers are unfriendly. They don’t care about their customers nor employees.
good,"The place is fast paced and you have to think on your feet.Must be a team player and willing to learn."
good,"Kein Kommentar,  jeder muss seine Erfahrungen selbst sammeln"
good,"il lavoro è molto interessante e vario, consente di imparare moltissimo e di stare a contatto con molte differenti persone in molti ruoli; il management è però poco preparato ed improvvisato, dato che i vertici preferiscono ""yes man"" operativi a qualsiasi ora di qualsiasi giorno. C'è troppa competizione e poca collaborazione tra colleghi."
good,It was great had a great time with the people I worked with. I drove cars back and forth to different Avis franchises. Learn how to do simple maintenance with vehicles

good,"Avid was a good company to work for, I believe still is."
good,The location that i worked out was actually very good. The manager was very easy to talk to and if he had a problem he would come talk to that particular person.
good,This company worked out good for me. I started in the 11th grade and it improved my customer service and driving skills tremendously. I met a lot of different people from different parts of the world and enjoyed every second of it.
good,there is not much to say is that they have very good management team and the environment is very good and fast pace as well. it  a fun place to work and to learn on the job
good,I learned a lot about providing excellent customer care while working here.  There never was a typical day at Budget Rent A Rent.  Enjoyed working in a fast paced environment.
good,"Avis/Budget Group is a family orientate company. I loved working there and would recommend it to any friend or family member. The pay is decent, but not a lot of benefits are available for the position i held."
good,Great international feeling to work at the airport
good,"Although it may be a great place to work at, the need to compensate still has a bit to be desired. Overall, as you move up in rank compensation does not keep up with the additional responsibilities you take on. Overall, supervisory management compensation needs to be tweeked in accordance to the responsibilities given. Once corrected the appeal of working here would draw more talent and provide a better qualified pool of candidates to choose from."
good,"This was a great learning experience as it was my first job out of college.  I learned about both the Accounting and Finance fields, especially being involved with International divisions for the company."

good,"If you like driving a different car every day & driving around & though the city this job is for you ,but after awhile you get tired of seeing the same places all the time"
good,Great benefits.  Room for promotion.  Pay sucks.  Lay offs come around often.  Other than that it's a good company to work for.  Company morale is high.
good,drive from rental to another cities to drop off rental car then join group in Van to return back to rental place to pick another rental car to drive to another rental place to drop it off as daily
good,"The travel industry is fast paced so it can be high stress or a lot of fun. Your team can make or break your experience. With an extremely high turnover rate, my experience with this company quickly shifted from fun and fast paced because of the customers and coworkers to sour, slow and stressful because of the lack of help and poor management. The job is not bad or difficult to do. The company just needs more reliable people to hire in and stay to make everyone's job a lot smoother. Avis needs solid team players and it could easily be one of the best places to work hands down."
good,Fun place to work high paced and fun people. I loved the challenges and i love love loved my manager/s. I learned a lot working here i loved everything about my job description and my schedule. I also learned so much.
good,"hourly rate is fixed and weekly hours are guaranteed. Too many bosses and immediate supervisor is good. "

good,Family oriented and great work culture. Friendly managers willing to help each department out. Effective team work to help ensure operations run as smooth as possible.
good,"The job was easy enough and fun to do. The Friday lead driver was a control freak who was afraid to let anything out of his hands until the last second. There was no team work with him, it was all his commands, you obey. If you questioned his methods or, God forbid, had a thought of your own, it was wrong because he did not give it to you.  Nearly as bad as Marine Corps boot camp!!"

Other than that the job in my opinion was easily handled on a day to day basis.

In my opinion this is one of the best method of learning ( learn by practice ). My job is an individual one, but i can say the other coworkers are great. "

good,"This job was very fast-paced and I enjoyed being able to meet people from all over the world. I was taught how to work on a code based computer program and rented cars to multiple people. The hardest part of the job was having to tell people we did not have their car available because the entire district ran out of cars, or having to switch them into something else that was not reserved. The most enjoyable part was the people I met and the relationships I built with customers."
good,I enjoyed this job until the office where I worked in Downtown Montgomery was moved to the Airport area. That was much further to drive and I looked for a closer job.
good,Amazing area to work and learn. Had a great manager that was patient enough to teach me how to manage and construct contracts for rentals for who ever came in need of a vehicle. I handled accounting here as well and manged many phone calls to keep every vehicle in order for rental.

good,"I really enjoyed going to work at A.B.G.. The staff was very friendly. Everyone was more than happy to help. The one thing I did not like, was being led on that i was being hired on. Following my probation to a key. Just to be laid off along with five others, after the busy season. Being told they hired to many people. If a company if hiring season or temporary help. That should be in he description."
good,Nice steady job. Great benefits. The pay is lower than average and not a very good. You may work an odd ball schedule like nights and weekends. Its very corporate and seem to pay based on productivity but more for how long you've worked there.

good,"Must be able to work with large union environment "

With that in mind, I have had to tell a few people at midnight that night when every flgiht had landed that I didn't have a car to give them. After a day of traveling, most people are pretty upset at that. I can't blame them of course, however I hated being the person that had to tell them that there was no way I could help."
good,Very Busy Environment but the most enjoyable part of the job is I love working with my co-workers.
good,It's not a bad place to work. Just needs to be organized and I believe shuttlers should get paid a better pay rate.

good,This was a really fun place to work and offered many travel benefits that I had and did take advantage of.  I learned a lot from the organization and was able to apply that to the jobs that I would have in the future after my time there.  The management was reasonable and fair most of the time.  My co-workers were great and I was able to establish bonds that have lasted a life-time.  The hardest part of the job was trying to live on the small salary.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fantastic travel benefits that we had.

good,"A typical day at work is fun but boring. I have learned how to tolerate better the different personalities people have and how to manage the issues they may have. Management is not hands on, the management team is more concentrative on numbers than on the daily operations. I enjoy my co-workers. We work together as a great team fir the most part. The hardest part of the job is the boredom that insues between the arrival of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting and meeting people. Making them smile whenever I can letting them know our company appreciates their business, and invite them to return soon."
good,Es una empresa donde tienes oportunidad de aprender mucho
good,The company have good benefits and paid vacation but lack communication between managers and staff. Can be very unorganized which is a personal  pet peeve! Good job for someone just entering workforce. Locating parking for your personal car has been challenging.

good,Working at Avis was busy.  It is a fast-paced place to work where you have to think on your feet.  It's not always non-stop but it is a place where you don't have to worry about being bored.  Sales associates deal with goal to be reached daily as well as making sure every client is satisfied.
good,One of the best companies I ever worked for .. But on the longterm; career advancement is very difficult. People are friendly and Teamwork is there and improving.
good,Overall the Avis Budget Group is a good company to work for. It is an equal opportunity employer and it provides a positive work environment for almost anyone. I personally like that you have the opportunity to communicate with people of all ages and nationalities.

good,"Its always an advantage to work here as I can learned a lot of things as we always have the training regarding the new system. up to date events, I can encounter different types of people and most of all i can meet and greet the CEO of the biggest company, celebrities. "
good,"The work is easy, pay is decent, people working there are great. scheduling goes by seniority so you might not get the schedule you’re looking for. When busy they will force 2 hours overtime if they don’t have enough cars."
good,"Company is very operational. The focus on operations makes it hard for leadership to see what is happening with the customer and consumer trends.  Overall, if you are operationally focused this is the place for you."
good,"A typical day was coming in, signing into the system, checking emails for updates, and responding to customers via the ticketing system. "
good,"Large call centre, flexible scheduling, great performance perks, benefits, regular performance reviews, interesting customers, approachable management."
good,Company was in transition breaking off from it's parent company. Wasn't sure of the stability of the company and was working part time somewhere else. Was given a full time position so left

good,"Good place to work if your number one focus is a good work life balance.  Probably not the best place in terms of rapid career advancement, but that could have changed with the new CEO"
good,Friendly environment outgoing one on one no intimidating job description very clear. Peers help each other when needed making sure all cars were ready for when the clients applied for the rental service.
good,I worked a lot of hours and mandatory overtime I took sometimes 300 calls a day. Management was very helpful. I enjoyed working there but it did get stressful at times
good,"Great place to work, but is real hard work."
good,"We aim to add value at every customer interface and try to live up to the ""We Try Harder"" motto. There is always something new to learn within the company and the industry.

The most enjoyable part of the job is finding a solution to a problem with the assistance of helpful colleagues."
good,This is a company that has grown so much in sales.  Benefits packages are extremely good for the employees.  Work pace is very fast and requires a lot of time and effort.
good,"You will do the same things everyday. Very easy work in the winter time. Not much to do but during the summer time it is really hard work. its a no stop job, always something to be doing. the only downside to working with the company is sometimes the management. They really lack communication. You will be told many different things  from different managers. Non of the managers are on the same page. but other then that. its a fun and enjoyable place to work. the people there are amazing, you become like a family and it shows."
good,"A typical day consists of preparing vehicles to be rented in a ""brand new"" condition. Specific tasks are detail cleaning, vacuuming the inside, and washing the outside. Meanwhile also being prepared to walk inside and provide professional service."
good,"I work with a great group guys in the plain district! I had the best District Manager in the country who truly cared for me and my career. I work with a great of guys in my territory with an average tenure of 15 years. My territory had the highest grossing revenue for 2014,2015,2016."
good,A part time position cleaning rental cars inside and out. Work was outside only 365 days a year. The employer provided all necessary clothing to combat extreme weather conditions (rain and snow). Worked with some very nice people. Training was performed by another worker which lasted one day. The hardest part of the day was all day. Not afraid to work hard but at 65 years old it took its toll. There was not much enjoyable about the work other than it was steady.
good,"Ensure customer service quality for all customers. Prepare the vehicles for high volume renters. Inventory vehicles hourly to minimize customer wait. Interact with the customers to ensure their service standers. Process the return rentals in a high volume location. Direct customers to reserved vehicles and assist with all customer inquiries.

good,"I loved this job, and miss my coworkers, and the atmosphere at San Francisco Airport.  Its hard work, but, the friendships, and situations we encountered on a daily basis made it a great place to work.  I met dozens of celebrities, including John Belushi, Dennis Quaid, Kefer Sutherland, Paul Simon, Randy Savage (Macho Man, a wrestler), etc.  Many gave us tickets to events.  I also got autographs from Barry Bonds, (S.F. Giant) who is notoriously fan unfriendly.  Kirstie Alley has beautiful hair (who knew?) and Robin Williams was a regular as he owned a home in the East Bay.  I could go on and on..."
good,Good people low pay.  Fun to work at but many hours for low pay. Many people have to work a second job to make ends meet. Company however is very well organized and continually trying to evolve to keep up.
good,Avis  Budget Group is a great place to work and learn. You always get to learn new technologies and brings out your analytical abilities. The work culture is pretty much balanced.
good,"Avis Budget Group (ABG) is a large car rental company with locations EVERYWHERE. For management personnel at airport car rental locations, there is a very solid management training program that really helps get your feet wet so that you are not trying to lead blindly. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is the vehicle perk. Unlike many other car rental companies, management at ABG are able to drive larger sized SUV's like Grand Cherokees and Ford Explorers. Not having to worry about gas, car insurance or car taxes is awesome too. There is a cost to all of this though... Work days are a mandatory 10 hours/day, 5 days/week and if you're working evening shifts, it is very difficult to leave before putting in 11-12 hours. Since you are management, there is no overtime either."
good,"Meeting customers expectations on good quality service, also I learned being reliable & honest cause dealing with this company it was all about honesty due to people belongings getting left behind in vehicle's. So it was our job making sure we turn in their property to lost & found. My day basically consist of non stop detailing cars, trucks, vans & SUVS maybe sometime around the day or night it'll slow down depending when flights landed at the airport, because we were located at the Lansing city capital airport in Michigan."
good,"fun, fast pace location. lots of customers coming from different parts of the world. providing excellent customer service everytime i work. "
good,"ABG is OK to work for, but the need to hire more employees.  They work employees to hard.  What I mean is to much overtime (employees working 12 hours a day, or 7 days a week,  employees get burned out). They sometimes forget about the employees."
good,Great sales and customer service experience. Very busy and under pressure on the pick season. Fleet planning need to be taken into consideration very serious due to the lack of vehicles.
good,As a shuttler all we were doing is driving around cars. Very fun way to earn part time money. Plenty of down time in the winter but very busy in the summer. Fellow employees and managers are all friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,Daily setting game plans and rate shopping competition.  Regularly training and motivating business partners to sale optional products and market their locations.  Auditing the rental car locations to ensure they comply with Company standards.  Analyzing markets to Open new car rental locations. Your creative input is valued.
good,"Good place to work, salary is average for industry and benefits are above average. Duties and requirements constantly changing, which can be frustrating."
good,Working at Avis Budget was nice at first. They worked with my schedule and got me the hours I needed. They then allowed me to take sometime off to go home for winter break. When I came back I didn't expect hours right away. But then they kept telling me they wanted me and needed me so I didn't look for a new job. But now after a month of waiting around and them not responding calls or texts about hours I'm over working there.

good,"Sending Replies to the customer and arranging PRO to complete customer requirements."
good,"Note: This is only the Budget Group. Avis isn't involved in where I work."
good,"I would do inventory and then shuttle cars the rest of the day.

Most enjoyable part driving different types of new vehicles all around to different locations."
good,"The hard working team and ever changing work enviroment, keeps work fresh and fun."
good,"Overall a nice place to work great advancement opportunity"
good,"Of all the jobs, I've held, I learned the most from Avis Budget Group. It was a relaxed environment as far as management. However, as with any job dealing with the general public, it had its stressful moments, especially given that it was in the travel industry. The support system set up for employees was as best as could be realistically expected for this line of work, but it really was a job that required an individual to be cut out for that line of business. I saw many new hires not make it through the probation period. For me, the hardest part of the job was the lack of support in training given there was a strict and ever changing script to follow. There was a week of computerized training, another week of hands on training, then the rest one was expected to pick up on their own through mentors who hopefully, were willing to train. I saw a lot of new hires leave for this reason as well. It was a challenge, but not impossible for me, but I am also a quick learn and a highly social person. Those who could make it through the probation period found themselves surrounded by one of the best company support systems I've ever seen. These people truly were like a family to each other. Many people had been with the company for years stretching into decades. The potential commission was unrivaled and the insurance plans were very affordable. I ultimately left the company due to inflexibility with scheduling and family emergencies."
good,"Very friendly and professional enviornment. Ensure cleanliness and availability of vehicles. Some pick up and transport for clients, allowing direct interaction with various people. Allowed for the enhancement of attention to detail skills."
good,"As with any travel industry job, the need is not always consistent. A busy ski week and/or summer week keeps you busy and on your toes. The work group I am in, is fun and easygoing. Management has there hands full when it comes to allocating cars to different agencies and the need at the airport. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with reservation that have been booked with only 30 minutes notice. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with such a diverse group of people."
good,A fun job to interact with people from all over the world. The schedule varies and you do not have much of a balance home life and I find It is Hard to support  the various volunteer groups i am affiliated with.It is a good job for someone who is more flexible and not looking to make a career move with the company.
good,"Worked with some great people, company appreciates hard work and will acknowledge it"
good,Avis Budget Group is an good place to work. There are usually allot of work to do so not a fun place to be. you can come in and get youre work done without too many problems.

I found my co-workers to be very friendly and team oriented. The hardest part of my job is finding new ways to keeping staff motivated. The most enjoyable part of my job is my ability to coach others and show results through management skills."

good,"It's a good place to work if you can handle customer service on both sides good and bad.  Though some customers could be a bit difficult, but what company doesn't have its flaws.  On the positive side it brought me out of my shell in major way and that was my biggest benefit for me.  I now enjoy customer service once I get the responsibilities and in & outs far knowledge of the line of work and what's required."
good,"A typical work day entailed detailing several cars and helping numerous customers. I learned to be more social, how to manage my time wisely and how to go above and beyond the expectations. The business was constantly finding itself under new management. The workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was having to clean an entire car in a matter of minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when all the cars were cleaned and business was slow."

Customers expect bad things from rental agents based on media portrayal, plus, agents deal with many customers on ""bad days"". Days where they have to get to a family members funeral so on and so forth. Ideal rental associate is unfazed by screaming customers, last minute changes, and multitasking constantly."

All Owner/Operators employ a variety of methods to achieve these arbitrary goals even when corporate decides to under stock a year's inventory on purpose.

good,"Good Hours, Decent pay but no job stability. "
good,"I have had my good days and my bad days. On a typical work day, you work with other Rental Sales Agents and compete for sales. What you learn from this job is to become a better sales person and become more assumptive. As a Sales Person, you understand more about the selling process in order to perform better. Managers are awesome, but at times they kick you in the butt to make us as sales people better. The co-workers were all great people and it's a family like environment. The hardest part of the job was the training portion but after that it was all pretty common sense of what a sales person does. The most enjoyable part of the job was making lots of money."
good,Rent cars and provide customer service.
good,"Working at Avis was extremely busy. I learned that Customer Service is very important to have a successful business. By being employed at Avis for so long; I had more knowledge about contracts and our system compared to Management. I got along well with all of my co-workers.

good,The best part of my job was meeting new people daily as I am a people`s person.Satisfying customers needs and being of service to the customer at every interface and by giving the customer the option of renting opposed to buying. My motto was always to work for a strict Employer but a fair one. When I work for a Company I make it my own and always try to do my best at all times by being passionate in what I do and giving total commitment and try to bring the same message across to co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to get people to share the same passion I have and I am also aware that I am powerless over the next person and can only work on myself.

good,I love the people at Avis/Budget but their policies are extremely questionable. The pay is just shy of keeping employees straddling the line of poverty.
good,"High pressure work environment. Good to work for if you are a logistical thinker and proactive."
good,"Job conditions are mostly in airports; as a CSR, you are authorized a TSA pass so you never have to wait in long lines. If you are full time, you have benefits. As a RSA, you work on the inside of airport."

good,N/a give it try and make your own decision. I cant speak for everyones experience. You get in what you put out. Managment treats you like a number and you are replaceable at any given time
good,"Avis Budget Group was a nice company to work for. They had great employee perks, and they treated their employees very well for the most part. They offer great benefits on top of that. I enjoyed everything about Avis, and I was employed there for many years. The only con I have with Avis is the job security at the company is not good and HR is not for the employees if there is an issue. They seem to be more in favor of management."

I have made a lot of life time friends working with this company.
good,"Completing rental transactions and upselling is the way to gain and excell! Management is delightful, and the employees are highly competitive. The hardest part of this job is the fleet shortage. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people coming from so many different places."

good,"A typical day at Avis Budget Group at George Bush Intercontinental was to go in with a lot of patience due to the frustration and aggression of customers who had unexpected delays due to complications with credit cards, No Valid ID, Not keeping the contact information that was required at all times. What I learned from this is to be patient with even aggressive customers, to work more than one job for the company and how to go from one job for part of the shift to another. The hardest part of this job was the lack of organized management, however, the most enjoyable was seeing regular customers who were always positive even when they had complications and the Co-workers who were more cooperative and organized than recent management."

good,"OVERALL:"
good,"Avis is a very relaxed environment, it's not very fast paced. Management there is very fair, respectful and kind. The hardest part of the job is learning to detail cars correctly and being able to do 32 cars in an 8 hour shift.

good,This would have to be one of my favirite jobsbecause of the eployees that I worked with. They always had birthday cakes and fun appreciation activities throughout the year.

I felt because I was good at my job therefore i was told to do alot of other employees job as well.

good,"We would, on average, rent out 700 cars a day. This means 700 cars would leave our branch, and 700 cars would return to our branch (average) on a daily basis. It's more about the service we deliver than the actual product being the vehicle, as there are many car rental companies. The idea is to exceed our customers expectations at every interface. I have learned the meaning of being resilient: the ability to bounce back after a confrontation with a customer; to control my emotions and to earn respect by showing respect. "
good,good company  hardest part is dealing with customers when its your co workers who aren't applying themselves correctly.

Once determined we were pick up by a van and transported to a lot where we pick a vehicle and transported to specific located to be washed, labeled and ready for customers pick up. I learned to be a safe driver and maintain vehicles in good working order. Management showed me how numbers can be tricky and sometimes scanners can miss scan items so double check your work. My co-workers kept me going with entertainment. The hardest part was not always having in stock what the customers wanted immediately. What I enjoyed most was the ability to ride in something I couldn't afford and learn the difference in them."

good,"Avis Budget Group was a great place to work. We had a small team that got along very well. We got along great with the other counters in the airport as well. The job was fun. Most customers already have reservation. During my contact with them, I would ask questions to determine their needs, and upsell the customer accordingly. I would compete with the other counters for business from customers without reservations. The only reason for leaving is that the hours changed and were causing too many problems at home.

good,"had an excellent team spirit, no 2 days were the same. Avis looked after their staff. the only issue was working up the ladder unless you relocated, which wasn't ideal with a family."
good,"I loved to work at this place, always a challenge and a rush. I just to work at a airport location (MCO) and love it. Wish I stay there but, union conflicts between management and employees made it hard for me to stay."
good,"Often people miss understand the purpose of our branch as everybody associates Avis with car rental only. Working at Avis Fleet is fun, challenging, and rewarding. I have gained much experience from working at this small branch and have been granted many opportunities to grow within the business and personally through study scholarships. Being a small branch we were more like family. Our manager was a friend and confidant when we needed one and a strict manager when the role was required. The hardest part of my job was taking on the responsibility of two employees due to changes in the business structure but this also allowed me to gain more knowledge and grow. everything about my job was enjoyable as it has helped me transition into the strong, reliable, independent women I am today."
good,"They supplied on the job training.  I worked in a fun, fast-paced environment answering incoming calls and placing car rental reservations in cities all over the US.  Our calls were monitored for quality assurance and we were given feed back and helpful tips frequently by management. It was a shift-bid based schedule which was a bit difficult as your shifts would often change. The company provided great benefits for its employees and had an onsite gym and lunch room."
good,AvisBudge Rent a Car is a fantastic organization to work for.  Since my journey started at Avis its been an extraordinary experience.  I have had great opportunities to learn and grow within the organization.  I have also had the privilege of winning wonderful awards.  The most challenging part is the shift work which does put a tremendous amount of pressure on family members.  We also work at a very high pace and enormous amount of stressful  situation which over the years I have learned good coping skills as well as the on going training from Avis. The most enjoyable part is leading a team of people pushing them to give you the results you want and enjoying the customer interaction on a daily basis.

Daily, weekly and monthly sales goals and team meetings."
good,"A typical day at work includes inventory of all cars, running reports, and checking cars in and out. A lot goes into renting a car and it is important to remain alert at all times. Coworkers were great and very helpful. Hardest part of the job is learning all the codes and memorizing commands for computer use. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to drive really nice cars."
good,"Busy environment, challenging environment."
good,Good job to have! Most of the day is giving cars to people and returning them. Not that difficult. Get to interact with a bunch of different people all the time.
good,Amazing company. Great culture. I just don't like that you must relocate in order to grow within the company. I love the fact that there is so much employee engagement. It really feels like a family atmosphere.

good,I love working for Avis it is an amazing place to learn skills that will help you in your future career. The people I work with I have grown to love as family. Avis makes it really fun and takes care of its employees.
good,Working for ABG has been one of the most pleasant experences in my life but unfortunatelly as in most large corporations with change comes some unneeded positions or positions that can be handled somewhere else for a smaller salary. I always got along with my co-workers and the managers over the 12 years of working here and my day was always challenging and rewarding at the same time.

good,"great environment, great people, really enjoyed working face to face with the public"
good,"Working for Avis is very lonesome. Usually, I'm the only one working. I have to attend to customers, detail vehicles for the next day, answer calls. It gets a bit overwhelming when no one else is there to help you with customers when you're already with a customer and the other ones are impatiently waiting. I learned a lot from Avis. Working by yourself prepares you in so many ways for future jobs. This job prepares you for future jobs knowing that you can basically handle anything that is thrown in my path."
good,"Great job and great workmates, loved the commitment Avis showed its employees."
good,It is a part time on call job.Clean and check and fill car and deliver to different locations in 3 states.
good,"I worked for Avis Budget Group for 6.5 years. Although the hours were rough at an airport, my colleagues were some of the most effective and caring I have ever met. Management is effective and was personally vested in the growth of all employees. Benefits are excellent and paid time off got better with each year I was there. Yearly pay raises were better than most companies and there's the potential to make a ton of extra money in commissions every month for pretty much just doing your job. You could expect to be paid at least $100 in commissions even if you just do the bare minimum. Human Resources was actually readily and easily accessible. They were willing to meet with employees to discuss issues and make action plans to resolve them. Overall it's a great company to work for and if I didn't move away from the area, I would still be working for ABG."
good,"Loved working here"

good,A typical work day starts at 6am and doesn't end until all customer needs are met. i have learned never to take anything personal.i loved my co-workers because we were a team. the hardest part of my job was actually seeing a customer disappointed. the most enjoyable was pleasing a customer because i know they will be back based on the service they recieved.
good,"we rent cars out to clients,book appointments, park cars, or pick a client if needed. we deal with different cars and its great trying them out, its small team of people you work with so you get to know each other and its makes work more of an enjoyable place."

good,Great team and great people work at this company.  I often learned new things each work in an effort to support the operations in providing great customer service and return to shareholders
good,The work is mostly random. They generally call you the night before (but not always). Pay could be better since we are responsible for the delivery of expensive cars. Nice easy pace great for a retired person like me.

good,"After the cars were vacuumed and checked, I would take the cars through the car wash and park them in our lot. Then wipe down the car, mark down what parking space it was in, then drop the keys off and repeat. It was a really nice job and my coworkers made it fun. Management was also flexible with my schedule."

good,"Renting cars, washing them, and dealing with customer complaints is a bit of an intense task when done in tandem with the consistently draining inventory during busy seasons. If you can balance that you can work at a licensee location, there is a lot of down time otherwise."
good,"I spent almost 20 years at Avis.  Made a ton of friends.  Worked in various departments, that helped me grow and develop my career.  The majority of management that I worked for, helped me grow and it was honestly a pleasure to work for them and call them friends.  But like any job, there's always some bad that comes along.  The worst boss at Avis was responsible for a dept of about 25 people.  In 2 years he was responsible for destroying the entire dept and turnover was a huge issue.  It took them a while but eventually they corrected the problem, but I had already left the company.  "

good,"fun work place to work. "
good,I am still employed at Avis this pay is really good for utility agent. We do the oil changes and tires on our rental cars. My managers are wonderful and everyone that work there is pretty nice. I would definitely recommend this job.
good,I worked for ABG as an interim after working hard in a 12 year career. I fully enjoyed my time there (2 years). The people who work there are friendly and the managers are equally as enjoyable to work with. Targets are clearly outlined and the facilities to achieve them are readily available.
good,Avis Budget is a great place to work if you are looking for a career.  Lots of different opportunities and company is committed to be at the forefront in the transportation industry.
good,its a great place to work with good people to work with. In a lot of jobs this is a very scarce thing to find both under one roof. The hardest part of the job is deciding what listen to while you drive.

good,Generally started the day at 9 or 10 AM until 6 or 7 PM. I learned how to appease and accomodate disgruntled customers with consideraable management support. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers and the best part of the job was the camraderie between employees.
good,Loved everything about this job. People I worked with were the best people you could ask to be around. Starting pay was a little low but work environment made up for it.

I've worked with many people over my 20 year career and there are none that compare. From management through all team members, it was a great place.  There was always room to grow and learn new technologies, apply experience with suggestions for improvement in ways to do things and how to accomplish goals."

I loved working with and getting to know all (well most of) the customers. I worked as a Greeter, CSR, and a Preferred agent in the short time I was there. "
good,"Avis Car Rental was one of those jobs I can say I enjoyed everything about....The people I can i contact with were nice, my management were good people, co-workers were like my own family and there was nothing hard about the job other than the harsh winter conditions, but we are talking about Chicago,Il"
good,A typical day would start out with me behind a computer for a few hours imputing numbers and getting everything ready for the day then in the garage cleaning and washing then back to computer waiting for flights to come in. I learned something new everyday and the joy was not knowing what it will be. Surprises daily and you need to always be on your toes ready for anything. Management was relaxed and orderly they really had a effective system. My co-workers were fun and open. Always ready for whatever and it made everyday interesting. Hardest part would be communication barrier at the airport. People from all over the world needed directions and advice which could make their stay more enjoyable. Best part of the job was driving new cars and meeting new people.
good,The company is willing to send you to conferences and leadership workshops. Wants people to enjoy their work day and their fellow employees.Great manager and is willing to listen to her employees. Truly does care about her staff.
good,"Being about to work for Budget Rent A Car in Gallup, NM was a great experience as a young guy. I was basically a full-time/part-time assistant manager. I've learn a lot with this company for example, customer service, vehicle detailing, and opening/closing rental agreements. During day there was a lot to do like cleaning/fueling-up rental vehicles,and do a little more training on rental agreements. The best part about working for a rental car business is the transporting rental vehicles from one destination to another. Also, being able to drive with other employees and getting to know them. Most of the part-time drivers like the job because it pays their bills and puts food on the table. "

good,"I loved working at Avis Budget Group, if I could go back I would. I really enjoyed meeting new people every day from countries I'd never even heard of. The hardest part of the job would be making sure you get the keys from the customer because often times they are in such a hurry you don't have enough time to examine the care, print their receipt, resolve complaints, and then remember to not let them walk away with the key."
good,So far so good. I enjoy talking to clients and receiving calls.I usually get to work at 8am. My seniors  and the management  are so supportive  and working for Avis is really amazing.Hardest part of the job is trying to get information from an arabic client who refuses their call to be transferred to our arabic speaking colleagues just becase they like my voice.(That is what they say ).
good,Es un lugar muy agradable para trabajar. Solo que en torreon no hay oportunidad de crecimiento.
good,"Typical day is not something I would use to describe my job. Being the travel industry, its more like Christmas or a box of chocolate. You never really know what you are going to get. The basics of the job are easy enough. It is the things you have to do to support it that make the job challenging, engaging, and exciting. Managing fleet on day to day or hour by hour time frame makes you constantly thinking. Developing connections with people across the world adds a flair to the day. Some days you make a little difference in a big way and changes the entire travel experience for one person. Management wants to see you grow. They give you the tool, show you how to use them, and encourage the whole way. It is up to you to do the growing. Management is fair in the treatment of employees.  Recognition is readily handed out, a personal favorite of mine."

I learned computer and people skills, as well as how the business was run from intake of the vehicles until their retirement.  Management was supportive of my needs and gave me free-reign to perform my duties.  For the most part, my co-workers were easy to get along with and enjoyable to work with.  The hardest part of the job was handling the customers complaints while also being among the most enjoyable after knowing I had made the customer happy."
good,"Fast paced, friendly and a diverse customer basis. The corporate managers are wonderful, full of knowledge and encouragement."
good,"Avis Budget Group is a great place to work.  They went through a reorganization; as a result, my position was eliminated."

good,A typical day would consist over transporting rental cars from the lot after being washed and serviced to the rental garage at the New Orleans airport. The work environment was great.
good,"Driving BRAND NEW cars back and forth everyday. I found it hard to  believe I was being paid to do it, grant it it wasn't very much and it wasn't full time I really enjoyed it. The management was very easy to work with and very approachable. The hardest part of the job was the weather..sometimes it rains or snows but nothings perfect."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of check in check out.  transporting one car from one location to the next location, finding out what rentals we have available and what extra services will be needed to make the customer happy to refer our services to a friend or company.  I check inventory go out inspect the cars for any little damages and report it in log book.  I always showed up for work a hour to 30 minutes early trying to reach sales goals and upsell products such as , GPS, luxury class rentals or prepaid gas mileage for customer traveling long distance.  Me and my coworkers had one of the most honest and trustworthy relationship because we became friends at work and outside of work.  I love my co workers because we can laugh, smile together and still get our job done in the most productive way.  management wasn't never their so we had to all act in the most professional, self disciplined way as if they were still there because we are representing the company in the most positive manner.  I think the hardest part of the job is not asking a question if you don't have an ideal how to do something like drive a manual shift vehicle because you have someone there who is willing to teach you how to operate the vehicle such as myself. the best thing anyone can do is ask a question they don't know the answer to.  The most enjoyable part is waking up to a job you actually love doing and being surrounded by so many uplifting personalities."

The Customer is our most valuable asset and we try harder to meet every possible expectation. I've learned that no matter what capacity an individual operates in, whether customer facing or not; we must always smile. A smile is worth 6,000 points. The group of managers strive daily to thrive in such a competitive environment.  Additionally, co-worker are continuously being developed to initiate great service. The most challenging part in the organization maybe remembering to always put your game face on and make it happen; no matter what. The most enjoyable aspect of the job in being able to fulfill someone else's desires and needs."
good,"A Typical work day for me would be a fast paced environment."
good,"Always ways to make money just wish there was more.  The percentage you receive for commision is too low.  Especially to max out at so little. no growth.
