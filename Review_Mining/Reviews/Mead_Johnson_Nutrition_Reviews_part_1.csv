rating,review
bad,"Lots of gossip around building. Tell one person something it goes around the whole building and into the next one. Management and supervisors are not up to par. Constantly saying there is nothing they can do. If you have health problems, expect them to ask you about it and constantly be over worked."
bad,You work like a dog at this company with no recognition.  My boss and his boss had a power struggle going on and I was caught in the middle.  I was forced to rework the same data to accommodate each of their needs.  They refused to comprise and work together.   My immediate Supervisor had unrealistic demands and required the team to work more than 80+ hours a week.  No one I started with is still there.  It is a sweat shop.
bad,"Het is een slechte cultuur om in te leven"
bad,Long 12 hour shifts just sitting/standing at your area. got 3 30 min break/lunch. work 5 days on 5 day off 3 days on 2 days off. that was the best part of working there.
bad,You get no time with family what so ever. spend all your time at work. make good money but never get to spend it. Manager is rude and not understanding
bad,Mead Johnson is an infant nutrition company that is trying to be a pharmaceutical company.  There was no consistency with management's message to the salesforce or how or what to promote to phyicians.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customers.
bad,"Je komt al heb je2 voeten  aan een baan. Dat is ook de reden dat niemand met elkaar kan opschieten. Vaste krachten hebben genoeg van dat ze alles aan iedereen moeten leren. Uitzendbureau Adecco behandeld mensen alsof het slaven zijn. Je moet andermans zweetschoenen aandoen en dat terwijl de “zogenaamde” motto van het bedrijf “hygiëne is. De werknemers van het uitzendbureau denken dat ze de eigenaar van de fabriek zijn. Kortom het is gewoon alleen maar ellende. Werk je ergens een week wen je eraan en hup word je weer ergens anders neergezet."
bad,"Anteriormente la empresa se encontraba estable, actualmente cuentan con citas de contacto, la dirección se encuentra en constante movimiento, tiene constante rotación y recortes de personal, en dirección las cosas son impositivas, sin importar la opinión de sus trabajadores y no existe coaching."
bad,"I was a recruited executive brought into the company to manage a global function.  Less than 6 months after arriving the function was eliminated, despite being 140% of objectives."
bad,"Desarrollo de habilidades como llegar a un compromiso mas eficaz en la venta, en el momento de cierre con los médicos, especialmente si contaban con apoyo de educacion mèdica."
bad,My co-workers harassed me on many occasions.  I tried to talk to them and then went to management.  it turned out they blamed me and then ended up firing me after I refused to apologize for something I didn't do.
bad,"Fue una empresa grandiosa en resultados, utilidades, clima laboral, etc, Como todo, llegó la época de contracción, resultados malos producto de decisiones erradas, falta de criterio, baja congruencia con los valores que promulgan, llevan varios años tratando de recuperar las glorias pasadas, que son glorias perdidas."
bad,ik heb daar gewerkt via adecco kan er niet veel over oordelen als uitzendkracht omdat er vaak storingen en fouten werden gemaakt stond productie vaak stil doordat het stil stond konden wij ( uitzendkrachten ) alleen maar schoonmaken of je werd naar huis gestuurd
bad,"Adecco Mead Johnson beloofd heel veel maar gebeurde niks."
bad,"This company doesn't provide the tools for continues improvement for the employees. The salary was below than the average market. When MJN was part of BMS the company, the working philosophy was completely different."
bad,"Mead Johnson Nutrition is a great company founded over 100 years ago in Evansville, Indiana. However. If you've got a fire in your belly and are very ambitious you will hate this place. They don't like to promote people there is very little opportunity for advancement. They will continue to lie to your face and act like there is, but there isn't."
bad,food/pharma bedrijf maar nogal verschil van aanpak in vergelijking met O&G/Petrochem/Power
bad,"Management here is an ABSOLUTE nightmare. everything is political. if you so much as cross someone that has a higher seniority than you, kiss your job goodbye. "
bad,"Las posiciones dificilmente tenían reemplazo, faltaba una persona y era muy dificil conseguir la información. Se iba una persona de vacaciones, podías estar 15 días sin poder cargar una orden de compra, por ejemplo."
bad,new people are energetic and dedicated
bad,"work environment was nice but there was an overall lack of communication across the entire company."
bad,buen empleo tranquilo solo que supervisora que esta en esa empresa es demasiado absorvente y hace tedioso el trabajo
good,"day shift has 9  employees to do the same work as second shift, but second only had 5 employees, giving us less time and man power to achieve our goal,"
good,Since MJN was bought out it has been a miserable place to work. Since they were bought out the entire company changed and it became a slow migration of all jobs over sees.
good,We were bought out a year ago and the morale is horrible. Management sucks. Expecting you to do more work for less pay (I took a pay-cut at the beginning of the year). Only promotions for the brown nosers and not those who deserve it!
good,"The two worst things about this place are probably that they only pay $9/hr as a temp and $10/hr hired on, and you never know when you're going to get hired on. Most places will hire you on after 90 days, with this place its ""when a position opens up"".... which could be never. However, it took me about 8 months. They also ""lay off"" almost everyone during winter time because business is slow, so if you aren't on the one line that still needs to run, you're not going to have a job for very long."
good,Lacking leadership with sufficient experience to manage all areas.  Good benefits with good pay. Poor planning and scheduling of lines and schedule. Policies are a grey area that will only be followed when it benefits management.
good,"I was on contract in this company."
good,"You are on the phone your whole shift."
good,"* a typical day at work"
good,"Working for Mead Johnson is great, learning about the baby formula and the benefits based on research is amazing.  People here at Mead Johnson are personable."
good,"we produced  baby formula packaging at a fast paced  "
good,Passion for delivery and quality is always present in the company. Fast paced projects delivery and multiple projects at a given time.Great people to work with.
good,"i have learned a lot of new things, it is a good place to work and it is new, it has a bright further."
good,"On time disbursement of salary has always been an issue for the same,as the sales force usually functions through 3rd party.Would be best if discussed at length at the time of interview itself.."
good,"Depending on where you get put in, the job can be fast pace or a relaxing pace. Now getting hire into there is a lot harder then other place and many people who work as a contract end up working until there contract expire or get let go."
good,"Visitas diárias em lojas, implantação de material, organização em gôndolas, envio de relatórios diários e divulgação da marca, "
good,Great benefits. Work life balance isn't so great especially when implementing projects. Limited work from home options. Limited advancement options. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people.
good,"Management is a joke, with no presence in the work environment. Pencil pushers that just want data to justify their job on a pie chart. No communication between managers and team members, Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Not getting funding for parts on machines. Lost tool room attendant. No organization with consistent results. Low o.e.e. of product line output. 100 year old building with poor layout for maintenance shop. Machine shop and tooling was removed 2 years ago with promise to return in new location. Lied to by management as it has not yet been brought back in house. All overtime for maintenance has been cut. 40 hours a week max, which has led to machines being driven into the ground."
good,"Good training for Infant formula.  Work/life balance is good.  3 wks vacation for everyone to start, holidays that aren't offered at most companies are offered at MJN."
good,"You are a warm body. A very hard place to work, and they own you."
good,"Good pay and benefits. Lovely offices. Weak middle management. General sense of arrogance, including a lack of accountability."
good,me hubiese gustado poder crecer aún más en una compañía donde me sentí poco valorado.
good,I had an opportunity to learn a number of different tasks and systems but did not have much room for advancement and taking on bigger challenges. Immediate manager was great despite have a heavy work load themselves..
good,"- 5 days works"
good,"The people are friendly and welcoming. The work culture is excellent. Management has a tendency to overlook employee input when instigating projects, which can be frustrating. There are also few advancement opportunities. Overall its a great place to work, but difficult to make a career here."
good,"Work with the team of sales merchandising, we worked selinng in the retail market, making the order of products, a put the products in the store, coordinate inside shoppers, coordinate pricing, negotiate product offers and product price discount."
good,"Overall, a very enjoyable job initially, but is becoming more 'Pharma' like with a 'one size fits all' mentality.  Mead Johnson provides a great product portfolio with science that outperforms other formula companies.  Hospital and WIC contracts ultimately dominate what formula is purchased by consumers."
good,An ambitious experienced professional would not enjoy working here. Part of the problem is the location in Eansville with small town attitudes and not a thriving cultural environment
good,This job is  in the boiler operations field. This job could have some leads to the powerplant industry. You work by yourself and have to be self motivated.
good,"we always travel"
good,"The company lack the ability to provide its young professionals with a forseeable career path. Nepotism is rampant in this company. Regardless of how hard you work, you're only able to move up if you know people."
good,"La một môi trường tốt, mọi người rất than thiện, làm việc rất chuyên nghiệp"
good,"As a contract employee at MJN, I have had experience with managers who view their contract employees as sub-par regardless of their work performance, simply because they are not MJN employees."
good,Pleasant company to work for.  Lots of training offered. Productivity is the driving force which allows you to always be looking for process improvement and change.  Friendly and courteous employees. Professional work environment.  Must be able to adapt quickly to changes.
good,I have had good experiences at MJN.  We are currently going through a merger and a lot of uncertainty.  I would recommend working there.
good,"Knowing infants need your product for survival is rewarding. "
good,"While the work itself was awesome, the instability of the department made the job very difficult. Dealing with the outside print vendors was often the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Job Descriptions: "
good,"Good company with good working relationship with peers and other colleague from other departments."
good,FDA approval problems not getting pipe going in time. had to sell old products with little support. 5 state territory and related travel.
good,"Actually, it all went well until the evaluation they need to apply for all the employees. They fired all the employees that haven't close relation to other production operator. They have unfair rules for evaluation. I learned how to know the real attitude of a person is."
good,"i have a learned a lot of things in that company and that's all i can say thw workplace is good, the hardest part of my job is having a long hour of duty sometimes"
good,"Multiples tareas"
good,"I really enjoyed the fact that I got my own desk that locked so I could leave my belongings there and I had my own desk extension. I really liked working on the computer and having my own work email. There was always something to do weather you felt like sitting and working or if you wanted to be active while working,"
good,"Gran corporación donde adquieres conocimiento sobre como ser Representante de Ventas que va mas alla de establecer una relación comercial entre Distribuidores, Farmacias y el equipo de la compañía"
good,"Empresa multinacional com faturamento anual de US$ 4 Bilhões ano, líder em nutrição infantil e terceiro player no Brasil."
good,"As a procurement business analyst, I reported directly to the CPO(Chief Procurement Officer), the head Global Procurement Department. 50% of my job assignment was to develop innovative analytic tools, such as econometrics model, commodity category deep dives, etc. to support the CPO on strategic decision making."
good,You can learn a lot when working at Mead Johnson Nutrition Vietnam (MJN). The company employees are friendly and supportive. They are willing to support and guide you.
good,Het is een groeiende bedrijf en betalen redelijk goed maar er zijn echt te veel omkleed procesures ze willen vapro b operators maar het werk is geen proces operator waardig het werk is eentonig het is niet echt uitdagend werk maar dat kan ook een keuze zijn
good,"I like my job, it isn't stable, I am temporary and going to be laid off in a couple months. That's why I am searching for a new career I can settle at and not have to worry about trying to look for another job ever again."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo y personal, buena capcitacion, es una empresa de talla mundial, la elaboracion de sus productos le da su renombre, promueven los buenos valores"
good,"La empresa me enseñó mucho tanto a nivel personal como profesional. Los días típicos son de mucho trabajo pero con una excelente predisposición tanto de las personas de mi área (Finanzas) como de las demás áreas. Aprendí a elaborar distintos tipos de reportes utilizando en conjunto excel, power point y SAP y a entender y respetar los procesos establecidos en la empresa, entre otros."
good,"It was a nice place to work, and great hours, I just had to leave to care for my daughter back than. The place was clean and people are friendly. Lunch breaks could be 30 mins tho."
good,"- 12 hour shifts"
good,Management could be better. Rules not always followed fairly. No a bad place to work. Team oriented and clean facility.  Worked hard and sometimes long hours.
good,"Uma excelente Empresa ,amava trabalhar e representar os produtos da mesma (nutrição infantil),más infelizmente nada é para sempre.Foi o melhor trabalho que tive em minha vida,se eu pudesse voltar daria o melhor do que dei."
good,"Worked at Mead Johnson / Bristol Myer Squibb for 38 years. I was a pharmaceutical drug compounder and team leader / scheduler.  Scheduled people and products in production rooms. Wrote Standard Operating Procedures, tracked various metrics, overtime, absenteeism, job effectiveness, and tardiness. Great management.  Worked with a good group of men that were conscientious, and had good values.  Hardest part of the job was coming in at 3:00am and getting off at 3:00pm because I scheduled three shifts.  Most enjoyable part was dealing with various equipment venders."
good,"I enjoyed working here, there was good camaraderie in the work place.  We worked well as a team.  Management was fair.  Was a very clean environment. Training was very thorough and in depth."
good,"Teams routinely leveragel  strong quantitative and qualitative support for decisions.  Internal and global initiatives fight with lots of red tape.so things often take a while to get final approval."
good,"Convincing the HCPs to recommend LACTUM IF to mothers."
good,"As a starter in the field of sales of pharmaceutical industry , this company always supported  the new comers. The management and the coworkers was always fun working with in the field. I got to learn many things and developed productive skills in the field of sales."
good,"increase you potential for communication thru the client,implement the first in and first out procedure"
good,we started at 6am and worked until 430pm Monday-Thursday. Fridays was overtime. it was a relaxed place to work.
good,"HR is a joke. The jobs provide a nice challenge that can vary day to day. Most department's work a twelve hours shift, thirty-six hour one week 48 the next."
good,"There is a good team oriented environment. MJN makes great products that can truly make a difference. I feel safe at work, and they have a great cafeteria. Work hours are flexible in the laboratories, but OT must be pre-approved. This has become a slight issue since they have increased the sample quantity but decreased testing time allotted.  IF you like multitasking and keeping track of large amounts of data, you will enjoy this job. The people there are great to work with, but they are a little ragged from the demands forced upon them by upper management."
good,Smart people who want to do the best for the business but have been stuck in turbulent times as the business has IPO'd and now sold again.  Likely more change coming.
good,"Decent place to work for. The company stays busy with projects. The company also has competitive pay. There are limited vacation days when starting off, not a good work from home policy."
good,"MJN takes pride in leading innovation of infant formula to feed infant and children around the world and this pride is felt among nearly the entire workforce.  Historically the company has done an excellent job of fostering employee engagement and growth, but recent marketplace trends - mainly the unpopularity of infant formula in The West - has impacted the company and forced tight controls and restrictions these programs."
good,Very busy days with lots of work and short deadlines but interesting and fun place to work.  Learned many various systems and excellent training was provided.
good,"When MJN became an independent public company the corporate culture changed considerably. It was predictable if not inevitable, but it did not benefit many employees."
good,Falta de procesos y confidencialidad entre el personal y RRHH
good,This company is a sustainable one. They compensated their employees fairly. This is a Milk Company. I am one of their sales representative. They are on retail and wholesale.
good,Empresa con grán reconocimiento en el mercado y con marcas muy bién posicionadas muy enfocada a la inversión en la relación con sus clientes.
good,Focus on values and great place to work. Results and people oriented
good,"Gestão de distribuidores, acompanhamento de equipes indiretas e diretas. Vendas diretas, indiretas. Canais diretos (gestão de contas, nacionais, regionais e globais), canal alimentar e canal farma; atacado e varejo."

good,Provided me the tools and training in presenting products. Very competitive culture which helped me develop sense of achieving goals at all cost.
good,"Enjoy working here. Some complaints but for the most part good people, good company."
good,"A typical day would start out with warm up stretching for fifteen minutes. Supervisor would review the day and the goal for how many skids we would put out for the lines. We would receive our assignments and then rotate every two hours between the three positions for the twelve hour shift. Co workers were good and managemnt was fair. The hardest part of the job was the clean ups,"
good,"Overall MJN is a good place to work for. Slightly above average pay, great benefits and other incentives. Most of the employees there are well educated, which helps drive a progressive culture and makes working out issues easier rather than someone just whining and complaining without offering a solution. Relatively open work atmosphere in terms of interaction between employees, mostly friendly. Since their purchase by a larger company lots of repetitive and ultimately arbitrary meetings covering the same topic with different groups, or repeat daily meetings even if nothing has changed since the day prior. Floor employees work long hours, 10-12 hour shifts doing physical labor in many areas.   "
good,Great place to work to make a difference in infant and children life. There is always opportunity to advance. The Company is very structured. The benefits package is very good
good,"Mead Johnson Nutritional (MJN)  used to be a division of Bristol Myers Squibb.   Hence, the rating is quite different from BMS. "
good,"A typical 8 to 5 work day, with interactions with global business partners. Professional with emphasis on performance, good work life balance,  diverse multinational workforce."
good,"Learnt many technical stuff from day one till date"
good,"In the 70's the corporate culture of ""Family Concept"" worked well for the company.  Through the years, however, this concept got lost during the change of management and management styles.  Salary and fringed benefits were good but not necessarily the best in the industry.  The training that Mead Johnson provides is excellent and working relationships with my immediate boss and those whom I supervised were truly enjoyable and rewarding.  During the severe economic downturn in 1983, though, the company did not adopt to the radical changes in the marketplace.  We were the only pharmaceutical company in the Philippines that was unwilling to bring down our Sales Budget.  In general, however, having worked with Mead Johnson was worth it and will long be cherished and remembered with fondness."
good,Territory sales with great products.  Learn how to build relationships with health care professionals and how to sell a wide variety of products.
good,"Es un trabajo muy satisfactorio que constante mente estas aprendiendo cosas nuevas y teniendo mas conocimientos medicos, ademas mas relacion con los medicos,las gerencias anteriores muy humanas con su personal y las actuales gerencias ya no valoran a su personal.En cuanto a los compañeros es un buen ambiente laboral, la parte mas dificil del trabajo son los cambios de estrategias que no dejan madurar ninguno.Y por lo tanto no hay continuidad en las estrategias."
good,Would recommend to anyone. Top notch company.  The culture here is firm but fair.  Operators have easiest jobs I have ever seen in a production setting and are paid very highly for it.
good,"I learned to manage my day absent direct supervision.  Empowered to make marketing, budgeting, and scheduling decisions.  Learned great management skills and exceptional sales experience with documented results.  Earned above average commission semi-annually and enjoyed the team atmosphere which enabled me to enhance professional skills."
good,Es una empresa de calidad a nivel nacional y con beneficios laborales
good,"fun and fast paced, lots of opportunities, lots of change, always opportunity to learn. Dynamic culture. Good company mission - something all employees can get behind."
good,"The day starts with production meeting discussing the previous days productions and any quality issues.  "
good,"Mead Johnson pays well for the area and doesn't overwork their employees."
good,"Mead Johnson es una empresa interesada en la fabricacion de productos de calidad y comprometida, en el que se trabaje de forma correcta y enseñanza de su personal."
good,"It is a good place to work, with many great people and an important set of products which require high standards.  However, there seemed to be shortcomings with communication, accountability, and the normal frustrations of a large established company"
good,"A company with a great mission, strives for quality, and encourages active involvement in the communities in which its employees live and work."
good,"A typical day at work entailed receiving inbound calls and responding to emails from Mead Johnson consumers. I attended an employee meeting monthly, and on-the-job training as needed."
good,The typical day as the CAD Tech really varied depending on the projects being worked on. When I left the company we were working on shop drawings. This entailed drawing up every piece of machinery in the factor and going back and recreating them in AutoCAD. Management was great at Mead Johnson! Everyone got a long and there was very good communication. I really enjoyed everything about Mead Johnson and would return if given the opportunity.
good,"Have to comply the needs of client in store, pooling, availability of the stock, good quality and check near expiry, time management to achieve the outlet that i have to check daily, the hardest was to train new merchandiser in the outlet especially if the salary is not minimum. most enjoyable was I meet other people with high experienced in sales, that i consider its an honor to be part of this company."

good,Overall a good company. Its mission is great. The products are good. It has a good sense of social resposibility. Most people are nice to work with. Some are with high professionalism that worth being respected. The international market competition is fierce.
good,"•Giving daily report base from the production output."
good,"I was working in Mindtree for MeadJohnsin, it was fun working place where I can able to have both work and life balance and good compensation as well, also I had good ramp up with the client as well."

Fornece um ambiente de trabalho agradável para seus funcionários visando o crescimento profissional dos funcionários."
good,"Mead Johnson is mooi bedrijf met een open bedrijfscultuur. In de pauzes zitten operators, administrateurs, laboranten, teamleiders, hoofdafdelingen en directeuren gewoon lekker naast elkaar. Een bedrijf met veel sympathieke mensen en die volop in ontwikkeling is. Zeer goed voor de werkgelegenheid in regio Nijmegen."

good,"I love working in Mead Johnson as it gives me a well blended work and life balance. They have vending machines for free snacks and also, snooker room to release stress. They also gives 2 hours of flexible lunch break. The superiors are also approachable. The job scope I had was something I look for as a fresh grad. They have given me the knowledge of how their work nature really is. However, as I was hired to cover for an employees' maternity leave, my contract only lasted for 6 months."

The most enjoyable part of the job would be the parents who showed so much enthusiasm and excitement about their new baby or older baby and wanted to get free products and how they tell all their friends about Enfamil products and the free family beginnings program."
good,MJN works to provide the best start in life.  Peers respect each other and everyone works with a common goal.  The recent buyout is making things challenging but should net out to the best of the company at the end of the transitions

good,Working with me Johnson was a pleasure. Communication seemed to be strained without an open door policy. The employees truly care about what Mead Johnson stands for
good,"Empresa com muitos benefícios aos funcionários, vários procedimentos e uma política séria de Compliance. A parte mais difícil era na minha opinião o Sistemas de Viagens que poderiam ser mais ágil, mesmo cumprindo as políticas. A parte mais agradável o clima organizacional, uma equipe bem unida."
good,Mead Johnson was one of the best companies I have worked at in my career. Unfortunately when new management took over - the company went down hill and was asked to relocate which was impossible for me.
good,A MJN é uma excelente empresa e possui os melhores produtos para garantir um melhor início de vida para as crianças. Meus filhos foram consumidores e não tenho nenhuma queixa a fazer quanto a linha de produtos.
good,Efficient and productive environment but lacks opportunity for career advancement. The recent merger impacts job security and continuity...............
good,"Have worked on critical issues."
