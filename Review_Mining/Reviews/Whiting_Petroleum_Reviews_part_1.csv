bad,"Very hard to move up if you are not part of the good ol' boys club. They have settled several lawsuits because they underpay women. I was being underpaid. When I brought it to HR, they agreed. After she talked to the department manager, HR changed their mind. I was being harassed about my sexuality and the manager would not do anything about it, neither would HR."
bad,"A lot of leadership changes over the years. 33% of the company gone in one swoop by outside HR company, seemed very apathetic. A lot of good talent has left. The manager that let me go was smiling the entire time. I am grateful for what I learned and wish the best for this company."
bad,Okay place to work. Not much room for advancement.  management is sub par in many areas and offers little to no proper training.  Lack of leadership is masked by amazing pay and benefits.
bad,Management was in chaos the past few years and everyone had their positions constantly changing.  There was a constant threat of lay offs for over a year and employees' attitudes reflected this.
good,I loved working for Whiting. Full benefits and strong safety culture. Great training environment. Unfortunately job is commodity linked and they sold the field I worked in. Then the opposite was true for Cobra. High stress no support and no safety at all. Always made you feel today could be your last day with the company.
good,I thought this would be my forever job.  They just laid off 33% of their entire workforce. Local management in Williston are great people.  Corporate Denver are totally out to lunch at this point.  They have no clue whatsoever what they are doing or where they are headed. I truly believe they are going through the process of being sold.
good,Whiting is in flux with the new CEO. He should make things better. New organization is in place. Whiting has a good core group. Whiting has pioneered unconventional oil plays. Great learning experience.
good,Good Benefits. Allows using new tools and tech. Management is fine. Salary is decent. Learned new tools and team is quite competent. Relaxed environment. A typical day just like any other company not fast I would say. Management is quite encouraging. CEO has good vision.
good,Was not micro-managed which was very nice.  Benefits were extremely good.  Company tended to follow the leader.  Good workplace culture.  Learned a lot from co-workers.
good,"The first 6-1/2 years, a typical day at work involved writing AFEs, writing workover procedures, picking perforations, drawing wellbore diagrams, creating production plots from OFM, running economics using ARIES, coordinating injection profile program daily for 2 trucks & notifying field personnel of which wells they would be on that day, obtaining RRC approval to plug wells by filing W-3As, keeping up with 35 workover rigs & 3 drilling rigs."
good,The work task changes almost every day. You don’t do the same thing every day. Work task can change often to breakdowns and as problems accur. I have learned a lot from my 4 years with the Company. Unfortunately due to management and personality conflicts the culture isn’t the greatest. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant problems of technical problems with equipment. The most enjoyable part is being able to repair technical problems. And to be on your own.
good,"When I first worked at Whiting, I had an excellent supervisor and we worked together very well. The last year I was there, I was moved into a different department under a new supervisor. This new supervisor was verbally abusive and unfit to supervise anyone. I probably would still be working there if I had not had to switch supervisors."
good,"Good company with relatively low politics.  Some silo issues that ned to be overcome.  Overall a positive working environment.  New CEO still working to change the company direction, but I feel he will be successful over time."
good,"Whiting is a good place to work. Relaxed, but fast paced. Whiting is fun and challenging. The hardest part of the job would be the driving, 250 miles per day. The most enjoyable part is all the different things that I get to do."
good,It was a great place to work that afforded me many opportunities to grow in the industry.  Too bad $30 per barrel oil ended it.
good,When I worked at Whiting I was exposed to many different facets of Oil and Gas.  It's not all about extracting oil from the ground. I worked with some of the smartest and most dedicated people I have ever met.
good,Defined job tasks with options to branch out. Good environment for the Oil & Gas industry candidates. Great for O & G producers and those that support it.
good,"I finally found a company, department, coworkers, manager and job that I looked forward to each day! It was a shame that the industry seems more up and down than any other industry."
good,My department was the best my supervisor was great and his manager was great as well. Whiting really is a good company. Co worker are very helpful.
good,Was a great place to work but with the current slide in oil prices mass lay-offs are occurring. The benefits and pay were excellent and other than the long commute I have no issues with them as an employer at all.
good,"work and family balanced very well, benefits were out standing. Management very good at what each individual did. hardest part of the job was possibly working for 23+ hrs. some times."
good,Great place to work as far as pay and benefits.  My personal supervisor was a very dishonest person and it seems most people in the company realize this but don’t care.
good,"In a typical day at work I would answer phones, take messages, and give them to the appropriate person. Gather the collected data and enter it into spread sheets, complete work orders, sort mail, and file paper work. I had awesome co workers that were not only fun to work with; they were also team players. The hardest part of the job would have to be the deadlines and the amount of information needed to be covered by said deadline. It was a fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. A decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Excellent company to work for...."
good,"Great place to work, Very challenging. They care about their people.  they let you try something new to enhance your career.  they ere flexible on your work hours,"
good,"Great place to work, friendly, knowledgeable people, great work atmosphere. Pay for performance is excellent. Really good on training, sometimes communication between departments can be a issue. Overall great place to work."
good,"I like it.  Good company.  Pretty good company.  A good job.  Good company.  Management improvements are great.  Fired the right people, mostly.  Kind of a good company."
good,"I enjoyed the time that I worked for Whiting Petroleum Company.  I found my job enjoyable and enjoyed the people that I worked with.  There was plenty of room for advancement.  However, the company sold and I was part of a reduction in force."
good,"This is a solid company to work for. The company offers a great benefit package and allows individuals to advance in the company."
good,"I was only a contractor there, 3 month contract turned into 3 year contract, but I left with long term friends! Great company, management was friendly, very helpful, the hardest part of the job was when the contract ended!!!"
