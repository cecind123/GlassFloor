rating,review
bad,La pire boite que j'ai connu. Management pourri et zéro motivation
bad,Sales Force Effectiveness
bad,"Dysfunctional company. Poor decisions from upper management. Good people and managers at local level. Shutdown of site at Smithfield, RI was misguided. Greed and hubris are the norm at executive level. Lots of talk about patients, but supply at risk from poor planning."
bad,"LATAM headquarters in Miami are a cluster and joke.  VP is a severe micro manager and makes for an uncomfortable working environment.  He is all about ""the boys"" and wants to build his own empire and get rid of anyone in the way.  He is sneaky and you must watch your back with him around.  You put in your blood, sweat and tears and don't even get a thank you.  Leadership is disorganized and ""clicky,"" and the office environment is like being in a morgue, everyone sits at their workstations like robots and doesn't talk.  Not a team environment.  HR does not look out for the best interest of the employees, if you tell them you want to grow with the company, you are told ""NO"" and beware, it will be held against you at a later point in time.  Strongly recommend anyone to think twice before joining this type of environment.  Everything is reactive versus pro-active."
bad,"Great Compensation and great Benefits.  "
bad,Integrity seriously lacking in this company.Highly qualified for position but overlooked as they had doubts about whether I would stay.Got feedback from friends within the company.The fact that the HR / managed don't even have the manners to give response to interview speaks volumes for this company.
bad,Most people feel they are over worked and unappreciated. The supervisors in some areas need to be retrained or replaced. Not the best when it comes to cGMP and GMP   The benefits and compensation are great.
bad,"Very stressful working environment they do not really care about your personal life or any requirements of it. Management was not supportive, all they cared about the bottom line.Not a good place to work for a long time. Facility Was  grossly understaffed in management knew about it for years then complained when mistakes were made."
bad,"My immediate team was excellent, we worked very well. The senior management team cares nothing for the individual and looks only at the bottom line. When I began working there 11 years ago it was a totally different culture from today"
bad,Muito difícil adaptar-se em uma empresa que muda tanto.
bad,"This company brags about a lot of things, but in reality their demeanor is highly unprofessional and rude. Its amazing how they treat people like trash. I was called for an on site interview after a phone screen and phone interview (taking an unpaid day off from my current work). I was told that I would be notified of their decision nay or yay within a week's time by the HR. Shockingly, I never heard back from them. I inquired twice through mail, but I did not get any reply from the HR even after a month of my on site.That is ridiculous."
bad,"Great place for cleaning up after chickens , they call it animal husbandry . I learned how to collect sanples from a rooster and artifically breed a hen.The management of this company is awful as they do not treat all employees fair and equitable .The hardest part of the job is the chicken dust and droppings all over the area to clean up . The best part of the job each day , was going home ."
bad,"Alexion was a great place to work until the C level management determined that it was in the shareholder best interest.(C level executives are major shareholders).  The company is a shell of what it used to be.  There is no constant direction from to top down, management doesn't pass information to workers.  The source of most major decisions in from the internet or local news.  Because of low regard of the workers the culture is toxic.  Everyone is concerned if they will be the next people to be let go."
bad,"I have no comment as i do not feel it is appropriate to state anything negative or positive in this forum."
bad,"Alexion is a company that has rested on its laurels, and its people for far too long.  in 2007, Alexion built a facility that was questionable in the ability to carry out the intended function.  This is understandable,, as the company had no income at the time.  Now, at a time of a critical need to supply Solaris, the Smithfield facility is running at a pace it can neither realistically support, for a variety of reasons.  Poor system design, no documented process, inability to provide utilities nor manage waste.  And, yes, resources.  It is clear that The executives at Alexion have every intention of ditching this facility once Ireland is running.  They will get rid of those that question the business model, and count on the remaining to stay out of fear, and if need be, out of apathy.  There are a small percentage of those willing to do what is needed, day in/day out.  Typical in this industry when the executives make poor choices...only once would the have to live with those choicesin order to not see this happen again"
bad,"My experience happened a ling time ago so maybe it isn't relevant anymore."
bad,"The company was originally ran like a family business where each member had a place and felt necessary. The climate changed to a more competitive environment, and exclusively for the elite or higher level associates. If you didn't have a title you were replaceable or non-relevant."
bad,People were nice but it seemed like a lot of them got the job through knowing someone not from their experience in Pharmaceuticals.  They do pay well.
bad,A lot of really good people at this company. The company is very successful and will continue to grow expecially in terms of Irish footprint which is very promising over the next few years.
bad,Alexion was a great company to work for at one point but senior management had poor vision and guided the company to a point were restructuring needed to take place which resulted in massive layoffs
good,"Typical day at Alexion is constant change in direction, lack of decision making. Horrible Management. Horrible culture."
good,"If you are contractor here then you are treated as a 2nd class citizen, avoid at all costs."
good,Alexion is currently going through a company wide transformation.  The environment is currently challenging and our culture is being redefined.  The hardest part of my job is now adjusting to a new position that I was moved into without a conversation and the toxic environment that has been created since the lay offs.
good,"Company started out wonderful, but like any other growing industry, corporate greed took over and now rules.  To much emphasis on patching and hiding problems, not fixing them.  Little to no advancement unless you are a management favorite, work ethic and performance are irrelevant."
good,I would say Alexion was a different place to work than most Bio Tech. I would have stayed if it did not close and will say that it was a good ride while it lasted.
good,"The most intense job I ever had.  The only thing that drives people at this company and makes working there tolerable are the life transforming medicines and the patient testimonials.  The company has completely changed this year, losing it's edge and passion.  The current culture is very dismal and employee satisfaction is at it's all time low."
good,Not enough employees to meet work demands.  Long hours worked on salary.  Management pushed to meet goals without considering actual time it takes to meet demands.
good,"Fast paced environment. "
good,Company undergoing executive changes and strategy changes. early year very entrepreneurial but last 4 years significant culture changes and more like big pharma
good,while started promising . the management within the department was terrible. no hire from within and seem to be a lot of favoritism within the company
good,I learned many new job skills while I was employed here.   There was no room for advancement and the commute was extremely long so I left after 5 years
good,"Alexion is going through a restructuring and eliminating 7% of personnel in April 2017. There is talk of a second round later in 2017. "
good,"This job has been both incredibly interesting and incredibly draining. I only wish management had figured out the merger sooner, because the culture at this location is diminishing."
good,good company doing a good job helping people. not a place to be if you like having a life outside of work.
good,"Great people working together. Rotating upper management yield a shaky foundation and constantly shifting priorities. The company has not had consistent strategy in over 5 years. Past management made critical errors around acquiring new products and strategy, leading to numerous problems. The promoted treatments are excellent, and YoY sales growth keeps the company very profitable."
good,"worked here for 5 years, up until recently, most of the mid level facilities managers were deadbeats..... Especially BVL..... worst manager ever had the misfortune of reporting too..... other managers dead from the neck up.... no sense of efficient work practices, cared nothing about the quality of work or saving money.  By the time management structure changed, it was too late, damage was already done!! The site will close soon."
good,"The notice that the manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI will be shut down was announced on 12Sep2017. There will be no more Alexion jobs in Rhode Island."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Alexion is the comradery between the employees. Everyone is working towards the goal of producing a drug that could/will save the many lives of patients with Ultra Rare Disease's.
good,"- Hard to have a normal family life while working for Alexion."
good,worked at Alexion Pharmaceuticals full-time 4 years
good,"Very fast paced, stressful work environment with minimal work/life balance. Became an enjoyable place to work once site was closing. I reported to 8 different managers in 4 years, gives you an idea of the lack of direction of the company."
good,Learned so many skills I hardly know where to begin.  Very fast paced with minimal training learning curve was exponential. Skillset will be useful for my future.
good,"Good payer, young crowd"
good,"My IT position was a busy department, we support 3500 people world wide and kept and made sure things were running smoothly. Management kept weekly meetings and informed us with  updates and new projects that were coming up. The building was new and had a great atmosphere with the latest new technology. We were constantly busy and growing quickly and we had to keep up with everything . We enjoyed helping everyone with there IT issues and formed a great relationship with everyone."
good,"Good place to work. A bit challenging with a manufacturing process rate higher than the utility systems can support. Can be stressful at times, but the people working here are outstanding and always seem to help hit our milestones and target goals."
good,"Great people, great opportunities. Workplace Options has a strong culture in a growing industry.really nice coworkers, they make the job easier"
good,Entrepreneurial environment. High speed. results oriented. Very successful. Mission oriented. Great compensation package and good benefits.
good,"Intense, challenging and great opportunity to learn. Fast moving environment. Opportunity to grow with the company."
good,Alexion has been a good place to work. The job I held was interesting and my boss was invested with my development. The cross-functional collaboration displayed at the site I worked at was impressive. Fellow employees really all pulled in the same direction.
good,Much of the management was replaced.   Seems to be on a better tack now.   Decisions by managers cancelled decisions by design.   Director of my department did not know what he was doing re science and regulations related to bioanalysis.
good,Some really poor Senior leadership decisions put the company under sever financial pressure. This pressure lead to downsizing and a complete 180 on all the workplace enhancements programs. The atmosphere in the company changed radically from a positive forward looking one to a negative uncertain distracted one.
good,"Understand if you go in as a contractor and if you are not hired on with in the first year. You will be let go after 18 months. This is the only reason why I didn't give them a better rating. I worked hard to get hired but in the long run, they didn't want to keep me on and they would just give me the run around as I was looking for a full-time position. Not once did they tell me until the very end."
good,"I was a Sr. Administrative Coordinator (Contractor) at Alexion Pharmaceuticals in New Haven, CT.  I supported the Senior Vice President of Global Drug Safety and learned a lot about that aspect of the business.  My boss was wonderful to work for as well as the team I supported.  "
good,"Would not want to work there again, extremely stressful for the work. Long hours and working frequently without breaks. The people were generally very good and a pleasure to work with"
good,"Développement limité"
good,"There are many factors that set Alexion apart from other biopharmaceutical companies, but above all is the intimate connection they share with patients. They are the Guiding Star and they serve them every day with their hearts and minds."
good,"Alexion challenges you to work outside of your ""typical"" comfort zone. "
good,"A great team atmosphere, supportive culture, and strived for compliance.  Staff a pleasure to work with, hard working, understood what we did was for the patient."
good,A great team comradery with a common goal.  It was my pleasure to work with such dedicated employee's.  Our efforts gave people with blood disorders a good piece of mind.
good,Very supportive for new ideas and processes. Hands on training is great. Very informative place to work for. Chances for going up in the company are higher than most.
good,"There has been constant leadership change since I've arrived. My direct department is good, but they have hired from outside due to constant upper management change."
good,"Alexion is a very fast-paced work environment. We put patients needs first, many times above our own, to get the trials enrolled and completed, with the intention of health authority approval."
good,Benefits are very good. Good learning curve. Too much of Hectic work. It has grown from small company to big in very few years. Lots of new technologies to learn.
good,"des collaborateurs professionnels et solidaires"
good,"I enjoyed my time over at Alexion, however i never really felt like i fit in over there. It's very clicky, and even my boss was that way. As far as the workload is concerned, its a good mix and will keep you on your toes. Expect overtime, its a must!"
good,"I was not there long enough to get through the learning curve, almost, but not close enough.  Great people to work for and with.  I really felt honored to work there."
good,"I worked at Alexion for 15 years.  I was able to work for a fast pace growing company who grew from 200 employees to over 400 global employees.  I was able to gain global experience working with offices located around the globe.  The work was challenging and fast paced, but the work was rewarding."
good,Expériences très enrichissante. Structure en développement
good,"I have recently completed a contingency contract with Alexion and found the company extremely vibrant, scientifically solid, creative and full of untapped potential in the rare disease arena, including biotherapeutics , RNA technologies and small molecule diversification."
good,Company was ok to work for and offered great benefits. Typical day was receiving and inventory of chemicals at three different warehouses.  Company is now closed and moved the current RI location to Ireland.
good,"Scheduled work and unscheduled emergency work, learned how to respond with discipline and efficient decision. work with skilled professional supervisor and manager. Alexion is very demanding and the need of ownership is important but very rewarding. The hardest part of the job is to plant work with production demand. The most enjoyable part of that job is the reward of making the different for the patient."
good,As a US based company we have to work late nights and some times login at 4.00 Pm and logoff by 1 am at night.Co workers are mostly your population. It was tough for me to mix and mingle with them.
good,"Alexion is a fast-paced, forward-thinking business environment where any individual can be the source of the next strategic initiative. I developed significant depth and breadth of knowledge and skills while serving in the Global Operations Group. I completed my time with the company by transferring to Dublin, Ireland to start the International Operations there while also simultaneously transferring my role as well."
good,"Muy buena experiencia en la negovciacin con las gerencias hospitalarias, y autoridades sanitarias de las diferentes comunidades, para el manejo de enfermedades ultra-raras y productos huerfanos."
good,"Must have a passsion for rare diseases, is so this is your place. Outstanding Senior management team. Fast paced"
good,Alexion was a great place to work if you can handle the 12 hour shifts and work weekends. There a lot of good people in the company I have nothing bad to say about Alexion.
good,Worked with great people. However unfortunately poor management and HR team.
good,"While it isn't always quiet in the office during day shifts, it is always a supportive atmosphere in which to work. Co-workers are very helpful and eager to make the office an excellent and supportive place to work."
good,Fun and fast pace environment.  Very patient-centric for those who are passionate about their work.  Soliris is a great life saving medication for various indications
good,"Alexion is a company with big changes coming, with the relocation to MA from CT. This will serve them well with the access to a greater talent pool. A good place to work in the drug development world."
good,"Good place to work. Some good workers. some take too many breaks. But the company is moving its operations somewhere else."
good,It's a good place to work as the compensation is good but there are fewer opportunities for career development. The work environment is good and the team members are also helpful.
good,"I enjoy working at this company.  My dept has friendly people, we feel good about the transformative drugs that are available to patients.   There have many changes but working to weather them as change is inevitable"
good,"* Every day is a new challenge "

good,"Records Management; archival support, scanning, filling and retrieval of cGXP documents"
good,"Company experiencing tremendous growth, so lots of potential for hard working dedicated employees."
good,Wonderful company to work for - they are a team and work nicely with one another.  I would recommend this company -= kudos to them
good,"Wonderful workplace with a great culture. Given this is a biotech company, a lot of strategic shifts in the company's direction make this a risky career option."
good,"Salary and Benefits are among the best"

good,"Aprendi como podemos fazer a diferença na vida de muitas pessoas, o quanto precisamos ser efetivos para que possamos salvar mais vidas."
good,Fast paced and demanding work environment but Management does truly care about and appreciate its staff and rewards them occasionally for their hard work.
good,Great company to work for. Plenty of opportunities to grow with the company. Excellent leadership team. Dedicated to help patients with rare to ultra rare conditions.
good,"Its a great company to work at as long as your not a temp, then you get nothing!! No vacation, no raises, no overtime. Dont be a temp. They will tell you they will make you permanent, but they wont."
good,I loved working at Alexion. My job was interesting and challenging. My co-workers were a great team and family. My medical benefits were excellent. The environment was extremely pleasant.
good,"Currently undergoing major restructuring; company headquarters is moving to Boston.  However, I find the science they are involved in to to be very interesting."
good,Alexion's vision and mission is one unparalleled with any other bio pharma company.  The staff here is passionate and dedicated at 150% to the work and research performed here. As a member of the staff here it fills me with pride to know that in one way or another we all play a huge role in the success of the company and the impact it has for the patients and families affected by ultra rare and rare diseases.
good,typical day started in by checking calander entry for upcoming deliveries and checking the warehouse. Planning and scheduling operations around the warehouse.
good,The new Alexion building has state of the art technology with a very accepting work environment. The young work force continues to push people to be competitive in their respective jobs.
good,"Love my job!  I learn every day, the  diversity is awsome. I speak to others in different countries, learn new cultures. management is knowledgable.  I am blessed to have this career."
good,Hand on heart one of the best companies I've had the opportunity to work for - was on a fixed term contract and my only regret was that there was a hiring freeze when it was due to be renewed. It was an honour to work for a company that puts the patient first and really makes a difference.
good,The main asset are the people. It is a fun and collaborative environment although very quick-paced. If yiu enjoy challenges and love working with people this is the place to be. On the downside - changes tend to shake the company often
good,"Excellent working place. "
good,A very fast pace environment with a start up feeling. Everyone is very helpful. The hardest part was making sure patients were not left behind.The best part of the job was knowing that you saved a life.

good,Best gig I ever had so far in life...thankful for the opportunities they gave me to learn in grow. The benefits and pay were excellent especially for around Athens.
good,Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a great company to work for.  Great work/life balance and benefit package.  Casual yet professional atmosphere.
good,"No day is the same,Working in commercial operations requires every item to be addressed immediately as the distribution flow can not be distributed. With this being said a current day in the office could be from having to arrange meetings globally and locally utilizing the most current video conferencing technologies, while trying to schedule with regard to current time zones and previous engagements on invitees calendars.Thus my ability to work closely with my peers from our global locations has allowed me to do successfully inmost cases less then 24 hours. The current management team I support are fantastic and have been wonderful mentors for me.  The staff in the department have come to rely on my smile and kind words even when it is my hundredth time teaching them how to do some simple task. The hardest part of my job is not feeling as tough there is much potential for growth as after being in the same position for over two years and taken over all the responsibilities that could be passed off. The most enjoyable part of my job is to work with such a fantastic team that the countless hours and sleepless nights are worth it when we all pull together and pull together and make miracles happen."
good,"Great place to work, flexibility in working hour. I enjoyed working there, great place for learning. Expect changes but in overall one the best Company to work for."

good,"Working at Alexion is an experience of a lifetime. The room for advancement is provided as long as you are diligent and proficient. I completely enjoy what i do on a daily basis, which is compiling and submitting documents for clinical trials. I have worked with FDA during inspections, individual investigational sites. I have learned a tremendous amount about ultra-rare blood disease; working with project lead and data management I learned how to complete a case report form, queries entries, and clean data for presentation to FDA for Submission of INDs and BLAs."
