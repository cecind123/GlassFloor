rating,review
bad,I was working as a contractor and I also provide leads to other representative agent at the helpdesk.  My contract ends so I have to go onto another contract work.
bad,"trabajo en esta empresa y gano poco y todo es una repulsivo..es un ambiente toxico"
bad,This was an enjoyable job experience as my manager let me learn and grow to suit my personality and work skill-sets.
bad,"If you enjoy being mistreated and judged by management as well as fellow associates, then by all means this is the job for you. Otherwise stay away! This company has fell into a decrepit state that has been driven by poor management!"
bad,"Loved the job,and some of my co workers.team leaders were ok to.once you put some of them in there place and you were,nt going to take there s hit.BUT supervisors, administrators,and management were a bunch of a ssholes.if you don't kiss there a ss they will make s hit up to get rid of you."
bad,Unless you like working six days a week and some times twelve hour days on top of that. This place has gone down hill and no end in sight. It gets really old after the last 3 to 4 years.
bad,"This used to be a place you would have pride in telling your family and friends you worked for...not any more. Management treats you as replaceable, supervisors have no training, HR tries to deny you benefits that you are entitled to because of who you are. Too many pizza parties in the office and not enough management on the floor. The place needs a clean up crew to come in and take over. All of the great supervisors have left for better opportunities."
bad,"Un día típico comienza con algunos ejercicios físicos como relajación. Después de esto se nos indica las actividades a realizar, surtidos, acomodo, embarque o desembarque de material. Hay un horario especifico para el almuerzo y dos pequeños descansos mas. "
bad,"Esta empresa deixa a desejar em alguns aspectos , que são o treinamento profissional para a melhor capacitação dos funcionários , salários abaixo do mercado de trabalho e desvalorização dos funcionários.   "
bad,"Poor trainings, lack of guidance."
bad,Worst management ive ever worked for.employees are mostly fast food failures that get promoted by complaining and turning in other employees for petty and childish things
bad,"This company really knows how to ""jerk you around"". There is WAY too many ""upper management"" and not enough care about you. It's every man for themselves, OR, if you happen to know a manager then you come in ahead of those who have been there longer and actually KNOW the job. But f you have connections and no experience at all, well then, this is the job place for you. They don't care about those that actually bust the hump and do the work, they just like pointing fingers and fobbing off their work onto others and never taking ownership of their mistakes."
bad,No good job that dont care about there employees just there company. They will get rid you for anything. Dont care about personal issues just there production. They can kiss my you know what.
bad,if you looking to advance in a company don't go there period. Management is below average. Human Resource is a joke. Supervision is par at best. Pay is the best thing this company can offer.
bad,"Horrible work culture both with Management and floor people.  People are cut-throat and toxic and protected by friendships with promoted supervisors.  If you dont fit in or go along with the toxic atmosphere you will be singled out and either leave or be terminated or threatened.  Poor decision making by floor supervision who are ""blocker"" in the company, meaning: they do not have the skill or education to move up.  They do recognize service to the company with awards."
bad,Management is terrible their and is very unfair they pick and choose who gets away with things their is so much favoritism so I would not recommend any one going their to get a job
bad,"Boss strongly encourage people they like over ability.  Thus having weak leaders trying to make key decisions.  Leadership was lacking in credibility and trust.  Lately our hours have been cut with no advance notification,  the secret is kept until the last possible moment, even texted after leaving."
bad,"Average company, it is what you make it. Relatively good about promoting from within. management is not hired from inside, always from outside the company."
bad,Work wise and co workers are good.  Just can't have a life outside of work.  Will go on stretches of 10 hr days and 8 on Saturdays for months.   And then will get slow and offer lack of work to people.    Then before they even come back your on overtime again because they can't manage there workforce and have to many off.   Management must love you to work overtime.  We had 21 people in our department and then they fire and lay off and move people to other departments to where were down to 13.   After going a while just working 7-3 we go to staying caught up to then cutting us down and 2 hours later overtime is posted and having to work 6 days a week again.   Completely ridiculous.   Plus then when the plant manager is talking to workers he laughs about it and says at least we broke a record and didnt have to work the 1st Saturday after letting people go because every other time he ever has hes made people.    It's like you don't mean anything to them and they can just joke around about taking people's jobs away from them.    Plus do it 1-2 weeks before there 6 months so they can't draw unemployment on them.   I do not recommend this place at all. 13 of us is left and at least 6 is looking for new jobs.
bad,"Management has no respect towards line workers, You do not have an option to be involved in family life. Punish those who are on FMLA. Only care about the bottom line and could care less how they get their bonuses and whos back it breaks to get them."
bad,"Too many clicks, too much favoritism, poor management. They will go out of their way to dig up any dirt on an employee to get them demoted or fired. Regardless of work performance."
bad,"Hard work for hourly workers.Benefits ok ,pay is minimal.Profits rule."
bad,"They do not care about any employees that are below the engineers, supervisors and managers. Low pay across the floor for years. Your life and work balance means nothing to these people .Go here as a last resort."
bad,Poor management unable to grow in the company showed a lot of favoritism higher ups did not want to listen to you about the issues that went on in your dept.
bad,"manager and supervisors with no experience in the field .non inclusion culture ,manager expect lower employees to come up with all ideas and innovations but no recognition or compensation ."
bad,"move you around a lot , management not clued in to work operations, no respect for employees"
bad,"Donaldson Company was a great company to work for at one point.  At one point, their product was so much superior to the competition that it was the easy choice for employment.  Competition has caught up, however, and DCI is behind the times when it comes to employee benefits.  There is no autonomy in this business.  There are no progressive thinkers here.  It is still expected that you spend exorbitant hours at the office and none to the leaders think a role can be accomplished outside of the office on occasion.  They are also on the low side of the pay range for the twin cities area.  I wish I would have left the company sooner."
bad,"I was an Engineer there for almost 10 years.  Long ago, it was a decent place to work."
bad,"This Donaldson hired 400 new employees to get them out of the hole their 200 long-term employees put them in, then laid off the employees that got them out of the hole, only to be left with the people that put them in the hole in the first place..."
bad,I’ve never worked so much overtime and seen so many employees walk in and walk out we started working ten hour shifts even my line cut out a second shift and then picked up every Saturday l
bad,Spent 3 years being a number not really a person. Management is comprised mainly of engineers that are so very disconnected from their employees.
bad,"A lot if turn over with all employees. Most people use this company to gain experience and then move on to a better job. As a machinist, a new employee makes more money than someone that has been here for 30 years.(shift premium)"
bad,My supervisor at the time was abusive . He treated the workers bad . He  created a hostile working environment. The pay and benefits was great. Worked a lot of hours.
bad,"Let me just say, that I do not enjoy or feel comfortable bad mouthing an employer or former employer.  It simply has ended up not to be a good fit for me for future employment.  I recently realized that I do not fit into the current management ideology."
bad,"A very toxic management structure.   While there are a couple of decent supervisors the majority prefer to do whatever they want regardless of what is in the contract.  If you file a grievance against them for a violation expect possible repercussions.  It is also not uncommon to hear from them if you don't like it take a point or be threatened with the pulling of your scan card if a disagreement occurs.   While it is preached about respect and decency there are a few supervisors who regularly fly off the handle and scream at group leaders or anyone else they decided upset them off.  Hopefully the new Plant Manager will be involved on the floor and turn things around otherwise it will continue to degrade in quality.   It has gotten so bad that people that have been there 5, 10. 15 years are leaving to go other places to work.   Giving up benefits and seniority for a more pleasant work environment. It is really sad that a company that was once so great to work for has degraded into what it is and from what I hear from those still working there continues to degrade to.  If you take a job here good luck and do what most of the new hires do watch for something better while making decent pay."
bad,"As a welder, you get paid well if you can get hours.    "
bad,"I enjoyed what I did, it just got to be way too much on my plate without the needed support."
bad,It is very hot in the  plant. Due to a lot of mismanagement it is hard to get your 40 hours  a week.  Things are always going down  so you get sent home early ALOT. Then work on Saturday for straight time! Management  shows alot of favoritism. They do have good  benefits.
bad,I really enjoyed working at Donaldson despite the poor salary. Most of my co-workers got along with each other making it a friendly and fun place to work.
bad,"empresa que motiva los valores de la seguridad, pero no los aplica por cuestiones monetarias o cuestiones de produccion."
bad,"Many skilled people and interesting work, management has gradually grown remote and controlling to the point that little can now be achieved going forward. Employee benefits have been cut year over year and ongoing layoffs have destroyed much of the good-will of employees. The company has forgotten that customers and employees are as important as shareholders."
bad,Outdated processes and procedures continually resulting in loss of market share and upper management who suffers from corporate double-speak - talk about top line growth but still in cost-reduction mode for profitability.
bad,"I really enjoy the people that I work with.  Most work very hard at doing their jobs while having fun doing it.  Being a member of a Value Stream Steering Team in 3 different departments, I have learned more about Lean Manufacturing, safety, and processes.  The most difficult part of my job is when people do not seem to understand the ideas and concepts that we are supposed to be using on the production floor.  The most enjoyable part of my job is simply knowing that I did everything I did each day to help our department."
bad,The coordinator and team leaders were very rude. got trained on the fastest line in 3 days and was expected to perform my job with no mistakes at a fast pace.
bad,"Very tough work environment. Management was very rude, very hard to work for. The money was great but the stress level was not worth it. Work really long hours and you only get every other Sunday off. Managment really needs to work on their people skills."
bad,"Worked long hours, on call 24/7, had to take work with me on vacation, roles that I was not trained for or qualified for were thrust upon me, given roles that amounted to basically several full time positions, and I could go on. I do not recommend working there."
bad,"Not the most organized, takes a person willing to learn on their own.  Up and down sales,  very operator dependent.  Fast pased limited budget."
bad,"Needed improvement on management skills and careless towards residents."
good,"I worked at Donaldson while in college. I had hoped to get advancement, but they would not move me out of my department. I had to look outside the company."
good,"Constant fire fighting, with external and internal customers. Everyone is expected to do more than their job title requires to make management happy and leave visitors/customers impressed."
good,Its stressful and has poor management. It has a poor environment with everyone working against each other instead of with each other.it does have good pay for the area.
good,hardest part of the job is to work under pressure although I got use to it. Anyway management gave me good instructions to follow in order to see myself out of the pressure. Most enjoyable part of the job is the more faster you work the more you feel relieved
good,This company has a great group of people to work with.  Management is often stressed out due to reporting requirements from the top office.  Great work life balance.
good,Not a bad job. It could be stressful. A very fast pace job. Usually worked about every Saturday. Not a lot of room for advancement. Decent pay and benefits. Got 2 weeks of vacation.
good,"I've had several positions within this company and given small opportunities to grow.  The development environment is lacking the necessary support from management.  My current role has given me great exposure to our global regions so I would really like to visit, develop relationships, and train my coworkers/colleagues on their home turf."
good,As far as training staff upper management did not have the skills nor knowledge of position. Had another employees training which they did not know the job function as a whole
good,"not focused on customers.  Management more concerned about moving the wrong people into middle management.  Directors do not stay long enough to see strategies through."
good,"Alot of overtime, fair pay, nice hours, it is a very fast paced environment, benefits are pretty good, mainly repetitive work, very hot in summer, management needs work"
good,Depending on the department you are working in determines your experience.  The Finance team lacks maturity and trust in their team.  They do not promote from within and is a click.  You must be of the popular group to get recognition and advancement.   The leadership is more concerned about their own personal growth and opportunity and leaves the other behind and does not foster a collaborative environment or growth.  Extremely immature.
good,Was an amazing place to work. Amazing co workers that knew how to work. Can’t say the same about management all they cared about was overworking their employees. We worked on an average of 66 hours. They took away our vacation for Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the entire office staff was off for the week. They stressed safety but put forth unnecessary rules that made regular procedures uneven more unsafe. My last month with the company management started to fire employees for no reason at all.
good,"There's great work life balance, the ability for you to advance in the company is at best poor. They have actually created positions and not posted for employees to apply or they post a position and then change the title after the person is hired."
good,ok place to work ...pay not so great and benefits are ok ...wish there was more opportunities there..its a small company with very little opportunities
good,"I worked for the “Industrial Air Filtration Division” of Donaldson for almost 15 years.  For the first five years of this time, the job was pretty good, actually enjoyable.  Even though working for Donaldson did not perceptibly become less than good until about 6 or 7 years into my career with them."
good,"I drove a forklift for Donaldson Company.  The plant that I worked in does not exist any longer as they have shut it down.  Was hot and dirty, but that is factory work."
good,Very challelleging job overseeing a specifc high security trade secret department.  This role includes al aspects of managing a plant/business.
good,Atypical day at work would be you would set your presses or machinery for the material and job you were working on. Ensure that it is good material and has good welds and measure properly to ensure that they fit the air filter body properly.
good,"I was let go do to an disagreement with a coworker. They let me go and let him stay  the co worker was a Male and threatened  me and caused alot of conflict and they let me go because I was not there as long as the other co worker was, and when they did  let me go they did it in a sly kind of way instead of being honest and upfront."
good,I loved working at Donaldson only thing bad i have to say is the management.They have people managing welding departments who don't know the difference from mig to tig let alone anything else.
good,"Decent place to work, but it happened to be going through a major overhaul while I was working there which made for some rough interactions with management."
good,Got to work at 5 oclock change clouths went to work station to set up the job tast for the day or  finish job from yesterday at 6oclock we had safety meeting .As we finnish one job we whould sighn out on it an start another..
good,Like most factors when I started it was a great place to work but over time it just became a 9 to 5. Management changed and so did the culture. A lot less employee friendly.
good,"Very friendly people work here . We all work on production lines as a team. Supervisors are very easy going if you do your job. Working 7 days a week right now. In all the years I've worked here, this happens and it's nice to save extra money."
good,Reason for applying for another job is that i travel too far. I need a job closer to home. I do like working for Donaldson. It is a nice environment to work in.
good,"My experience at this company has been very valuable, especially in the change management realm. I've had exposure to domestic and internaltional teams and business functions. The company doesn't invest in employee development. It also doesn't take many risks within the industries it's compelled to lead in."
good,"It depends on the department/division you work in."
good,"Do to it being a manufacturing plant they fill orders as needed, meaning, if there are no orders you have no work, but then a rush comes in and you're never off. I personally didn't't appreciate the uncertainty of hours. The pay was fair, an higher than the local competitors. Management higher than Team Lead or Supervisor are often unorganized and can very rarely give any indication of work order concerns and job security. However; if someone is very fast paced and has no other responsibilities outside of a career, Donaldson is pretty idealistic."
good,"Donaldson is a wonderful, great place to work for, they are a easy going factory, everyone is very relax, the bosses are easy to talk too, everyone is level headed"
good,Donaldson is a fast pace job and can be physically demanding at times. Most of the work is repetitive and requires a person to be fast and paying attention to detail all at one time in more than one work station. The gas that is produced when the parts are made causes lots of skin issues with lots of people that work there especially in the heat.
good,"currently manage over 50 employees, work at lest 10 hour days 5 to 6 days a week. lots of employee turn over which requires a lot of training and employee building efforts. taking care of your employees is the greatest benefit for me. hardest is working 6 days a week."
good,"I worked there night shift for almost a year.  Just were 10-6am.  Once you completed your training and felt comfortable in the position you are to be assigned to it wasn’t too bad.   Training was brutal.  Not organized.  Employees not helpful.   It’s your responsibility to learn your position and there really isn’t any guidance.  Especially your orientation period you are put wherever the made need you and they don’t take the time to rotate new employees through all departments.  Mandatory OT almost every weekend.  No PTO for new employees 1st year.  Strict on attendance.    They will work 21-36 days straight at times.  Little time for family unless you have time not the company and have accrued PTO.  Management had frequent turnovers.   Production floor has high turnover rate.   They are union and employees can get bumped from there position or shift with little notice. Time and a half on saturdays and double time on sundays regardless of hours worked during week.   Excellent benefits.  Stock options, FSA, HSA, 401k, increased hourly pay, and great insurance."
good,Good paying job but can’t hardly advance. Management isn’t good on communication I liked the hours for the most part. Easy job but very demanding on peak season
good,Typical day was spent spray painting military equipment. Learned to work with 100's of different types of paint. Management is willing to assure you are properly trained.
good,"I like the people and the overall environment. It's a job like any other with good days and bad days. You go there, work and they pay you. There's not much more to say."
good,"Work was good, People where relatively nice."
good,6 Day Job was the hardest part. Fun place to work other than that. Follow the schedule and run your machine to the best of your ability. Building gets really hot during the summer.
good,Good Company at the time on wall street. Not around anymore and hard to find a job like this again.  Would recommend working here if it was still around.
good,"good place to work, i recommend the place of employment to anyone to work. great benefits to include vacation, personal time off, stocks, and different investments"
good,I was  employed there .............. I liked first shift the people were nice............ first shift time goes by quickly people are nice and helpful
good,"Easy job, easy to work with people. Learned a lot about the company and how the air filters are built. They take their time to train you right."
good,"I loaded and  setup departments according to blueprint and route sheet. Assembled and welded items and got ready for painting or packaging.  Also included driving Forklift, using Overhead Crane and setting up presses as well as operation of , and maintaining my equip as well as helping others maintain theirs.    I learned to Weld with proficiency and to be a team player.  Management was stiff but fair.  This company and it's co-workers were like family all had many years of service. The hardest part of my job was the overtime required.  I really enjoyed the team work effort."
good,"Flexible hours (8-12), hard working employees, most supervisors treat you right.  Work atmosphere is decent for the most part. Maintenance shop is extremely short staffed."
good,"The people are great, but hard work and accomplishment are recognized with a pat on the back instead of advancement or additional compensation."
good,"Donaldson is a great company with excellent benefits. Nevertheless, I was micromanaged from day one and as a sales manager I was not able to optimize my skills and performance. I was still able to earn salary increases and merit bonuses."
good,"Face paced, time goes by quickly - never have nothing to do.  "
good,"Set up and machine operator. "
good,"Stressful job with long hours.  Expectations are very high, but management support is low.  Future goals of the next level management is to focus on Engineering and new products, while moving existing manufacturing operations off site, and likely out of the country."
good,I spent 17 years here so it couldn't have been too bad. It has great benefits and good wages. There are times of no overtime and then times of a lot of overtime. They are Union and have advancement and time off guidelines set. Having time off between Christmas and New Years Day was always nice! Production is just what it is.
good,Management makes all the difference.  Not all of them are good but my current management team is great.  Highly supportive and empowering while setting solid goals.  With their support and a lot of hard work I have finally fulfilled my original career goal by reaching Principal Engineer.  I love what I do and believe my department is making life better for all of the machine operators who will run the equipment we design.  The only real negative is the high level of travel required in this role.
good,"Great place to work unless you are looking for a career. This work changes with the seasons. Very strict about safety, which I like very much."
good,"Setup computerized machines to run and packed. I had good co-workers that always did their jobs just not good supervisor, he was on a power trip."
good,"When I started working there everything was fine and I liked it but then people found out about some stuff and would always try to get me and a close friend of mine in trouble. One day i was just casually wrapping pallets with my friend so the loaders could get them in the trailers and my friend gets called to the RF cage and gets in trouble for messing with the audit system, which he barely touched throughout the day. I liked this job but the people who work here are just a pain to work with."
good,Depending on job you are doing and I had enjoyable work environment for the majority of time while employed. some areas were very frustrating and hard on body. Amount of overtime could occasionally cause hard time with family and functions.
good,Loved working there because i am a self motivated individual. Stopped being fun when the company expanded and there was no compensation or added help.  Most employees are unappreciated for their hard work and years of working for the company.
good,this a real good way of learning new things and helping others as well. I really think that all the tools I learned  from several companies has allowed me to expand my special skills tremendously. I most definitely would like to help more co-workers in the future.
good,"I would have loved to reply about this a few years ago loved my Job ,now?????? This used to be the place you would try to get into! Now I feel it's just a job! Insurance has gotten worse, too many hours,no pension  no Xmas parties no nothing feel very unappreciated!!!!"
good,"no training, no growth, no job guarantee  "
good,"It was a good place to work till the company decided they were going to downsize, cutting half the staff. Alot of good people and fun environment to work in."
good,"Relaxed day at work with helping colleagues whenever needed."
good,"Decent pay, communication. Culture does have room for improvement. The company does seem to be heading in a better direction. They have treated me well and helped me to become the strong leader I am today."
good,"usine proche du domicile ( environ 15 min)."
good,"Much challenging work.  "
good,"You work almost every Saturday and office people never set limits for purchasing so the plant is always behind and management is always looking for a way to improve departments but tend to go nowhere. Ok place to work, could be a lot better"
good,"Company is stuck in the 80's & 90's in Culture and facilities. But, they are making strides to modernize the workplace and also benefits to attract the next generation of employees."
good,"Easy and challenging, great place to start a career. I've learn about packaging, date codes, and operating machine. Management is overall good. Friendly coworkers and hard working. Nothing really hard about it and i enjoy most when operating a machine where i check my own work."
good,"It's a place where there is a lot of job daily assisting 3 production plants and 1 distribution center."
good,Felt like coworkers were very knowledgeable and professional. Typical dad report to manager and grab folders to complete changes and projects as they come. Go over what is needed expected from manager. Complete each task as quickly as possible. Proffread work and return.
good,"I enjoyed working with the great employees and customers here.  The pay was good, good perks with paid dinners and lunches, training and travel quarterly.  Poor managers."
good,Donaldson was extremely good to me during my years there. They went out of there way to help my family when needed. I appreciate the people who work at the Nicholasville plant. The workers are extremely intelligent and nice.
good,Donaldson is a great company with great people is outside sales roles. Listen to the senior sales people and you will learn faster than you can imagine.  They will also give you fantastic insights into how they sell (which is a very confusing way to go to market) but it WORKS.  Upper management likes to shuffle people around.
good,"I would like to be in a woking environment thats positive."
good,Was a very great place to work along with some very good people. I would recommend people who live near them to give it a shot. Alot of good ways to move up in the management system.
good,"Work safe, work efficient, focus on quality.  Keep a positive attitude.  good Attendance is important.  Good certification opportunities.  I prefer to make no further comments"
good,Enjoyed the job very much and looked forward to each day. The upper management were great and easy to interface with. The middle management left a lot to be desired.
good,"I enjoyed working at Donaldson, the culture is generally really good. There was always something interesting to be working on but at them moment the business is struggling so there is push to be more innovative but I don't feel they have the tools or patience to do so at this point. You don't ever get promotions,  you are expected to apply for a new position if you want a promotion, you don't just get bumped up to the next level after doing a good job. That was extremely frustrating because I liked where I was at and didn't want to move to another group."
good,"Processing orders, answering inbound calls. "
good,ottima azienda che è cresciuta tantissimo negli anni una multinazionale di successo che è riuscita a farcela nonostante la crisi.
good,Enjoyed working  here. Learned  a lot. Job evolved over time  to  a position  that was challenging and different each day. Benefits are good. People  are great. Hard work but compensated fairly.
good,"Donaldson is a good and stable place to work, but struggles with truly offering work and life balance to its employees.  The money is fair for the job and the area."
good,"Management just wanted everyone to do their job and leave them alone. You couldn’t come to them with issues, even if the issues were affecting your everyday work.  They would brush everything off and wouldn’t deal with anything."
good,"Excelente empresa, continua creciendo conforme la demanda de los productos fabricados."
good,"They need to figure out how to give people at least 2 weekends off each month - permanently."
good,Can be fun place to work at times. Sometimes relaxed and sometimes hectic work. Benefits will beat or equal most companys. Hours are good. Management strategies could be better. Ability to bid on different positions. 10 minute breaks every 2 hours with a 30 minute lunch.
good,"A 100 year old, large international company that feels small and non-corporate. People are generally very nice and cooperative. The down side is that the company has not been doing well in recent years."
good,"Donaldson, is a fun a challenging environment to work for."
good,A typical eight hour day production job manufacturing products (air filters) on a rotational assembly line.  Worked with other operators to insure a quality product is made and exceeds customer needs and satisfactions.  Learned a lot about root cause analysis to identify and fix issues involving machinery and quality.  Management was fairly easy to get along with most days and almost all other employees were great to work with.  Had the best benefits of any job I'd ever had but was sometimes difficult to work at a fast pace during a hot/humid day.
good,"Donaldson is a successful, fiscally conservative company with strong values. They are not known to excessively compensate employees but treat them well and promote within the organization."
good,"I knew when I arrived at work everyday that there would be a new challenge for me to deal with, in the manufacturing world it is a constant change with customer orders and plant expectations."
good,"Left do to ankle injury"
good,Alot of changes going on some skill used to be involved in the job but Donaldson has really dumbed it down so anyone can come in an get it done. Overall the work is easy and benefits are great so no complaints there. Only complaints are with the supervisors. Their more worried about their bonus checks than actually running the shift. They don’t understand how to delegate the work and are always running their mouths to multiple employees creating animosity among the crew and shifts. Other than them it’s a great place to work
good,"Welding cutting with a touch and other hand tools."
good,Management at Donaldson is very good and encouraging.  There is no such thing as a typical day at work! The culture working at Donaldson is great and they really promote a team environment.
good,"Planeación robusta y objetios bien establecidos a largo plazo, excelentes beneficios laborales y ambiente retador, nulo liderazgo por ejemplo, imponiendo actitudes que no demuestran"
good,If you are looking for a good paying job and benefits then Donaldson’s is for you. They have multiple jobs that you can apply for which keeps things fresh if you are looking for something new.
good,"As a filter manufactor, there was a rotating time frame for each station on the line. Line would use media and wire mesh, to create media paks. There were diffent lines also, paint line, macheing, inspecting, trouble shooting reworking products. Fast pace, needed to be alert at all times, as to never let the line shut down."
good,"flexible start times available (7a-4p / 8a-5p / 9a-6p)"
good,"Bonne culture d'entreprise en général. Entrée chez DONALDSON, c'est faire partie d'une grande famille. On adhère ou pas."
good,"Excelente relacion con el gerente de produccion por lo que la sinergia entre Produccion, Calidad y Procesos fue muy benefica para el logro del cumplimiento de la calidad con los objetivos de produccion. "
good,Todo bien solo que no hay categorias y solo hay aumentos de sueldo una vez al año
good,Donaldson has a great company culture that fosters a healthy work/life balance and creates a productive and successful environment.
good,"Se requiere ser un profesional de alto desempeño, con mucha disciplina y liderazgo para poder sobre salir en esta empresa."
good,"You have the ability to work at your on paste. No one ever breaths down your back. It's a very hot plant but you are pretty much to yourself.

good,"My experience was as a full time employee, it's my understanding that the I.T. department is moving to more outsourced employees, however when I was there it was more of a family feel.  With the retirement of the more ""Donaldson Raised"" leadership the focus changed to more of a typical corporation environment."

good,Donaldson is a great company but they are going through financial difficulties and laying off people. Lots of opportunity to advance in the company.
good,"It was a good place to work for. People were friendly and the teamwork was typically strong. Like all businesses though, money is the end goal and sometimes the only way they can achieve the profit they need is unfortunately to cut good people loose"

good,This is a great place to work even if you know nothing about filtration. The company still feels like a family business even though it is 75 years old and a global business. A lot of room for advancement both vertically and horizontally.
good,"Learnt to work autonomously and to manage important key accounts. "
good,Full cycle recruiter in a corporate evironment.  Enjoy meeting new people and meeting the needs of the candidate and matching their skills to great organizations with great opportunities
good,"I learned a great deal about starting with sheets of raw steel (cold roll, hot roll, stainless, carbon) and transforming them into a quality product, all with the use of heavy machinery, equipment and hand-held power tools, but without the use of automated processes. I therefore learned the value of working safely and neatly. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing all departments work together as a whole in meeting our production, delivery and safety goals set for each month. I also enjoyed working different shifts around the clock, and working lots of overtime. We were forced to work very hard and long hours because of our high production goals. Probably for that reason management was fairly lenient and tolerant. My coworkers were some of the hardest working people whom I have ever had the pleasure to work with. We pulled together everyday to get the job done. Though I was assigned to the machinery department, I learned many different skills by occasionally rotating through the various departments within the factory to help fill in where needed. I think the hardest part was working safely with large pieces of sharp edged steel. Much of the time these had to be moved by hand. Cuts and bruises were pretty common among everyone. Some of those had to be treated by a physician's care. The most rewarding part of the job for me was seeing how I could ""form up"" flat pieces of steel into a three dimensional cabinet, all from a set of prints."
good,"Checked production schedule, talked with previous shift supervisor  and with operators about our plan. I learned a great deal about manufacturing, quality and how to make people successful. Most managers were really good but there was a couple who did things so they could justify their existence. The culture was pretty good since I had a good working relationship with the operators and most managers. The hardest part of the job was the amount of daily meetings we were required to attend (all day) along with being told to spend 60% of your time managing the floor. The operators were self sufficient so my job was easy and I enjoyed rolling my sleeves up and getting in the trenches to work with them"
good,Good company to work for. Pay is very competitive with surrounding companies plus great benefits package. Coworkers are friendly and easy to get along with plus willing to teach the job to anyone new thoroughly before letting them do it on their own

The tasks were like, no micro managing. I felt like my work was helping Air Liquid solutions, R&D all  around the world."
good,One of the best companies I have worked for until the upper level manager was transfered. The environment then became toxic and employees began losing tbere jobs due to the selfish new uneducated leader that thought he knew everything and no one could tell him any different.
good,"Donaldson Was an awesome company to work for, I enjoyed it and the pay was good, I bid for the welder position and got it pay went from $9.to $18 and hr. I was the first female welder in the Auburn facility."
good,Was one of the best places I've had the pleasure of working at. Sure management and the hours sometimes sucked. But we were all like a second family. Hardest part I would have to say is sometimes coming in and not knowing if your going to work an 8 or a 10 hour shift.
good,Overall a very knowledgeable work environment and internship set up previously. Lots of professional experience to be gained in the short 3 month contracts.
good,I'd come into work and print out schedules for my depts. Walk to the floor and check that I have all employees accounted for in each dept. Set up the order to run the schedule in order to make ship dates. Meet with the other supervisors to make sure we can run all lines efficiently. 9am we would get together with management to assure there is efficient work for the next shift coming in @ 3:30pm. I would say the hardest part of my job was having to send employees home when there was not enough work. The enjoyable part is to see the smiles on the faces when I participate and help or when they reach goal.

good,Majority of my day was spent talking to business clients regarding their positions of their portfolios and what was available within their risk parameters to replace called and/or expiring trades.
good,"Since working at Donaldson Co I have gained much experience in the manufacturing field. I have Learned about processes of ordering to designing new machines, gettting projects approved, quality improvement, Cost Reduction and much more. I learned that some ideas may not work the first time, modifactions may need to be made, and that jobs may not be completed as soon as I would like. The best thing I was able to take from this company was the experience. Working with the other engineers and learning of what my duties as a manufacturing engineer were, was the most benefitial thing I had recieved from this company."
good,"I work in an area of 4 people in this area, one is running the machine, I am with the other 3 and we exchange our job every hour: one person cuts and glues the paper, one uses seam sealer to seal the glue to the paper and the other funnels the paper into the metal part of the filter. The hardest part of the job is funneling the paper into the metal part, cause there is a technique to getting it to pop up and as its popped up to slide it off the table and into the metal part of the filter. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, the job itself and the hours. My boss was the best, when things were rough on the job he would still have a sweet personality toward my co-workers and myself"
good,This was the best place to learn from the ground up.  Management was always attentive and in line with your needs.  The day went by quickly and you always were involved in the team effort to put out a good product.
