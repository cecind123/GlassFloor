bad,"- Schicht übernehmen, selber neue Bestellungen bearbeiten, Schicht abgeben"
bad,"This place has horrible management the lie all the time and the have people that don't anything about managing people,I only worked there because I desperately needed a job."
bad,Managers you're all liars from the bottom all the way to the top they sell y'all falls dreams and think you're going to have job security for a long time they're full of s***
bad,"If you are part of ITAD services at Arrow, there is no chance for promotion, fair pay or doing anything interesting. Managers/engineers are lazy & don't care."
bad,"Arrow used to be a great company to work for, but since relocating to Colorado, the company is a shell of its former self. All the managers are poor.  Do not except a job at his company!!!!!!!"
bad,not a good place to work- i cant tell you how bad it was. please dont ask me any more questions on this topic. thank you very much. hope you find the right job
bad,Bad work environment. No focus. No leadership. No training. Horrible Management and culture. No one knew what they were doing. Bad benefits and perks.
bad,I was signed for 6 months temp to hire but there are people in my group who have been here over a year and they are still temp. No holiday pay or benefits for temps here. I am looking for something better. This company could easily afford to hire permanent employees but their only concern is the bottom line.
bad,"A poor place to work, did not agree with culture and outsourcing of all employees. negative working environment and does not foster an environment of fairness."
bad,"The people are nice, but the company is so bad. They let people hanging , not giving them full time, and they get rid of them without ever looking at their performances. Performances don't matter which did not drive motivations at work.."
bad,"A day usually goes by pretty quick"
bad,Terrible place to work. High turnover. Racism thrives here! They will cheat you on hours pay and benefits. This place will break you down! No time off for anything! 03 cent raises per year even after 5 years is a joke. HR and legal department are dishonest.
bad,"Arrow Electronics is a Fortune 500 Company, as such they encompass the typical negative outcomes of “Corporate America”. You are a number. Decisions are made by upper management, who have no clue what the outcomes will be when implemented to lower levels. The company has 24 Billion in revenue; yet raises are small (if any) and holiday parties are a thing of the past. There is no room for growth."
bad,"Arrow electronics bought out what was originally  TechTurn and ended up closing it down shortly after,thus leaving everyone scrambling to find a new job"
bad,Was not a good experience working at Arrow. They have low pay you will not be able to retire working here unless you are in upper management. Good place to start out of college.
bad,"The management, up to the director level, in the AIS division was the worst I have ever experienced. "
bad,Management is clueless lacking in accountability.  Very little opportunity to advance and literally no training.    Low tech for a high tech company.    Awful work/life balance at quarter end.  Lousy base salary and dismal commission structures.
bad,A lot of unhappy people. No real work/life balance. Several departments cannot even get their basic job functions completed correctly or timely. Management and leadership do not make the necessary changes to improve the company.  HR is about 90% outsourced - if you have a problem they will give you a 1-800 number to call.
bad,"that company don't give a care about the employee at the bottom of the line chain, the ones that really make money for arrow electronics"
bad,Horrible company with terrible leadership. I would advise to never work there! VPs are a dime a dozen there and have no idea how to lead or treat their team
bad,"Arrow has major issues with the hours the employees work. You never know when you'll start and when your day will end, it's not a set schedule, it's all by ear. It's extremely frustrating especially since each supervisor tells you something different. Supervisors are completely incompetent. They really do not care about how hard you work. This company tends to focus more on punishing their employees. If you talk you get a write up, you miss a day you get a write up, you are constantly punished no matter how good you are at your job. I do not recommend working for this company. People tend to quit after a week of working here. Either not enough money or over working. They make it near impossible to move up in the company. Honestly worst company to work for."
bad,"Aangenomen voor andere activiteiten als die ik dagelijks moest uitvoeren, op activiteiten waar ik niet voor was aangenomen daar wordt je op beoordeeld"
bad,"zero benefits for temp to hire workers, no company culture. recent accounting graduate and when I was excelling at job- manager marginalized every thing I did to maintain her year-out hire plan. scrutinized daily by the manager to the point I was told my laugh was disrupting."
bad,This was supposed to be a temporary position till I found something in my field of experience. They have a huge turnover. Poor work conditions. I do not recommend this company.
bad,I felt like a slave working here. The co workers was very disrespectful I was over excited when job ended
bad,"I'm so glad to have left this life sucking place.  There is no chance for advancement unless you suck up and are a yesman.  Want to sleep your way to the top?  They can do that too.  Supervisors and managers are rotated so fast that you will not get a yearly review from the same one you had at the start of the year.  Then when you don't get a raise, they'll give you the ""work with me this year"" speech.  "
bad,Awful company to work for. Terrible management. Upper management realizes the lower tier are peons and treats them as such. However if you like getting dueced on at work this is the company for you.
bad,This is a terrible company to work for and they are constantly changing the rules. They will not train you on the new and up coming systems so if you go to work there expect no training.
bad,Was never a good place to work. Poor pay and worse benefits. They provided a sabbatical which was great but now it's gone too
bad,"they will over burden you from the onset.  If given 100 items to task   if 99 are done , you will receive no praise or thanks for completing the 99 but only get discouraging remarks for the 1 that was not attained. "
bad,"Awful company to work for, they don't care about the employees,  just the money they getting from our hard working.  Unfair pays . The only good thing was my supervisor and my co-workers. that was the thind that made the job better"
bad,"If you don't have ambition it's a place for you. If you want to be treated fair and have ambition look for a more professional company cause you deserve better than Arrow Electronics B.V. Because here you are only a number that they can replace. Only pressing people down. No professionalism of management and Hr. ""If you don't like it go away"" Arrow Electronics B.V politics."
bad,Everyone is constantly being laid off which produces a hostile environment. Upper management wants nothing to do with anyone below them. Benefits are below industry standard.
bad,"As the largest employer in CO, this company targets individuals throughout the country in tech. Then when you try to leave, they blacklist you with Everyone who does business with them. They don’t pay all commissions owed to employees, demand most employees travel, and offer terrible insurance plans - most of which Won’t Cover You When Out Of State. "
bad,"No one can help you with a problem employees just worry about what they have to do. In most cases they sit in front of their computer and work in their area, no concerns about anything else."
bad,"A typical day is fast paced."
bad,A typical day at work is doing the same thing over and over again which would be fine if the rest of the day was tolerable. Management is ignorant and don't have the ability to make positive changes for the company or to stand up to employees that don't put the company first.
bad,Went in with great expectations and have been disappointed at the lack of trust and teamwork among departments.  It's a fend for yourself environment.  Bad attitudes and a lack of responsiveness is excused by management and blame is passed like a hot potato.
bad,"managing over 120 accounts daily. Provide full customer service through the entire sales process. For the most part the co-workers are friendly. Hardest part is that there is no room for advancement."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was being crossed trained to work in many different departments. I integrated myself and myself as valuable as possible, I loved being able to do anything requested of me and helping out management as much as possible and learned as much as I could. I trained quite a few people and I learned how to test OS systems, how to program part numbers, serial numbers, model numbers into a huge programming database called APD. I could also test the assets and entered in any and all information required. I started out in Quality Control, making sure that all private information programmed on any and all assets was officially erased, I cleaned assets and reset to factory settings and than boxed them and transported down to shipping. While there I also learned how to run their whole receiving department by myself and log incoming assets ontop of weighing all pallets and recording them in both our systems and corporate systems. There really wasn't anything hard about this job as I enjoy a challenge and adore learning how to do new things and making myself valuable to my company. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn something never every single day and implement my new knowledge into my job. "
bad,I worked there for close to 14 years. I learned recieving shipping and storing product.
bad,"This your typical corporate company, Hr lies to protect the company advancement is granted to those who are deceptive, dishonest.Mutual admiration Soc"
bad,"I worked at Arrow for 5 years, and in that time I had some room for advancement, and while some of the opportunity was on my merit, it was also because nobody wanted to stick around in higher roles. Due to the reactive environment, people clutch at their own responsibilities, and work hard to shift accountability away from themselves instead of collaborating to customer success. Different departments are liking different companies. Engineering can spend lavishly on non-business related items at will, where other areas of the business are passed over for minimal yearly increases. Many people work two jobs in this market while still having room mates well into their 30s. If you just need a job, and that job does not need to satisfy you, this will provide a paycheck. All decisions are made behind closed doors without input from people (mind you I was in management and left on good terms). I had to keep my team in the dark constantly instead of empowering them."
bad,"Low morale, horrible management and no policy or procedures insight. Lots of contractors at Arrow that are over worked and under appreciated! No sight of corporate direction of said “5 year out” should be get out in five years considering the turnover. Stay away if you have self dignity and pride! What a shame."
bad,"The majority of the employees, both managers and non-managers, have a high school mentality...very cliqueish, the ""cool kids"" like to mock others and make them the object of derision for their own amusement, or to cement their standing. Rumors spread like wildfire from shift to shift, as it's like a social engagement for an hour whenever shifts overlap. The foreign-speaking employees, of which there are a majority, openly talk about you in front of you and behind your back. The longer tenured non-management employees have an overwhelming sense of entitlement, and tend to do as little real work as possible."
bad,"No process remains unchanged.  Nobody on the same page.  Beyond stressful because nobody can ever get anything done. HR  is the worst HR I have experienced in my career.  They don't have a background in operations and don't care.  Not a healthy work environment, it was very chaotic."
bad,"I have no idea how a company like this lands in the top 500. Who you know, what you know or how much you paid to get there is more like it. Typical day is full of chaos and broken systems that were never correctly tested or put in place. The hiring of too many extra pieces to be later let go. Those extra pieces sit around on the internet all day while very few get the work done. Management in meetings making poor decisions to make bigger mistakes . It's a vicious cycle of chaos. Turnover is crazy. The longest tenure might be 2 years- It's the twinkie shelf life of an Arrow employee."
bad,Manages its capex and opex by slashing staff when the don't hit their numbers. Old school management style. If you know buzzwords or someone higher up you have a better chance for advancing.
bad,"There is no option for production workers to choose the most suitable department/section because the selection is random. In result some employees end up working with shift allowance and saturdays, some other don't. "
bad,"I came in as a contractor for Team Lead, This worried me as to why it was not promoted from within.  The members of the team I was assigned to had horrible attitudes.  They were constantly rude to each other.  Offered no help in explaining situations.  And as the team lead, when I asked for certain deadlines to be met, they completely ignored the email.  No support for the team lead was provided by upper management.  This position is doomed for failure from the start.  I stayed for 7 months before I left this position."
bad,Theres nothing good that can say about this company. Management relies on line workers to do their job for them. A lot of mandatory overtime is worked because of the failed design of the building. relatives of management are hired and promoted to leadership roles before their probationary period is over.
bad,I regret staying so long. I am still healing from the damage that place caused. Stay away. It is completely toxic and there are constant layoffs so you are always worried about your job.
bad,"The work there is monotonous. It reminded me of high school. Supervisors and leads can ask you to non essential tasks and then ding you at the end of the day because you didn't have enough time to hit your quota.  Working through a temp agency made it easy for them to let me go, but the lead was too afraid to tell me that they were letting me go. He simply said the temp agency needed to talk to me that day with no explanation as to why, and the temp agency then had to find find out when I called the reason for me to call them. A temp employee isn't treated the same as a full time employee, so I do not know if it would have been any better as a full time employee."
bad,"No matter how hard you work or how well you perform you are always in fear of being laid off, some managers help you feel better about working there even though the smog is in the air.  Arrow goes through cycles of massive groups each year or so are laid off.  They crack the whip frequently and ride your performance very closely.  It is as if you are a stock broker and every single decision is as crucial as the day the company was founded.  In the 7 years I worked with Arrow I was laid off three times and kept making the mistake of coming back.  I think Arrow will always feel like a ship with many holes in it that will never truely float and move through its business peacefully."
bad,"I am amazed that they are still around. Leaders at HQ have zero respect for frontline employees. They are disconnected from how product gets out the door leading to high OT. Benefits are dismal, pay is low."
bad,"Managers are terrible."
bad,The culture limits freedom to express ideas.  Management comes from the upper elites and you are forced to buy into even bad ideas and direction.
bad,"I could sit here and slam Arrow, but my time is better spent doing other things...like forgetting that I was stupid enough to work for them."
bad,The management is not respectful of the employees' contribution.  There is no work life balance. The training /development of employees is next to nothing.
bad,The Accounting department has excessive turnover for a reason. Management is poor and very inexperienced and is unwilling to assume any responsibility for the problems plaguing the department.   Definitely an us vs. them mentally.   Overtime is excessive so work life balances is very poor.   Opportunities for advancement are limited.  Co-workers and facilities are great.
bad,"Expect to be at the office until midnight during close weeks. Absurd work/life balance. Zero training/development from management. Employees are treated as a number. Very poor organization and passive upper management."
bad,"Worked there many years.  Used to be the best place to work, but after management changes, the culture has changed.  They have become a cut throat organization who no longer cares for their employees.  All perks were taken from employees and management has instilled a work by fear mentality."
bad,"I was laid-off one day before my 2 yr anniversary, because on this date they put money into your 401K. Nice, really freakin' nice."
bad,"Mgr was in Phoenix hard to get in touch with. Laborious Oracle software had 20 yr seasoned veterans literally bawling due to Life Crushing, Soul Sucking STRESS."
bad,"Not a place for growth, they tell you that but management and HR will not help. The environment is poison. They hire drug addicts and drunks and allow these people to have jobs despite the countless mistakes made"
bad,"The HR Dept. is such a joke. "
bad,"Very poor training, and a different position than what I was told during the interview."
bad,"Never accomplished anything, worked for this company for over two years and never received training or anything to help with poaition. reall wish this was better"
bad,"A typical day at work was coming in and figuring out who you would have to be backing up that day because that employee was out, submitting requests for quotes on electronic components, and being yelled at by sales reps.  "
bad,"The company expects one person for two people worth of job. Low margin company with an accepted model of high burnout high turnover. Will feed you during some portions of overtime, which is everyday, weekends, days off, and holidays."
bad,All they want is more this and more that while they change the process every 5 minutes.  Training or lack there of is a joke.  they come over read a piece of paper and then make you sign like that was actually training me.  I could maybe understand that if it was 1 page but really its like 12.  This place is a joke at least the AVR side is the component side is actually good to work for or so I'm told.
bad,Frequent layoffs   Favouritism displayed and nepotism is rife - people that are married couples should definitely not be working in the same company and should not be working in the same office.    Lots of overtime    Some people work very hard and others are out the door as soon as they can
bad,Currently laying off the entire global components division. Really enjoyed working with computer servers and networking equipment but that is all coming to and end.
bad,"This place most definitely need to get it together."
bad,"Been in technology sales and marketing business for 28+ years, worked for Fortune 50, 100 and 500 sized organizations.  Arrow was the most inept and dysfunctional organization I've ever worked at from top to bottom. I worked for them for a year, the job I was hired to do was never fully functional or supported by the organization before they scrapped the department and let us go.  Management busied themselves playing politics while dangling us about.  Amazing they manage to stay relevant in the distribution/commodity re-marketing business."
bad,Directors are not allowed to make decisions and/or provide any strategic direction.  There is no development provided to staff positions and everyone has a target on their back.
bad,Not an employee friendly organization. The career path are not well defined and very arbitrary. Not a process oriented organization.
bad,The culture at Arrow is horrible.  Management and Executive Level employees - it's like the Hunger Games or Game of Thrones.  They will throw anyone under a bus to save themselves.  Maybe other areas of the organization are ok - but Finance is a DISASTER!!!!!
bad,"I worked here and was surprised at how low the morale was. Staff not really working but standing around and talking for long periods of time. Don't get me wrong. There are those who do bust their butts, there. But it is not a large number, unless you happen to be working on another team.. There's also lots of back biting and gossiping, so if you saw this in the others' reviews, it is very true. The attendance policy is only enforced if they don't like you. They say it is strictly enforced, I say not true.. I witnessed with my own eyes staff leaving early to go on dates, supposedly sick, or don't come in at all due to hangovers..They later joke about it on the floor the next day. One guy rarely is there, and when he does show up, he leaves early when he doesn't seem to feel good. This seems to be a regular thing, yet he is still there, lol..I have seen him maybe 65% of the time..Maybe 70 tops since I have been there. How low is the morale? How about a trainer whose been fired an excess of four times, yet keeps getting hired back because of her lawyer? Or the fact that when temps are sent here, hardly no one ever comes back? I mean don't even last 24 hrs! Or the fact that, Arrow Electronics can't seem to keep Supervisors. .The folks who are still there are individuals that should have been fired ages ago. And the things they talk about on the floor will make your hair stand-up, especially if you are a lady..But these guys are all cool with management, so nothing to worry about..There are two very good workers there, well three..An not one of them received any award, no thanks"
bad,Good company to work for. Advancement is limited and new management is trying to change the culture. Sales quotas are very high and paid is tied to meeting a very high and sometimes unachievable quota.
bad,"The job was not hard, but there was never any communication. If you had a problem and went to HR, you were told to do it yourself, HR never wanted to help. And if they hired someone, they were lucky if they kept anyone more than a week....high turn over rate"
bad,"Work at arrow electronics is standing in front of computer processing orders on a timely manner, no talking allowed, constatntly being watched by supervisor felt like a prison"
bad,"The people in our facility that I worked with on a daily basis where the best!!! Upper management.... not so much. A lot of ""passing the buck"" when trying to get information from other areas of the company."
bad,"My management was so eager to please her management that she overreacted to every twitch and made life impossible for her staff. Any suggestions were met with ""Maybe Arrow isn't for you"" and that attitude pervaded the office. Insecure management makes for paranoid staff. Middle management accepts no responsibility and shifts blame where it can. Sales staff childish in attitude and lacking in product knowledge"
bad,"No work culture, no convenance."
bad,Low pay and mandatory overtime. Factory work as well which can set you into a layoff at any time. Not a good place to work for. Working here is like being a prisoner. You have to go through a metal detector up to 6 times a day for each time you leave for break and come back 2x each break 3 total. If you come back like more than a couple minutes late you will get a point on your record. I don't remember how many points is required for termination I only worked there for 3 months and just walked out due to low pay and a unpleasant work environment.
bad,Terrible company too work for they don't really train you like that. They change the rules all the time and if you don't understand the rules they will let you go. It's just a terrible company
bad,Most of the place is filled with moody and mean people. Management NEVER knew your schedule it was changed daily. Sometimes you got your hours and other times it was 50+ hours a week. The only thing I liked was the pay
bad,Being at Arrow was very stressful they had us doing too much and I didn't feel supported when I needed help.  I am glad I had the opportunity to work there because it helped me to know how to handle stress and a high intense environment.  I worked there for 8 month's as a contractor was never hired to be perminant employee. Was not told the truth when asked if I was going to be hired w/in 3 month's of being there
bad,When i started 20+ years ago Arrow was a great place. Now they care more about their race cars than employees. Raises are in frequent.  Every department is severely understaffed and fingers are pointed at you from every level & group.  Stay clear
bad,You'll never see friends or family again. They schedule mandatory overtime and one day the schedule changed 4 times before I left and I did show up at the wrong time the next morning because I was unaware of the last change to the schedule. They lay off decent temps to keep some employees who do nothing all day. Arrow didnt believe I'm a human but a robot made to work 10-12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week. Oh also their benefits are terrible so while you're working every second of your life you better hope you dont get sick.
bad,this place was managed by another place in california it was just a scam.
bad,"bosses all have power trips, regular workers are great though."
bad,"Wages are significantly lower than employees doing the same job that were hired a few years ago.   Layoffs occur at least twice a year and the most recent layoff was massive, including the closure of businesses acquired in other states.  Outsourcing local jobs to other countries results in errors and extreme customer dissatisfaction, but executive mgmt. does not seem to care.   Stressful work environment - departments are seriously understaffed and some work just can't get done.   Frequent hiring freezes mean infrequent promotions.  Benefits get more expensive each year.  Lack of awareness/support from executive management team - you can't get near them."
bad,Understaffed and to many It projects to keep up with. Senior It staff has to pick up level one trouble calls after hours due to lack of staff/expertise.
bad,The land of distribution is driven by lower costs.  The only significant way to lower costs is cutting employees and working who is left to the bone.  Burn out is high.
bad,"That place has a lot of favoritism. I got laid off which was better than being fired because I got severance pay, but I am pretty sure it had to do with the people I was working with. They were like bullies in high school. It was a lot like high school actually. The boss would choose the lead a lot over other workers. I was humiliated one time and constantly being talked down. I was in the FQR area by the way, and not to mention I would only go back because I needed a job."
bad,"Worked for Arrow for many years, only stayed to get the experience needed to progress my career. "
bad,"Management does not trust employees to achieve goals, and often sets goals out of reach to avoid having to pay their compensation plans.  Management is out of touch with their workforce, alienating top performers and failing to recognize successes and failures.  Management does not hold themselves accountable to their own decisions.  Increased workloads with vastly reduced workforce.  Incentives and benefits are marginal or below average.  Basic training programs do not exist."
bad,"I came in as a temp worker though tristaff group "
bad,"Upper management is terrible, they really need to get a clue. To bad the Big Boss doesn't see it... HR wont do anything about it"
bad,"Highly touted as a best place to work but doesn't deliver. Depending on department, managers are not respecting of those who they are charged to motivate. No thank you for a job exceedingly well done"
bad,When i started 20+ years ago Arrow was a great place. Now they care more about their race cars than employees. Raises are in frequent.  Every department is severely understaffed and fingers are pointed at you from every level & group.  Stay clear
bad,"Management has no interest in the grunts of the operations; overtime is mandatory and likely to lead to no days off; the benefits were severely nerfed into nonexistence; PTO is the only way anyone will get days off, and earn 2 or 3 hours a paycheck (may have changed); HR disinterested in assisting employees"
bad,it was small and product was every where and the hardest part of the job small building and there were no enjoyable part we hardly ever see the manager plus I learned how to treat people because they were okay
bad,No room for growth with inconsistent leadership.  People leave and they do not fill the vacancy.  The workload then has to be absorbed by the minimal staff they currently hold.
bad,Arrow was great company to start with the pay was good but the company goes through to many management changes and hours are too long it is hard to balance life outside of this place.
bad,Management has deaf ears to issues. Way too much time wasted in meetings that go nowhere but to support new ideas that never materialize. The new building on Dry Creek is very nice.
bad,The hardest part about dealing with the job was constant changes and management changing their minds. You could never tell how much work you would have when you came in the following day or what you would be doing. Lack of employees
bad,Was hired during the busy time of the month. Was told that I had three months to get up to speed with things. Instead I was tossed around from position to position. On the last day of the busy time I received a phone call after working a mandatory 45 hour week. The reason for the call- due to the fact I was not up to speed yet I was now terminated. After three weeks not three months. No wonder they are short staffed!
bad,"Management have preferences on who they promote, they prefer there race than any other.  they cause to many conflicts with the employees local HR wont resolve your issues with management"
bad,"Hired on with the agreement that there was flexability in the hours of the day you are at the office vs. working from home and a strong belief in not working more than 8 hrs a day.  This is what my hiring manager believed, and that was all great, but the manager changed shortly after being hired and the expectations completely flipped.  The amount of work that was piled on was is something you would do to a person if want to set them up for failure.  There is a lack of the human element in the finance department.  It's very sad."
bad,"Arrow is a great place to work and get a career started if you're in need something fast or down on your luck. They are good at giving fair opportunity but not a long term solution or a place for advancement and growth. The job culture is very ""1950's do your job and that is it"" they are behind in employment empowerment or employee appreciation like other company's that prioritize that in their culture."
bad,"This place is understaffed, mandatory overtime you never know when your next day is. Supervisors are all about making themselves look good and you look bad. Speed is everything and error margin is zero. If you need a day off for personal time off or doctors appointments you fill out PTO form and your lucky if it’s approved."
bad,"Was a great place to work. High turnover, lots of burn out, lack of goals, and an antiquated management philosophy.  Great place to get experience, but you are only as good as the current quarter."
bad,"The company is drying up slowly and we're getting more contractors than employees. Currently there are quarterly layoffs. There's little to no advancement for employees. The work environment is very closed off since everyone is working as hard as they can to even keep up. There's very little opportunity for training or personal growth, since the status quo is to 'keep working.'"
bad,"I always feel greatful for a job.  After all it is someone who takes a chance on you, but you also take a chance on them.  "
bad,"You usually end up doing the job of 3 individuals, and then some. They do not care about your individual success, and alot of the upper management only cares about themselves."
bad,"A typical workday involves meetings, trying to deduce what is happening and working long hours because of the slow trickle-down management policy. it's all about leaving it to the last moment and rushing to get things done'"
bad,"terrible management, unhappy employees who are in constant fear. bare minimum on benefits. poor compensation and inability to change jobs or get promoted since you need manager approval to do so."
bad,"There is quite a bit of turnaround here due to constant management changes, poor work culture, and micromanagement. The majority of individuals who did advance did so by transferring out of the Semi org into another department entirely."
bad,"I was hired for a Coordinator position but once I arrived, they gave me an entry-level position.  It was easy and they use programs from the late 90's."
bad,"This company has no leadership and has changed management several times within a year or two.  It is finally starting to hurt their business and they are trying to change, but I wouldn't trust them again."
bad,Very busy place to work due to very lean teams supporting a heavy workload. There is a lot of opportunity to learn and spend time in areas of interest to grow your skills to support career interests. There is a lot of turnover and culture is very investor and customer focused.
bad,"good to work in a neat environment , to build my career skills i am looking out for a change.it was a nice working experience that i have learned so far,"
bad,"el ambiente es bueno, falta valorar mas a su gente y sobre todo darle mas oportunidad a sus empleados de crecimiento"
bad,"Same old people making the same old decisions behind closed doors.."
bad,"Mandatory overtime and low pay makes for low employee moral. Repetitive tasks, unfair workloads and expectancy. Mostly staffed by temporary employees who come and go every week."
bad,This was the worst positions i have held with any company.   They do not focus on employee development and customers are challenged due to the company's commitment on profit and not supply chain.
bad,"The accounting department at Arrow is understaffed with upper management completely understating the work load and expected hours.  Culture does not exist as the turn over is so high.  Work life balance for Managers is ridiculous as close weeks require over 100 hours, Seniors at 90 to 100 hours and Staff at 70 to 80 hours.  Upper Management is completely unresponsive to proposed changes and when people leave for better employment their positions are rarely back filled.  Current employees are expected to pick up the slack when coworkers quit and are offered nothing in return."
bad,"To start this review, please note that this company will literally hire anyone, including the homeless. I suppose that can be a benefit to some. Others, not so much."
bad,after working there for so long I made many friends and we did have a lot of fun.  People make the business.  I grew so much at this company and learned so much more beyond just selling electronic components!
bad,Liderazgo enfocado en cuestiones personales y egocentrimos de la alta gerencia.
bad,"Arrow is VERY cliquey from the top down.  This place is like being back in high school again.  If you like that type of atmosphere, then this is the place for you."
bad,This location went under and would do anything  to get rid of employees. Was a good starting  off point but there are a lot better jobs out there. Dont recommend.
bad,Very disorganized and a less than favorable work environment. The job was not very difficult. Management was unfavorable to say the least. Most enjoyable part of the job were tho coworkers.
bad,"Arrow corporate lacks consistency, accountability, and culture. "
bad,arrow was a ok place to work I learned a lot about micro chips and what tape they went in and how to make labels to go on the microchips. working graveyard had to be the hardest
bad,Arrow is a large corporation and provides an average working environment with competitive benefits and adequate salary.  Corporate controlled functions are distant and slow to respond with meetings taking up most of the day.  The work/life balance is questionable and training (apart from the basic tasks associated with production) is limited to what the employees takes on outside of work.  Arrow is no better or no worse than most of the large companies operating in the area.
bad,"Arrow used to be a great company to work for. It’s gotten too big too fast and can not keep up."
bad,The company has a lot of politics when it comes to corporate HR.  Corporate HR tends to regulate everything and will terminate if you don't say something right or don't agree with their decision.
bad,"Arrow pays well but if you have pride in your work, you are in the minority and will be constantly overlooked by management for promotion as you are more beneficial to them in your current position. The dress code is relaxed, the benefits are great, and the offices are new and have many amenities. If you are a ""yes man"", this is the place for you. If you are an independent thinker with ethics and pride in your work, steer clear!"
bad,i really did love this job they thought me how to take your time management are very two faced the hardest part of the job when the system is down payed weekly was the best thing about this job as a temp you can work hard have good attendance in still don't get the job
bad,Arrow was a difficult place to work.  The worked us long hours with not a lot of acknowledgement for our hard work.  The culture was not the best.  Employees are not very happy.
bad,If you want to collect a paycheck and you have no emotional investment in your career it's a decent paying job. The benefits should be so much better for a company of this size as with career advancement.
bad,"A typical day of work consists of 3-4 meetings with the other half of the day focused on deliverables and supporting other departments."
bad,"Aarow is a electronic parts warehouse , my  duties there was :"
bad,"start the day pickup my two RF,tablet and printer at security.check what needs to be replenished.everything i do i know before i got the job.management is ok co-workers are great.the hard part is all the extra work that i do without the gratitude or compensation.the most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
bad,"Was not very organized, even though I understood it was a temp job they still did not properly train people in the tasks needed to be done. It was basically hire, put you in your area and hope for the best kind of deal. They were firing a lot of people and laying off a lot of people due to poor management. Before I was part of the group that got laid off they fired the general operation manager ."
bad,Good pay but horrible management. Too many lay offs and favoritism.
bad,Good training to employees and good programs are offered to customers to win new business
bad,"I was a temp for 6 months and was not seeing any full time employment in the near future. It was very Segregated (as far as temp employees and permanent employees) and they made that VERY CLEAR. The pay did not suit my needs as a single parent. My supervisor was extremely helpful and nice, but the company was just not for me."
bad,the company ok but the supervisor need improvement the management are poor and to much laid off I work for 14 years to much mandatory overtime no for your family
bad,"It is a shame that a company with the resources Arrow has does not focus on it's most valuable asset... it's employees. The company continues to focus on the bottom line, gives out ridiculous growth plans and hinders employees ability to do their jobs by allowing huge walls of bureaucracy to stifle activities. There are no real formal development or training programs.  "
bad,"The company would be okay, but there are a few managers that play favorites.  Also, they do not promote from within.  There are certain groups that are better to work in than others."
bad,"Every day could be different you may be picking 1 day"
bad,"Large account sizes on one desk higher management demanding results, not enough time in a 8 hours. Overtime is rarely approved and co-workers are always working over 40hours."
bad,"Scared of change"
bad,"Stuffy, slow, not innovative but relatively secure. I saw little opportunity for growth at Arrow. I wouldn't recommend any friends or colleagues working here."
bad,"Very stressful environment,  People are great, leadership needs a lot of work.  Pay is on the low end,  scale equivalent to fast food."
bad,"For my position, a typical day at work would be to check my email and see if theres anything pressing to attend to. If not go about my regular scheduled projects or training sessions."
bad,"This organization rated 141 in Forbes 2013 and 2nd Largest Electronics Distributor is one of most sought of organizations for work. Has the latest infrastructure but the hardest part of the job is good hands are not retained due to poor peoples management."
bad,"The executive team was arrogantly patronizing on how they came off. It's a Fortune 150 and they execs take great bonuses. But when hard times hit, the exec bonuses stay, and employee benefits are cut, salaries frozen, unpaid furloughs, layoffs. They often say in townhall meetings that ""our people are our most valued asset.""  Which - if you read the above - is not true. Their employee evaluation process is designed so that if you do your job spectacularly, you get average ratings for meeting expectations. So merit raises are a joke. There is a lot of politics and posturing for advancement of your career. Not a lot of merit based promotion - more ""who are you buddies with"" promotions. But they do promote from within.  So that's a point in their favor. Once you're in, if you're good at what you do, you tend to have decent job security. Your initial offer will be competitive salary wise.  But it will stagnate. The benefits package (especially health insurance) got worse and worse during my years there in order to cut costs. And when times got better, good benefits did not return. The only reason I was there for so long is that I was hired by a fantastic boss and worked for him for my first year and a half. He was laid off, and I was ready to look elsewhere. But then a new great manager came in who was legitimately interested in growing and developing us on his team. But he was quickly jaded by the corporate philosophy. When he left, very few on our team stayed long. All in all, it was a steady paycheck because I am good at what I do and I get along with people easily. But it was"
bad,"They make it seem like they have a ""team"" attitude, when in reality everyone has their tasks and you have yours. Asking for help is virtually impossible as people are too busy with their work to help anyone else out. The only time there is any interaction with team members is during meetings when you report your individual work. There is no collaboration and the general feel is they expect everyone to fail."
bad,"The work and shift co workers were decent to work with, but the poor management did not save the company from closing..."
bad,"Complete lack of proper training and management. Anyone from newer hires to temps can be training someone.  No consistency in processes and nobody above the line workers are held accountable for wrong doings.  Everyone has their own way of doing things and you just learn the way that person taught you, it isn't necessarily the proper way. "
bad,"Only bright spot of this job was the people I worked with. Otherwise I felt like I was on an island with no coaching or direction on how to do better. "
bad,"Fun place to work, but Arrow is abandoning experienced individuals for college grads.  Little to no raises, they are strapped for cash.  No real engineering or innovation happening there, it is all a facade.  The illusion of 5 years out.  Their Sam car was designed in Germany, let's not pretend."
bad,"Arrow strongly recommends lateral moves, not career advancement. Once you make it to a certain pay level/title you are basically capped. Your only option is to leave the company and come back if you want a raise or move to a different team where there are more realistic sales goals to help hit accelerators and make more in commission."
bad,"1)When I was works there, this is the worst place I have been work."
bad,"If you like corporate environments where politics rule and you have little or no direction on what success really looks like, then Arrow is for you.  Management typically has no clue what the employees actually go through on a day to day basis, and shows no interest in finding out.  Employees are an expendable commodity, to be used until they wear out or have their position eliminated in a ""cost cutting"" measure."
bad,Overall there is a lack of cohesiveness and coordination between groups.  Working with support functions can be challenging and frustrating due to demand and the different priorities. Tools and information and data gathering is outdated.  Management seems out of touch to employees day to day challenges and effort.
bad,Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere but the work kept getting more intense.  It was a fun culture where they brought in free food every now and then. Not much pressure.
bad,This was an extremely well managed company for many years. Strategic vision and leadership team was strong and well-liked.  It has changed dramatically under the current CEO.
bad,Typical day consists of 20-30 calls and emails and assisting customers through general PC problems. Build machines to spec to send out to customers regularly and troubleshoot general in house problems.
bad,"Many good employees and managers, get as much money as possible when hired since raises/promotions will be small if they happen at all and Arrow will squeeze as much work out of you for as little money as possible. Be prepared to play office politics."
bad,"Free coffee, covered parking, on site lunchroom for hot or cold breakfast and lunches. Onsite armed security and elevators. Ping Pong table and private meeting rooms."
bad,"Arrow Electronics is a place that compensates extremely well, but there's no job security or clear path to promotion. Favorites game is strong. "
bad,"When i first started working with this company, I enjoyed my time there despite how labor intensive the job was. Once the company merged with another company, the work policies changed and suddenly they began enforcing mandatory overtime, despite my health condition and the effect it was having on my back. This eventually lead to me injuring my back, and in response, the company fired me and claimed i quite when i attempted to file for unemployment."
bad,"got to learn about logistics and that communication and management play a big part of how a warehouse is run and that at least where i was it was lacking in both aspects, the hardest part of the job was just not getting angry and storming out of the building"
bad,"Definitely a work place where your fellow employees are all very friendly and a welcoming group, however management is terrible.  They make terrible decisions play favorites whenever promotions come up, find ways to short you money, often mess up pay checks and it will be weeks before you see it corrected.  Very deceptive management that will tell you something and then half a day later deny ever saying it.  They will screw you over at every opportunity.  HR is a joke unless you want to accuse someone of harassment.  Will go a week with work that they require you to do overtime to finish, and then the next week have no work and have to either clean the warehouse to kill time or use your vacation time and hope more work comes in.  Went three months once with no work and people cut and sent home.  You will be extremely hot in the summer months and it is a very dirty warehouse.  Would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,the job was confusing but thank the support i got from fellow coworkers i was able to focus and work accord so i had some nice motivation i learn doing the same work without progression is so boring but when you hungry and humble you do your best at work the hardest part was dealing alot paper cuts but it was cool.
bad,"The coworkers are a hard working bunch. They have to be. The product is overflowing in and the building is not climate controlled. They are a good group to work with and shift around to help others. The management team is not the best. They are good people, but do not properly motivate. Their idea to fix any issue is a write up, and to hit any goal is mandatory overtime for weeks on end. As far as pay scales, I have seen the ranges and grades. Pay never really goes above the lower end."
bad,"Negative feedback,  cutting back on hours and employees. Great co workers, fast paced, clean place overall. HR team very helpful and quick to answer any and all questions."
bad,Management does very little to assist colleagues. Often management is in all day meetings and unable to offer support to those who are in need. Customer Account Reps are often overworked and told to ignore small accounts in order to hit larger sales goals. Prioritization is lacking within Arrow.
bad,"I started out working as a contract employee in the accounting department processing invoices, and after six months my contract was up however I was able to secure another position in Supplier Accounting. There my knowledge of accounting was expanded tremendously; I had to fight (it seemed) for a raise even though I took on plenty of new responsibilities. This department has one of the highest turnover rates in the company, but I did not know this going in. I soon learned the reason for the high turnover, which was poor management. I believe a manager should know, at a basic level, how to do each job every person below them is required to perform. When management does not know how to perform each job, but expects it to be done in an unreasonable amount of time there is a problem. This happens all the time at Arrow. If you can learn quickly, and don't mind remaining a contract employee then you will be fine at Arrow."
bad,"Management shoots from the hip.  They make decisions without including stake holders.  After a reorganization, they decide to assign the program I created to someone with no experience that is in the corporate office and knows leadership.  In the process they have upset customers as well as our sales channels that work with the program.  The new manager feared my involvement so assigned me to another group.  Just poor.  "
bad,"If you are a pro then be worried. ""here's your desk, you'll get your cards and phone in two weeks, where's the new business?"""
bad,"I used to be inside sales, more similar to account management. They gave you attainable sales goals at first but once you get close they blow your targets out of the water and make them unreachable. The culture and management support were phenomenal. We had regular events such as grill outs and happy hours. Raised money for charities and enjoyed freedom to perform our jobs. After 2 years in that position they performed huge layoffs and changed out position to a sales support roll. They have had layoffs in the company 3 times in 2019 alone. The advancement support is gone, the managers are distant, there is no feedback on performance, the culture is dying, and with the continual layoffs people are becoming overburdened. There are no more events for team building, we don't raise money for charity anymore, Arrow is a shell of what it once was."
bad,"The executive committee ensures they have raises, but doesn't offer the front line employees raises. It's all about the stock price, not the hard work employees are doing.  There is no employee recognition."
bad,"Management is not for anyone but themselves and they do not hide who their favorites are. Stay off their bad side! They do not take any responsibility for their mistakes, and the employee is always wrong and they loath people who ask questions."
bad,"a company need a lot improvements to achieve the high efficiency. based on their employees source, typically AE can not expect more from them. but the working schedule is very flexible for people who are looking for 2nd shfit"
bad,"I would have to pick pc's and notebook orders, clean them up and pack them into boxes. Then I would stack the boxes on a pallet corner, wrap and strap the pallet secure. Then take each product and batch them into a location."
bad,"Solid company in its primary business, but is not doing well with its new businesses. It is acquiring a number of businesses which are not as profitable."
bad,the job is cool but not for long term. its in a wharehouse so some days it hot and some days it gets really cold. But most of the time as you work you don't noticed most things
bad,"NO!!! opportunities to advance and job ""insecurity."" Employment is based on tenure (Time-in). You will be second guessed based on managements lack of understanding for your position even though you're doing your job correctly. If they don't need you in your role, you are pushed out quickly."
good,The  leadership at Arrow has changed so drastically over the past few years that it is hardly recognizable.  They are leading through fear and creating angst and anxiety at all levels of the company.  At the first sign of financial constraints and margin pressure they are quick to pull the trigger to lay off employees and roll up the sidewalk rather than look at strategies to improve margin.
good,I got penalized for coming up with an idea on how to do things differently. I worked in the horseshoe area for about 2 months and they wanted me to train new employees no raise no incentive.
good,"Management was very hard to get a hold of. My manager was in a different state. Never saw them, but they gave me my annual appraisal and raise every year? Not sure how that works when they don't even know me"
good,"Every employee is overworked and overloaded.  There are not enough hours in the day to finish all your tasks, and they do not offer overtime.  very Stressful at times"
good,"stressful, work environment is open office space and therefore outdated. high noise levels, no conference rooms."
good,"great people, employees. Non-existent public relations, deficiencies in management in the HR structure"
good,Company over all is fine but the Management needs to be addressed.  Upper management is unaware of the severe lack of professionalism of lower management.
good,"There was a lot of favoritism between the management team and lead technicians. In my opinion, the lead technicians were given way too much power over the regular production technicians.  Some days, I felt like I was working in a sweat shop in a foreign country.  There was always a high volume of work to do and mandatory overtime requirements on a typical shift.  We consistently lost important customers due to poor quality from bad workmanship and from the lack of qualified technicians.  Arrow Electronics is a good place to learn about computers.  However, it's working environment and culture was pretty bad."
good,in the 3 years i worked their i did learn a lot but this job was very focused and no advancement available. They way did things is the way they did things not open to change
good,"Good people to work with,but management made poor decisions resulting in company shutting down the facility."
good,"Some management lack ability to energize and keep employees in a happy work environment, often change up the break schedules and have no way too reduce points off of your record or keep yourself safe from termination if you happen to take too many days off"
good,"If mindless busywork is what you love this place is for you. You can plug in your headset and work through the average day. The work was incredibly easy. The environment was very quiet, businesslike. They were pretty flexible with what you were doing while working as long as everything was done in a timely manner. I often found myself running out of things to do with rare offers of more work so the days felt very long and unsatisfying."
good,"Same kind of warehouse work just same kind, favoritism is not a problem just kind of have to watch out for maybe general managers or higher-ups trying to hump on other people"
good,"Mucho nepotismo, no hay crecimientom tampoco hay proyeccion para una carrera professional, No hay gerentes con Maestria."
good,"poor management decisions created a hostile work environment and the company was so internally focused it lost site of the customer.  no work/life balance.   management not concerned about employee welfare and had no problem with employees working 14-16 hour weeks, most times all weekend.   incapable management."
good,"Initially followed contemporary software development practices. Now embracing project-based, hierarchical, matrix centered waterfall practices. Very little trust placed in full time employees. Frequent layoffs"
good,"Don't even bother.  Employees from Denver are rude, nasty and arrogant.  This company does not care about anyone.  Lucky to last a year here. Even the higher management left."
good,"Arrow Electronics is made up of numerous acquired companies, This creates different office cultures in various divisions and geographical locations. On the corporate level Arrow is very bureaucratic."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and owning my desk. All of my daily tasks were already acquired from past work history.  Management was ridiculous; many layoffs and placed employees in supervisory positions that did not have the correct skill sets and underhanded.  Co-workers were friendly although most everyone felt the same way about more work, no compensation growth, not happy with directs.  The hardest part of my position was positive attitude which is not the type of person I am.  The most enjoyable part of my job was end of the day and finding a constructive, encouraging job."
good,"I've gained a fair amount of hands on experience testing, trouble shooting, and repairing various electronics during my employment at Arrow Electronics Value Recovery group.  I enjoy the opportunity to see and learn to use a wide range of electronic hardware and to see antiquated or uncommon equipment.  I also really enjoy working with everyone at my facility, and have learned so many new things from them."
good,"the management was hard to read, didn't get the chance to improve my work skills do to moving back and forth to 2 or 3 job locations. they had a foose ball table that helped to get to know other people"
good,"Good Place to work and learn, supporting all the user fro UK US help them resolve Technical issues over the phone web request and chat"
good,"Six managers in three years, constant demands to fix issues, without addressing process failures, or even data management.  No support, engagement, positive work life experience, demanding and ungrateful."
good,My jobs at Arrow Electronics were a great experience for me.  I found Arrow to be an excellent challenge and am grateful for the experiences that I had while employed there.
good,Worked as a contractor and was not a good place to work. I dont have anything good to say about this position.
good,"Really, really nice people, but the most dysfunctional software development environment I've ever experienced.  "
good,"There's a huge culture of micromanaging at Arrow. I'm lucking in that my direct manager thinks all of that is ridiculous and knows that most of his employees actually work better remotely. When my team is in the office, little work gets done. The team all gets along very well and we spend more time socializing than actually working. The execs are so out of touch that they think that if they don't see us in the office, then nothing gets done. But when we're remote, we log in earlier, work more since we're isolated at home and don't have anyone to socialize with, and we stay on later. The commute in Denver keeps getting worse and worse, so actually going into the office is a strain. I live less than 20 miles away from the office and it usually takes about 45 min to an hour to actually get to work when it should take roughly 25 minutes. That's all time that I could be spending actually working if I were remote. The company is also ridiculous with their money management. They spend millions on a brand new office when 99% of the workers in that office building can do their jobs remotely. The op-ex of that building is through the roof. The company could save so much money by getting rid of the office and letting workers actually be remote. Not to mention, the execs make huge bonuses even on years (like 2019) where they do mass layoffs to ""save money"". How about they don't take their bonus and let some more valued employees keep their jobs. The culture at Arrow is very toxic."
good,"Company goes through reorganizations and layoffs frequently with health insurance coverage ending on the last day of employment, even though you paid your share of the premium for the whole month. You are as much valued as the work you produce and once the business need is not there they will dispose of you like yesterday's news. You will not be given the opportunity to apply for positions within the company in advance of the lay off, even though at layoff you are told you are eligible for rehire."
good,"I was told that Arrow use to be a family. "
good,"Worked there for 3 years with no pay increase. They do pay for traveling, hotel and food that's a plus. Good location not far from home. Arrow closed it's doors July 2019 and laid everyone off"
good,"Work was interesting and challenging. Team Leaders have a tendency to Micro Manage. Large Corporation where decisions are made in other Countries. Inequality between departments, some have flexible hours and working style others don't."
good,"Many long time employees made it difficult to be accepted creating a style environment to work in. Overall company was great to work for, allowed me to be creative and help develop new work process. Job security was dependent on contracts for new jobs awarded to the company. Benefits  and pay were  average."
good,Arrow is a world class company that can swallow you up if you don't know how to navigate the inner circles.   Always changing their focus like a rat with ADD.  Still a very big player in the electronics world
good,Job itself is not bad but the pay could be better. Management needs to get on same page. The hours are way too long and the pay does not compensate for them.
good,The companies acquired by Arrow definitely have room for continuous improvement.  This was starting to be implemented when I was there. Hopefully things have progressed.
good,"A large corporation that absorbed several smaller companies to add an Electronics Recycling segment to their flourishing business to complete the overall lifecycle of an asset.  "
good,"i felt like was used here. i had to do others work because they cant do it. i had to work three department because of lack of teamwork. supervisors are cool, sum think they are all that, think theyre working but theyre not. just sit behinf the desk all day amd point finger."
good,"Promised a full time position with in 90 days and never was hired on even after working for almost 2years, when you are a contractor you get zero benefits, holiday pay, sick time ect."
good,It was just poor management..but the job was great and in that result the company closed. I would have loved to continue to work for the company. I learned alot from working there
good,"Arrow has some very good hard working people that work there. Overall, Arrow provides good benefits. The trade war with China has been challenging for them, like most electronic companies."
good,The employees are the best part of the job.  Nice to have a steady work schedule.  The work out center and the cafe are nice additions to the work day.
good,"Arrow electronic definitely keeps me on my toes but over all it's an easy, fast pace fun job to work at! The only issue I had well working here is very poor management"
good,I enjoyed working with most of the people but senior Management was not in tune with the day to day sales and I don’t think they ever tried to help move me into a management place
good,I struggled to advance out of my position with Arrow Electronics.  My supervisor was denying my attempts to apply for positions outside of her team for several months and I wasn't aware until she called a meeting with the team and used me as an example.
good,Poor management within the department.  Manager very quick to believe everything he was told before investigating.  Workload was very unbalanced.  Supervisor was discrimatory against women.
good,If you are interested in transition from any industry to business or want to start building your resume Arrow is a great place to start. Although due to the nature of the culture and the job being driven by performance and numbers that overwhelm most employees I would recommend looking elsewhere after a year.
good,Overall the job security is good and the work environment is fairly relaxed. My work hours are always consistent and I receive my paycheck every week. Employee recognition is poor and the same is true for incentives. Advancement opportunities are rare and it's more difficult to progress if you are on the bottom.
good,Working days were long and we typically worked weekends as well.  It was definitely a sales based organization and management was focused on meeting quotas and not on smooth production.  Corporate's expectations did not match those of the branch.
good,"I was a shipper, I made sure that orders went out correctly packed in specific boxes and ranged items so there can be no damage. management is poor. they believe ""we fire because we care"" meaning they hire for no reason and fire you because you are labeled ""not good enough and not what they were looking for"" after working there for a few months."
good,I had a fine experience working at Arrow Electronics. Very busy work load and high demands from customers. Typical in this industry. I had a very long commute to work.
good,"It pays the bills ... almost."
good,Arrow is a good company to work for.  I have had some Super bosses and some not so great.  It really does affect job satisfaction when you work for someone you can relate to.  The people I work with are amazing and wonderful people.  I am interested in getting into a smaller environment and getting back into a sales role or I may consider staying here.  There is not the availability of advancement in the direction I want to go here.  They have cut back considerably on employee benefits and hiring.  When someone leaves the load is dispersed instead of replacing.  Workload is very demanding and sometimes gets out of hand.
good,not a health place to be. it's hard to get a head. no Advancement for to many.
good,"My role had a lot of free time without work, even though I asked every day. There was no room to move up, learn, job shadow and it really was not encouraged."
good,"The management here is full of cast offs from a previous company they had all worked for before.  Rather than bring new ideas and energy to Richardson RFPD, they are trapped in the past, and bring with them a bitterness and clubbey type of environment which separates the old employees from the newer employees.  This does not help the new employees feel a part of the company or see that they have the possibility of advancement or management opportunities."
good,"Arrow has recently closed their Ohio Facilities.  Days were long with a lot of travelling.  Close inter departmental communications, and overall a solid place to work."
good,Decent Workplace and Co-Workers. Overtime can be demanding. Pay and Benefits were good. Career advancement was hard to pursue. Upper Management did not do a good job of listening to their work force.
good,"This company has everything you need to start your career."
good,"Time goes by fast working there,they pay good,always something to do.The only thing is management just throw you evrywhere to work.Lots of overtime!Limited parking spots."
good,"What you would expect for a fortune 200 company. People are great, management is stressed and you will be over worked. You are a faceless number on a spread sheet."
good,"Overall Arrow was a good company to work for and employed good people.The location of the company was good, Work life balance was good. Compensation was fair."
good,"fast paced, stressful, must be able to multi-task, global company, pay and benefits good, with implementation to new oracle system 2017-2018 a lot of changes to jobs and responsibilities"
good,"Arrow Electronics is a dynamic company struggling with an identity crisis if they are a distribution company or a technology company investing in new ventures.  Tightening margins in semiconductors which is the core of the Arrow business has reduced morale and talent in the core business. "
good,"In comparison to other organizations that I have worked for in my career, Arrow Electronics had a very slow and stagnant HR culture. Therefore, if anyone were to join with analytical experience, such as predictive modeling in retention, cost of turnover, or talent metrics will soon find that Arrow does not utilize their skills or experience at all. The culture is very resistant to change and creates more problems than solutions. "
good,Little room for advancement and mediocre pay.  Good exposure to multiple vendors and technologies.  Upper management and HR are extremely hard to reach or form relationships with
good,It seemed as if female management knew that they were in a world of upper management made up of majority of males and needed to show their dominanace by belittling those under their management.
good,"The company is going thru changes and is definitely unstable. The ivory tower concept is alive and well in this organization and if you are not in it, you don't matter. Not to mention, lay-offs happen every year for any reason. There are no bonuses nor stock plans for employees and the benefits packages are completely sub par. Not to mention there are no systems in place to raise employee morale and the performance review process needs a complete overhaul. There are executives who should not be in be leadership roles period, as they lack the skills to lead period. And it makes one wonder how they were placed in the positions they are. It's truly unfortunate, as this company has the potential to be a great organization.  Needless to say, there is need for drastic improvement."
good,Good work atmosphere and kind people to work with.  Not very stable/ lots of lay-offs. The workload can be pretty heavy at times.
good,"Generally a solid place to work, however their model squeezes its employees. "
good,Arrow is a huge company which means there are plenty of opportunities at the company. But being a large company does not make it very personable. You are very much a number at this place. C-level managers are very visible and pleasant when you get to talk with them which was very awesome in my opinion. This is an older company trying to become a more hip place which means they are hiring plenty of young talent. It does kind of feel like your grandpa trying to be cool and young again which can be awkward.
good,Good place to start one's career. Has a good job culture and the management is fair but in order to give myself or my family  better life this isn't the best career desirable.
good,For the first 90 days is the probation period and if you call in sick or are late you will be terminated. I completed the 90 days without incident and was hired direct from Arrow.
good,Very difficult place to show your talents or skills.  Constant turnover from GM down.  Very little concern for training or for the progression of operators or management.
good,"A typical day at work was visiting engineers at different companies and interacting with the buyers as well as the engineers.  I had a lot of Sales Training courses where I learned certain sales techniques, like the Versatile Sales Training Course.  Management was ok but they could have coached the Sales Representatives a lot better.  My co-workers were very helpful and were a large part of my success here.  The hardest part of the job was when most of the companies were buying semiconductors, software, and other products off-shore.  The most enjoyable part of the job was travelling to each different company and meeting the different employees and watch how each individual company operated."
good,"I have had the extraordinary fortune of starting my career from the very bottom (as a Receptionist). I then worked my way up through many roles, ultimately as a Sales Manager. I not only gained experience, I gained the ability to creatively look at my roles (and the business in general), from a variety of perspectives. I learned that no matter what your role is, the secret to success is exceptional customer service. Whether you are dealing with your internal or external customers, your success (or failure) is directly related to your Professionalism,  Integrity and the Service you provide."
good,Enjoy the many years of growth and being part of the results.
good,Past siz years i am in Electronic component industry i have learnt lot from this industry
good,Global company that had limited vision and communication capabilities with the employees.  Employees not encouraged to participate in a team environment and Management team provided little to no strategic vision.
good,Mgmt is struggling to keep up with the needs of employees and it is showing with increased turnover amongst the most talented people.  Compensation is also lower than industry standards.
good,Exciting business model.  Interesting topics.  People are great. Management not so great.  They lost focus on the people.  Good benefits. Great location.
good,I worked at Arrow Electronics for about a year.  There was very little collaboration between the upper management teams.  Now the facility is closed and I believe it was due to the culture created by the companies leaders.
good,Çok-uluslu matrix organizasyon sebebiyle çok fazla yöneticiniz ve rapor verdiğiniz kişi var. Sürekli çok yüksek performansta büyük stres altında çalışmanız gerekiyor. Hatta bu durum sağlığınızı bile etkileyebilir.
good,"Great environment, good people to work with, management was exceptional at best. Training, turn over (& pay) for the contracted temporary workers was horrible. Opportunity to advance or move up is there but slim to none sometimes. Pay raises came but never substantial."
good,"I don't have a ""typical day"". I have extremely strong multi-tasking skills.  I can plan to pull reports, only to get a phone call to be sent out of state at a moment's notice.  I can anticipate running a report and be re-directed to place a hot buy.  Everyday is a new adventure where I ""expect the unexpected""."
good,"Great for people who need a lot of work and need it now. When I was there we were working 10 hour days 6 days a week as the turnover rate was high, we never had enough employees and management was often implementing changes that were supposed to make work life better, but never did, and they continued to make promises of relaxed hours and scheduling changes that kept getting pushed back month after month after month. Equipment was scarce and would often take weeks to replace. People were constantly changing supervisors without employee or current supervisor knowledge. It seemed like every improvement they made for employees (a raise, a day off, etc.) would be at the expense of something else (a cut of overtime pay, more hours and mandatory weekend overtime)."
good,"I have worked here for 4.75 years and have asked several times to more than Accounts Payable.  Have been told on several occasions, that I am the A/P queen, so I am unable to advance my career at Arrow."
good,"Long hours. Never saw family. 0 balance. High stress."
good,"It was a good place to work and the work was not that difficult and the atmosphere was relaxed. My coworker were the best and management was helpful, I would likely still be there if the company didn't relocate the jobs."
good,Quick paced job. Can be stressful for some. Work and Life balance depends on the department and job you do. They approve a lot of overtime and are fair with their benefits and vacation time.
good,Enjoyed People I worked with but struggle with the poor Salary and the majority of the Managers lack the leadership skills.
good,"Typical day was face passed, learned how to work with multiple people from  sales reps to supply chains. "
good,"Great coworkers, positive work team-workload unmanageable.  Change management is poorly orchestrated here, planning and execution of change is not well planned."
good,With major growth comes pain. Employees are now in a big pond and seen as a little fish. The companies direction is hiring contract workers to get the job done. Dedicated employees are nervous about the ships helm.
good,"* a typical day at work - Travel, installation of telecom equipment and meeting, working with new clients"
good,Huge organization with many layers of management. Very little flexibility with schedule. Always felt like I was being micromanaged and was not given the tools needed to succeed.
good,"My typical day involved working and interacting with the sales and engineering team to promote and get registrations for my suppliers' products.  "
good,"You learn new things everyday as technology changes. Some are challenging, but everything gets easier with knowledge. I work independently but I also work in groups. This was a very rewarding position because you would get to make things that did not work and turn them into working units that had value."
good,"Slow to implement change, took a viable business model and didn't know what to do with it, somewhat stagnant.Still struggling with implementation 1.5 years after cut-over."
good,"- Like any large company, waves of new hires and waves of layoffs"
good,The most boring job I have ever worked. I received inbound electronics everyday.Co-workers were all friendly.Management was to critical. The hardest part was the repetiveness of work. There was no enjoyable part to the job.
good,This is for some one who is a quick learner in a wide variety of electronics and parts.
good,This was a very difficult job as we were selling competing brands and shifting strategy almost daily. There was little to no accountability as there was no plan stable enough to compare progress.
good,"Arrow's company slogan is ""5 Years out""--unfortunately this became something of a joke, as everything was five years in coming; improvements, technology refresh on computers and software, restructure and corrections to process issues, etc. When were things going to get better? ""5 years out"". "
good,Company closing doors on September 27 completed unexpected.  Typical work day fast paced and versatile.  Teammates worked well together for the most part.
good,Invests and is interested in new competencies and ideas. Business environment is complex and political in nature. Traditional distribution business often overshadows execution of evolving strategies.
good,"Productive to work"
good,"Long Hours and most Saturdays were spent working. Constant turnover made it hard to get the department to meet production and quality goals. With over 700 employees, I did love the diversity of everyone working there."
good,"Use to have great benefits like a paid sabbatical, but no longer and have changed vacation to be up to managers. The people are good but not as friendly as it was in the past. Not a lot of learning or advancement and always seems that everything is an emergency. But did enjoy the fast pace of work which keeps you busy."
good,A fine place if you wish to be stuck in your current role. There is an unfortunate lack of communication between different divisions making the transition between them all but impossible.
good,"Very qualified people leave Arrow because of the political games that are played there. Unless you play the game, good luck every getting promoted. And the help desk is useless, it takes months to get any support."
good,The job/workload got increasingly stressful as turnover became an issue. The managers and co-workers were nice and it was a very collaborative environment.
good,"Productive and fun, but needs a better pay rate. The entire time i worked there i did not receive the pay that i deserved. Overall the company needs to adjust and work on the pay rate that they provide."
good,always waiting for the next layoff due to margin pressure and jobs moving to Denver. training and development has been reduced to virtually nothing. advancement is nill unless you move to Denver.
good,"This company has given me the opportunity to learn about the warehouse life. I grew up from a simple warehouse associate as a picker and grew out to be a quality member. its all thanks to my trainers for giving me the proper training to do my job. I've learned the value of all the electronic devices that we currently own because by a chance that I could've inspected a piece of that hardware installed inside the unit. Every morning that I wake up, I am excited for what challenges that I will be facing that day at work. it gave me the courage to tackle any obstacle and always figures a way to resolve the issue. "
good,"Initially it started out great. Good extensive training, but upper management were mostly in place from before Arrow moved their headquarters to Denver from New York. East Coast mentality and culture clashes too much with Coloradoans and Denver and they now find themselves with a revolving door because the turnover is so high."
good,Stocking and filling the production floor with what they needed on a daily basis! Daily cycle counts and receiving needed to be stocked if needed for shortages etc
good,Addetto carico/scarico del materiale con utilizzo muletto. Controllo e verifica prodotti con bolla del fornitore. Disimballo e inserimento anagrafica prodotto nel sistema operativo (WMS-SESAM-ORACLE). Picking di materiale tramite sistema operativo TEK TERM.
good,This company has been around a long time and is well respected within their industry.  Lots of products and companies to be familiar and create relationships with for business to be successful.
good,"Could be a lot worse. A huge corporation, a lot of red tape but good benefits and generally good management and move up potential. Money could be better and over work/life balance could be much better. At the end of the day, it is what you make it."
good,"Great hourly employees, but management abuses there authority. Standers are way to high and thats why its hard to hold a job. Advancement is possible but very limited."
good,"The staff were very hardworking. Timelines were strictly enforced which led to projects being completed on time. I felt that at some point, the bottom line led to some harsh budgetary moves."
good,"Middle management is not very good.  There is no morals."
good,"I work at Arrow Electronics, its a computer recycling company. as of right now we test and wipe phones, computers, servers, networks. We cleaned and packed them then put the items away."
good,Management can be difficult. Life/work balance is not their priority
good,On a normal day I would call  in and get my first ticket. As we finished a ticket we would update the current ticket and get another one. We alternated on call.
good,"The employees are great, and the facility was small. We were like a family. Communication on process changes needed work, but got better as time went on. We had company BBQ's for lunch during the summer months to show the employees the appreciation for all the hard work."
good,I enjoyed working at Arrow after they acquired Nu Horizons Electronics. It was a fulfilling job that kept me motivated. My time there I learned a lot from my fellow employee and manger.
good,"Great place for recent college graduates to work.  Social environment, good basic sales skills taught. Exposure to many other companies. Fast paced need to be  self motivated."
good,"Arrow has everchanging goals and job functions--with employees always being changed due to companies new directions."
good,"It was a nice place to work. Very unorganized management, which led to the company closing down. Benefits were good, and working environment was good as well."
good,"Many hard working people, but there were management issues that set the company up to fail, which resulted in the business closing. Promoting from within departments would have made a huge difference."
good,"It's was a great place to be at first, then was watched too closely for metric and work hours started out flexible tho. Micro managing is an issue and not being flexible with your shift hours"
good,I would like those comment for myself. It is a fair place to work. It mainly depends on yourself for your career. The manager or company should have limited impact on your own career.
good,"Arrow electronics is a high demanding job and pays a decent wage, however there is a massive disconnect between management and the employees which allows for no consideration of worker value when management makes a decision. The manager is always on vacation and never available. the benefits are decent and the hours are nice. There is zero job security with this company. If they are losing money they will lay anybody off without the slightest consideration of an employees value, knowledge, seniority, or certifications."
good,They will advance you but they will also work you hard. Be prepared to work your butt off.  It's not for everyone but you do learn great skills!  I am grateful for everything they did for me.
good,"I needed fast and friendly employment, I was sent to Arrow. After some training, I was put on a line. I unboxed and sorted. I boxed picked orders, and I prepared orders for shipping."
good,was under contract. Did what I was asked. Position did not last very long. Training was poor. I had to do alot of self learning and everything I did had to be reviewed by a superior.
good,Tenure at Arrow Electronics was short due to an unexpected promotional opportunity outside the company with a former supervisor.  Overall the company had solid management team and vision.
good,There is no room for growth in this department. You tend to feel stagnant and management is constantly changing. Different teams have different workplace culture depending on your manager. There has been quite a bit of turnover as well.
good,you had to have some computer knowledge and be able to multi task and complete log in info to a virtual warehouse for shipping and receiving to be able to pull orders for shipping also maintain a clean and safe work area follow all safety rules deal with other people professionally willing to help in other work areas and also work overtime if asked.
good,The direction of Arrow is very interesting from an acquisition perspective.  They are focusing on interesting companies and technologies to provide solutions for IoT and AI.  Like the direction they are headed.
good,"Great co-workers, benefits were great compared to a lot of companies. Great time off benefits. "
good,"I was a contractor, but was a great place to work!  Ability to work from home sometimes.  If you like a fast paced and challenging environment this is the place for you!!"
good,The comp plan is an issue in our division for most of the staff. I have learned how to manage a large territory and be active within the structures of many different resellers.
good,"Untrained managers run the show.  It's a bit of a circus."
good,company is growing very quickly which creates some chaos. some benefits have been dropped or paying in full by employee. the wages are good. there are other places to work that pay just as good.
good,"To sum it up, no matter your complaint about another employee or management, you are simply listened to, told they will address the issue, and then never talk about again."
good,Management was good the environment is laid back co-workers where like family very comfortable place to  work job duties are repetitive gets boring for those who would rather be active salary is low advancement not promising my opinion this company is great for those nearing retirement
good,Working at Arrow Electronics was a good place to work. Good benefits. Not very many oppurtunities to advance. Not equal across the board. Raises are not very good when you do get them.
good,"Needs to pay more, needs better benefits. Overall a good company just needs to fix some issues. The employees deserve more pay and not be favorited. Everyone should be treated equally"
good,Good company to work for. it was my first job.
good,"The team at the Arrow office were great. But there was high turn over. "
good,"Looking for sales start up with in the organization as pre sales. "
good,"leader in industry, all work no play. Management continues to layoff and require those left to take on more responsibility without increasing wages/benefits"
good,Overall day to day is fast and furious.  Constant changes happening usually for the better.  Although not always communicated down through the ranks so they understand why moves are happening
good,"it was an OK place to work."
good,The lack of management support makes it hard for front line employees. When an issue is brought to the attention of management it is over seen which makes the job at hand difficult.
good,Little opportunity is here at Arrow unless you are on the inside or friends with upper staff.  Turnover is high and most employees are but a mere number.
good,"I typical day consists of 8-10 hours on a laptop answering email requests, entering customer orders, and quoting solutions.   Learned a great deal about vendor specific programs and channel management.  Upper management does not have a real understanding of the day to day role of each employee plays to positively impact the business.  Out of touch with reality.     The most enjoyable part was building positive relations with vendors and partners."
good,"For a company that prides itself being in the Fortune 150 you are sometimes left head scratching with some decisions and directions."
good,"I felt like Arrow only concentrated on the higher level employees and did not recognize supporting roles.  It was a very politically run company.  The person I reported to, however, was fantastic.  I learned to become a much better assistant by not being micro-managed and was allowed a lot of responsibility."
good,"In earlier years it was a pleasure working with former management where employees were treated like family members.  Then management changed and many of the perks were eliminated, like Christmas parties and picnics."
good,Arrow is a good company to work for.   Management is reasonable.  Pay is acceptable.  Training opportunities are many.  I feel fortunate to have worked at Arrow.
good,nice working place very accessible. the employees are very welcoming and supportive which makes the working environment lighter.work pressure is tolerable.
good,I learned a lot working here but the company was challenging and I really didn't like working here. I did my job to the best of my ability but I moved on for a reason.
good,"A typical work day busy. I learned to use scan gun. Management was fair and flexible. Workplace culture was professional. Hardest part was walking all day. Most enjoyable part was light work, no heavy lifting."
good,"Arrow is an extremely large company. Their are a lot of good people within the branches, but your experience within the company could be hit or miss depending upon the department/ branch that you are in."
good,Arrow is an okay place to get your feet wet.  It is a large company and therefor loose alot of your time in the system.  Lots of opportunity for verticle and horizontal movement
good,"A typical day at Arrow Electronics would be boxing equipment, making sure the shipping label is correct, meeting quota of boxes shipped in a day and keeping your work area stalked and clean."
good,I enjoyed prepping and packing computer parts and loading the trucks in a timely manner. I worked second shift Monday through Friday and most weekends when needed NO longer work at Arrow as they relocated out of state
good,"I can only speak for my location of the Arrow Value Recovery division, and not Arrow Electronics as a whole. I learned a lot about computers and had a lot of good hands on experience with fixing them, and other devices. Once a month we had cookouts or catered lunch. I had a lot of great, friendly. and reliable co-workers which always made my day better. I liked the department I regularly worked in, but most the others were undesirable. The work was simple, but sometimes stressful and they often expected the impossible to get done as if it was regular work. More than once we had 6 months straight of 60 hour, 6 days of week work schedule. They also often changed training procedures which gradually slowed production the more they changed them. Our management did not communicate well with our upper-management, and a lot our questions and suggestions were never taken into account. I would request tools and resources and it would take more than one e-mail and few conversations with HR until I would finally get them 6 months later, or I would just give up and get creative. Also, wage raises were very low even after getting an outstanding year review. The upside is that they offered really great benefits, and an abundant amount of vacation/sick time. I would recommend a job like this for getting hands on experience with computer hardware, but not for long term. I can't speak for other Arrow divisions, but I imagine they are better managed than our AVR location; which is now shut down so my review is probably not helpful anyway. Although I received a decent severance for the layoff for"
good,data entry and adding value to units such as laptops and desktops.  co-workers are easy to get along with.  protecting client information and data erasure on hard drives.
good,"The company itself isn't bad, but the opportunities for advancement were limited and the consistent overtime takes a toll on personal life and health. Very few holidays and limited vacation/sick/personal time to use. Co-workers were great and made the day go by most of the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was educating technicians and watching them grow."
good,There wan't not enough training with supervisor. I think should be more training and more time to collect all that Arrow does. Overall good company to work for.
good,It seems like only 6 months a year this company has enough work for their employees. The rest of the time they are moving people around and firing the rest
good,Great place to work if your only concern is income. Regular hours with plenty of opportunity for overtime. Poor management and culture.
good,Reasonable hours but not consistent in work flow. Many changes every week that makes the job much harder to keep up with the works conditions.
good,"Management is worthless, don't listen to new ideas from lower levels. They only care about themselves and will cut everyone down for them to gain another step further."
good,"Assist customer in design and development of wireless, Networking, RF, Fiber optics as well as Analog systems."
good,A typical day consisted of inspecting orders and programming data into computers.
good,Arrow has a very talented team and is a very reputable company.
good,"I work at a station of my own and I removed hard drives from laptops, desktops, and servers per customer request. During my time here I have learned the inside of these units and how to troubleshoot problems if any, and how to fix them if needed. Management here does not really show that they genuinely care about their employees and a lot of my co-workers feel the same way. Everyone under management gets along and does their job/duty respectively. I enjoy learning new things about the software that we use and learning about different processes."
good,Too much panic by Corporate upper level management. Created a brand new division and at the first bad news of earnings on Wall Street dissolved the division.  Laid everybody off.
good,"I had no real problems while working at Arrow. I was able to start in receiving and then moved to shipping, where i got more responsibility."
good,It is over all a good company to work for. The management is poor.
good,Great company!  Employees are nice.  Worked as a temp and work was done.
good,"It is good at working their.This company is USA based company."
good,I enjoyed the quality portion of my job as it allowed me to gain most of my knowledge (10+ years).  The job was varied and I enjoyed the investigative aspect of working in quality.
good,"Very fast work pace, Nice people to work with. Management was fair with employees."
good,"At the current time, I am not going to provide a review.  This does not reflect any negative or positive feelings I have in regards to Arrow Electronics"
good,Inside sales is key to company growth. Not too many programs existed for training and advancement of inside sales teams.
good,"i am new in this company , and i observed a lot of things, i learned from my brother and my sister in law. they are both a manager of their company. relatives are not allowed to work in the same company to avoid some problem.. As i heard and observed in the company i have seen most of the people working are relatives or families. And i know and i have seen some of them have their brother working as a part time and the sister is a regular employee. I saw her one time that she left her work and go back to the clock to log in again but she log in to the temp. clock, and after that i heard that she have a brother working in the shipping dept, as a part time, so i thinkk she do clock in for her brother because he was late at work. And their step mom always come from her mouth the word "" i will give her an error "" and also i heard she said to her friend that she fix the error of her friend. i don't have any intension or get them fired at work, coz i know how hard to get a job here in the US and they have kids to support. And some workers also who get an incentive are cheating the company. they make an exeption card but what they did they went to the rest room and phone. And one lady working with me i saw her throwing the remaining parts in the garbage and when i ask her why? she answer me... its a company money not yours they are rich,,,so i told her it means u don't care. and how if this company went down and we loose our job what will u do, she said she don't care. i hope that the company will give time to fix this problem and focus on it first. I do this because i work for more"
good,"I've seen multiple areas of Arrow as part of my job.  There is an overwhelming sense that management is fine with the temporary fixes and there is no motivation to affect necessary changes.  I feel lucky that I get to work with great individuals in my department.  However, I have worked with many where I cannot believe they are still employed and how HR hasn't been clued-in to certain individuals that are causing significant turnover.  It just seems like a place of complacency rather than excellence.  I will note that the work-life balance is great, though that's not true for all groups.  And we are underpaid compared to the rest of the Denver market."
good,"werkzaam bij één van de kleinere divisies van Arrow Electronics, met focus op de ITAD business welke wel een wereldwijde dekking heeft. Hierbij ben ik verantwoordelijke voor de 9 Europese Operation teams. De focus ligt hier uiteraard of de service levels en compliance. Daarnaast efficiency en het streven naar improvements. "
good,"Overall Arrow Electronics is a great company. However, growth within the company is very limited. As a member of the AVR division with Arrow my job never truly felt secure."
good,"I liked working at Arrow while they were still treating people good. When they laid off a ton of people in ONE day, that's when I said enough was enough. I did enjoy it, but once they laid off all the people, the work load got pushed on to other people who had more than enough work already and still expected to get EVERYTHING done by it's expected due date. Management was great & so were the co-workers, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend Arrow until they can prove they won't lay off anymore people."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the people at Arrow, and appreciated all of the opportunities to enhance my skills through challenging work.  The downside from my experience were the long hours and below market compensation, which was my primary motivation for moving on."
good,The place is alright if you know what you are doing and roll with the punches well but as time went by they seemed less employee focused and more deadlines and results.
good,"Peers are great to work with and company is socially responsible. "
good,"The job is easy but repetitive. I worked part time. Learned to be punctual, but the place was poorly managed. There is a big place for a cafeteria and breaks are normal for the hours worked."
good,If you're looking for a career option Arrow Electronics is not for you. If you're just out of high school and looking for a job this is the perfect entry job for you.
good,I have enjoyed working at Arrow Electronics.  My co-workers are wonderful people.  The workplace is business casual which is a plus.  What was most enjoyable for me were the cookouts and holiday parties we had.
good,"Recruiting environment is so focused on the process that we lose sight of building relationships with candidates. This may be due to the fact that majority of the recruiters are outsourced through an RPO, so the internal recruiting team is small and project based. Team environment is lacking."
good,"I really liked working for Arrow Electronics it was a fun job,the job keeps you active and youre on your feet all day overall its a good job,managment is good their work ethics are good."
good,"I have learned a lot from this company.  When I first began my career here, there was a lot of structure and present management.  My only complaint is the lack of mentorship that I received as I took on new positions and responsibilities."
good,When the I worked for was under Market 2 Market and then Chasm and Intechra there was great opportunities to grow. That is what I look for in an employer. I want to find a company like that again/
good,"The work place fun, we were all pretty close. I liked the fact that there was mix of different kind of people, who made the time interesting. The supervisor were very helpful in getting things done. I enjoyed my time while I was working here."
good,"Arrow ist ein riesen Konzern der Weltweit agiert. "
good,"Responsibility for integrating Richey Electronics (purchased by Arrow in 1998) into Arrow Electronics value added division with full responsibility for the sales and P&L of a $125 million assembly division.  "
good,"Arrived at work to relieve the night manager, and took over his duties during the day. Created and managed schedules, improved employee productivity. Maintained high quality control."
good,"I deal with Manufacturers and Reps from the time I walk in the door until I leave, trying to get that super special price to book an order, or going to the manufacturer to get parts that one of my customers need...."
good,"Arrow was an ok place to work.  However, over time, management became less focused on employees and work life balance and the work environment became very stressful."
good,I enjoyed here very much. Loved my coworkers but it was extremely disappointing when they laid off all those people. About 1/2 of the office was let go and some of the people had worked there many many years.
good,"There is a lot of excitement in joining this company, they provide you with all of the tools to learn as much as you can about the industry.  I enjoy working with the people around me and it definitely makes the day go by faster.  The hardest times at work come nearing the end of each quarter."
good,"Now management has changed and now they are at growing path. one should join this company if one has longer stay goal with the company."
good,"Este trabajo fué para mi totalmente nuevo, aprendí labores comerciales, gestionar pedidos, hacer ofertas a los clientes, atender sus gestiones tanto por e-mail como por teléfono etc. El trato con el cliente siempre era muy agradable, esto era lo que mas me gustaba. La parte más dificil era el trabajar con referencias muchas veces desconociendo el producto, tanto yo como mis compañeros, ya que esto ocasionaba algunos errores."
good,I loved working here with experienced people that has worked here for a number of years. With all this experience it makes doing your job very easy.
good,"This place has an excellent environment, the people is very cooperative and nice. I learned a lot about how to fix inventory discrepancies, the basics of ORACLE and WMS. The only hard thing about this job is that it gets old after a few months, the procedures are very standardized and repetitive, there is no much room to grow and the new positions are not usually given to people already employed."
good,Arrow Electronics is a great company to work for. Management treats their employees with a tremendous amount of respect. The co-workers are like a family and everyone helps each other to do the best they can each day. The hardest part of the job are the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great work atmosphere.
good,"unpacking computers and parts for intergration, learning new things and meeting new people"
good,"A typical day at arrow consisted of being assigned , pulling and building a job consisting of between one and ten systems . Each job had a time assigned to it to ensure the proper amount of work was getting done each day . I was able to learn a great deal because the systems being intergrated changed every so often and I worked along side with engineering to develop build plans for them . Management wasn't the greatest but my co-workers were very knowledgeable and fun to work with . The hardest part of the job was the overtime . We sometimes worked over time for three or four months at a time . The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new systems ."
good,I learned to have a better work ethic and built on to my production skills. Great co workers who for the most part had a positive attitude.
good,"Interacting with the user"
good,"Good company , good pay nice job if your in college for IT you can learn about any computer...  This Good job for people with A+ certification I mean the pay is pretty good for a entry level computer repair job. Good for college students who study in the IT field."
good,"We would arrive to work, have a little meeting on what needs to be done for the day and what needs to be pushed out. Then the fun begins.  Our work place is very much being busy and trying to get orders that need to be out for the day.  If we are done doing out task we would move ourselves to another department where work is needed.  There is always help needed in any kind of departments, so we are constantly on a roll.  The hardest part of the job is trying to learn something quick and fast in little time.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when we see management getting involved in helping us getting our job done. Pretty much management getting there hands nice and dirty...When they get involved that means to us that they are communicating with us and seeing what else needs to be done."
good,"There is no typical work day. No two days are ever the same, with that being said a person can learn a lot from the company if they are willing to try."
good,"I was employed for 15 years with the company that Arrow Electronics bought (Lex Electronics). My position at Lex Electronics was Manager of Product Accounting, which was a department that was created to identify all the profit losses which went undiscovered. Upon creation of this department it was quickly noticed by upper management that this area saved the company several million dollars a year. I did learn quite a bit at Arrow due to the fact that after I completed the transition of incorporating the Product Accounting Department to Arrow, I transferred to Inventory Management responsible for Intel and Motorola.I really enjoyed working with inventory and also a variety of other manufacturers. This was an entire different side of the company and I feel that I was an asset in this position with my financial background, as I met all the goals that were set."
good,The company as a whole was a great company. Compensation was competitive and fair. The work/life balance in the group I worked in was very good and always had good communication.
good,"This was a difficult company to work for. Finding a supervisor or manager was always difficult when needed, especially under emergency circumstances. Getting any sort of training outside of your applied position was also a task not easy to complete. I felt the company is a lot more worried about numbers and production than the overall skill set and job duty understanding of each employee. I also feel strongly that the company was unorganized in the matter of shift fulfillment and management. Many times shifts could be cut at 8-10 hours and often worked up to 12 with a large amount of time being wasted on who was doing what and where due to a non- sufficient amount of work or orders."
good,"Long hours, it is a sales focused organisation and that drives any decision day to day, humans are there to drive sales, the trade war between US and China has been tough on the company, lots of great people and collaborators at most levels, lack of experience, indecision and understanding of how to truly innovate. Good place for those early in their careers as you get exposed to some of the biggest tech companies in the world."
good,Don't believe them when they say 90 days. I have been a temp for over a year with absolutely no incentives or paid days off. You are just a number there.
good,the work was easy to do. Some days were slow while others were fast. Working with others there was fairly easy except for a couple people. They pay well even for a temp agency worker. If you go through a temp agency just be aware that they might not hire you in the end.
good,"A typical day at Arrow was for the most part drama free. Once assigned to an area you were trained by an employee that ran that area."
good,"It was my first job, I have really nice work experience their, my supervisor was really helpful and co-workers was really helpful. As a fresher it was really good opportunity for me I learned a lot their"
good,They strain the facility and often extra time is required to get all  the work out. This does not seem to be changing anytime soon. he buttons are all pushed form the company  HQ in CO.
good,"Hours vary, you will get hours... forced occasionally, somewhat okay but favoritism management, good coworkers, good paycheck, you do start as a temp."
good,Arrow was fun because l got a feel of all that l studied in School.Never knew cleaning Hard Drives and destroying data on hard drives was Big a bussin
good,"Slowly we were eliminated if we were over 30 years of age, only to be replace by a 20 something young lady.  The last employee that was over 50, was told she was too old to work there and was eventually let go"
good,"90% travel based, would like to be home more then 2-3 weeks out the month. I enjoy traveling just to 3 weeks a trip. The hardest part of my job is traveling."
good,"Great place to gain experience, not great for promotion if on a smaller team/ business unit. Recruiters are supportive and helpful in search for internal career advancement. All-in-all a good place to work."
good,"Arrow was the only place I think I actually enjoyed working. Someone left a Google review talking about a female lead/supervisor that gets jealous of your productivity and takes steps to get you fired... That is exactly what happened to me and another co-worker. The both of us came in and ""worked circles"" around everyone that was already there and that, I guess, wasn't a good thing. Despite that, I liked it there. The environment was pretty laid back and not super stressful for me.  It was hard to keep a good pace in the summer time though, because we had to wear these heavy lab coats in a hot warehouse and stand next to a 6""0' tall rack of hot hard drives... That part wasn't fun."
good,"Team structures enable interaction and sharing of direction, views, values that help determine appropriate action to take.  It takes a team to run a business."
good,"Good people to work with, not enough resources to be fully successful.  Going through a lot of changes currently.  Management does not provide enough strategy and guidance, leave you on your own to succeed/fail.  Management helps when they can with customer issues."
good,"Arrow is a innovative company that has reinvented itself and grown  exponentially over the last decade.However, if you desire to climb the corporate ladder and get promoted this is not the place for you.  Management is engrained and unless you are hired as management you will stay where you are."
good,"Good place to work, but not great.  Re-org has contributed to low morale and uncertainty across the organization.  This re-org also contributed to lack of advancement for qualified and excelling employees."
good,Arrow was a good solid company to work for. There was ongoing emphasis on team culture and training. The work was usually fast paced and very demanding.
good,I didnt want to continue to in sales and travel every day of the week.
good,Heb altijd met plezier gewerkt. Trainingen gevolgd.
good,nice company to work in and it has a ping pong table with soft drinks in all the floors. I liked the meeting rooms which are quite friendly to be booked by any employee.
good,Great matrix structured company to work for that is promoting leading edge technologies and services.  Many opportunities for career advancement and knowledge transfer regarding industry leading practices.
good,"Arrow is a good company to work for, but they have lay-offs every couple of years. "
good,"Arrow electronics is my second experience in a warehouse, the job was sometimes fast paced, the workers are friendly, leads and supervisors mostly helpful. They recycle too"
good,"Fun environment and you can have work-life balance. "
good,"Very professional environment. Paid trips to Denver, CO twice for a company-wide competition. Overall, great experience, but not as engineering-oriented as I would have hoped (I was mostly working with business/finance interns)."
good,i like working there it was a fast paced environment always looking for something to do . it always was busy and overtime also. was a picker and a runner
good,"Distribution is a difficult place to be in technology at this time. Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Arrow Electronics and grew tremendously, it is time for a change."
good,"Arrow was a good company to work for. My managers were understanding, fair and provided me everything I needed to do my job. Unfortunately my department was outsourced."
good,"Arrow have an amazing collaborative spirit among the employees that I had never seen before at any employer in any country."
good,"A typical work day at Arrow can vary quite a bit.  End of month and quarters are quite busy--working well past 40 hours per week."
good,"I was a contractor, so I did not receive any benefits but the permanent employees seemed very happy with them. I would be open to returning to Arrow in another role."
good,"Good company, complex corporate direction. More focus should be placed in long term growth. Great manager and open coworkers. Would apply to the job again."
good,Covered Parking and free coffee.  Steady stream of work and a lot of accounts to manage.  Great building.  Very diverse workforce.  Too many meetings and training classes.
good,Good timings and good Management.I have already completed 5 years in this organization. I have found this place very good to work and stay in this organization.
good,"Working with Arrow Electronics was a fun and educating experience. Arrow was my first warehouse experience, the company provided all the training needed to perform and fulfill necessary duties to distribute electronic components and computer products to industrial and commercial customers globally."
good,If I can go back to Arrow in the future i would. It’s a great job to start your career at. Great people great management and they take excellent care of there employees.
good,I really enjoyed working at Arrow Electronics and was disappointed that they chose to eliminate both positions I was handling to outsource outside of my state. I had hoped to be hired on full time after my contracts were completed.
good,Dedicated knowledgeable staff focused on quality and customer service. Multicultural family environment with employees having 7-10 years on the job experience.
good,I learned valuable skills at Arrow.  Arrow allowed me to engage with customers and Arrow Sales to resolve customer issues and determine effective resolutions to prevent future problems/complaints.
good,"Stable but changes happening. "
good,"•	Played a pivotal role in securing new business and closing sales on Arrow’s products."
good,"A job as any other, pays the bills and has the benefits.  I would recommend working here if you are overworked at your current employment.  For the most part, the management is good."
good,"Big company, very successful.   Decent benefits, great passionate employees overcome most challenges.  Big push to move from B&M to E-company.  Would recommend."
good,Intern program includes linking interns across the country collaborating on a team-based group project. The interns are flown to the headquarters to meet and present their findings which was very enjoyable.
good,"Many people are able to telecommute which makes for a good work/life balance. Arrow has done a good job of connecting with customers but management, policies and processes are always changing and it can be stressful to keep up with what's going on."
good,I was only here a short time (laid off due to acquisition) and worked remotely so I cannot comment much on the internal culture and daily interactions.
good,"Great Team Atmosphere, good managers, excellent benefits, excellent working conditions in remodeled building with mountain views and amazing café, small phone rooms for personal and speaker phone meetings"
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, un gran lugar para aprender y crecer como profesionista."
good,Lack of work was the reason I was laid off and let go after no work for more then 6 months. All and all it was ok place to be. Will put your through school just wish there wasn't a lack of work.
good,Arrow is a employer that is in a fast paced industry with margin under attack from all sides so work environment is fast and stressful.
good,"Very busy days, our team has very little turnover in employees. Interface daily with sales teams, customers and management."
good,"Overall the company is good to work for. I started with the company in 2001 when it was known as Pioneer. We then went with a new branding year where the company changed its name to Agilysys and we were then bought by Arrow in 2006."
good,"Very limited opportunities to advance and job ""insecurity.""  Great training and good benefits.  Options for self-improvement and education to help personal development although prevalent feeling of job insecurity.  If they don't need you in your role, you are pushed out quickly."
good,"My co-workers made it a pleasant place to work. It has been 13 years since I've been there due to leaving during lay- offs, so I have no idea what it is like now."
good,"An EAD requires great team work to get the job done by the end of the week. You have to load the computers, wipe, scan and image. This alone takes about 8 hours per computer. Each week there is at least 700 computers to wipe and image. Then it must be scanned out to be sold to potential customers. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything gets done on time. The most enjoyable part is learning about different electronic equipment."
good,"Currently it is not an awesome place to work(Only in India)"
good,"This was a very interesting and good experience for me.  I had never worked in Distribution before.  I understood the basics of distribution, but working for Arrow made me live it.  Was hired to start a new program from scratch.  Had to hire 8 team members.  Was very fortunate to have hired 8 very strong individuals.  Main goal of the program was to support the entire Bay Area Branch in the Electromechanical portion of the business (power supplies, connectors, etc).  It was amazing how easy it was to grow numbers once a company puts a little focus on a particular section of the business."
good,"needed to keep the SLA (service level agreement ) of 97% or higher "
good,we would work long days and even over time because we would pick up the slack to get orders out on time. it was fine at first and then it got old because i was not able to spend quality time with my family.
good,Excellent company to work for with the exception of the work/life balance.  Great group of people.  Arrow is in constant acquisition mode so there are new challenges on a daily basis.
good,Great hours fun environment. I like my co workers and my supervisor is the best. He knows his job and looks out for his employees
good,"Excellent place to work. There was a lot of stress,but it keep you alert"
good,Arrow is a world leader in distribution of semiconductors and passive electro mechanical components
good,"A typical day is generating reports, problem solving."
good,Immediate management were a team leading good group. It was a big department and most of the co-workers go along great!.
good,"Professional employees"
good,The work was very enjoyable. There was a challenge to everyday work that made it worth while to go to work everyday
good,se trabaja muy augusto en esta empresa. los managers están cuando los necesitas.  hay muy buen ambiente laboral.
good,"Typical office environment"
good,"scanning electronics, making sure that they are in proper working order"
good,In this role I supported and worked for two separate companies.  I learned to balance the expectations and requirements of both companies while completing essential job functions.
good,Fun place to work! Learned more about production assembly.  The management provided excellent training. It was great to work with the team concept. 
good,It was a very good place to work and very challenging. It was fast paced which i liked
good,"Worked to Increase sales penetration within assigned accounts, by developing relationships with buyers and working with engineers on prototype developments. Supporting other team members with their accounts while maintaining the high ethical standards set by Arrow. Coworkers are energetic and ethical team members. Everyone is encouraged to stretch their boundaries and improve their skills."
good,"Arrow is a decent place to work. I enjoyed most of my work there as a supervisor. I didn't enjoy the labor model and thought it was a bit weird how operators would instantly replace people. The upper management liked to drive kaizen event s and process improvements, which is a good thing."
good,Goals were set where they were attainable. I had the autonomy to drive the business with my partners without minimal micro management.
good,"Good warehouse environment, most of the warehouse is temperature controlled for comfort.  Just need good attendance, punctuality and decent work ethic."
good,"A lot of opportunities for growth, different experiences, and great people. Leadership opportunities for projects and to work with various departments and divisions."
good,Learned lots of things about electronics and will use on my journey for growth . I had minimal experience when I started but now feel like I can jump right in at any similar position .
good,"Over  the years this company gave me wonderful opportunities to advance my career working with wonderful people. However, due to company relocation from NY to Denver over time the environment shifted and became a very uneasy place to work. My job was eventually eliminated."
good,"I would still be working there but they relocated the Data Center  to"
good,"Fast pace, be on your A game.The work load would come in, and you wanted to get it in the door and to the next step.Worked with very good people that would be by your side if you needed a hand."
good,"Can be a good place to work, although culture could use some help, and comp and benefits are on lower end of being competitive.  There is a high level of turnover, but can be a gratifying place if you work on the right team."
good,"Overall a good place to work for, but as far as upward mobility, unless you know someone in a decision making position, it is very hard to get a promotion, even if your background warrants at least a look."
good,It is a strong company to work for and very secure in the market. I would say due to its size it can get hard to feel included or required however overall a great company.
good,"Good place to work, I would still be there had the position not been re-located to another state."
good,"it was a good job with great people in higher roles.  after 5 years was laid off.  Was able to travel some.  would recommend other to work there, depending on the department."
good,"This position was with a staffing company and provided me with the company focus, culture and a knowledge of their current order and inventory systems."
good,"Arrow is overall a good company.   Smaller divisions do not get the perks that the corporate office gets.  No room for advancement in the divisions.  "
good,"Depending on which manufacturers you manage, being an inside sales representative has varying degrees of stress. First of all, the ECS division of Arrow operates as a distributor, so you're selling to resellers and certified business partners, not directly to end customers."
good,The best part of this job was the colleague as we all started together. The job got a bit. Print after a while as there was not much work to do. There were also a lot of changes going on which could be confusing at times.
good,"Excellent place to work; High integrity culture;  Top value added distributor in the global IT industry focused on data center class hardware, software and cloud solutions"
good,"I've learned sales, technical and management skills. Hardest part of the job is the pay plan. But I enjoy the outside sales position. I make my own schedule and money. Although there is a cap on my commission."
good,"This particular job was at a facility known as SIVAC which was first owned by Pioneer Standard Electronics, then Agilysys, Inc., and finally by Arrow Electronics.  Not all the plusses or minuses can be attributed to just one of these companies since each company kept most of the same people and policies after acquiring the facility.  The facility itself is no longer in existence, after acquisition, Arrow Electronics shut the facility down and moved the operations out to one the Western States.  "
good,Large corporate job.  Cubicles and all the normal stuff that comes along with it. Nothing really was bad except for feeling like a cog in the wheel after awhile.
good,"Arrow Electronics was a very professional environment in an emerging technology business of component distribution. "
good,Arrow is an interesting company to work for. There already is really efficient softwares implemented. That enables young finance professional to learn in an already established company. It can be good to work for. The only problem is the money advancement is not that good and hierarchie is really strong.
good,"I learned so much from the VP and Operations manager, I looked up "
good,"la gente que alli trabaja es lo mejor"
good,"Enjoyed my years with the company "
good,Arrow was a fun work place but at the same time it was safety first and that made the jon even more enjoyable
good,"It was a difficult role to learn initially, but once settled into the position it was a good and developing role. It's a great place to work with lots of events and things going on"
good,"My typical work day consist of getting a pass down from the Supply Cordinator before me. Logging into my computer. Checking my emails. Then print On Demand Carrier Check list. This is a print out of all the orders requiering tape that are due for this day. I walk to every location and verify that we have these tapes avaialable. I maintain the ""Cage"". This is where all the supplies and orders are distibuted through out the floor. I make labels for orders, kit orders and load and unload the conveyer. I'v learned so much from this company about ordering supplies throught the world from different vendors. I work all day with may co workers getting them the supplies they need to do there jobs. So we all have to get along. I like my co workers. The hardest part of my work day is having to keep up with all the demands of supplies. I do it very well but is hard sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I am a big part of this companies production.."
good,Every day was a diffrent challenge
good,A typical work day is answering customers email requests and releasing of orders. The most difficult thing is you are required to figure out things and find departments to resolve your issues. Often taking on task outside of your realm and taking up you day to be productive in other areas you are required to perform. The Stress level can be very high and burnout is real. The management does support you and I have learned more about the industry.
good,"Working culture is good. "
good,"Great team mates, work was constant, traveled a lot, too bad they closed our division down and was laid off. Learned so much here but it grew too fast and they should have left it at 15 drivers instead of 50 !!"
good,"I enjoyed my time there.I expanded my excel skill set, which has been very helpful since I left the company. The compensation was great, and the location was good for me."
good,I enjoyed working at Arrow Electronics.  They continue to change with the business environment and adapt to changes in the market.  They are International in scope and provide services that benefit everyone.  I would recommend them as a place to work.
good,Because I was the only receptionist/office administrator for Arrow it became challenging to get a break or take a lunch was there were days with constant visitors -- unable to step away until time allowed.
good,"I came in with an acquisition of my previous company. I found the management at Arrow to be very supportive, agile and informative."
good,"PSG and Arrow are the same company.  My experience with Arrow was fine, I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with at PSG."
good,"Arrow was always fair.  It has many products, and at times a product line does well. When things change outside of Arrow's control it has to take action."
good,It was a great experience. Love the people in my team. lacks direction most of the time. Perfect place for go getters and someone who like to work independently.  Managers leaves you alone most of the time.  Can be good or bad depending on what kind of project you are working on?
good,"Great company with lots of growth in the future.  The biggest area of improvements would lack of life/work balance and too much internal focus.   Arrow is a sales company without the #1 focus of driving sales.   The sales team is secondary to HR, Asset, and Marketing."
good,I have been working at Arrow Electronics on contract basis (Less than a year).  Homely feelings with good working environment.   lot of scope to learn new things
good,"I enjoy working for Arrow. Good people, interesting work, fast paced. I'm located at the global headquarters, so there are plenty of opportunities to interact with various departments and executive level decision makers. It's a big, public company, so the focus on quarterly results and ""meeting your number"" is tremendous. Maybe not any more intense than at other large public companies, but can be stressful nonetheless."
good,It was  great place to work great room for growth and the people were very polite. i learned a lot of skills there with data entry and how to manage people and manage product that came through the door. my co-workers were hard workers and we did the task today everyday. hardest part of the Job was dealing with the new management that took over. Most enjoyable was interacting with my co-workers on a daily basis.
good,"Arrow has great co workers who are very helpful and cooperative."
good,good company to work for although advancement opportunities are scarce.  good benefits with 401k match.  nice workout facility on campus and cafeteria.
good,The typical day in the life of an Arrow Product Manager is working with our sales teams a various branches and our assigned suppliers to get the best costs possible to secure pricing that would help us win business and maintain profit margin expectations.
good,"recibia el material para la produccion de las diferentes lineas que existian, por eso tenia que coordinar a mis compañeros otorgando las resposabilidades y el area de trabajo para cada uno, mientras yo resolvia problemas de inventario, recibimiento erroneo, inspeccion de calidad, o seguimiento de materiales HOT."
good,"The people I worked with were great people, always willing to help out when needed.  Nice environment to work in with several amenities available to employees."
good,"The people in general are friendly and nice to work with when referring to the company as a whole.  This all depends of course on what group and who your manager is."
good,"Working for Arrow Electronics introduced me to a new field of business. I supported 5 buyers and provided customer service to external employees across the country. "
good,"I've learned a lot over the past 7 years and have advanced similar to my previous jobs.  Arrow provides reimbursement for education and training seminars and has a strong ""promote from within"" philosophy."
good,"Arrow is a great company to work for. Pay and Benefits are excellent for the type of position. Advancement isn't great. They try very hard to hang on to people in their positions, but are not good at approving merit increases or helping you grow professionally. Work/Life is pretty good, flexible with time off. Management seems to be apathetic in their positions."
good,"challenging obstacles, learned to resolve any issues with the help of co-worker and management. most enjoyable is learning to operate machinery such as forklifts and computer software. a typical day at work is inventory products and staging them in the right locations."
good,"Great people to work with for the most part, systems are slightly outdated but currently being updated, good benefits and nice facilities with new gym, cafeteria, etc..."
good,Standard 8-5 job. Learned tremendous amount regarding Tier 1 CM's through out the US. Department went through 4 managers while I was employed. I worked with positive people and negative people.
good,"Unloading & Loading of semi trucks, Pulling product from racks to be ran."
good,"New Leads & New Orders follow up "

good,Good place to work. One of the leading employers in Denver metro. Be prepared for endless cycles of firing and hiring.
good,"Arrow is a Fortune 100 company that is very focused on employee inclusion, innovation, and looking to the future to provide goods and services for its customers"
good,Great Place and friendly colleagues. Though a lot depends on your individual manager. Exposure working with remote teams.  Limited opportunity for growth and development.
good,"Enjoyed my time there .  I loved the responsibilities.  I was responsibly for 6 sites and a large inventory value.  I was traveling a lot, which I enjoyed and we had a very good team."
good,"Arrow's ITAD had a strong influence and support from the parent, Arrow Electronics. Meet a lot of great people there, had a lot of opportunities to work with teams across the US and Europe. I learned more about my field and made an positive impact for the goals of the company."
good,"This served as an opportunity to learn sales, inside and outside as well as hone in on customer service. Also management was fair and understanding within the branch."
good,"The People were friendly, work was easy and the pay was good. The hardest part of my job was there was not many people in my department so on busy days it made it a lot more stressful for me."
good,"Great people, management wasnt too bad and pay was pretty good.  Only problem is the company decided to close its doors!  Evidently due to not making any money, but that happens when you have people running the place with no clue of how to be efficient."
good,"Arrow employs the best people in the business. The downside is the constant turn over and layoffs. "
good,Worked renewals daily to make sure i was 90 days out. Benefits were great. Other employees made the workplace culture fun to be apart of. Good environment to work in.
good,"You can expect a salary in line with the lower end of the industry spectrum.  You will find it hard to advance in a biased culture, but people are nice (to your face)."
good,"extra summer hour, free office gym, busy during month end close, other times has good work and life balance, unlimited sick day, good employee discount website. not much promotion opportunity"
good,"Arrow is a great company to begin a career after graduating college. They even hire people without college degrees, and do not favor those with one. It is a clean and new office & I've learned a ton about corporate culture. Unfortunately, it is difficult to support myself on the entry level salary they offer. Since I started two years ago, the cost of living in Denver has gone up, and the pay has not. The rate of advancement is very slow, which is why I'm looking for a new job."
good,"If you are looking for a company to grow with and is committed to helping you develop and advance professionally, Arrow Electronics is it! "
good,"Cool culture, fast pace but enjoyable work environment. Wonderful cross collaboration and support between teams. Awesome involvement with surrounding communities."

good,"I have worked for Arrow for 9 years and have enjoyed it.  I  was afforded a lot of upward momentum and had the opportunity to gain many skills.  Arrow is currently going though lots of changes and I am looking to move on because I need a new challenge and the pay is slightly lower than industry standards."
good,Difficult to get a promotion there. unstable depending on the quarter as to whether the company will lay off employees to maintain quarterly goals. Great people to work with. Collaboration and teamwork are a good constant.
good,"Good company to work for.  They have a nice gym, and café..  The job requires high transactions, and good customer service.  You will need to be Sales motivated, and service oriented."
good,"Extremely fast paced, everything was same day ship.  Deadlines to meet daily.  Manage close to 40 people, consisting of 3 different groups.  Environment was that of a start-up company with many perks however, in return we gave 150% all the time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with my team.  I thrive managing people."
good,Arrow is a large global organization with many different roles available as well as opportunities for advancement.  Most of the opportunities are located in the Denver corporate HQ though.
good,"Arrow electronics is one of the leading electronics components distributor in world. my job function was product manager for key semiconductor lines like TEXAX Instruments, Vishay & Osram Opto. Working in Arrow was truely amajing experience and getting to interact with top suppliers & leaders really gave lot of learning & key skills which helped me to grow as a leader & strategist."
good,Lots of opportunities if you live near their corporate office.  Great rapport with many customers and suppliers.  May have a lot of layers of management.
good,"Arrow has about 18,500 employees currently, so there is a lot to be said about job security. Even people who have been laid off have the opportunity to apply for other positions that are open and management is really good about helping them into new roles. "
good,Working for Arrow provided me with a ton of opportunities to develop and explore my career options. The company understands work/life balance thus providing compensation to alleviate outside stresses.
good,The hardest part of my job as Customer Service Representative was dealing with though Customers in times they have urgent request and suddenly their requested items weren't yet available due to some internal (production) issues...I learned how to be gentle/calm and patient.

good,"I was responsible for contacting customers via phone and e-mail for collections and helped managing 60,000+ accounts with various database and spreadsheet applications. "
good,I always liked going to work because of the people I interacted with were pleasant and helpful.  I liked the fact that we were not micro-managed in my role as a material planner II.  We did our job and at the end of the day I felt like I had accomplished what was needed.
good,A strong company to work for. Most of my daily duties were either computer packaging or assembly. Management rarely supervised us but had high expectations. Hardest part is when massive orders came through and moving really fast was required to keep up.
good,My position was in the shipping dept. We would scan and consolidate orders for shipment. It was a production job and there was not much room for mistakes as these were expensive products that must arrive to the correct address and they must be the right part to ensure future business.It was nice to work well with others and help others when needed.
good,Typical office setting with casual attire. Ability to work from home with little stipulations. Mostly stable personalities within office team.
good,great work environment offer the best insurance plans available in town would refer a friend if in need. overtime available when posted.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management.Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.Decent amount of red tape and politics,but is expected of a big company."
good,"Un tipico dia en el trabajo es llegar con una agradable actitud a cumplir con nuestras responsabilidades, interactuar con el resto de los companeros de las diferentes areas para obtener mejores resultados en los procesos, una de las cosas que mas me gusta es la libertad para proponer y hacer cambios enfocados en mejoras."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty good for the most part. "
good,"I earned many opportunities during my years with Arrow Electronics while working with high quality people at all levels of the organization.  The company is very focused on monthly/quarterly results creating unstable job security at all levels of the organization, but particularly at the hourly level.  It is difficult to state that employees are the number one priority when executing multiple layoffs in multiple organizations although a reality in today's economy.  My responsibilities demanded travel 50 to 75% which was difficult, but expected.  The collaboration with the leaders and employees was the most enjoyable aspect of my responsibilities and I do believe that I was compensated fairly and that Arrow provides a good benefits package."
good,"A typical day would involve trying to resolve inventory discrepancies. A lot of preventive maintenance with cycle counting. Management was great to work with, the hardest part of my job was the yearly inventory which would run for 2 weeks straight. The best part of the job was solving problems or finding missing product."
good,Job required managing and planning for multiple ongoing projects. Tracking project status and addressing risks as well as updating forecasts and tracking report hours.
good,"une journée de travail typique consistait à répondre aux clients , répondre à des demandes de prix , établir  des devis , prendre des cdes , négocier de meilleur prix d'achats, saisies des cdes , suivi des cdes jusqu'à la livraison, traiter les litiges......"
good,"Check all emails and investigate any queries "
good,"I worked for Arrow's child company Converge for a number of years and though still a temp after 3 years with the compay was an ""Acting Lead"" in their ITAD division.  I left the company when they were acquired by Arrow due to layoffs of all temporary workers (Converge was notorious for keeping people as temps for years before considering them for hire. Some as long as 9+ years). "
good,Work started at 5:00am had 2 breaks and lunch work ended at 3:30pm
good,Great place to learn and gain experience of troubleshooting of computers and proper handling of electronics
good,excellent esprit d'équipe
good,I built computers of various types depending upon what the customer requested. I would test the systems according to specifications and then ship the product.
good,"Busy fast paced environment, with high demands. Little room for moving up the corporate ladder."
good,I had a great job and it was only after losing it to a round of layoffs did I realize it! Good manager (but 4th in 3 years in the same dept/position) but that is the new economy!
good,Company with ethical hard-working employees. In an industry that is continuously growing and evolving. Great executive leadership. Employee benefits are not competitive for a Fortune 200 company.
good,I cannot really say much here as I was part of the project to move the data center from New York to Denver. It was sad seeing the last piece of this company leave New York knowing it started out in the 30's where the World Trade center used to be.
good,"Good paying job. Just as any job, strict on attendance and tardy. Management are descent but the People are friendly and kind. "
good,"A day at work typically involved picking and packing orders to ship. Orders can range from 1 item being pulled to 5-600 items being pulled for the order depending on how much of a load you wanted to handle for the day. Orders usually were shipped at the end of each much so it was essential to pick majority of the orders that came in for that week otherwise they will be sitting there waiting to be picked at the end of the month. Organization was key as well as being able to balance the workload for the week. Handheld devices were used to scan in the items and computers were used to verify all assets and to ship items out the building that were on a specific order. Some weeks could be slow while other weeks were very heavy with orders and products being processed into the building. Management was for the most part reliable when questions were asked as well as getting the necessary help to finish huge orders for clients. There were cookouts, giveaways, employee appreciation days, special lunches throughout my time there. I learned alot at the business including data wiping sensitive information off of many different assets ranging from servers to computers to mobile phones to tablets. This was key because assets would come to our building to then be reshipped out later to customers who purchased the item online to be shipped. Workplace culture was good everyone got along with each other for the most part and majority of people there were very dependable if asked to help with something."
good,A great place to work. A very simple joe in which a learned a lot about computers and technology. Received annual raises and hosted annual events throughout the year.
good,"Employers mainly people under the age of forty, but a good company to work for as an employee. Make sure you know how to use Microsoft Excel and pivot tables."
good,"Arrow is a good company to work at as one develops their career and innovates their personal brand. Arrow utilizes modern collaborative tools, learning systems, and promotes cross functional collaboration."
good,"a typical day at work can be very hectic,specially towards the closing of the month; it is based on numbers/sales. yet a lot of competitiveness and challenges taken, all that with some fun and relax time: lunches or dinners on the house, good rewards for best performers."
good,Large scale cubical office space that can be loud at times. Large free parking garage on site and great cafe area for lunch/snacks. Very complex sales organization with multiple departments sitting on the same floor in the same areas.
good,Enjoyable work place. Great staff members and wonderful work environment. Very innovative and looks towards the future to make positive changes in the world we live in.
good,This place will expect quality from your work and production  however its extremely possible to meet their standards but you have to work for it and keep yourself busy even if its slow.
good,Change was very difficult due to the method of communication.  Those in management positions were often the poorest communicators.  Which lead to frustration and disappointment.
good,"Great opportunity for those who are driven to succeed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  Collaborative work environment.  Flexible work schedules.  Nice, bright and newer workspace. Good compensation. Leadership tends to have to be hands-on.  Lots of leadership churn."
good,"This job was incredible when I started. Over time however policies become harder to adhere too and my requests for advancement fell on deaf ears (never got a response either negative or positive)."
good,I was in field sales at Arrow so I was on the road 90% of the time. I had a good team of inside sales people assisting me. I was young and just out of college - Arrow put us through an extensive electronics training school to begin our career.
good,"The upper management teams at Arrow have been going through a major shift, and as such, many people are uncertain about their roles, what additional changes are coming, and what the overall strategy and direction should be. Communication from the top is lacking, despite the additional effort to keep the workforce in the loop. Overall, I believe that they are on the right path, and are looking at their various activities and industry involvement in a good way. The people that I worked with at Arrow made all the difference in the world. A great group of people, smart, driven and dedicated to their jobs."
good,"Good company in a challenging but expanding market. The distribution business is changing quickly, so their is a significant degree of volatility in management and the workforce as the company strives to adapt and capitalize."
good,"A typical day at work included working hand in hand with sales team to place drop ship orders with partnered distribution companies. Placing of orders for material needed to complete production orders.  The workplace culture was a comfortable, easy to work in type of atmosphere.  Management was easy to engage with and very helpful in making every employees job as easy and productive as possible."

good,"Le mie giornate qui sono state molto stimolanti."
good,"Great company to work for. Lots of progression. Good managment. Great job too."
good,"Arrow is currently in transition, this can make day to day work a little frustrating because it is constantly changing so if you like a set routine this is not the place for you. The people that work here are helpful and nice."
good,"My experience at Arrow has been mostly positive. They do not provide much formal training. They take a sink or swim attitude and let you figure things out on your own. That is good and bad. Overall, I would say people are professional and helpful. Because there isn't much turnover though you do have a lot of people who can be quite petty and unwilling to help you learn."
good,"Very fast paced environment"
good,You are required to stand for long periods of time at your cart and count out the pieces according to customer orders.
good,"My co-workers were great to work with.  The company seemed to lay off people every year so, employees were always afraid of losing their jobs."
good,Good professional working environment. A lot of traffic in the office from reps and manufacturers liking to work with Arrow to penetrate accounts for new business
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 14 year tenure at Arrow Electronics.  Arrow offered an excellent environment for career advancement, positive work environment and a management team that was supportive of collaborating with employees to meet mutual goals.  Positive , fun , social networking events renforced the positive working environment"
good,"Great working environment. Co-workers are friendly and professional and a pleasure to work with. "
good,"A very professional Electronics Industry aiming to please. The atmosphere was very nice and people friendly. A large company but i was able to communicate on a first name basis with most. Arrow was a great experience for me and a good learning tool. My day at work was not always the same. I had multiple duties to serve internal and external customers.My co-workers and myself worked as a group and coverage was part of the job. I had a good relationship with them.During my years of service i had a few different Managers with change . I have learned to be very good with time management and good customer service, I never looked at the job as hard but always a experience with helpful knowledge,"
good,Quoted service to our resellers via online quoting tool. Management was ok not bad or great. Co-workers were good and fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was the amount of quoting. Most enjoyable was the co-workers.
good,"Arrow is a large public company that aims to be employee focused but is ultimately loyal to the shareholders. Despite this the daily work environment, corporate culture and employees allow this company to feel like a smaller, energetic experience. My co-workers and staff are what made each day exciting and drove a sense of loyalty."
good,Management gave clear direction/ expectations and work/ life balance was respected.
good,"Arrow is one of the better companies I have worked for. They offer 20 paid days off per year plus an additional 16 paid sick days per year."
good,"In the time frame that I was at Arrow, the HR. Dept was very attentive to answering all inquiries I had.   There was an Ice Cream social for a job well done for all employees. There was a luncheon hosted for employees.  There were meetings to inform employees of current events such as new hires starting at a better wage, Arrows current events and status in the work field. etc."
good,It was a great place to work. If the company was still on operation I would have loved to work there for quite more time. You won't get stressed working in here.
good,"Although there were a few questionable decisions made by upper management, working at Arrow was satisfying; to an extent. The salary was fantastic and the work-life balance, plus, flexibility of the schedule were major high points.  The downside with working at Arrow is that, hierarchical advances were far few in between not to mention the toxic like “high-school for adults” environment within the office. In addition, management had the proclivity to play favour it’s and it was obvious. The detriments behind that was...they would not be as assiduous with the assistance that they provide with one employee as they would for another; regardless of the level of associated opportunity the “deal” may provide. It made it easier for individuals to not want to reach out to management for assistance on certain matters. This doesn’t mean that the managers were bad, it just means that there were habits that the collective group exercised that was in no way beneficial to the sales teams.  The director was fantastic though. Great man!"
good,very easy work didn't require a lot of walking or constant change in work. located in a great area. different food choices nearby. I don't think its no longer open
good,"Phoenix, AZ facility. "
good,"Arrow is a great company to work for with good leadership. There are some gaps on moving into the future and financial risk mitigation. For example, why would you issue your employees laptops, docking stations and monitors for remote work - yet don't allow it and invest in additional brick and mortar buildings. "
good,"Arrow strives to maintain happy employees with proper training and benefits. I was able to advance my career through proven performance. Ultimately, one can make a life career at Arrow. My health was the only reason for leaving."

good,I genuinely enjoyed working at Arrow and would love the opportunity to return in a capacity that allows me to utilized my Arrow specific expertise.  My varied experience positions me as a 'plug and play' alternative.
good,ARROW Electronics is one of the best companies out in the field to work for.  Compensation is decent with a lot of challenges on the daily basis.  Great people to work for and with great opportunities to excel in your field.
good,lots of work and too much overtime. I think there is a lot of favortism in this company and not all of us a treated fairly. Over all good pay and a good place to work at.
good,"Working at Arrow was educational in a sense.  There was something to learn everyday. It was fast pace, informative to say the least, interesting. I was a pleasure to work for a company like Arrow !"
good,"It’s a great company to work overall. The 401k program is excellent, constantly earning vacation, sick time and Personal time. They decide to close DFW,-Coppell sadly. I gain  experience and knowledge, I feel so thankful for that. Almost everything was good."
good,"Benefits were great, vacation was great and people and management were great also. Competitive, intense, long hours but gratifying helping the customers and booking large orders."

There is scope for growth and learning."

good,"La empresa apoya al empleado y lo hace partícipe de los grandes proyectos, sin embargo falta considerar más al personal para las promociones internas."
good,"Supervised a staff of up to 25 People. Managed receiving, production, warehouse, quality control and inventory control. Worked closely with customers keeping good relations and making sure product was shipped and packaged to their expectations."
good,"A typical day was to come in and receive work orders, load work lines and complete our duties as warehouse associates. I learned a lot about how manufacturers named and organize their products for consumer uses and entertainment. They have a cool management staff with a great since of humor."
good,"A typical day at work would be processing and answering questions over and over again about new tech cutline. I learned a lot about electronic devices and how they are used, and what is above tech cutline to resell. I have great management that are understanding and respectful, my co-workers have their ups and downs but to sum it all up they are great and helpful. The hardest part of my job is a lot of lifting product. The most enjoyable about my job is that I get to learn new electronic devices that come in and I also get to see how they operate."
good,you are going to be given your work and expected to do it. You will not have anyone looking over your shoulder but if something goes wrong it's on you.

good,Great company had wonderful opportunity to grow and learn about electronics. Handle large sales accounts had the opportunity to visit my customers to understand their businesses.
good,"I've been happy to work for Arrow for the last 6 years except for the fact that my last 4 years have provided me with a very satisfactory job in a very unsatisfactory location and environment, with small to no room for growth and an HR/corporate lack of flexibility in terms of using today's technology to perform my tasks remotely rather than in an office environment. This last point has lead me to resign as I requested to be able to keep doing my job from a different city to where I will be relocating and the request was denied, even though my tasks require no interaction with suppliers, customers, teammates or management and all communication is done via e-mail, IM or web with very little phone interaction. For a company that claims to be 5 years out, it is actually 30 years behind in some of its politics and policies."
good,"In spite of the short time internship, Arrow Electronics sharpened my computer (hardware) science knowledge. I learned what other people could learn in more than two years."
good,Productive with ample learning opportunities. Large Oracle R12 implementation with multiple modules.

good,"Worked for Wyle, Electronics, acquired by Arrow. Wyle was a fantastic company to work for. The environment was very friendly and cohesive."
good,I would rate Arrow as a good place to work. It is a great company to learn about manufacturing and distribution. The North American customers are large and dynamic and demand good service & sales support from their representatives in Halifax. This is an honorable job and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Arrow was a great company to work for due to their technical edge. They ran a tight ship and expected employees to perform. However they would pay you according to your quality and timelyness of work.
good,I wish I was challenged more but regardless it was a great start to my career and built my confidence. Learned to manage my time very well and was able to meet great people

good,"I love my job and group, the benefits are great, comp is ok, and we are always finding ways to have fun! In my group the only down side is that management has no idea of what my role looks like or how to manage it effectively. I wish they would hire someone with more experience to support us."
good,"Inovative company."
good,"My role was very different from others as my daily tasks were to support the teams after a shared service takeover in the UK. I was to learn the processes from new teams and adapt them to the current UK processes by adapting any templates for reconciliations but also by training the team on these processes. This was to ensure consistency with financial reporting to the US team at month end and year end. "
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral el trabajo noe s complicado los jefes de area muy competentes

good,"I did a 12 week internship at Arrow. It was a lot of fun because we were able to do a lot of interesting design work. The people are super friendly. Over all, it was a good experience."
good,"I worked for Arrow for almost 19 years and it was one of the best places I worked. I got into the industry through someone I knew not what I knew but that quickly changed throughout the years. The best part of the job was my local office, the people were extraordinary and we all got along well and everyone had a sense of humor. I enjoyed going to work everyday . It had an open door policy and you could go talk to local management and feel heard and not judged. I got to learn different job positions as well as multiple computer programs as each supplier had a unique system for their business purposes. I enjoyed all the people that called or walked through the door and made many acquaintances and lifelong friends. The hardest part of the job was not being able to accommodate everyone's needs within the time frame they required, due to circumstances out of your control."
good,This was a good work place and over the years pay got to where it needed to be. Then they closed my divison of the company. I enjoyed the team work and the people that worked here.

good,"I enjoyed working for Arrow.  I supported a Director, 3 Regional Sales Managers and approximately 20 Field Sales Reps.  It was a challenging job and I loved it.  Unfortunately, business slowed down and half the group was laid off, including me.  However, it is a very good company to work for with great benefits."
good,"My experience at Arrow was a good one.  Co-workers quickly became friends and management, even though difficult decisions and their consequences had to be made and implemented, I always felt that they cared and wanted to help find other roles within the company."
good,"The company is a great company, but with so many silos they don't always know what the other business units are doing and therefore a lot of duplication"
good,"Fortune 150 Company that has a small business feel with upper management that make themselves accessible.  It is a very busy and fast-paced environment. Other than the month-end close weeks and quarter-end close weeks, planning season, and year-end, there was a decent work-life balance. There is a familial culture. Lots of opportunities for movement within. I enjoy working here very much. It was very unfortunate that they decided to move nearly all job functions to Denver, CO."
good,"Work culture is good."
good,Work with the company for more than 10 years. Made a lot of friends and enjoyed working there. Always busy and is a high production oriented environment.

good,"I started in this job as Temporary and hired Permanently after 4 months.  I work for Warehouse Operations as Tray Sorter.  At first I was working with 3 older ladies that are light duties.  They all moved back to their regular Departments after a month I work with them.  I work for this Department alone for 6 months, but after I was hired Permanently I had an accident.  I hurt my right Knee and after 5 months of suffering from pain I had Knee operation.  I used all my sick time and vacation time after the accident and even after my operation.  When I came back from my operation I have a new Manager, and ever since he replaced my old Manager, he has favoritism.  He never appreciate the hard work that I did for this Department while working alone and even while I'm in pain because of my accident.  He terminated me because I called in sick for not having enough sick time or vacation time to cover my shift.  I called in early morning and asked him if he can check my sick time that can cover the day I called in and if not I will still come to work even I was having chest pain.  He ignored my call and because he didn't call me back I went to work with chest pain, but just to find out he still terminating me.  I felt that I was a good employee and a hard worker, at least I could have been given a chance or given a warning."
good,Excellent atmosphere for a cubicle job. Great company with awesome benefits and management who helps you succeed. Many opportunities for growth locally and globally.

good,"Production was a full unbox of all products, to be  assembled in a computer rack, integrate, configure, diagnostic testing, quality assurance, and reworks as needed, then re-box as completed customer order. The re-boxing process of all was the most hardest to finish.  Good work place, had great benefits, and profit sharing. But had  some management issues that were out the production team control. Good group of technician to work with. Meeting our turn around time on each project was the most rewarding part of this job. Our team was rated tops in that area with the IBM staff."
good,"Was a good place to work,enjoyed the people that I worked with,leadership was always helpful,was willing to teach you new procedures to help you advance"
good,"Arrow electronics was amazing. The job itself helped me in so many ways. I'm very appreciative of my position, being an account coordinator. The management team was extremely about business only and that's what I respect about the job  the most."
good,"We work hard. If you want to be friendly with your coworkers, you can. Managers will put you on projects that are seemingly impossible, and if you don't figure it out, you can expect consequences. If you do figure it out, look forward to limited praise."
good,Arrows thought me a lot and I’m so disappointed that company got shut down I would have love to stay at this company. We had a great team and I learn how to run a warehouse was a great experience.

good,Pleasure to work for them and receive cross training in different areas of the warehouse.
good,Buen lugar de trabajo un lugar en donde se aprende mucho pero pocas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"Arrow Electronics was one of the best places I ever worked at. When it comes to compensation and work performance evaluations, Arrow has one of the best processes ever. For example, my manager hated me on what I felt was a personal level.

good,I found my position at Arrow Electronics during the recession of 2009. This position matched my prior skill level of 10 years to implement pricing from bids and monitor contracts at Covidien. The military customers were nice and the team was intimate. There were three bid administrators who negotiated the pricing and I was tasked to load the pricing and handle the expiration and price increases to parts and notification to sales force of products status. Busy and complicated job that used the my greatest strengths.
good,"was a temporary employee here, if you like to work in a dead end environment with boring soulless people, this is the place for you!  My favorite part of the day was scanning documents for people that I had three times the capability of, primarily because the had been there for 20 years and had never learned how to use the scanner.  They mostly lamented the end of the fax machine."
