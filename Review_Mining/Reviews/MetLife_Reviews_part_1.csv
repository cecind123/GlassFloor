rating,review
bad,Extremely under paid for all the stress and disgruntled customers we deal with every day. Schedules are by seniority and unfair with that as well as seniority for vacation picks. Not a good place for your       overall mental gealth
bad,"L'azienda é ferma agli anni 90 con dirigenti inadeguati che sono li da piu di 20 anni e non hanno mai fatto nulla per progredire culturalmente. neanche una laurea. Non ci sono investimenti sui sistemi, tutto si fa a mano. Possibilità di carriera inesistenti. Manager inadeguati ed arrivisti.ambiente stressante e orribile. Assisto quotidianamente ad un esodo incredibile. Regressione formativa assicurata."
bad,not a great atmosphere to work in.  low level employees. not much room for advancement. not a great environment. i would not recommend. low level positions
bad,I did not see this company treat their employees like they treat their customers  they push the employees too hard to meet their standards for their customers but don’t take into consideration the stress you go through for each and every call. They do not pay you nearly enough for the things you go through on a daily basis. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,Metlife is full of slogans where no one actually work on the strategy to achieve goals. Everything is haphazard and as long as the same person can do multiple non relevant tasks they will just use him. staying after working hours is normal everyday with no overtime.
bad,"I dont work at MetLife anymore. That is fantastic news, Id suggest you dont work at MetLife!!! You will listen to people call in and describe the worst aspects and events that happen in their lives all day long. "
bad,"It was a horrible experience,Job period in met life was  worst experience in my life.No support and help for sales,They are making exaggerated offers in unit link plans, Not a basic support to even beginners,Only supports for High end profiles.People will suffer to meet boths ends  to  a job in Metlife."
bad,"Very reactive leadership, poor communication, little talent development. Nearly 1/3 of workforce is external, disability evolution is a costly and ineffective farce"
bad,"The MetLife Values - Put Customers First, Be the Best, Make Things Easier, and Succeed Together - make for a nice poster on the wall, but very few leaders embrace or emulate them.  Foster THIS!"
bad,"Hands down the worst company in the industry to work for. You go from getting 1 call in an 8 hour day to being slammed with junk back to back. "
bad,"La llicenciada solo se interesa por sus asuntos y no ayuda a los trabajadores. Terminas fastidiandote porque te envian a escuelas muy pequeñas donde a nadie le interesa contratar un seguro. "
bad,"I loved it at first, the pay was adequate, although all the men even beneath me in hierarchy were paid more, at least the ones I knew, which I found out by accident, not because I asked. I was expected to work as many hours as necessary to keep up and I did, they gave us laptops to work from home so I did.  I would put in a full day at work then another 5-7 at home and all weekend.  I had young kids then. I was not allowed to discuss the hours I worked or I would get told to stop by mgmt and I was not allowed to claim the hours or I’d get written up. We were all in the same boat in my department."
bad,This place was a joke.  They sold o0ut our department and played favorites.  There was not structure and the benefits changed and things were getting messy.
bad,The way they treated me after leaving a job I’ve been at for 19 years. I went to Metlife for  opportunities . Worse company ever. If a manager don’t care for you it’s over.
bad,"MetLife recently moved to Omaha and it seemed like a quality opportunity, However looks can be deceiving. MetLife since opening has had the biggest turnover I've seen from any company there is AWFUL communication, no management structure, no growth opportunities, there is no way to get coaching or training to grow not to mention MetLife pays an average of $1.50 below the market standard per hour. Do yourself a favor DO NOT APPLY for this company there's way better opportunities with companies that pay a fair wage"
bad,"not recommended i was only brought on as a temp,  other than that the other people were nice and friendly, training was beneficial but pay was poor as were benefits."
bad,"Frat boys run the sales desk. If you aren't a favorite then your career will go no where. Better to look else where for a career. Also, not a good place to start your career"
bad,"RUN!!! as far as you can terrible place to work you will regret within a year or less."
bad,"Unfortunately MetLife does not have a structure that assists their employees in being successful and/or opportunities to move up if you wish to do so."
bad,"at its worst. Lots of waste, poor oversight. Little opportunity. Decent culture, but overall a very corporate and distant overall atmosphere.........."
bad,"Focus at the former Metlife was on the sale of life insurance, annuities, and investment.  Retirement plans were a focus."
bad,The work load was unbearable and the management was even worse. This is not the company to work for. I would suggest looking at other insurance agencies that are larger.
bad,she was very unprofessional and i will not provide them any good scores due to her poor attitude.unit leader did not know how to differentiate personal and business feelings
bad,No training also managers would pick on a single worker not help you improve.  Was laid off because I fainted at work from the stress. They offered severance package to keep me quite. Good money bad company
bad,Abandoned its employees. They claimed one thing and did something else. Executives are planning on driving the company into the ground. It has already begun.
bad,"Metlife was unorganized with a payment structure that was unfair. example. you sold 100 policies, sold 150k premium and issued policies you was at mercy of underwriting doing job and processing on back end. And if they didnt do it in time, they'd process following month and you'd be paid minimum and potentially lost your previous month bonus. Racist work place and extremely unorganized, one department not understanding the other. They do not take discrimination investigations serious. horrible, horrible management. wouldnt recommend Metlife to a enemy."
bad,"Working at MetLife was a horrible experience. I worked for a racist, sexist supervisor, who would never think he was. "
bad,"I'll only speak to the culture of this company being very cold and brash. Management has no human compassion and only want the job done, whatever it takes. I worked in the short term disability department and some of the decisions that adjusters made for people that were truly hurt and on disability were questionable. This is why I resigned my position."
bad,"management does not support its people or managers to make effective decisions. People are fine, work is OK, expectations are unreasonable.  office is noce"
bad,"They just care about hiring a bunch of people at one time, and picking favorites. They say they care about training, but don't always provide assistance when on calls training, when you REALLY need the Help. They have cut throat scores, that matter more than their customers. Come on do you really want the stress =["
bad,"company went downhill when it got rid of its distribution section, management was incompetent. I would not recommend working for this company any longer"
bad,Been with the company 5 years and haven’t gotten anything good from it. Wouldn’t suggest working here unless your sanity is worth the pay. Never get weekends off and your vacation is nice and everything but it’s never approved for you to be able to use it.
bad,"Professional setting without the friendliness. Most agents there were unhelpful as this was a competitive setting.  As a new agent, you were required to have another agent take care of any underwritings as he would be first for any renewal commissions on any policies. New agents had to wait over a year to receive any type of commissions."
bad,"Metlife is a pro-TRUMP ""click"" environment --- ""Run"" TERRIBLE place to contract with non-QWL !!!  Working at Metlife had many unintelligent Manager teams regarding technolgy and IT Security."
bad,Companies goal is to move all operations to North Carolina or Florida.  Management was very poor and very sketchy.  Rigid work schedule.  No raises or bonuses.  I would not recommed working here.
bad,It has good life balance. But not good for career movement. It is not recommended for young people who have passion or dream to work with elite people.
bad,"It is a very stressful place to work, extremely process driven, extreme micro-management, raises and bonus' based on who you are not work product or quality."
bad,"It is extremely difficult to sell a policy, you have to meet a certain quota to receive commission, if you miss the mark by 1, you will not get commission for the other policies you did sell.  Meeting the monthly bonus is nearly impossible and the salary alone is not enough."
bad,Nejhorší prace mého života . Nikdy nikomu bych nedoporučovala
bad,"If you do your job well and make your metrics, you will be rewarded by doing your peers workload with no benefit to you. Poor training and high expectations to perform at experienced level 30 days after training has been completed. High stress levels and low salary compared to similar roles at competing companies.  Supervisors and Managers will only get involved if their own manager is notified of the issue."
bad,"I worked in the annuities department which is the hardest role to maintain. Your employment is contingent on a Series 6 Exam, if you do not pass, you will no longer be employed."
bad,MetLife was an eye-opener in the field of health insurance. I got to see all the details of how it worked on the inside. Not pretty. Cut throat to customers and very poor service.
bad,I was laid off nothing to say at this point. They no longer wanted a mortgage company so they laid off everyone. They bought the company for only two years and ripped everyone off of their servants packages.
bad,"Very disappointed in promises not kept.No training or support. Poorly managed. "
bad,"Please see the review for this company under First Horizon Home Loans. I enjoyed many things about both First Horizon and Metlife Home Loans, but the company is no longer in business."
bad,"MetLife lied to thousands of employees of their Financial Services division by having them relocate to North Carolina and telling them that it was a strategic move to streamline the business and make it grow faster, all the while shopping it out for a buyer which ended up being headquartered in Boston. Many people lost their jobs shortly after relocating their families from other parts of the country once MetLife sold the entire division."
bad,Mgmt did not care at all about their employees; they are only focused on statistics and making as much money as possible by taking advantage of their customers and employees. I would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,"un muy mal trabajo, el supervisor es un persona despota y se repiten   los numeros de prospectos una y otra vez"
bad,Ok place to work. The forced ranking made for an environment where coworker did not share work and ratings were based on not work performance but if they personally liked the person.
bad,"Lack of structure "
bad,High school type culture. Would not recommend.  Management is not upfront and sales metrics numbers do not add up.  Sales calls are said to be random but appears to be manipulated.
bad,"Metlife is a fabrication of social promotion.  Lots of italians work there.  The IT systems are highly antiquated, and the cafeteria food sucks.  The building is unsafe."
bad,"Reviewed long term disability claims for current medical treatment to determine if the client continued to present enough limitations to support continued long term disability benefits. Was able to work closely with the claim managers to discuss cases, and also with vocational specialists."
bad,"I went on short term disability for cancer and the day i was scheduled for surgery my manager called and terminated my employment. I did get the disability payments but ended up having major bills from my surgery complications. "
bad,"Although my application process with Human Resources was friendly and productive, my interaction with the Territory Sales Manager was unprofessional and unethical at best.  With 30 years in the insurance industry in management and sales, I would make a suggestion to Met Life to vette your management more vigorously.  As one of my initial contacts with your company, this Territory Sales Manager did not provide a favorable view for Met Life P & C."
bad,Working for metlife was a learning experience. The work place is an ok atmosphere. Metlife does not have many branches of the branch I worked for so I do not know now.
bad,Depends on the department that you are in and the management team you have.  Some are great and others have their favorites.  The company is going through too many changes and there is no job security in many locations.
bad,"Arrived at 8:00am went straight to class, we had a 6wk training class"
bad,My position was in sales. Most of my day was out in the field looking for new business. Management was focused on sales and the revenue sales reps brought into the business.
bad,"clueless, vindictive management out to fire every1 (even if in top 10% sales). u get punished for selling. they only want dials. awful, mean, dumb mgt"
bad,"MetLife was the worst experience of my life and 30 years in the financial services industry, they don't care about the agents or the customers. They lie and deceive clients about their products and management is basically clueless."
bad,This office was closed not long after I was laid off for getting pregnant  The man that was the general manager was terrible at interpersonal relationships.  it was a toxic atmosphere.  I really didn't learn very much while working there.
bad,I only worked here for a little i looked into it thinking that it was going to be a great job and also be a great paying job. he lied to most of his employees and did not live up to the standards he said he would.
bad,management is difficult and does not take into account the actual job that you do or give you information on reviews that provide the actual work you  are doing
bad,"I worked for this company in Annuities for almost a year. Enjoyed my job until all the changes came about. As soon as they decided to sell off portions of the department the moral changed for the worse. From day to day you would be unsure if you had a job when you came in to work that day. The pay is very low for the industry, so don't let that be a reason to come work for MetLife. Pass your series 6 and hit the door like everyone else does for a company that really has competitive pay. I left with a resignation letter and my self proclaimed manager put me in as a termination because for family issues I wasn't able to stay my full notice period.I wouldn't go back to MetLife if that was the last job on earth.  Good things don't come to bad people. I was offered better opportunities elsewhere. Stay clear because there is no room for advancement"
bad,"I loved working at Metlife. The compensation was just ok. I was working in an entry level position and just felt like I needed to be more challenged. The environment was very relaxed, almost too relaxed. Sometimes I felt that the dress code was too relaxed. Sometimes you felt like you couldn't tell the difference between someone on the street, or someone who worked there."
bad,"Good place to work but no salary at all... only finance . Which is very stressful to a lot of people."
bad,"I have learn to communicate with different kinds of people,hardest part is when month end come and you get unexpected salary and when you get client and refuse to sign that's very disappointing.most enjoyable is where you get more client and they are happy with your service"
bad,"Too Much work not  enough pay, they hire people who don't know anything about insurance, they will make more than you. Go to work, answer emails, answer calls getting screamed at by customer. Listen to co workers complain all day about how much they hate their job but don't do anything about it."
bad,"As a Sr Project Lead in Cary, NC in the RADAM organization my typical day was 10 to 12 hours as a project manager.  I had a legacy boss that was the worst in the world, as they say, people leave jobs because of their management and bosses not because of the company.  The culture is cut throat.  There are so many new people expected to learn convoluted systems and just not provided adequate direction.  Even the PMs are expected to know the systems without training that is because their managers all moved to management from the developers level.  Co-workers - well not sure if anyone is happy, they are all over worked.  A typical day is trying to resolve issues when no one covering your back.  Management will cut your throat, lacks support.  I don't know how the company survives.  I received a letter from NC wage.org a month ago as apparently people are complaining they are working so many hours and not being paid.  I never smiled or laughed on my job, was evaluated unfairly - labeled by legacy management.  HR does nothing to protect  any of the employees.  Stay away from this company!"
bad,"MetLife Disability is a great network, they great with customer centricity and empathy. I will recommend MetLife to everybody!"
bad,"The legal department was recently re-organized in a way that was detrimental to most and made no sense from a customer or employee perspective. Career advancement opportunities were eliminated, many attorneys were demoted (or given a financial incentive to leave) and new people were put into leadership roles that have little or no relevant experience. I strongly recommend against considering MetLife as a place to work."
bad,The management will tell you anything you want to hear to get you in the door. They promise a team approach and working with your manager to better yourself that does not happen. The make the compensation very difficult to understand so the employee gets confused and does not pay correctly. I would highly recommend staying away from this company.
bad,"Work as an Insurance agent.  this was a filler job and I never intended to stay in this position more than 2 years.."
bad,"After being recruited to head up the rebuilding of the sales organization in Southeastern Massachusetts and RI, the decision was made to exit the mortgage business 2 months after my hire."
bad,"MetLife was an enjoyable and productive workplace, offering many opportunities in all areas for career advancement and training."
bad,It's hard to post out and move around the company. Overworked and underpaid. The team moral is awful and it feels like we're stuck in the same position and the only way out is to leave the company.
bad,"La actividad de la comercializacion de seguros de vida, es un asunto de suma importacia para el consuidor de este producto financiero, lamentablemente la empresa no entiende el valor de escuchar al consumidor y profesionalizar al personal que desempeña."
bad,"fun and challenging as well"
bad,"A huge company with very huge numbers of customers about 470,000 customers in Egypt."
bad,"Received approximately 90 calls per day.    First CSR job,  learned a lot of communication skills.    Learned how to deal with elevated calls.  Great management team, willing to help when needed.    Co-worker were great team players.   The hardest part of job was when a natural catosterphe happened and dealing with so much loss.   Most enjoyable part was being able to help people in a time of crisis."
bad,"Customer service position, incoming phone calls. The people you work with are great. Management has gotten terrible. Terrible work-life balance. Will not hire enough associates to meet call volumes. If you do your job well, you are just overloaded with more work and not compensated for doing so."
bad,"This particular office has so much turnover. While at Metlife for less than a year I have seen 8 people fired and many more have left. "
bad,Management is out of touch with employees. They keep tightening service levels to the point where you hardly have time to go to the bathroom and feel guilty about taking a lunch hour. I always felt my job was threatened. Very stressful and unprofessional atmosphere.
bad,You'll end up with a knife in it layed off.   Zero loyalty to their employees here
bad,I don't have anything good to say about metlife so I will keep it to myself...
bad,"nice at work "
bad,MetLife does not care for it's employee.  MetLife is more focus on it's customers and puts it's front line employees last.
bad,Good job nice place to work. flexible. a lot of the work was being sent to different parts of the country not much left around here as far as i know.
bad,"In charge of sourcing, conducting initial round of interviews and recruit 15-20 financial advisors to build a team. Train, motivate & generate business from the team."
bad,"MetLife was once a great company to work for and partner with. They invested in their advisors, infrastructure, marketing, and products. Over time, the culture of serving the best interests of the clients first changed into maximizing revenue in the short term at the expense of both advisor and client. "
bad,"No one to lead, very self-centered individuals and cut-throat. This role requires help from a on-board team to assist new reps with the sales process. It is also expensive to work there as all costs are paid by the employee."
bad,"If you want to work for a place that does not care about thier employees, Please apply."
bad,The VP drove this company into the ground. The faith in management and morale is absolutely horrible. Communication is horrible and the turnover is high. I even felt bad for our customers while I was there.
bad,"This is an absolutely horrible position. During the so called training period there is zero training, management, or guidance. ML has some great products but very difficult to qualify for, making it much more difficult to meet goals. Note, I exceeded all goals but manager felt it was not enough. All expenses are your own at first, minimal salary and no commission during so called training. I have never felt so used."
bad,"MetLife is concerned about 2 things and 2 things only. Maximizing Top Tier Management payrolls and shareholder earnings. Employee's and customers are dead last on the priority list. As an employee, particularly in Sales, you will be nickeled and dimed for everything. Great business model... You service their client base with no cost to them while you starve."
bad,"Poor management, lack of leads, full of promises with no follow through, no training, transactional model. I wouldn't take a chance if you are in sales and are looking for a company that will help with marketing---don't think they ever heard of it. The clients are not serviced properly, just left to be called from all the reps trying to find someone to talk to. Think long and hard about this company."
bad,An insurance company that shows favoritism to their employees. On the phones. Asking people if they were going to work. If they weren’t going to return sending their supervisors a letter saying they weren’t to work and why.
bad,"Terrible corporate culture; management out of touch; no concern for employees; low pay - long hours; no training; double-standards abound; typical corporate culture: if you kiss up, then you advance."
bad,"Run,run,run!! Disaster waiting to happen.Management treats you unfairly. You're just another number.In training you're promised one thing, and how quickly does that change once you get on the floor. There's no work life balance. They're more concerned with their numbers.They won't hire enough people, so your doing more than they tell you.Manager will micromanageEVERYTHING"
bad,"The company cant even decide where they will have their headquarters (Park Avenue, Long Island City, Bryant Park), and they lost the rights to the Peanuts characters.  How do you lose Snoopy?"
bad,"All they care about is numbers. This supposed customer service based company only cares about how many claims you get through. The management is terrible! "
bad,"If you're wanting management to appreciate your efforts, please do not apply for a position regardless of the money.  "
bad,"Prior to joining MetLife I had five years of financial services experience.  As a new agent I was assigned to an experienced agent who was responsible for assiting me in developing the book of business.  Unfortunately, the types of assistance I received did not set me up for success.  There is also the requirements to sell “core” products with the Met-Life logo.  Even though I had well over 100k assets under management and two small business benefit plans within the 1st six months of joining the company I failed to meet the “minimum” core requirements."
bad,"The management in the service operations area at the Tampa, FL location is abysmal.  Many are unqualified for their positions and MetLife does not do much management training so they never get better.  They pay lip service to the importance of servicing their clients.  They take forever to fill open positions and when they do it takes a long time to train someone due to how many and how archaic their systems are.  In the meantime more work is piled on the employees that are left making it impossible to truly service the  clients.  They treat the job like it's a call center - they are more worried about how many emails you answer a day vs. if you were able to resolve your client's service issues.   Compensation is on the lower end.  There are many employees that barely do their jobs but they are not performance evaluated out of their positions.  Employee morale is non-existent."
bad,"miserable place to be. Wanted to die. Work tedious, majority of individuals are out of position players. Spent most of day clock watching. The other time spent putting out unnecessary fires"
bad,"No life/work balance"
bad,"A typical day at Metlife for a Project Manager is 10 to 12 hours or more.     Co-workers are nice but  are all over worked.  Hardest part of the job is that management throws more and more work at the Project Manager providing no support let alone does not value the hours or work done.  We are expected to work during PTO - paid time off and the directors call it ""pretend time off"". Worst company I ever worked for, does not value hard work.  Too many legacy people in management.  Not a collaborative environment, more cut throat in nature. Political and back stabbing culture overall."
bad,"Me desempeñe como asesor de seguros en metlife, pero desde el primer minuto en que ingrese me trataron como una simple máquina.  Tuve problemas con los pagos de comisiones , con el contrato y con mi jefatura directa quien me trató siempre con faltas de respeto."
bad,"You are a number. Thats all you are to MetLife. They don't care about their workers, they only care about how much money they make off of you. Co-workers are great. But in the end, you're tied to your phone and if you go off and take a leak they're right on your butt asking why you weren't taking calls."
bad,"Working at MetLife was the worse experience I have ever had. I came into MetLife ready to challenge myself, develop, and make a difference. I was warned not to work for this company by a friend but I ignored the warning and accepted the offer. It only took me a week after onboarding to realize something was not right about this company. "
bad,"Trabaje 1 mes cafe gratis y relajado ambiente, pero salvare como puedas, la capacitación venia despues de pasadas las primeras metas.no entendi detalles de los seguros, ni por comienzo te dan base de datos. Y como no ve si hazta luego gracias y no la plata de la micro!"
bad,Taking phone calls for initial claims. Some follow-up with adjusters for customers. I learned that I am not good at being aggressive with the elderly. The co-workers were okay. Management I won't commit on them. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the people.
bad,Talk to Claimants and explain how to apply for Social Security Disability. Provide Assistance understanding Social Security Administration requests.
bad,"nedoporučuju stoji to za hovno. je to taková psychologická hra, jak lidem prodat něco drahého, co vlastně potřebují"
bad,"MetLife is a highly respectable company(in NY), unfortunately in Tampa LTD they have a few bad ULs and Management(operations and director) who  have created a very unhealthy work environment."
bad,They need better management. I did like the kind of things I was working on. I did like the tools they used. It felt like sweatshop.  The expectations changed on a daily basis.
bad,Long hours they don’t care about your life or your family you’ll be working like a slave for very little pay you’ll work 12 hour days while the CEO is out on his boat sipping fancy champagne and smoking cigars while you’re barely making enough to take care of yourself and are not compensated equally for the amount of work you’re doing
bad,"Very High Stressed, you are always playing catch up on your work based off of how they have the work setup.  The culture of the organization is very people oriented though."
bad,The whole company is extremely unorganized. They do not work with you when you have emergency situations. they are quick to give out occurrences. they are always short staffed and fire people daily. They give 2 pto days per month but always have everyday you need off blocked out so you can't request the time. They are very unprofessional and you should not work there especially for only $15 per hour.
bad,I was fired for something that was never discussed nor giving the chance to correct. They only care about the company's numbers not the people that work to get the numbers they need.
bad,Company is constantly changing and definitely not for the better. Company is cutting back and Leadership doesn’t care about training employees or pushing growth within the company.
bad,"This does not apply to MetLife as a whole. Unfortunately, the Alpharetta, GA office leaves a lot to be desired and changed. This location is not working moms friendly, religion friendly, disability friendly, and it does not celebrate diversity and cultural differences.  There is no work/life balance. You either enjoy having a job or they will fire you so you can have a life. Those are the only choices.You are expected to either be like the management team cultural wise or you will be let go. The management team will pigeon hold you from advancing in your job. The management team makes disparaging remarks to its associates and they will retaliate if you speak up.  Company and EEO violations take place at this location which is hurtful to the company's overall branding. Steer clear of this location."
bad,"Name has changed to MassMutual.  Call it Mass destruction. This office cant train nor communicate properly. Low end clients."
bad,"En 8 ans, j'ai vu cette entreprise se dégrader, quel gâchis !"
bad,Every day would wonder if I was going to be fired or let go. When asking for help would be told there would be enough support once out of training. Reality there was very little to no support.
bad,"I do not know one person that honestly liked working there. Everyone on my team, who were great people, were searching for other places to work. My boss was under a lot of stress and he placed that on us. The CEO cut roughly 1$ billion worth of employee benefits, wages, etc and outsourced to contractors because the company is facing financial difficulties. Not a good place to work."
bad,"MetLife was a very stressful company to work for. The management was poor, never around to help out. Management ran on who they liked and didn't like personally."
bad,"MetLife had a disability claims office in Mt. Prospect, IL.  It's primary goal was to deny as many claims as possibly and hope people would not go through the lengthy appeals process."
bad,"Poorly run company.  11 years there.  In 2013 moved the dept to North Carolina, then  2 years later, let the workers go.  In 2018 moving business to North Carolina and Tampa, Florida.  Outsourced work to India is a disaster.  Very Shady Management.  Had to get the fraud department involved in a mind blowing idea from the director and AVP.  No bonuses and no raises.  Initiative to save $1 billion, has then in constant flux.  Work environment was awful."
bad,"I was a contract employee for 2 years and consistently worked 65-70 hours per work.  The teams were both unprofessional and assigned blame.  I tried to foster a ""teamwork"" culture on teams I participated with to try and make a small difference."
bad,Given a desk and a phone and expected to prospect. Not great if you don't have experience or connections to grow your book of business. A lot of older advisors taking advantage to use new recruits to make phone calls and using you for free labor.
bad,"I worked the hardest for the lowest amount of money than I every had anywhere else."
bad,"Management is very siloed and it's a top down management environment. If you work across teams, your manager will get mad. Everything has to go through a chain of command. Also, don't help other teams, you will get in trouble."
bad,"Training for new hires and managers is very poor."
bad,"Project Manager effective in leading and directing projects from inception to launch. More than 10 years of progressive"
bad,"Great benefits, poor management. Work environment and workplace culture poor. wouldn't recommend as reliable employer."
bad,Unstable work environment; and weak management.  The customer service in their group department needs  a lot of work; therefore they are constantly trying to reorganize their departments which only leads to disorganization and an unhealthy work environment.
bad,Metlife put more money into the building then paying employees. Being licensed with FINRA they kept dumping products on us with a no training on how to service the product. A typical day is getting to work and not knowing what was going to happen next.  Calls where overloaded to the 15 employees who were licensed and their tier 1 reps( unlicensed) dumped calls on us as well because they couldn't answer basic questions about the annuity. Very underpaid from what I have researched for industry standard.
bad,Pay outs are low and systems are antiquated.  Stay away!  The company charges the advisors for almost everything and the paperwork is outrageous compared to the rest of the industry.
bad,Over worked and peer made more money.  Performed many duties outside of scoop and wasn't compensated for it.  Trained peer to only to make 8K less a year and had to make several attempts with management to have grade increased with peers.
bad,"The culture promotted by upper management is horrible. Your consistanly picked on for doing your job well. Never rewarded for going above and beyond. They do not promote great people to other positions due to there lack of hiring the right people for call center enviroment and keep high producing team members back from moving onto other job positions within the company."
bad,metlife insurance good company but no intertest insurance i am not like
bad,"first month when i don't have earn anything."
bad,"everyday the threat of downsizing was on everyone's mind. lower management had no job security whatsoever, and cliques ran rampant. merit promotions were rarely, if ever seen.  instead, being in the right ""crowd"" was looked up with more importance.  Sad for such a major corporation."
bad,"It is a very hard job to begin with, delivering claims decisions and dealing with other's money, but I also don't feel like I have the opportunity to advance. I have great co-workers and the management try to help develop a plan for advancement, but there isn't time to sway from our current jobs to pursue other tasks."
bad,In this company it is not what you know about the job but who you know. You can be a great worker get all your work done each day be a team player one bad day will get you fired. I worked there for 9 years one misunderstand and I got fired.
bad,Most people are on do not call lists or have given up their home phones for cell phones. The worst lead program ever option is buy your own! Re-cycled orphaned leads that consist of 80+ or deceased!
bad,"the recruiters will sell you on the fact that you have unlimited earning potential. You will be forced to bother all of your friends and family, and to pressure them to buy or you will not make a living. They claim to provide leads, however they provide the same leads to 10 other aqgents, so these poor folks get bombarded with the exact same scripted call over and over and over again. you can make money, but you will not have any life/work balance for years as you build up your book. Nothing is free, and you will pay for all of your continuing education and your own E&O, so you might as well work as an independent and not have the micromanagement issue."
bad,rien de plus a ajouter concernant cette expérience
bad,Adjusters are supposed to adjust claims but all of the adjusters even the Sr. Adjusters work the customer service & FNOL phone line which rings off the hook. You take FNOLs all day long (call center) & can never return voicemails or be available for your customers which results in a pile up of work on your desk you can never get to because you’re constantly trying to work the call center line  . We tell them over & over but they fail to recognize there is an issue.
bad,I would not recommend working here. leadership is not great and culture is note great as well and policies and procedures are not well thought out.....
bad,"ambiente de trabajo toxico, malos salarios, muchas preferencias hacia otros trabajadores, injusticias"
bad,"A lot of company changes, including constant position relocations, which are resulting in several layoffs. Still some benefits such as WFH flexibility (depending on what area you work in), Tuition Assistance, etc."
bad,"department at one time was amazing incentives, contests, trips and morale at an all time high. Then new management brings in new ideas which destroyed everything that was positive."
bad,"Lack of communication, especially holidays, field never included in cookouts, job recognition, ect. No Christmas acknowledgement. Nothing, only phone calls from management we're negative."
bad,"The training was horrible, it was a rotation of four managers from different departments in New York that flew to Omaha for about two weeks each.  Each of which seemed to know little to nothing about long term care.  Within two weeks of hitting the production floor we were monitored and everyone failed due to the lack of training.   So we were retrained for a laughable two hours and were inspected to get everything right going forward.  After that we were re monitored with no additional training and most were let go.  A huge lack of support especially manager support"
bad,"21st century sweat shop.  Too many metrics to manage performance.  This is no career, this is truly a job.  Leadership here is a needle in a haystack."
bad,"They hire you on with a warning of passing your FINRA series 6 which by industry standard takes no less than 6 months to prep for, Metlife gives you 3 weeks, everyday of which they spend most of the day telling you over and over that your job depends on your passing this exam. I seen more adults cry at this place than I have in hardship real life situations. It was an overall joke of a prep, then if you do not get to test when your manager places everyone you will sit in product training until you can get into the test window, in comes product out goes FINRA. The daily threats, the constant feeling of not being up to your training coach's expectations, was enough to cause my training class to only pass 5 of the 25 they brought in. Those 5 where also the first 5 that got to test immediately after the FINRA training. The rest of the people were set up for failure! Do not waste your time, all you will do is stress and cry, for way BELOW industry standard of pay for a Broker/Dealer. That is also in NO WAY needed for this positions!"
bad,was my first job purely in insurance. Did not like supervision or upper managementt. Not helpful in furthering my career. Commute to staten island was costly and a pain
bad,"I worked for MetLife for 3 years. When I started I worked in Dental department. I loved the culture and the people that I worked with. Unit Leaders were amazing, co-workers, and people cared about peoples success. "
bad,"Overworked, frequently firing people & not replacing. If you have to use your disability benefits don't expect to be treated with respect or kindness."
bad,"Une entreprise qui vous vend du rêve, zéro formation aucune organisation dans cette entreprise. "
bad,"Quite inefficient company, no career advice, no mentorship, too complex structure. "
bad,"Good workplace and better team "
bad,"Job securirty is non existent as is on the job praise. Progress is like crawling through mud and freinds are favoured over talent."
bad,Management is very rude and only favorites certain employees.  I did not like the way business was handled. There was more side talk more than anything else.
bad,"I worked at MetLife for 7 years and during that time I did love my job, however there is little chance of actually getting a new position in the company, and management doesn't listen to the employees. I started working from home as the company mandated for all of the customer service when they closed out building to save money.  Eventually I got a new house and started having issues with the lines being left laying accross the ground. Upon bringing this up to management, instead of contacting the phone company to get the problem fixed since the phone line I was having issues with was in their name, they left it until until my system issues got significantly worse and termed me. I again tried explaining the issue to them and they still refused to listen. MetLife in only about money, they don't care about their employees. They want their employees to be engaged but not to speak up about issues and things affecting them.  Also upon trying to appeal the situation they refused to listen, I had to send an email to the corporate CEO to get anyone to listen and then by that point it was too late for them to even consider doing anything with the new information I provided. The only answer I was given was the information should have been given while I was still employed which it was, they just didn't listen.  All in all I see now that it was all a ploy for cost savings. Cheaper to pay a temp agency for a temp at $10.00 an hour than to keep a loyal and valuable employee at #27,030 a year. Everything has gone down in this company since they have started trying to conserve money for their"
bad,I am very hard worker & smart worker Its my very qst job I enjoyd a lot
bad,Management was gud. sales job was very difficult.kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bad,"The co-workers are great & make the day go quickly. Unfortunately, the management team treats you like kindergarteners, shows a lot of favoritism in the workplace, and does not reward you for a good job!!"
bad,I worked for the mortgage retail division in Seattle. Stressful work environment due to poor management and unsupported business decisions led to lack of balance between work and life responsibilities. Ultimately the mortgage side of the company went out of business within 5 years after it was established.
bad,Culture is highly political.  No-one takes responsibility and tasks move quite slowly.  Toxic environment over all at the cary office - don't recommend working there.
bad,They not support their sales people very well. If you make good money on a sale then the next month they deduct it from your salary. Lapses are the worst at metropolitan  life
bad,"trabaje 3 meses y no tuve una buena experiencia, el jefe que tenia era muy clacista y siempre hablaba de las personas y eso habla mal de la empresa, cuando vas a la entrevista no te dicen muy te hacen hacer todo el preceso y capacitacion que es muy basica pero cuando ya empiezas te vas dando cuenta de muchas cosas y mentiras, la idea de ellos es tomar todos tus contactos para venderles seguros el cual analizando bien son demasiado caros y no ahorras nada, trabajas por el art. 22 y te controlan la llegada y la salida el cual no tendria que ser. Hay demasiada rotacion de personal todos los meses cambian gente o se van."
bad,Not a good company always contradicting itself. The training was long ad confusing. The process doesn't give you a chance to grow. I would not recommend working there.
bad,"Programs used were ancient and job required multiple (many) programs for life insurance. No job security,  under constant threat of loosing job.. Management was poorly qualified. And not consistent about reviews. Schedule changes made it impossible to attend college classes. Schedule changed every 3 months.  You get lots of PTO hours but was never once approved to take it."
bad,"Poor Management. Poor communication. No Effective Leadership in the R&IS department."
bad,"This company has leaders that bully you to the point that you are forced to resign. HR is also more supportive towards those toxic leaders. Higher Management also does nothing about toxic behavior and this encourages the bullies. Disappointing! A top performer, Resigned due to this reasons."
bad,"Meet some really nice people there, management is lost, cost and finances aren't really a concern here. No real direction from management, mission changes from day to day"
bad,"I was there as a temporary employee, I would never recommend this company to anyone. I have friends that have been there for years but couldn't leave  because they needed the retirement. Management is very clicky if your in High school then you will fit in."
bad,Pesima el area comercial. Engañan a los postulantes
bad,"Everyone is very friendly at MetLife and it is a very pleasant workplace. However, the higher ups really do not have a clue as to how much every individual adjuster struggles on a daily basis and what poor shape the claims department is in. I would have given more stars to job security but a bunch of people were just fired recently."
bad,"The management staff is horrible. Ratings are based on your personality and who you eat lunch with instead of your performance. They stress that everyone is like family, but it only applies to the management team. You will never get promoted unless you are a servient robot to management!!"
bad,I was not happy with local mgt. It was hard to get time with the sales manager for assistance. The classes and meeting schedule was excessive. I did not feel like the management had my best interests at heart. I believe this was a local problem and not a company problem. The Managing Director was replaced soon after I left.
bad,I worked for MetLife for over 5 years and honestly the pay is great but anyone who says anything beyond that is either a liar or part of the problem. I worked in the Warwick office and the management feel that they are powerless and probably this is true. No one can ever give you a straight answer on if they are moving jobs overseas and just over the last few years they have sold off their life and annuities division just to cut under government financial regulations. Their administrative offices are now run by DXC and they do not care about their employees. Truly a sad place to work.
bad,The culture at MetLife is poor and starts from the top and works its way down. The managers will tell you they understand challenges in getting work done and then the next day give a poor rating for performance. The expectations are unrealistic and this leads to the high turnover within the company.
bad,"Stressful to work in MetLife. "
bad,MetLife Mexico intentionally hires people with a very specific and similar profile among. Additionally the company in Mexico has a very close relation with Mexican goverment and ends up hiring a lot of politicized employees for some key positions. That makes the work culture very particular and difficult for employees to manage.
bad,"With this position in this company any day is a working day, remember the aim is to get many clients as possible.I have learned to be self independent,to work as a group,to be confident and not shy.The management was very good and kind.I had lovely co-workers.the hardest part of this job was having to meet the number of   positive clients in a day,and having to work under the sun the whole day and negative clients with bad attitude.the most enjoyable part of this job is that we were travelling to different places."
bad,"Process long term disability claims. This is a production job. responsibilities include Managing assigned caseload of long term disability claims, evaluating claimant eligibility, reviewing medical information, determining whether to return, deny or pay claims, inputting data, deciding payment period, following up and monitoring payment accuracy & timeliness."
bad,Due to the turn over rate the amount of work spread throughout the teams caused your to work 8 hours in the building then finish at home. Which you would work until the systems shut down at 11 PM. Once you began to do all of the over time it became expected of you. The case load and metrics are not realistic.
bad,"This company likes to micro manage and is only concerned about themselves.  Also they constantly monitor you so."
bad,Clique company where they are more concerned about their processes & completed work than the person. They say they care but its lip service.  If you want to do more than your assigned tracks then this is not the company
bad,"Your every word is recorded and you have to deal with rude people and people that lie to you over the phone. Also, if you get stuck on a bad phone call or long one, you will be stuck at work until it is done."
bad,Not a fan. I would not recommend this position to anyone. Very stressful and not enough compensation. Bad hours and the work is very mundane.
bad,Numerous denials and appeals. Many different programs have to be open at one time to find the information you are looking for. Programs are not user friendly.
bad,"When you join Metlife, we are are supposed to pass a number of employee certifications that surround the topics of employee well being or professional bullying. None of which are adhered by the manager of the company. It is a very hypocritical company where there are two extreme type of manager; horrible, insulting ones or extremely nice. There is no balance of personalities there. experience where I had to keep looking over my shoulder to see if my Boss would come out of her office to insult me."
bad,The training was long and arduous but necessary but also trained by someone who hadn't been on the phones so much of the information about taking phone calls was not correct. Management DOES NOT listen to the employees and the systems are outdated and broken. You are expected to take phone calls even when the systems are down and log it on paper. Then you are not given time to go in and enter the phone calls when the systems come back up. You do it between calls. My manager didn't like women. Had no respect for them. He got promoted anyway.
bad,"If you can't commit to working 70 hour weeks then MetLife isn't for you. It's all about sale and all up to you to get it, if not you don't make money."
bad,This company falls short in a variety of ways. They don't train you or give you work to do. I mainly just sit at my desk waiting for something to do. This is not a well oiled machine.
bad,"If you want to work for a company with no job security, unattainable objectives, dull atmosphere, unappreciative managers, unfathomable responsibility, miserable customers, micromanaging and monotonous work, but want to earn a modest starting salary, then MetLife is for you."
bad,Nice place to work but not enough culture diversity.
bad,I’ve never work for or heard of a company less interested in root cause analysis than MetLife.  It always seem to be thrown on a Band-Aid and move onto the next issue.
bad,"Really good employee who loved my position. However, feel that I was treated unfairly by  both  management and HR Department. They did  not consider all the facts before terminating my position.  Would not trust them with anything."
bad,"Met can be ok, depending on the department you work. Auto and Home however is incredibly stressful. The management are unconcerned about helping you do your job. The metrics are almost impossible to meet with the call volume and amount of associates that don't do their job."
bad,"As MetLife tries to reduce their footprint, many jobs were lost.  A significant number of people relocated to NC office.  However, it was subsequently closed, thereby leaving those that relocated out of work."
bad,"No room for advancement, no diversity within my line of business not even a handful of minorities especially  Hispanics. The environment in my opinion was extremely stressful, full of gossip and just down right negative.  "
bad,"Letting go people was basically their motto...then dxc transition was a nightmare to just lay us off again. MetLife ruined what WAS good, the PEOPLE we did it all, we knew it all. I get getting rid life insurance your desire but should have accommodated the people. We bust butt with low pay...all so cold and sad. Not a job security plAce"
bad,The tasks required do not meet the job explanation. Analyst means secretary typing 20-30 business letters a day. There is no analysis of anything. Just typing.
bad,They will feed you what you want to hear. Team members made me feel small and irrelevant and my supervisor did nothing about it. She was favorable towards people she liked. Very fake. I was drowning and my team did absolutely nothing to help me. This job has a high turn over rate and I now know why.
bad,Paralegal Manager very unprofessional.  Sabotaged my success.  Company permits management to make inaccurate statements and performance evaluations about interns and employees without facts to support statements.
bad,Work at your own pace and write your own cheque.Gained experience in interacting with clients.Enjoyed recuiting more clients
bad,"MetLife was a great American institution.  However, it is now a shell of its former self.  Individual life insurance was once the core around which the business model was constructed, but now MetLife does not even provide this product."
bad,"After many yrs of working here, I got new mgmt team, some little dip-sh__ who worked for a big dip-sh__ plus one mgr in btwn, and all 3 thought they were going to Fix the Company. I did an EXCELLENT job there.  Not only did this mgmt team not know what they were doing, they were 3 really lousy people, and did not know how to manage people, let alone the work. After many yrs, I left. They treated me like you know what. So, it was time to move on. I work elsewhere, money better, people good, and mgrs kinder. I know those dips are still there, and this evening, I'm inspired to let you know. I only hope they make each other miserable now, it has to happen! May someone treat each of them the way they treated me. And that's how I bless you mid-level dodo's out there at ML. You know who you are!"
bad,"Worked for the company for almost 7 years with a very strong work ethics. This company is filled with rude, disrespectful, hostile leadership team. They treat you with no respect and always talk down to you. Rude and disrespectful leaders are never held accountable for their actions. Lately high resignations due to lack of appreciation and no level of professionalism from AVPs, VPs and up above."
bad,"Typical Call center with an overly toxic micro managed environment.  The opportunity was truly not worth the time.  To the Team Leaders on the floor, Supervisors, and Managers, I have this to say, Lead by example."
bad,Where do I start? First you get an ample amount of vacation time but only 1 person is allowed off per day so good luck getting any day that isn’t a random Tuesday. You are allowed 3 days per rolling year of call ins and at the 3 rd you get a warning for attendance and this includes weather emergencies. You go though 5 weeks of classroom training (this trainer is really nice and helpful in this phase of training) but don’t let it fool you.....next you get out on the floor where they just dump a case load on you and you start getting reviewed by these trolls called CSS’s that micro manage and tear apart every bit of your work. Everything you do gets reviewed and spit back at you non stop to make nit picky corrections as you are also trying to learn the nuances of the position and handle the caseload that you have. The CSS’s totally abuse their power and there is nobody reviewing them to make sure they are being fair or correct. They error you on what ever they want- frequently incorrectly and it is you ( the newby) versus them- take a guess who wins that dispute. If You get one of the fair ones you may get thru the 3rd phase of being a trainee but your chances are about 50/50. They assume when they hire a class of 6-8 that only 2 will be there after a year and they are correct- if that. There is a reason this job has been posted on indeed for 2 straight years. They bring training classes in like cattle at 6-8 people every 6 weeks non stop 52 weeks a year and still can’t keep the place fully staffed. If you finally make it to case manager after a year you can look forward to caseloads
bad,"Today, I viewed their posting for Client Services Consultant I in Tampa, FL right here on Indeed. Since I do meet the minimum qualifications they are seeking, I decided to try my luck, and apply for the position. "
bad,"Working for MetLife was awful. Stuck sitting in a cubicle all day with the phone ringing back to back to back. Agents call in and speak to you like you're ignorant garbage. When hired, I was under the impression that there was room for advancement. The truth is that they will keep you on the phones for as long as they possibly can. If you need to take off for an appointment, illness, ect., you have to make up your missed time when they tell you to (either skipping lunch, coming in early, or staying late). You do not get to decide. Your time off the phone for a simple bathroom break counts against you as ""personal time""."
bad,"Not a great company, they don’t care about people only profit, quick turnaround , decent pay but not worth the aggravation, not recommended to work here"
bad,Bastante normal .  Me llevaba bien con todos . Pero decidí irme por mí cuenta .
bad,"Was a real good place to work, good benefits, good people, good management. Very caring for employees, reasonable, good pay. Closed down in 2012, not open"
bad,Probably the worst place to have decided to enter into the mortgage business. They were drastically unprepared and failed to have the foresight needed to survive the obstacles in the mortgage business.  They hired on all of the Countrywide executives to run their company and they ran it into the ground. It was complicated to understand how the company was being mishandled. Out of business.
bad,"Paid less than promised, great people in a new building. Blind corruption by upper management. A good place if you are Not White, under 40  and have a sheepish personality. Your helping to offload work to offshore and excessive Vendor costs. Requests for technical training ignored. Great diversity . Give, give and live a short life on this happy campus. Work hard so you are replaced as soon as possible. There is no HR service, mentoring or conflict resolution. Read these reviews, many agree the MetLife workers strive in a leadership dead zone. Smile and remind yourself that the mantra is: Me, Me, Me, what is here for Me today ?"
bad,it was a nice job to receive training after college. you will recieve all investment and insurance licenses. you will work on training team and call leads to build a book of business.
bad,"MetLife is your typical revolving door run by almost entirely incompetent middle/senior management that only moved up the corporate ladder in the wake of the favor and good ole' boy network - I should know, I was one of them."
bad,"Learned a lot during my tenure there. Department began re-structuring and distraction lead to lost focus. Morale suffered, not a motivating place to work in the end."
bad,MetLife is great place to work. I learned a great deal at MetLife.
bad,"MetLife was a great place to work,  until you get older or paid a high salary for number of years of service.   Then they tend to lay you off and hire a younger person with a much lower salary.  Yes it helps the bottom dollar for the company but devastates the older employees who were loyal to the company and now they find it difficult to find work."
bad,"Every day is different, there is no advancement opportunities"
bad,"Responsible for providing ""Once and Done"" service. Service MetLife Bank and MetLife Annuities and Investments callers. Process electronic funds transactions. Assist customers with Individual Retirement accounts. Process pension start-up requests and update annuitant files. Service Annuitant Online registration questions. Open money market and Savings accounts. Assist customers with account balancing and Online Banking registration"
bad,The company was not employee friendly and it was extremely stressful.
bad,"Overtime required on a very frequent basis in order to get the job done (average 10 hours per week).  Overtime pay, not paid.  Lack of training and management support."
bad,This position was not a position for me.  I am not built to have someone cussing me out because they cannot get into their account on the company website.
bad,"Great Company, great culture, Great environment.  A typical day is spent working with various Financial Advisors, helping them create insurance based solutions for their clients."
bad,"I encourage all job seekers to make sure to have an additional job or a backup plan ready if considering a job at this company. It is unstable and will leave you empty handed if you don't play your cards right. The old sales saying goes ""Always be closing."" It would behoove you to always be interviewing as well."
bad,"Tienen un pésimo proceso de reclutamiento, te llaman un dia para decirte que estás contratada y ya nunca te llaman para decirte que día y con que documentos debes preséntate. Son groseros y además no tratan de modo correcto, pésimo lugar"
bad,"Provided assistance in Distribution / Dispute Department to ensure documents were accurate and complete"
bad,"very much challenging"
bad,"Was excited to work there but as time progressed, it was realized regardless of job performance, chances for advancement were not available and it became evident this was only a temporary employment opportunity to fill in quotation."
bad,First time I had to go to HR on management ever... within my entire career. I would have had a better experience if the manager I had was managed appropriately.
bad,"Working an adjuster is good, but the workload is ridiculous. You spend hours taking new claims every single day never getting the chance to complete the old ones. Customers are constantly angry and now I understand why."
bad,"Stressful from the moment you began work, due to under educated/experienced leadership; who had unrealistic expectations due to limited resources and direction, given to complete each task."
bad,"Average day consists of phone calls, new claims and ongoing case management on overall inventory.  Making timely decisions and meeting metrics.  High management and claims Specialist  turnover. Some leadership is lacking knowledge of product and practices within claims Specialist role. Excessive demands of overtime causing strain on personal life outside of work. The more work you do the more capacity is found to assist others whom lack on a daily basis. Poor communication amongst internal associates when changes are made. Systems are outdated as they are frequently unreliable."
bad,"Long working hours. Tough to balance family life."
bad,It is by far the worst place for any agent to work at.  Floating hours with tiering.  Impossible to take time off.  Goals are constantly changing because of agents leaving and the current agents having to make up for the loss.
bad,"Elitist environment."
bad,the work needs someone with courage and willingness to work.it is a nice company to work for and the Management is good. there are lots of opportunities to further your studies for free.
bad,management is not supportive. pay is low and there is no training program to assist. They are not up to date in technology
bad,Mostly attending a lot of meetings leaving no time to do real work. Typically work thru lunch and working 9-10 hour day. The current management structure is very poor. There is very little direction provided and the only respond when there is pressure from senior management. Folks you work with directly are great.  Everyone is very helpful and willing to pitch in. The hardest part is dealing with other organizations to take responsibility and ownership of their domains. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with your peers on a common goal.
bad,Company hires you under the idea you will be working with a senior financial advisor and eventually you will be working the senior fa book of business.  But your experience will only be what the senior fa helps you with. Poor training.
bad,"Just like most corporations, Metlife is no different. Work life balance is horrible, people act like highschool kids and everyone has its own little clique. It is like being back in highscool and being the new kid. Management has no idea what it is doing and favortism is all around. I will not be seeking another position with Metlife after I leave."
bad,The culture is very political. Internal jobs were offered to to employees based on who you know not what you know. Managers had the freedom to get the job done any way possible which led to a lot of unprofessional behavior
bad,Promised great things when I was hired.  The office was very political and not inclusive.  You had to watch your back.  Many coworkers left while I was there!   So happy that I left!
bad,"Just going to be deadlocked in customer service unless you know someone or jerk off a member of management, there are people working there 10 plus years that are still in customer service trying to make it ahead. They close their call center at 9pm, so if your shift ends prior to that time you have to come in half the day and then drive home instead of allowing you just to work the full day from home. They refuse to catch up with the time technology wise, their phone system is garbage."
bad,The unfair treatment of hard workers is why I left and the low pay with no room for advancement or ability to get pay increases made leaving easy! It’s ok if you’re young but not for a person with a home and responsibilities
bad,"The culture is morbid. Leadership is toxic. They hire very smart SMEs, but fail to listen to the SME's advice. They have a great office, and it's enticing to see it, but the employees are miserable."
bad,"I was constantly asked questions by my boss to see if I understood  my job.  One day, just to get him shake him up a bit or tease him, I answered incorrectly, I'm not longer working at MetLife. The Job was multi-faceted with lots of moving parts.  I created a ""how-to"" notebook for myself and continually updated as new instructions were given.  I was never trained.  the person assigned to train me said that she did not have the time and passed me off."
bad,"You can only get somewhere in this company if you know someone with authority. You can be the best employee and do a good job and never miss work, but if you are a threat to your supervisor, they will let you go. They don't care about you as a good employee."
bad,I am no longer an employee of Metlife. I work for DXC Technology.  I work helping customers service their life insurance policies. In my 30 plus years in the insurance industry I have learned many different insurance policy terms and procedures. I made some life long friends in those years.
bad,"Most times the people you work with are what help you cope with such toxicity in an employment environment. There are Pros & Cons with all companies; however, the bad outweighs the good but the benefits are definitely good enough if that counts for anything but they do not care about their employees. Period."
bad,There is mandatory overtime. The recruiters lie to you to get you to take the job and then no one cares that a you were lied to.  This is a Back to back phone call call center.
bad,"Management is poor. The operational procedures are disorganized. Minimal training materials. The training provided is a ""sit with"" where you watch a fellow employee while they explain the process of what they do day to day. Showing the best practices and operational procedures they use, but everyone operates differently. No advancement is offered or talked about with employees. High turn over rate due to unsatisfied employees. Metlife is the most frustrating company I have ever worked for. Claiming to strive for change and improvement but is filled with management that will not put forth the effort to see their employee's hard work put into action. The best thing Metlife offers are their benefits."
bad,"Basically - Squeeze you like an orange and throw you away. "
bad,I used to find this a great place to be until the office moved to a new location. Now my commute is over an hour each way. Some managers allow their subordinates to work from home but not all. My manager is not respected by the other leaders in management so unfortunately I do not get to work from home like the special employees.
bad,"In the course of 1 year I was given 4 different supervisors, each more bias than the next.  The nepotism is through the roof, so unless you are related to someone there, don't worry about promotions.  We were lied to from day one on the expectations we should have for t he job."
bad,"Extremely poor culture. Managers and supervisors have no idea what is going on. Changes daily from corp. No work life balance. All benefits have been removed, only benefit is a paycheck. Desk are open concept, no privacy or walls and you listen to supervisors socialize all day. Typical day is claims, claims, claims and then a huddle to throw off your day. Customers call to complain constantly with no help from supervisors they just give what the customer was looking for and you feel horrible after."
bad,It's hard to advance within the company.  Management is not transparent nor do they work well together.  Success is highly dependent upon others which means failing is too. Hard to feel secure when faced with these issues.  Nice to be able to work from home at least one day a week but this is after being in role for a year and often you work way more than you are compensated for.
bad,"Depending on who you report to the expectations for your work load and whether or not you can have appropriate work/life balance is extremely varied."
bad,"Worked at the Oriskany office in NY. Worked for the TAM team under one of the worst managers. She was disrespectful, she would threaten you if you don't pick up over time when she wants you to... Understaffed and people quit within days of getting hired under her. You're expected to do everything on the claims while you're on the phone 100% of the time. Favoritism was so blatant. The only way to be treated decent is to kiss her rear and buy her gifts with the few dollars they are paying you. Salary is thee worst!. I'm glad I resigned!"
bad,"This once was a great company, however over the past 2 years it has started to fall apart. Unbalanced workloads and no room for advancement especially if your a virtual employee. "
bad,Working for the company was okay as it was a small call centre with about 80 seats and limited lead supply and that was the hardest part of the job. The management was just misusing the funds trying to create a more vibey environment but the leads shortage was a problem.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Company seems to be going through many changes. There is excessive work, bad software and tedious processes... not a good combination.  They will work you like a slave picking cotton.  The company is sacrificing their employees with too many cuts. This is the only place that I know of that hires so many temps and they stay hoping to get a full time position.  Very deceitful, immature and messy management.  They are threaten by real professionals. Over aggressive men."
bad,"Telemarketing Executive in MetLife Insurance .Telemarketing is the process of using the telephone to generate leads, make sales, or gather marketing information. Telemarketing can be a particularly valuable tool for small businesses, in that it saves time and money as compared to personal selling, but offers many of the same benefits in terms of direct contact with customers.."
bad,"Passive manager. They do not treat temporary workers with respect. The turn over of temporary workers with this dept is ridiculous. Morale is horrible. The nurse reviewers are old, archaic and extremely difficult to work with. The companies system and software are very archaic, anyone can make changes and there is no way to track who puts in or make changes in this system. I would advice temp workers not to get too comfortable with this particular department at MetLife."
bad,"Morning sales meeting, product classes, prospecting for appointments."
bad,"A typical day here at Metlife is really boring. I just sit around and do nothing all day. Just kidding, my life while working at Metlife has been really interesting. Met a lot of great people whom I would have loved to continue working with."
bad,"• Provided secretarial support to RSL VP, DSL and sales staff in AZ, NM & CO, including typing letters, memoranda and reports using PC programs and software"
bad,"It not what you know , its who you know in this copmany. A women can say no to all projects and pretend to work and still keeps her job. If MetLife does not change this culture it will join the list of those big company who were once a good gompany."
bad,"I wouldn't go back, poor management, lack of training/coaching, management in the department that I worked in was very unprofessional, all that mattered was a warm body behind a computer.  Not one day was rewarding."
bad,"MetLife auto and home did some re-organizing in their claims operation about 3 years ago and it has been downhill ever since. Senior leaders are clueless about how their mid- managers treat their employees. If you complain or try to make a suggestion for change, you are labeled as negative and you can forget it. They say they want your feedback and they solicit it constantly just to hold it against you.  I don’t believe they will be able to stay in business another 150 years. I think they will sell their auto and home business or it will go under."
bad,"In my opinion a good management team is needed to succeed. That is what is lacking at Metlife, the right hand does not know what left is doing. Also there is no accountability, no one takes pride or ownership in their work. Most of the employees are miserable an looking for other jobs."
bad,Management never seems to have a clear vision. Constantly changing course. Workloads for claims adjusters are heavy. Layoffs every year. Very unnerving atmosphere.
bad,"Since 2016, MetLife has been going through a unit cost initiative (i.e. Layoffs) that will continue through the end of 2019. The groups are majorly understaffed and opportunities for advancement are nonexistent.  Teams are siloed and workloads have doubled over the last three years without any additional staffing. Employees are overworked, underpaid and undervalued. There is no quality Management in place there and the current leadership lacks taking accountability for their mistakes and is notorious for passing blame down to their associates when issues arise. The atmosphere is extremely tense and takes a toll on you physically as well as mentally. Information about the company's direction is not shared so employees are forced to work without any idea whether not they will be losing their jobs. The lack of communication then gives way to rumors and speculation making an already stressful situation worse. It has become an unnecessary burden that employees are forced to endure. Given the corporate climate MetLife's UCI initiative has created, I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,Everyone blames everyone else. No accountability. High turnover rate. Constant change in staff and processes. No stability. Leads and management are both immature and do not feel the need to take time and learn the industry.  Management that has no idea how to run the company because they are all new. Constant turnover. New leads come in with something to prove and have not bothered to learn policy and procedure. Micro-management.
bad,"need better managers with integrity"
bad,I work from home and they are moving away from those opportunities.  I am not in a geographic area where they are creating new jobs. The majority of annuities are now with Brighthouse financial and at the end of 2019- the servicing for those annuities is moving to DXC.
bad,"Its a horrible place to work. I did not enjoy any part of my job and would want to quit daily. Pay if horrible, its thankless and Im so happy any lucky to have found employment elsewhere."
bad,Constantly changing with very little insight into future direction.  Very tough environment but the day to day people are nice to work with.  There are a lot of IT challenges.
bad,I am not comfortable doing this and am not going to write any comments.  I am not going to type comments for this organization. I dont like being asked to do this.
bad,"Pros: Flexible hours, Option to work from home on as needed basis, Great co workers and supervisors,  "
bad,"MetLife is the only company I have ever worked for that treated their employees unfairly. How people are treated did not have anything at all to do anything with their work.  I have seen hard working people exceeding expectations year after year who never get promoted or advanced or they had to fight very hard to be advanced. There is almost no diversity in leadership or beyond a certain level. I have also seen people who under performed year after year and showed up to the office about 2 days a week yet they received continuous promotions. With MetLife it's very much the culture of who you know and being cutthroat to get to the top. Hard work, healthy culture, and a strong work ethic are things they are seriously lacking.  If you are great at spending most of your time at networking and rubbing noses with the right people while letting everyone else do the work then this would be a great environment for you."
bad,"Worst job I ever had. The company has the most red tape that I have ever seen."
bad,"The company is very unorganized which leads to insecurity in the position. Our office closed and many people were laid off, others of us were working from home with very little support from management."
bad,"As the title states, I wouldn't apply unless you're comfortable handling a phone based position that will start you out at $32,000 annually with a bachelors degree. It's honestly my worst decision and I truthfully regret applying, which is why I'm posting this as a fair warning to whomever may feel the inclination to apply."
bad,Metlife is a very complicated account. We need undergo training for 4 months. It is very stressful environment because there tons of calls receiving every day.
bad,Most of my peers are constantly keeping of with changes and having difficulty keeping up with work assigned to them even when they are on PTO.  Some members of the leadership team who are on salary need to record every minute of every action they perform throughout the day.
bad,"Not many opportunities to grow and move within, especially if you are not or cannot relocate. Hard to succeed overall with all of the changes of structure, duties and management. Nothing is transparent and people never feel that their job is secure. For anyone just starting their careers, this would be a good place for experience."
bad,"I have frequently seen people with bad behavior advanced, even skipped levels.  Management uses a yearly evaluation system that is highly flawed and based on personal preferences and not what the associate truly delivered. The environment has lots of room for improvement. Many senior manager have a very low social IQ, and are truly clueless on how to treat humans. Their priority is their own bonus!!!!"
bad,"The company is okay to work for but not permanently. "
bad,"I would not recommend this position at the Bloomfield location to anyone."
bad,"A lot of things changed in a very little amount of time.  I am most definitely okay with change, but this company I noticed constantly held on to temporary/contract employees for long, lengthy periods of time to avoid providing PTO, a 401(k), and better health benefits than that of the temp agencies."
bad,Inbound call center with cross training throughout departments to help with production needs. The company need to have more options for advancement in the customer service department.
bad,It was more focussed on sales than employee benifits. the company was only concerned with the business rather than how to generate business.
bad,"You come in, work and go home. Nothing special except the few good coworkers"
bad,"I read the reviews after I applied... I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach.. I was contacted and graciously accepted the position, which they start you off at a good fair market amount.... The finance department is not structured well... The employees never feel comfortable asking management questions. Not because they were mean... the LITERALLY DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWERS!!!"
bad,"-Typical day included coming in and checking the constant emails that were sent by supervisors/managers, EA reviews/or claim reviews that the supervisors were in charge of completing. There was rarely time to get to reviewing these claim reviews as the day went crazy faced paced and you could hardly stop to take a breath."
bad,Know procedures in place. Employees not well taken care off
bad,Processing LTD claims in a very task driven work environment. Department is very report driven with limited Work Life Balance.
bad,Representatives are always looking for the next sale. If management feel that the rep is not producing enough they can get quite nasty
bad,"No la recomiendo, no tiene buenos beneficios, el ritmo laboral es bastante acelerado y esta todo muy desorganizado."
bad,"Mala debido a que la información siempre la dan a medias, no te hacen sentir parte de y por tal motivo rs muy complicado dar buenos resultados"
bad,"Not nearly enough opportunities there for advancement, and did not really pay a living wage. There were mandatory overtime.Raises were extremely difficult to get regularly."
bad,"Es una empresa con gran músculo financiero, aunque considero deben tener un poco más en cuenta el SER de cada persona y capacitar más en este tema"
bad,Corporate culture was one of fake it or get fired. Speaking up is just drawing a target on yourself. Location is good and workplace perks made it worth it for a while. No respect for work/life balance when it came to after-hours symposiums and like events don't show up and be shunned. Management was clueless but tried to keep it together.
bad,"Upper and middle level management was the worst!!!!."
bad,"Not a good place to work.. First 5 months, you work almost every weekend.  Little or no support from the  immediate supervisor.  It feels like you have four main supervisors."
bad,"Current Management is poor with the engagement of their own production teams. You have one Ops Manager that is ALL about the metrics and then you have the other Ops Manager that states the opposite. Discrimination is very evident within the department. They pick and choose who they want to succeed. When you are hired you are told you will be handling about 80-100 claims, you end up with 200+ and then grade your productivity with the incorrect metric system for that case load count.  Training was great but when on the floor, there is a lot of inconsistency on how to manage the claim.  They set you to fail."
bad,"Management at Metlife was extremely poor, either no management at all or constantly being micro managed. Salary was very competitive and very good bonus'."
bad,There is no opportunity to grow yourself or advance in the company. They do not pay well for the work that is expected from you. Very stressful work environment.
bad,"Typical call center. Hours were flexible.  However, having your management team in a totally different state was very difficult. A lot of the communication was via email."
bad,"MetLife is a decent place to work, great to have the name on your resume but that's about it. Very nice people to work with. Uncertain about security."
bad,"They do not care if you have been a good, hardworking, dependable employee for many years.  They dumped a lot of very good people, that provided outstanding customer service, just so we could be replaced by cheaper labor"
bad,Job assignments are given without employee feedback.  Job assignments are give out of the blue with very short delivery dates.  You will be hired for one skill set and given assignments that have nothing to do with what you were hired for.  Management discourages communication both within the team You can be expected to finish tasks without getting requirements.
bad,"As a new hire, and career change application, was promised very hands on training and follow up, it was not there."
bad,"The work culture in Global Technology and Operations has deteriorated significantly over the last ~15 years. Associates are not valued. They are simply cogs in a wheel. The pressure felt from the top down is crushing, and time is misspent, per senior leadership direction, on perfecting PowerPoint presentations instead of working on strategic gains."
bad,"Mala dirección, se nota el cambio del Gerente se han perdieron beneficios y respeto a las personas, se hace necesario sindicato de trabajadores."
bad,They had a good structure.  My only issue was that they moved most of their operations to NC and as a result I could not keep the job.  In the end it is what it was.  They had a good structure.
bad,"There is no growth potential at Metlife.  The culture is very competitive. A lot of backstabbing.  It is not based on your knowledge or experience, but rather who you know to get ahead."
bad,"MetLife is a great company that has been in operations for almost 150  years.  The culture, based on my experience, is one of individuals slow to change.  Many of the individuals I met were legacy employees, meaning their grandfather and/or father worked for the company.  There appears to be quite a bit of nepotism at the organization.  "
bad,MetLife can potentially be a great company to work for eventually. Every year there would be a new Sr. Executive with new ways to handle business however; MetLife was unwilling to hire and retain hard working associates but chose to keep unskilled management to run the business into the ground.
bad,"There are too many erroneous changes being made that are going to hurt the company and upper management is not listening to the people doing the jobs, on the front line."
bad,"gone. company is shut down.  I don't know why I'm being asked to provide a review of a company that no longer exists, and this Indeed software won't allow me to bypass this requirement."
bad,Metlife doesn't give you enough power to do you job properly. They let customers walk over you and you are expected to be ok with it. You have to have a strong backbone to make it anytime here.
bad,Management was new and was still learning the role. My peers were nice. I enjoyed the location as it was surrounded my sidewalks and trails to walk on nice days.
bad,"Learned a lot in the insurance field.  They did not only cover life insurance but they also did 403(b), 457, 401K and financial planning."
bad,"Training is overwhelming, systems are antiquated, customer centricity (supposed to be exceptional customer service) is a joke, the most important thing is call metrics, that is how fast you can get someone on the phone, off the phone and onto the next call.  If you get a long caller and you miss the start of your break, you can still go on break, but because you started your break late then you are out of adherence, too many time of that you get written up.  Company has great health benefits, but it is the typical call center environment.  The best part of the job is quitting time, the worst part is from starting time until quitting time, other than that it is a dream job..."
bad,"MetLife is a strong company with a great culture and global footprint."
bad,"The attendance policy metlife is very unrealistic, they only allow for 3 sick days per year if you go over your 3 days you get a verbal warning ,then written warning which follows you for one year to the day of your actual sick days you used .  Even if you have dr note writing you out for 4 days because you have strep throat they will not accept dr note as an excused absence. Because they are a paid for perforamce if you any type warning when they do your yearly review you will not qualify for your bonus or a raise regardless of how your stats are. They have also made changes to the way you choose your work shifts when I started it was one late night to 10 or 11 pm with one sat a month. Now it is based on your job performance so as a new employee my choices were to work until 11 every night and have sat and sun off or work 4 week days from 8:30 to 5 with one random day off during week and work every sat. I really don't feel like I have job security either between performance goals and attendance policy I feel like I am nothing more than a number.  I would not recommend this company to anyone who has a family."
bad,"was not given enough training, management was unavailable to help mos of the time. always and to find an employee form another deparment"
bad,"When I started with this company, I absolutely loved it. Then after 5-6 years, when a lot of changes were made, it went downhill. Myself andseveral other co-workers felt the same. Where it was one of the best places we say we worked ended up being just a ""job."" I'm not sad to say that I am no longer there, actually feel relieved. If time can be rewind I would relived the beginning of it. MetLife is a good company to work for but that's if you're in the right position/department and people/co-workers."
bad,"Quiet work environment"
bad,"No hay linea de crecimiento dentro de la empresa, quitan fácilmente tu bono de puntualidad y asistencia, el sueldo no me alcanza para mantenerme"
bad,"If you like paying a company to work in a commission only sales environment, this is the job for you!"
bad,"If you like working in a negative, fishbowl environment, then this is the place for you. Management is concerned about themselvlves and has little to no regard for the peons below.....they are throw aways that only ensure management's security."
bad,"Caveat Emptor for those seeking employment here! .......... there are more firings going on then there are hirings. Top management is trying to save money for its ""shareholders"" as it is a public company. Every branch in the country is going through transition and merging locations with New England Financial ( NEF ) Decisions regarding the people they are retaining are horrible, expense cutting is ridiculous at the the branch levels ( when was the last time you had to buy staples or paper clips out of your own pocket to do business ..... or better yet, have the paper towels and coffee locked up so you can't use them without operations opening the cabinet for you?!?)"
bad,"Aprendi muito sobre liderança, amizades no trabalho, porém trata-se de uma empresa com muita pressão no trabalho, poucos líderes capazes de liderança, muitas pessoas sendo promovidas por números mas sem conhecimento de liderança, empresa com as fusões está perdendo ótimos profissionais capacitados e verdadeiros líderes."
bad,I have learnt more with socialising with different people.The hardest part of this job is when you dont get any clients because your sallary depends on them.Presantations are most enjoyable part of this job cause you get to shere your knowledge on product you sell.
bad,"Boss was unethical, training very poor. Enjoyed being able to set your own schedule."
bad,Tough company to work for. No work-life balance. Not team-oriented. Needs new leadership. It's a set up on how they make you believe you can own your own agency and then just leave you out to dry.
bad,Te dicen muchas cosas positivas que al final son muy difíciles de cumplir y la capacitación no se enfoca en lo verdaderamente importante.
bad,Reorgs seemingly every 6 months. Upper management (VP/above) very disconnected. Middle management offered little sense of security. Promotions were rare.
bad,"...and lately the bad has been outweighing to good. Little to no direction from management, and when they do say anything it's usually not true or completely changes within the next week."
bad,You have the weekends off every job has its pros and cons helping people that really need it I learned std and ltd disability high stress level don't know what to say about management I don't understand why they want me to add more metlife is metlife that's it
bad,It is a bit rough when almost daily you were unsure of changes coming from top management.  It is a strong training team that is sometimes not used to their fullest capabilities.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at MetLife.  4 months prior to me leaving, new manager was placed which was rude, disrespectful and degrading.  This cause a lot stress."
bad,The office environment was not supportive of improving employee morale or performance. Management not clear in their goals. Senior Leadership uncommunicative to the broader organization.
bad,The environment at MetLife was very competitive and at times outright cut throat.  The system is setup where persons mentality was just about making the next sale at all cost.
bad,At the time of this writing there is a general lack of trust of the middle and upper leadership team.  There is zero work life balance and if is a hostile work environment.
bad,"Commission only was a lot of work for little pay. Working late evening hours, a lot of weekend work. spend a lot of money on marketing as they only pay commissions."
bad,"At first, I really enjoyed working at MetLife.  However, several years after I started, the life/annuity operations went thru a lot of changes (as was typical of many companies at that time).  As a result, morale among employees took a turn for the worse."
bad,"MetLife has a firm handle on reputation and propaganda. However, the fall way short in adhering to these messages and practices. My daily work consisted of trying to get information and data from people who could care less about co-operation and getting the job done than their own reputation and status. Scattered throughout the company are those gems that are not only a joy to work with, but are willing to help, listen and share their knowledge of MetLife's true workings and technical expertise.,"
bad,Its was fun to learn something new. Its was a stressful job The people were not really that friendly since I was just a contract employee. I love to talk to the clients to be able to help them get there claims set up and paid for them.
bad,No review at this time as I only worked for the company for a short period of time and the position was not what was described to me during my three interviews.
bad,"My role was in the SSO (Single Sign-On) & Federation IAM group."
bad,the company developed a new insurance for RETIRED veterens and completely misunderstood their audience. It put a lot of pressure on the work force to sell this insurance to people who seldom make such a decision in the time they wanted.
bad,I took the job at a time when the economy was not good. This was a full time sales job. I would not recommend this position unless you love to sell.. There are many companies with better products and compensation.
bad,"Completely stressful everyday"
bad,I worked as a Certified Security Guard.  I worked night shift and I did not have much to say about this job because this job was boring and sleepy every night I have to keep up with walking the building to keep busy to not falling asleep.  I have stomach ulcer and I have to leave the job as the Doctor said or I have more medical complicated.
bad,"MetLife is an extremely stressful environment where the workers are  micro managed, work is shoved down your throat, and you are treated like an assembly line worker."
bad,No cuenta con condiciones laborales competitivas y existe alta rotación laboral
bad,Un día tipico era solamente enfocado a realizar y enviar reportes.  Aprendi a utilizar herramientas computacionales y trabajar bajo presión. La dirección podría mejorar. La cultura laboral es buena pero en decadencia. Lo más difícil del trabajo lidiar con la dirección. Lo que mas me gusto aprender del negocio de los seguros.
bad,I have no comment thanks I have been there 2 years without a rise and no advancement  manager was ok but overall couldnt go any higher to further my career
bad,"over 50 hours work week"
bad,good place to work for and managment worked with you. lots of perks and good pay. all managment was good people and it was a fun place to work for and clean
bad,metlife was a busy position but the management was not organized it could be more organized in its perspective I would recommend the job if someone need it but as a career move no.
bad,Very stressful atmosphere and the department I was in offered no help to solve a situation. You could not tell the higher ups in the company because the department supervisor would make your position and work ethics very difficult.
bad,"The pay is good but it is not worth the stress it puts on your daily schedule. "
bad,The manager is pressuring staff to sell a big amount and discouraging employee by telling negative things. The company is good but the area manager in that specific branch is not good.
bad,"Poor company culture."
bad,Was not a professional work environment in India. There was no response for employee grievances from any level. Hectic working hours. Biased management.
bad,"This company was great to work for until 3 years ago when a new senior manager was hired. He peppered his staff with people he knew and while he talked internal advancement, almost all new positions were hired from the outside. He provided zero feedback on job performance until it was review time. At performance review time you heard of all the things you did wrong that you never heard through the year. Leaving no way to make adjustments during the year. "
bad,"A typicl day working for Metlife Securities was making sure that customers check request was processed and mailed out before the cut off time. The most important aspect while processing check request is paying close attention to deal. Such as, check amount , address where the check is to be mailed to,  and any special instructions."
bad,"MetLife was a great company to work for until they sold all of there representative to Mass Mutual.  Since then the compensation and the operations have changed drastically,"
bad,"Since it has been so long, I can't recall a typical day at work. The workplace culture and management were great. If I could go back, I would if only the paid more."
bad,Management pushes for over the top goals from employees. Very stressful environment. Expectations are high without any real praise for employees. The company is scrambling trying to stay afloat as it is struggling. Very inconsistent.
bad,"MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]"
bad,"Sales Job, Metlife dose everything and as a result nothing really good.  Leads are old and not worth the phone call. "
bad,I was working as a Financial Advisor with MetLife Alico that dealt with the individual and Group Insurances. It was not a salaried job ad was on commision basis.
bad,"MetLife has the means to be a great workplace but it's not living up to that expectation. At first, the environment seems so inviting and you're excited to get started. However, after being there for a while, you see that the work environment isn't as positive as you'd like it to be. Employees are often kept in the dark about what's going on around them and they end up being extremely unprepared for changes that come their way. Of course being in a call center environment, there is a large variety of personalities and people of many different backgrounds. The workforce is diverse but there is very little recognition of that fact."
bad,the conversion of systems and the uncertainty of the business created a very stressful situation. I am not at liberty to discuss further..
bad,"*Bad Environment"
bad,"I learned that corporate america can make one a slave to the job and often times keeps you away from family and friends. Furthermore, the most enjoyable part of the job was the cafeteria"
bad,"MetLife is one of those it could be better it could be worse places. Management never seemed to know what was going on. You could ask one manager one thing, then turn around and another manager was telling you something completely different. The hardest part of the job was not having the resources to do the job. Yes, there were your co-workers, but even they never had the same answers. Training was never consistent."
bad,Constant pressure is put on employees to obtain unreasonable results with work tools that do not allow for success. employee to employee interaction is frowned upon unless work related. unreasonable work load. philosophy does not foster independent thought process
bad,"First Horizon was in the top 100 companies to work for, for many years. In addition to support, I also collaborated with other leaders during transformation."
bad,"lack of support in the field."
bad,"I wish I could recommend this place to work for.  I'm sure there are good groups within the company, but I found that key people were reluctant to help new people in their positions so that they could succeed as a team.  At last count more than 75% of my orientation class had quit within the first year (and we were all in different groups).  Others have moved to different groups and even more are actively looking to get out of the firm.  That's just my impression of the company."
bad,Started working as first job so it was really fruitful nice learning experience. Nice to meet professional working people in your first job.
bad,"Aprendí a escuchar cada una de las necesidades de las personas, y el poder darme cuenta que su seguro de vida nadamas los protegía en su centro de trabajo y comentarme que metlife si cumplía."
bad,"Fast paced"
bad,"This is a very demanding place to work which allows for an environment of stressed out, unhappy people which is very bad work culture. Positions are not commensurate with salaries and instead you are rewarded with endless branding items which ultimately do not pay your bills."
bad,"Handle high $$ value applicants, "
bad,"Had to go out of the office to convince people to buy insurance. "
bad,"MetLife Home Loans, a former division of MetLife, no longer exists. Banking operations were liquidated in 2011. In my opinion, the company had a poor corporate culture, one where rules and procedures were more highly valued than sound judgement, problem solving, and conflict resolution. "
bad,Typical day is redundant
bad,"Typical day was on 15th feb, 2007 when i joined."
bad,Nice Company to work with.
bad,Alot of layoffs and outsourcing taking place. No job security with them anymore. My dept was outsourced so I'm now trying to find my way into a local class A driving job.
bad,this is a good place to work and a lot of room to grow and move in life. the people were fun and nice
bad,"Worked so hard to feed the top managers.  If not one of ""the guys"", you might not make it long.  High expenses as a financial services professional with low percentage of pay that you actually earned."
bad,"Metlife was a joy to work for, at first. 6 weeks of training that made you feel part of the team. The first few months on the floor , seemed like everyone was on your side and there to help. But watch your back if you don’t know the right people. After about month 3, is when work loads get out of hand. My position was a claims adjuster, but what they expect you to do is so much more then that. Even certain managers have remarked that it’s too much, that is required if you"
bad,If you're looking for more than what you make then you can probably handle it. But the turnover rate is like none other that I've ever seen for a call center. The pay can be worth it if you work evenings or weekends but otherwise it's too stressful.   Definitely recommend only staying here temporarily or you will end up having a stroke. Management says they care but they dont. They only care about numbers. . You also wont advance unless they like you enough'  very unfair. They dont tell you about things that change until the day of. so you're taking calls trying to help people but end up messing up something and hearing about it later in a meeting when you werent even ever trained on what changed. It's just over all not that great of a job. Nothing like it used to be. Constantly fixing other's mistakes because they werent trained properly on something. MetLife is too outdated. MetLife and electronics dont mix at all.
bad,"Management and co-workers will make sure you're gone if you look at them the wrong way probably. So competitive it's toxic. "
bad,"I was really excited to start my career with Metlife, but now I'm not sure. Management picks favorites and is almost never fair, the pay is very low for the stress of the job. the perks seems to be good but if you're in the call center chances are you wont be able to attend any employees activities"
bad,Lack of advancement coupled with lack of challenge from position. Those that did advance were not those who were necessarily more educated or smarter but simply those who know...know the MetLife system and the Supervisor.
bad,Benefits Administration for GM salaried workers. Good secure job. Grunt work and lots of phone work but a good learning environment and gain alot of skills
bad,"Si bien es verdad que se puede ganar mucho dinero aquí, la estabilidad laboral es mala, a la empresa le interesa quedarse con tus negocios y clientes que generes, más que quedarse contigo, por lo que los tres primeros meses que son de práctica, son netamente para estrujar tu cartera de contactos (familiares y amigos cercanos) y ya al final cuando no te quedan mucho y se hace más y más complicado llegar a las metas, te desvinculan al vencer el contrato, quedando ellos con tus negocios generados y las comisiones que seguirán generando."
bad,"Lucrative if you can land a contract, but I wouldn't recommend full time employment."
bad,"Pretty much had to sell Metlife products to earn top grid %"
bad,really great when it comes to quality of training. but too much internal politics and absolutely no quality work. The client/partner relationship with US side is a big mess
bad,This is not the company to join if you want to advance your career. You will not thrive because the culture does not support that. Poorest management team I've ever been exposed too.
bad,"Horrible management and an inconsistent adherence to stated company directives and values resulted in company-wide mismanagement of employees.  Many were underutilized in their given roles, languishing for lack of meaningful work, while others were worked to the bone and burning out very shortly after hire.  It wasn't uncommon for projects to be cancelled after significant time and energy were invested in it."
bad,Very minimal to no career opportunities and advancement. Strong passion for customer service and focus on centricity but have had no advancement in last 4 years.
bad,Hated the people I worked. Too conservative. Not a good start from anyone at the start of career. I would never want to go back to them Please choose the people you want to work with.
bad,I have been with Metlife for over 10 years so get lots of vacation time and the health insurance  is great. I carry the insurance for the whole family
bad,"MetLife has recently gone through some changes that have made the workplace culture difficult. There is little to no room for advancement, and the work load has tripled as a result."
bad,"Client service is constantly changing as upper management attempts to find a model that is efficient to compete in the market place.  Every 18 months a new upper management team arrives, with no prior experience in Service and implements changes. Systems are old and rigid and require numerous work arounds to function.  No plans to update systems.  They constantly preach metrics for evaluating your performance, however many of the metrics they use are flawed in their concept.  In the end, your success or lack there of is completely depended on where your manager ranks you against your colleagues.  It's a forced bell curve, so there are only so many A's, B's, and so on.  A great team has to have some one in the unsatisfactory position, whether it's justified or not.  This kind of thinking is an example of how far behind the times this organization is."
bad,"The benefits, salary and location were excellent.,  It was a different story with the management and the people in general.  People are managers that have NO people skills whatsoever and then there are others who play favorites.  This was just what I saw in the work area I was in.   I am not sure about other areas.  "
bad,"The MetLife Cary campus is beautiful. The building is great, there are lots of collaboration rooms, ping pong tables- the works. The downside is that no one really uses or is encouraged to use these things, it seems more like its for show. The culture still feels very much like a stuffy work office. "
bad,"Employees are not listened to and management doesn't really do anything but tell you everything negative they are also not the most knowledgeable in management, the products, or employee relations.  there is very little recognition and makes you feel as if you are unappreciated. Training was just a joke, there was no structure and we were expected to know things that we were never trained on in class and you are counted off for those things even if you didn't know it because you were 'expected' to know it already."
bad,"Cool co-workers, always free food and donuts BEWARE if you're watching your figure. Robot job with decent pay. Snoopys everywhere in the office."
bad,Reinventing the wheel every time there is a problem.  Systems are so old and nothing is user friendly.  Worked 10 plus hours a day and still not being able to catch up with work load.  The management pushed extra work everyday even though they knew how behind every one was.
bad,"The position itself is great and has a number of positives: Plenty of autonomy, lots of client interaction (typically email dominated), great variety of tasks and projects from day to day, strong team atmosphere and culture of helping one another, lots of job flexibility."
bad,"17 years I worked with this company, I enjoyed my time learning and doing the kind of work I did.  However, just as in any other company, you will always have your Pros and Cons."
bad,"Encountered the following overwhelming themes in my day to day work:"
bad,"MetLife Securities was another good company to work for because it gave me opportunities without any prior experience. My daily responsibilities were to process checks, wire transfer, and third party checks. This jobs was no easy, it required a lot of focus and detail everyday. My challengers were get my check request out before the cut off time and during those moment when I did was my most enjoyable part of my job. Co-workers were helpful from day and a joy to be around."
bad,"I was a contractor, so I can not comment. I provided mainframe DB2 for z/OS systems programming technical advice and implementation."
bad,hard to maintain a work/home life balance - management has changed in the last year and is now handled off site.
bad,always have motivational gatherings to keep the positive energy flowing
bad,I work from home with no real support from the regional office. My typical day consist of scheduling visits at my assigned school. I'm learning to set-up school visits with the help the school secretaries. I work solo with no real back office support.
bad,"Every day in the company i use to call the clients and take all their appointments at morning times. at the afternoon time after lunch we use to meat the clients at their place to explain our company investment plans and convening them to invest on our plans."
bad,I decided I would attempt a go at the Insurance marketplace. I found the sale difficult as a large part of the job was calling on friends and acquaintances to market a product which most of whom I contacted already had coverage's with other firms. The hours were acceptable but the income was limited and it would have taken a long time to reach the income I would need to survive. The company was going through some reorganization and there was friction between the old and the new upper management staffs and thus those below suffered. I wrote and passed my licenses and I found the job a challenge and made a move when another field of career opportunity became available at the City of Bathurst.
bad,"the day wen i dont even wrote a one client.i learned that life is all about working hard.i had a good relationshiop with my manager.we worked as a team with my co-workers,they have what we call a motivational way to make us feel part of a team.its hard when you got clients whom are full of lies.every time when u reach ur targets der are rewards like vouchers."
bad,"NEF is behind the times, the agencys operate under the General Agency System. Slowly but surely NEF is being integrated into MetLife which is a good thing. We no longer have our own product line and opportunitys for advancement are poor."
bad,"I was hired as a long-term temp at MetLife, and I tried as hard as I could to convert to Full-time permanent. I showed up early, stayed late frequently, cut my lunch short and took pains to get along well with everyone. I trained my replacement to do half of my job and they outsourced the other half to India. Fortunately I got another offer before my assignment ended, which would've been about 3 weeks after I gave notice. I don't know when they were going to tell me, probably that same week I'm sure. Definitely do not temp, if you go in as a regular new hire I am sure things will be different. The people are very smart and it is decent management, but it is that same culture all large corporations have."
bad,"Lack of management listening to issues in department, favoritism, lack of training, in my class only 2 people made it out of 17 as an example, needed more help, and it wasn't there"
bad,"Lo más destacable es el permanente contacto con la gente, los usuarios y beneficios concretos a las personas, lamentablemente el puesto de trabajo no poseía la fluidez con la jefatura, lo que relentizaba las respuestas a los usuarios, cosas que tampoco fue tan mala, pues ayudó a que tomara cierta autonomía y asertividad en mis decisiones."
bad,"The management values average handle time almost as much as actual customer service. As long as you're moderately nice, you'll excel if you're fast. My manager had no advice on how to be faster, just that I had to do it if I wanted to keep my job. The fastest worker was the one who kept getting employee of the month, despite handing calls over to supervisor more than anyone and hanging up on people on purpose sometimes. So if you need to break the rules to keep your time down, that's fine, I guess. Good luck!"
bad,"I was excited to work for a big company like Metlife when I first joined. However, training for the job was awful! Support from management isn’t there. They act like they are and that you can talk to them but anytime you talk to someone or even ask a question it’s documented and used against you when it’s time for a raise. They are always understaffed in the claims area. People put in way more than 40 hours a week and are told by management you work until the work is done. Yet also told there will always be work to do. So the work life balance isn’t there."
bad,The benefits are excellent . The call center life is not for most . I did not enjoy being listened to and told what to say . I am a person not a robot. Commission is based on the script u say rather than bringing in ridiculous amounts of premium .. guess they like to keep all that premium. Some people kill this job and great for them! If you can do a script time after time this might be a job for u
bad,"Typical day at work is answering calls and attempting to sell insurance polices.  You must cross sell and close at least 2 policies per call in order to possibly hit the bonus structure. As a new agent you are placed on the lowest tier; which is where the clients with no or bad credit, no prior insurance, and are priced out of the company. They are constantly pushing for very high metrics and require cross selling on all calls however you are also expected to keep a high close rate. Your bonus structure (commission) is based not only on sales it sounds great during the hiring process they tell you per item is what you need. However, you have to have items+ premium+ you must get the cross sell as part of your metrics are based on 2 quotes per call and 2 sales per call.  They do a lot of live monitors with jumping into your calls and listening and sending you instant messages while you're talking to the client. The systems crash on a daily basis.  The benefits are excellent. I love being able to work at home, but under constant stress of trying to make ends meet on the base salary."
bad,"It seemed to me, that although they bill themselves as ""like Google"", MetLife had its ups and downs."
bad,handled phone calls daily from current clients and possible clients. Inputted information into the system also let clients know the status of their claims.
bad,"The sales department is not the career path that I would recommend. Considerable daily pressure and little management assistance.Other departments were conducive to a career, but one could not transfer to another department for a year."
bad,A typical work day is 4 hours of your day on the phone taking incoming First Notice of Loss Claims and status calls. 2nd half your work. Not Possible to maintain
bad,"In the position I was in I would have retired from the company had it not been for being impacted by a reduction in force due to an acquisition of another company."
bad,It was always the bottom line and making more money for senior management bonuses and people were expendable.  Bad communications from the top down and management always had hidden agendas.
bad,Metlife is a good place to get licensed and learn the basics but beyond that there is no advancement or benefits- just seel to your friends (network)...
bad,Less critical work. Skills can not utilized like SAS and R. Involvement of India side business corrupt/rune US culture. Learning and grooming is neglected by management.
bad,I don't have anything negative to say about the company.  I enjoyed my co-workers.  I wish there had been an opportunity for advancement or to earn a few more working hours per week.
bad,"Contacto com potenciais clientes, gestão de carteiras."
bad,"challenging environment, have to constantly travel to outskirts in order to source new business. fun in terms of flexibility and being your own boss more than anything else."
bad,"While Metlife provides a good customer service. behind the scenes the work environment is negative, stressful and not age friendly. Management pushes harder and harder for more results above and beyond abilities, without support or value to employee."
bad,"Annuities department is new to Charlotte, North Carolina. There is room for improvement. Supervisory staff are new to the role and have no previous experience in managing seasoned representatives."
bad,"For a Fortune 50 organization, MetLife is able to offer a set of benefits that few other organizations can in this day in age. The downside though is that the organization restructures constantly."
bad,I enjoyed my employment there but their strategies for workflow are not well planned. Needs better work life balance support.
bad,Learned a lot in s short period of time. Have to learn a lot in a short time with no manual or training. Team member seems not care about other or over department results. Management is always right and does not want to hear you opinion or
bad,Everything depends your department and manager. In Morristown office a lot of people were doing their last career turn before retirement.
bad,"Not good work culture - hectic"
bad,This company is very unstable.  it was okay.  the people were nice
bad,While I enjoyed my specific job the overall environment was difficult due to many mergers and management changes.  I telecommuted to New Jersey from my home & again enjoyed my work overall.
bad,"- I would always check my voicemails, then emails first thing in the morning."
bad,"While the compensation and work/life balance is good, playing politics is more important than producing results. Loved the tasks involved in my role as well as building strong partnerships, strategic planning, improving processes, taking the initiative to resolve issues and managing, coaching and developing teams. The hardest part of the job was the environment."
bad,"Just like any company it has its pros and cons. I have learned alot while working at this company. However, when it comes down to being diverse in the Oriskany NY area, MetLife needs a major improvement."
bad,This was a great place to work 5 years ago. Upper management is completely out of touch with the claims teams.
bad,"Working as an internal wholesaler I would make calls to financial advisers and inform them on how to sell insurance to their clients. Also would take some incoming calls from financial advisers that would have questions about MetLife insurance. Management was not very open to listening to all employees, and in turn they were not very great in leadership roles. Co-workers were very nice and lovely to work with everyday. Hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the managers. Most enjoyable part of the job was working along side some really great co-workers."
bad,The training was poor. Nothing like the interviewer described. My class was told they would be fired if they didn't get the martial the whole time. No help whatsoever when it came to training and was thrown into the weeds with less than 2 months of training. No support from management. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Left less than a year to different job
bad,I worked in MetLife for more than a year. The office and work culture was really good.  I worked around the same project which had repeated change requests. So after a couple of months there was nothing much to learn and it was beating around the bush.
bad,"I loved my job, but the micromanagement and favoritism sucked. "
bad,"The pros include quality benefits, PTO days and work/life balance. "
bad,"STD benefits case manager"
bad,"MetLife cannot get away from meetings.  A typical week included 40+ meetings. Most meetings were not productive, little follow-up and they never started on time."
bad,"Process can ramp down anytime . HR and  management takes no accountability of your redeployment. Employee can be jobless anytime"
bad,"Several tasks to complete each day, not enough time to complete them, it is a call center environment now and unable to handle your own work at times."
bad,MetLife has a culture where they feel they own you.  I was expected to work a minimum of 50hrs a week and most of the time it was 50 to 65.  Then they took the entire operation and moved it out of boston and went down south where they literally laid you off and then made you apply for your own job again so they could put you on the carolina's pay scale.  Sad way to do business.
bad,"Career/salaried employees are treated like hourly employee, only with no OT pay.  There is no work/life balance and no flexibility.  Management has favorites that are offered all of the career advancement opportunities."
bad,"Although  I cannot speak for the entire organization,  I can tell you that the Investment  IT department is no longer a desired placed to work.  Friends of senior management will get promoted and even given your job although they do not have any experience in that capacity. It should be against the law but Nepotism in New Jersey is not against the law. neither is sucking up."
bad,Working Environment is average. Management is less supportive. company is not employee friendly. Bossy culture is there in the company which is not good.
bad,"Good company, need to focus on employee work life balance."
bad,"Recruitment skills"
bad,Policies are made based on financial back-office operations which gets difficult for people in IT domain to maintain work-life balance time to time.
bad,"I was told to sell products that were not appropriate for clients."
bad,"I am usually crunching numbers, validating the results of models against other outputs. Management is uncaring, and culture is not amenable to change in a rapidly changing world"
bad,My work included a lot of migrations and work culture was't great.
bad,Pays well but no longer a good place to work. Culture has changed over the years. They care less about employees. Little job security.  Not many advancement opportunities. Very political.
bad,We done customer care  services  for resolving  customer  satisfaction  all.  Telecom  services   for rim  cell phone  lot of enjoying  in company   culture  is good
bad,"i absorbed a great deal of knowledge and gained huge insight"
bad,MetLife was going through a dramatic change in strategy when I worked there so it might be that things have smoothed out. There was a lot of confusion and lack of vision following the sell off of US Assets by the company.
bad,"The job paid well, but it was way too much for anyone to handle. Every day was extremely stressful and I would carry that stress home with me. To say you need to be good at multitasking is a gross understatement, imagine juggling 15 bowling pins at once and that would be a good day. Everyone I worked with was great, but no one was happy. There's a reason they mostly hire young people as adjusters, no one over the age of 30 has the energy to keep pace. The job pays well and that keeps a lot of people there. If you don't absolutely need the money, take a lower paying job where you'll  be happier."
bad,"Very difficult to learn as tenured folks tend to keep needed information close to the vest, thus tough to succeed. Lends itself to a very frustrating day and a lot of extra work at night to try to fill in the I don't know what I don't know items."
bad,"En departamento que me desempeñé la forma de llevar a cabo el trabajo es poco clara, si bien la secretaria debe asistir a los ejecutivos de venta, esto no significa ayudarlos a pasar carpetas sin el filtro correspondiente."
bad,Commission based job where the better your market the more money you made.
bad,"I found working at Met very stressful. Due to the economy clients struggle to pay their policies and when they can't pay MET takes back the commission you worked for, irrespective of the amount of time, petrol and cell cost you've spent. They say it's the name of the game."
bad,There is a significant scope of bringing in the management processes. Workplace culture is good. Management is cooperative. Gym and Pool table onsite help to keep you active. Good view of the lake and extremely nice facility.
bad,"The training process is terrible. You literally get no support,The mental stress is not worth it. You only get a 30 min lunch. You can barley pay bills working here. Run please. It’s extremely micro managed. This is not the company of your look for career advancement."
bad,Bajo sueldo. Dificil de trabajar por la venta de apv
bad,"horario laboral bueno, cuando es temporada de vacaiones las ventas se caen por completo."
bad,"always got lied to never told when I would know my scores terrible management  then got wrongfully fired"
bad,"I worked for MetLife. Had the worst Manager of my career who after two weeks still had not sat down and talked with me.  No goals, no key performance indicators, no clear understanding of expectations. They say they want outside expertise to help them, but when I tried I was told 'we don't want to offend out internal clients'. Basically they want change but are unwilling to try anything new. My Manager was a former bank teller or some such thing and all she cared about was how you dressed and arriving on time and leaving after 5:00. She liked having holding court with all her minions seated around her.  She had no business being a Manager.  When I left, I informed her and her boss, and gave my reasons.  Her boss, still wet behind the ears, never even bothered to learn more. And several people had already rotated out of this position previously.  So, the company may be fine and pay is pretty average, but the Management team there is a complete joke."
bad,"I think the company expects to much out of its adjusters, we are overwhelmed with claims so its impossible to be a good adjuster to customers.  lets face it  having a workload of over 50 claims a week , there is no way you will be able to give customers the truly one on one assistance that some of them need."
bad,The job was a little bit hectic and challenging but was enjoyable at first. Prospecting was challenging but enjoyable. I learned a lot about the insurance business working for MetLife.
bad,"Pessima,  não efetiava o pagamento em dia e o cliente viviam reclamando."
bad,Unsure if it were the manager or the position or the manager but there were no opportunities for advancement event though there were promises of advancement. They routinely over looked hard workers for advancement for friends.
bad,"Promotions are all political, based on who is known not who is qualified. Also, company puts on a great illusion of caring about their employees but they were laying entire departments off year by year to hire foreign associates overseas for lower wages. These new hires made lots of errors, causing those who were left double work and bad customer service but they never cared and continued to do it."
bad,the company is big but management is still terrible. the workload is not bad however you need to focus a lot dealing with your supervisors. and they always fight against each other
bad,"Childish, irresponsible management.  The whole environment is a popularity contest.  Treats people like criminals when you have completed your duties and your temporary position has run it's course.  Only positive is that they allowed as much overtime as you could possibly manage."
bad,the environment was client base orientated and it helped me in improving my bathopele principles which was the core of business in my day to day work.
bad,"This job does not compensate its employees very well.  I took the job out of need, I would not recommend anyone apply here."
bad,"Was under paid by my ""boss"". Enjoyed speaking with people on the phone and doing paper work. Organizing paperwork and policies"
bad,Enjoyed assisting the customers very much.  Job required a depth of knowledge on group plans and detailed policy inquiries.
bad,A great place to work with a firm that believes in work life balance. Many opportunities to grow and learn in the firm.  Great coworkers who partner with you.
bad,"Not particularly a fan of some of the work ethic styles. Really exploits the corporate environments ""bad name side."" Not a trustworthy atmosphere. No progression within the company."
bad,"Was given a death claim on a young woman with 2 kids and a grieving husband.  My ""mentor"" said, try to sell him our variable annuity."
bad,"Coming into this company as a new entry level hire, I was told that there would be training provided since my degree and background didn't particularly fit into the IT field. I was never provided the training I  was promised by the hiring team. So basically, I was thrown into a situation that made it difficult for me. I was just assigned the role of being a Lead on a huge project. Remember, I'm just entry level and the role required zero years of experience. Now I'm given a task that requires some project management skills. Excellent skill sets to have but I was never given the foundation to be successful. Kept asking my manager for the training I was promised but I was blown off consistently. Talked to HR and the lady was no help at all. I feel like it was a bait and switch situation for me.I have basically regressed. There are a lot of unhappy people at this location. I know this because no one is shy to tell you how their job sucks. Senior management keeps having these focus groups so they can hear people's concerns ( that should tell you something) but nothing is done to fix the problems. MetLife just moved into Raleigh and they are having big problems already. The whole domestic outsourcing makes your job difficult as well because the people feel like you're a threat. I have been talked down to and insulted in emails from my ""buddy"" who is suppose to transition her work over to me. I gave up some much to move to Raleigh and oh the recruitment process sucked as well. I'm basically kicking myself now for taking this job."
bad,Reputable insurance firm but pay is not great...Growth opportunity is nil...Get in..Get out..
bad,• Series 6 and 63 licensed
bad,The job is a nice place to work if you are in search of a career. The pay is really good and it has nice hours. I would recommend this job to others..
bad,"System issues, computer quality and poor marketing is why I am looking to relocate to a better Insurance company. "
bad,good company with horrible management choices. Leadership falls short and job is always changing. One thing is good the next day it no longer works. Hard to come into work looking forward to the day
bad,good place to work needs better management . it pays good and you get to watch games for free qho ever that is playimg at the moment and u also get free food
bad,"MetLife as whole is great however, LTC department needs help. People are unhappy there. Their not enough people in that department  to handle the high volume of cases. Management act like they don’t care. It’s suck because this company offers a lot of perks but that department make you not want to work there."
bad,Metlife is still growing here in charlotte and providing many new job every day.
bad,It's a commission only based do it was to straining for to handle as I couldn't afford myself alone not adding my expenses. Istead it was costing me out of my own pocket.
bad,"Le falta, capacitar a los vendedores ya que el único interés es vender por los contactos que traen los nuevos ejecutivos, sin darle las herramientas necesarias para poder vender ellos solos. "
bad,met life alico work style is so good.it is a multi national company in the world.Many more things learn from met life.best company in the uae.i like it working style
good,"Lamentablemente mi experiencia fue mu mala.No hay vida personal, ya que todo es la venta y el número a fin de mes. No existe buen clima y te tratan como un objeto solamente que vende."
good,"Staff work well as a team to get the job done. I learnt a lot about employee benefits in the time I worked there."
good,"Culture is not one of respect, alignment or teamwork as advertised."
good,"It was a temp job with Adecco temp service.Didn't really care for it, I like being out there with the public because of my people person skills."
good,"Si bien entre a la empresa al inicio de operaciones, eso no debió haber sido un pretexto para no tener un equipo de líderes con la capacitación necesaria para arrancar un proyecto de esa magnitud. Lo anterior hacía que el trabajo fuera altamente estresante, con jornadas laborales de más de 12 horas diarias y sin una línea de acción clara."
good,"Submission reports from 12pm, 14:00, 16:00 and 16:30. It was difficult cause we had to do presentation and do cold calling. The Commission was difficult to understand."
good,The pay is good because the overtime is endless. Managers and supervisors are Demi-Gods.  Promotion and advancement are far fetched ideas . The company actual states to advance your supervisors must like you ;you must go to company outing; On top of overtime. Paid time off is heavily weighted against  company’s need which again overtime is always needed. You’re force to put time off request in October only to be told it can’t be grant in Junein oct
good,"Hours are not great. Schedule changes,  so don't expect to eat with your family."
good,"No chance for advancement as a virtual( work at home) agent since moving to Las Vegas in 2008. I need a team environment where I can collaborate ideas, thoughts & opinions with others."
good,"Management is lacking, poor culture environment for work.  People are often overworked because of lack of quality talent.  Management doesn't know how to manage."
good,stock company had tough time in the 2008 and never recovered not a good place to work people were good management bad.  work was ok but unorganized end of summary
good,It was a little too layed back for me. Very bored a lot of days but I did learn a lot of computer programs through training programs and I also enjoyed the people just not fast paced enough for me.
good,"Management expects employees to work fine and project / present same data for different audiences and in different formats "
good,"do not expect to go into this job and get any training and make it on your own. Major Functions:   Provide families and business owners with assistance in building their financial freedom and provide a resource of information with my personal and professional experience; Presentation and processing of illustrations of the following products-Life insurance, annuities, long term care, mutual funds, Roth IRA’s, mortgage protection, disability, educational funding, pension transfers; Provide LEAP processing plans to help my clients organize and coordinate their money into a financial model that is easy to understand and follow using a comprehensive and holistic approach; create and implement personal marketing plans; schedule appointments; Meet clients at their homes; keep a client data system; create client files; process mass bulk mailings monthly; create business plans; design quarterly sales presentations and present ideas at sales builder meetings; email mass electronic newsletters monthly; build client relationships and contact history; Collect premiums and process applications."
good,The hardest part of the job was that there was no salary.  The job was 100% commission.  The sporadic paychecks did not allow for budgeting expenses.  You had to continue to prospect to maximize compensation each year.
good,"The culture can be reworked on. Approaches like People before numbers, engagement, skip levels, training and other processes can be set in. Managers should be trained well to manage their teams better."
good,Micromanagement is out of control. Office environment is unpleasant. Nurses who have worked there for years are nice when you start and then are rude and not helpful. Management is not supportive of your success and wanting to further your career within the company. They are not focused on work/life balance making it very difficult for people with kids. Your work is not valued and you are treated like you are easily replaceable. You can find the same job at another company for way more money and better work environment. Spare yourself the time and look elsewhere!!
good,I was very ill and in the hospital for a week and wasnt able to work. I was let go due to missing work and not being able to come in because I was hospitalized
good,I have worked at many different and diverse positions at MetLife. Most recently I managed operations in Tampa Florida. The company offers many opportunities - now transitioning to North Carolina and Tampa.
good,"low pay, over worked and under paid, management was a joke, they were all under qualified and did not respect employees, Never promoted employees and too much micromangement"
good,"co workers were nice people"
good,Maybe if they got someone who could run a company properly then this place could be turned around. There is lack of ownership when something goes wrong and management does not want to own up to their mistakes.
good,"Reviewing emails, getting the pipeline reports daily to my CFO.  Also the daily ledgers to the 158 lines of business he oversaw as well as the monthly reporting to the board members."
good,"I wanted to work for this company for other job opportunities."
good,I have been working in this compant for more than 15 years. I have learnt alot have an experirnce of finanace and all kids of payments.
good,"long work day"
good,"nothing was like it was said to be, alot of broken promise....no advancement, increased layoffs"
good,"typical day is a normal day year around with no out of ordinary moments its an all work environment. Co-workers are fun individuals and hard working. I have learned to co-exist with different personalities and deal with constant changes in a work place. Not much to comment on regarding management as there is no close relations other than weekly/monthly update email. The hardest part of the job is working with a lot of different departments that sometimes have no other means of contact other than email and systems. I enjoy delivering one stop service to clients, client appreciate it when they speak to one person only and all their needs are met."
good,"Empresa de seguros con contrato mercantil. Nadie se metia en el tu trabajo, pero nadie te ayudaba a nada. Deje la empresa porque era una perdida de tiempo."
good,Typical day involved reviewing files that had been audited by auditors. As needed would assist new auditors in learning policies set forth by Metlife.
good,"Metlife is a good company to start and gain some experience. Unless you’re a white male, it’ll be very hard moving up within the company. Diversity is only reflected at the lower level positions."
good,Typical workday is busy and procedures constantly changing.  Management is the worse because not very supportive and shows favoritism to certain ethnic backgrounds.
good,"Working as a rep in the annuities department is extremely tough.  I will try to break it down in an informative manner."
good,"Great place to work if they had Good Management and were able to accept changes and flaws, should be able to welcome new ideas even from peers not only top management, since the staff is on the field  and under stand the situation much better than sitting in the office."
good,"I was working from 2015 to 2017. my job responsibilities are:"
good,"Stressful work environment, long hours, and unsupportive management.  There is so much work to do the work, you are busy all the time, so the work day goes by quickly."
good,MetLife is a decent company.  They have really nice facilities and the people who work there are very nice. I have enjoyed working with everyone who is there.
good,"Metlife is a very challenging, demanding, and stressful. Work life balance is  very low on importance, Scheduling is not reasonable for a person with a family or single parent, I'm just saying"
good,"MetLife is a good place to work and stable but not much room for career movement. Some teams have different expectations that others, and this make competition hard."
good,I was earning with commission only and if you don't find client you won't be able to get money I wanted a fixed salary. That's the reason I went to traffic
good,Just a place you work make a little to barely survive due to sales matrix being hard almost impossible to meet. Only 30 mins lunch two 15 min breaks. Very stressful for what you make. I can't make ends meet. If you do well the sales matrix for bonus changes to make harder to make bonuses. VERY STRESSFUL PLACE   It's hard for a reason ;so MetLife doesn't have to pay you commission. Benefits are good as far as health ins. And 401k.
good,In the beginning MetLife was a great place to work and management was there to support you and guide you to grow in the company.  As the years progressed management seemed not to care about their employees.
good,"Aprendí a escuchar."
good,"It was a numbers game from start to finish, the CEO is a bean counter and does not seem to care about employees unless you tally into the desired category."
good,"Worked there for many years, but recent changes are making adverse effects to the business. "
good,"Very stressful you are told you will do one job and it changes one day you might work with the account you were hired for other days you have to deal with multiple accounts and they all have different policies very demanding claimants, employers and Metlife"
good,i learned a lot when i come with clients.i make them understand and why is important to take up the product iam selling to them and the hardest part of my jobe it when iam doing a follow up to my cilents to make payments
good,"Lack of training poor management, technology is antiquated and poorly maintained. Multiple opportunities for advancement but the negatives out weigh the positives."
good,"Demasiado supervision por parte de la gerencia de ventas."
good,"*On the field"
good,"The call center environment was high pressure, little training, lack of support and you must be on time, more then 4 minutes late counts as an absence, causing overall high turnover."
good,"lots of on the phone work, computer work, helping customers via telephone."
good,"The difficult part of this insustry is,rejections are very high."
good,Manage Global Infrastructure Production Management Team. My Team ensures that enterprise & vendor infrastructure changes adhere to Metlife standards & do not impact the business units.
good,Management is not the best and work life balance is the worst. In phone job is a challenge so the strikness for break etc I am not nor ever will I get use to.  Call center is not for me however it is what I am doing until something in my field comes along
good,"MetLife could be an awesome place to work if they hired enough people to handle the massive caseload. High caseload right out of training is very discouraging and some UL's are poor managers. If they distributed the workload evenly, they would have less turnover and happieremployees."
good,My job at MetLife was a virtual based job from home. I think for myself personally I would rather be in a brick and mortar job. In my virtual position there was a lot of miscommunication.
good,The most challenging part about working for the department I was working in was that they didn't have defined roles for people.  Some of the associates I worked with who were problematic were allowed to continue their problematic behaviors.
good,"Mi experiencia en Metlife fue aprender mas sobre este rubro, es dificil poder autogestionar el trabajo cuando es uno mismo quien debe realizar el listado de candidatos posibles para una compra de un producto intangible."
good,MetLife is your company if you believe in the supervisor cracking the whip and constantly monitoring your every move. Plus side they do offer a lot of PTO and their benefits are decent.
good,"Typical at work. okay most of the time"
good,"I loved my entire tenure at MetLife, until we were acquired by MassMutual. The transition was challenging and leadership was not overly welcoming - they wanted the advisors, not those of us who supported them, although it's business - and we move on."
good,"I worked closely with a team of advisors. My head suporvisor really looked out for me. Whenever an issue would arise I was able to speak freely and communicate what the issues were and we would execute them together, as a team. The only reason I left this job was because he relocated and moved to an office in Florida. Sometimes I miss working with him."
good,typical call center environment. take as many call as you can and sell as many policies as you can. majority of lower lever supervisors are great to work with. the further up the chain the less they seem to care about the employees and only about the bottom dollar or some other metric.
good,"The job allowed me to make a difference in others lives. The company did training , With this position it was straight commission. With me being single it was a tough way to make enough income."
good,"Cary Campus is awesome, work life balance is horrible. Management is okay. Job security is low. Many networking opportunities available. Plenty of learning opportunities."
good,"If you get put on second shift because you're new, once you improve and become a strong employee, there's no hope for getting normal hours. No shift differential."
good,"Buen equipo de trabajo."
good,La communication c'est zero et le mangement change tout le temps. Les projets et objetifs sont tout le temps revu même en cours. dur d'evoluer car les formations sont mal faite.
good,MetLife is eliminating all employee sales positions all across the US. This is very sad as some people have been terminated just shy of their retirement.
good,Falta de apoyo de los gerentes y mala administración del personal.
good,"Was good of as company, just the changes with Lean and such made the atmosphere very different to more of a stressful work style"
good,"Great Co-workers, Production environment, Lack of Opportunity for Advancement, awesome benefits. Great place to build your career network."
good,"Great company , but not for everyone. Work life balance is very difficult. Have to put in extra hours everyday and the weekends to keep up."
good,I worked in a fast paced call center for Group Life Products.  I worked on about 30 different applications and answered calls regarding Life Insurance products & services. I also filed death claims and researched customer questions and concerns regarding Life insurance policies.
good,"Training in regional office was to take place within the first month of being employed. It did not happen at all within the first 90 days. I was sent on first client call alone and without any training."
good,"Good solid company , however management very fractured.  Inability to set goals and accept employee recommendations to make environment better.  Always preach that employees are vital however when executing strategy probably least important aspect.  Company needs to walk the talk and develop a strong core."
good,"hardest part of the job is getting clients and keeping your clients,co workers are great and friendly."
good,My typical day at Metlife was to code agents and broker dealers so they can receive commissons.
good,"•	Dealing with Three types of Policies (TERM, TRADITIONAL and VARIABLE) which are basically run on U.S. is trained by State site client."
good,Especially if you are thinking about being a career agent in MetLife Auto and Home.  The system is broken and they are looking to phase this distribution system out.  Don't get caught in the downward spiral.
good,no room for advancement. no management to go to if issue with immediate supervisor becausde they are social outside work and dont believe there is an issue
good,"I have been here almost 1 yr and am in a different job function They only hire temps, no permanent staffing"
good,"Computer desk work  By Phone and Email"
good,"The company is offering intermediary and advisory services to client. I learned to market and sell products. I loved meeting new people and maintaining relationships with clients that I offered my services to. The client that I offered service to, still require my services and it is easy to still offer them because of the structure of the company. The company required more planning and it was target driven.  "
good,good place to work for the self starter. Make your own schedule and set your own hours. Work when you want to.
good,".The compensation is non competitive in the industry, even as a commission based job. They did give some support when it comes to getting clients. The philosophy taught to their advisors was outdated and not always in the clients best interest. Their product line was also not as good to many other life and annuity companies out there."
good,I was able to sell Insurance and do things that I thought I couldn't do. You can really excel here at Metlife.
good,"Very large company with a lot of different departments, so culture depends on where and who you work with - some better than others.  Good benefits.  Opportunities for professional growth, and advancement if you are willing to relocate."
good,Leadership has allot of problems. internal fighting and lack of following a central directions. lots of leadership going in different direction since they can fund it.
good,Great brand to be associated with. Leading in the insurance industry. Strong presence in the marketplace. The best part was the team culture and team spirit.
good,Compensation is reasonable but advancement is nearly impossible and layoffs are prevalent.  They are severely understaffed and refuse to prevent issues when warned ahead of time.
good,"Organization still follows old work ethics and mind sets, avoid internal growth and improving work-life value. Employees pretend to be working while there is no work to be done."
good,"Nurse Consultants review medical information and participate in the interpretation of any disease processes on the ability to work (disability review NC). On boarding & training is variable depending on your Unit Manager, and can be disorganized & minimal at times, or else very micro-managed & severe.  There was no set regimen for on-boarding new staff. Turnover is pretty quick, with the average Nurse Consultant lasting approximately 1-1.5 years. These are the hardest parts of the job: the business culture vs the medical culture-- it is a BUSINESS.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to tele-commute part time, and the flexibility of the schedule."
good,"un día típico; el asesoramiento "
good,"Falta um pouco de experiencia gerencial das equipes."
good,Favoritism was a big factor here.  If you weren't the favorite you didn't get considered for promotions. Only concerned about metrics and production you were just a number in a seat.
good,"Very micromanged, employees all struggle for survival.  Definitely a sweatshop mentality.  Managemt style was quantity not quality causing a lot of issues for customers."
good,Some good people work there .  Very nice building. It has a gym and a nice outside area. There was some overtime requirement when I was working so you did do about 4 to 5 hours per week more.
good,The work place was clean but it was very loud. It was a call center but still noisy to where you could not hear. I left because of the over all management. We were not paid in a timely fashion and when you switched from a temp to full time your pay was delayed 2 weeks.
good,"It's really hard to get things done in this company.  Broken processes, if they exist, too many silos and hand-offs, that fail due to lack of accountability, too many layers of management.  Employees are not empowered, and the environment is too sensitive!  So much time is spent on faux optics and no one wants to tell senior leaders that the place emperor has no clothes.  This company will not/cannot improve if leaders don't take a honest look at what's wrong and commit to making things right."
good,"Their systems and processes are outdated compared to other insurance companies, with rates through the roof that are discriminatory. There are never ending issues and irate customers. They offer great incentives and pay because the job is incredibly stressful and no one would stay otherwise. Your schedule fluctuates with the business need and how good your numbers are every 6 months, so if you aren't tenured and you aren't performing at the top, you will get a schedule that leaves no work life balance. You have to be able to take constant constructive criticism. Supervisors are overloaded with work and it really shows."
good,Enjoyed working for the sales reps. Did not have much association with upper management. MetLife has good products for every individual at an affordable price.
good,Management is far more concerned with exceeding metrics than maintaining strong custom relationships.  I learned a lot about corporate America and myself.
good,"Flexible work environment but ever changing management structure, little training and full commission.  Culture very individual in nature.  Benefits were ok. Pay was variable."
good,"Overall Good Company, But job security at risk due to constant budget cuts. CEO has changed to much, Most executives on top structure has resigned. Restructuring to frequently. Give the sense that management don't know what they need to do."
good,can be stressful but overall a decent company to work for. Culture could use some improvement but for the industry its not bad.   Management promotes who they like not always the most talented
good,"An average life insurance company with below average management at all levels.  Advancement often on the ""buddy system"" instead of on talent or work ethic."
good,"Virtual Agent - Works from home, but onboarding was a trial by fire as there's been very little input from management aside from having another agents attempting to ""Mentor"" while keeping up with their own very aggressive sales metric"
good,A retirement product for teachers in public and parochial schools. I would go to a different school each day to introduce and educate teachers and staff of the benefits of contributing to a retirement acct. that would be available when they retired
good,"No support from management, upset customers and extreme stress with low pay. Typical day is receiving 60-80 calls from upset customers, systems constantly crashing and no support from management with constant request for overtime."
good,"Very difficult to receive positive direction. However, I did have great coworkers. I just did not receive the positive direction that I feel new hires should receive"
good,"The job it self is very rewarding, helping Customers understand there product and how Claims are processed. The stress of the work place, can get overwhelming. Example: Keeping with the high demand of the stats, and a lot of them we have no control over, but are accountable. Example: If Customer don't take the survey after the call, goes against us. If we are explaining the whole benefit service and the call is long, goes against us. The demand is First and Done but calls can be long, when researching why a claim is denied, for every think is in code, and not just written in short sentence so it is understandable or nothing is there at all."
good,The dept. I worked for was extremely metrics based. Year end reviews included your metric stats and determined your advancement in company regardless of in-accuracy of metrics
good,"Like any org. job quality and satisfaction is linked to direct leadership. This org. struggles with some leaders. Overall, solid organization with growth potential if in the right area."
good,Very clique oriented job. Surpiisingly for a huge organization. Unorganized and over demanding. Suggstions for improving technology not moved on fast enough. The management lies ot customers on deliverables
good,MetLife has good benefits.  The hours expected to work are voluminous.  Most positions are not offered extended training that would enhance further employee development.
good,"We were hired as First Notice of Death intake for the call center.  We were first trained as Call center workers that would take calls from beneficiaries inquiring of payout, etc.  "
good,Hay diferentes áreas en un mismo sitio todo es tranquilo generalmente.
good,As an agent it was impossible to move inside the company when they want to keep you at the entry level making money for the company. The compensation plans get worse all the time taking money from their agents.
good,"I liked working there but people of Newcastle seemed to have negative feelings about the company and did not want to associate with it, When you arrange to do presentations you ended up focussing on solving problems created by other people"
good,Our department is given a heavy workload with promises of moving up to the next level but those promises are not kept.  They hire people off the street with no insurance experience in a higher pay grade.  The morale there is low also.  They expect us to bend over backwards for them but it does not show in our paychecks.  I would not recommend working for MetLife at all.
good,Lot of exposure and learning. Flexible working hours. trainings given to all. options of doing over time..Enhances more knowledge in the required fields.
good,Just like any other call center. Very call driven the more calls the better. the scheduling is not ideal if you have a family to tend to. One good thing is there is no weekend shift.
good,"the job can be very stressful at times , this kind of work  is not for everyone . they watch your every move . the breaks are short  long days , a lot of setting and mainly on the phones all day ."
good,"el día típico depende si es cierre o no. Los días que no son de cierre, es un ambiente agradable, relajado. Días de cierre es otra cosa, todos corren, gritan, gruñen... caos total "
good,"MetLife is a typical insurance sales company. They are not evil or horrible, but all the negatives that go along with the insurance industry are right there, present and accounted for. "
good,"The hardest part is overcoming the 2% wind and hail requirement along with the two rate increases taken on auto & home."
good,Some managers/supervisors need to be trained to manage people. Production driven. Lots of fun co-workers. Learned a lot about people and products.
good,"The company as a whole has undeniable rating in the industry. "
good,Challenging blending the old culture with the new culture. On the job training is hectic and not organized.
good,Hours in some departments are not very flexible.  General atmosphere is not great. All cubicles.
good,"MetLife micromanages, and changes the ""claims process"" very frequently.  I learned a great deal there and have met wonderful people, both peers and co-workers. Now, however, they require the clinical staff to teach medicine to the case managers, thus allowing them to make clinical decisions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the case managers make an intelligent short term disability decision on any given claim by explaining to them the intricacies of any particular procedure, or illness/disease process; and an expected outcome when the patient is out of work d/t the aforementioned illness, injury or disease."
good,"Administration/customer service"
good,"You were mostly on your own and called most of the shots.  However, with that said, there became a greater and greater level of needless paperwork to complete for management that became, over time, quite redundant. "
good,"Necessary access not granted to resolve issues, Meetings held about meetings to come. Very disjointed Security Organization.. critical positions being left unfilled that were causing many of the Compliance issues that I saw there and did not want to hire to fill open needed positions for political bickering reasons, and the Security Engineering Dept did not have a clear understanding of the critical role they played in this, and refused to own any of it...."
good,"Expect change every day. Remember that you can't help everyone that calls in to your call center. Learn as much as you can because everyone is busy and can't stop to help you. If you feel stressed about your job, know that those just above you are more stressed then you are. You will make more friends if you go out on smoke breaks, because all levels of employees are there and that is the only place they can complain."
good,Flexible work schedule
good,Very good company name in the Financial and Insurance industry which can open doors. Quality products are available thru the agency
good,"I always received a ""far exceeds rating"" fron my manager(s). Never any complaints from customers or coworkers. Hiwever I was not aware, once I received a promotion, they were attempting to get rid of me with one hand while praising me with the otgwr. Watch your back."
good,"prospeccion en frio y pago unicamenrte a comisiones y aprendes de ventas pero no tienes mucha retrubicion, par aun estudiante esta bien pero para alguien que ya egreso no"
good,"The company is not helpful when it comes to providing leads, assisting you with generating new business and closing them easily. The management doesn't care much about its employees, everyone is concerned about his self.The culture is a mix of many nationalities, the work place is toxic, you don't have any privacy and the employees have their nose in everything. the hardest part is handling the customers when portfolio becomes big, the system is not up to par with other companies. I know its a multinational company but in Dubai it needs a lot of work from management to infrastructure. They make tons of money from clients and businesses but they don't invest in their employees and technology. The time it takes them to do something is a lot. it can be a simple task but they complicate it and delay the matter. Their staff are not trained properly and given jobs like call center and receptionists which cause problems when businesses or clients try to deal with them. Even this is an insurance company they cheap out on giving its employees a proper medical insurance coverage and make the employees pay for a better one out of pocket, unless you a manager or director which are only few!"
good,"Not great!  Few, if any, chances to escape your own sandbox.  It was an eye-opener how regimented the IT organization was in this area..."
good,"El Centro de Servicios de MetLife Queretaro es una buena oportunidad para poder conocer otras culturas y formar parte del entorno Internacional. "
good,"wonderful, I loved my job. I loved working with the people and employees I serviced. I learned all about Short Term Disability Benefits, which has given me a great experience to move forward in my career."
good,I have enjoyed working at MetLife most of the people are pleasant to work with. and then you have those that look at you like you have 2 heads. I was very blessed to work with a wonderful UL and the people on my team ALL Are AWSOME!!
good,Metlife is very unpredictable.  What they write in their rules and brochure can be overriden with a complaint from one person and they whole program is switched up.  This cause alot of rework on the employee as well as manual work arounds.
good,Many people work there for 10+ years and are in same position and title for most of their time. Finance jobs spread out across U.S. Only way to advance is by moving to another state.
good,Current focus is to replace seasoned FTE with new hires at lower salaries at the expense of customer centricity. Off shoring work responsibilities is very common. Lack of the ability to monitor and confirm quality of work off shore.
good,Working for this company taught me how to build my confidence in making calls and initiating conversation on how to schedule appointments. I got to travel  to learn more perks about the company
good,The work hours are 8:00-8:00 CST plus working a Saturday’s & holidays. Every six months you get a new supervisor & they move your desk. Very disruptive along with a meeting everyday with your measured stats posted for the entire office to view. Big waste of time unless you’re chosen for the new process team.
good,"The supervisors at MetLife lack the type of communication that would be ideal for a professional office setting. Being talked down to, unsure of the job the associates are doing, etc."
good,"Benefits were great, but caseloads were too high for one person.  Goals set were impossible to achieve with the number of phone calls and claims.  Unreasonable expectations."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I worked with and the culture.  Hardest part of the job is balancing workload of both internal and external tasks amongst reorgs/realignments.
good,My time at Metlife was the most stressful situation I have ever bee willingly involved in. Giving my resignation was the best thing I could have ever done.
good,A lot of activities and at work outlets are provided for freindly competition with refresher training to keep employees updated with forthecoming changes.
good,Problemas en la administración de liderazgo. De resto OK
good,"This was a good place to work.  The reps were very knowledgeable and willing to help.  I liked all of the managers I worked with and still work with one of them to this day.  The only downside is they emphasized selling MetLife products too much, even though we had a general agency contract."
good,The amount of information an employee is expected to know is not equal to the pay grade. This was too much stress for not enough money. There is no collaboration with co-workers. The workplace was lonely. No one speaks to anyone else.
good,"Generally, not flexible with hours and poor pay and benefits. Difficulty walking in and handicap parking is not very accessible to the building. Performance metrics are very strict and cause stress."
good,"I was forced into a new role due to company reorg, However, I received no training at the new role due to ""budget issue"". Had to teach myself everything and at the end I was penalized for making minor mistakes simply b/c I followed instruction."
good,If you are OK with being tied down at a desk and being watched constantly then this is the job for you.  Pay is OK and there is some overtime but the majority of the managers are not good.
good,"sending out letters to clients, making phone calls to clients, data entry , filing. Hardest part of the job was not having two of my Executive  Marketing bosses at same location. most enjoyable was writing and sending out client birthday cards."
good,"Hard challenging, need to know your products, competions is hard, no basic salary, that's is difficult when you have a family to look after and childrens"
good,"The good thing about metlife is the work/Life balance is good. work pressure is less, though management is poor. Managers lack the basic managerial skills which stops the growth of employees after sometime. though it is excellent for freshers."
good,MetLife provides a very open and learning inclined work culture. It helps you groom for your role and makes you job market ready. Job progression is looked into seriously and helps you groom all around.
good,"call center to assure that the callers had all information needed to get their disability benefits., contact Doctors and Case workers to make make sure deadlines where met"
good,"Medical claims was a great job when I was newly graduated from college. It allowed flex time which was also great because I was a new mom. However, the company pulled out of Auburn, NY, and I found myself jobless after 7 years."
good,Co-workers are how you make it through the day.  Family commitment is why you stay.  Feels like the company is waiting for this site to retire out and then will force those remaining to relocate or lose their job.  Not the company it used to be.
good,"MetLife offers a great opportunity to grow and move up the ladder, however, you never know from one day to the next if you will be employed.  Management changes all the time, and they close offices  with no notice.  The pay is typically competitive and benefits are great."
good,A great company is great because of its employees.  The management at Metlife was very sneaky and abusive of their authority.  I hated to leave but HR is their for the company not employees.
good,"Call center setting. Sufficient training. Most impressed with the diversity of customers from all over the world."
good,"The work was fine; management was like Big Brother watching every thing you did and said.  Most people didn't make the cut.  Personally, I think that was their intent."
good,"It's not a bad place to work. It is going under seperation of retail business. Some changes are expected in near future. Hopefully, it will settle down soon."
good,I actually didn't mind the job at all. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the majority of the members I spoke to regularly. The issue at this job was that the management expected you to be able to work 24/7 and on call for $8/hr. They would work you 20 hours overtime if you didn't speak up.
good,"I was super excited to be part of what I thought was a great company with opportunities for growth and advancement."
good,"Typical day: Cold calls to make appointments. Meeting clients to analyse their life insurance needs. "
good,good paying job with bad management.long days full of standing in all types of climates.not likely to ever go back!
good,"It was very nice experince being Metlife,only on commission base work,No salary,very good office very good work atmospire,but job is very challenging."
good,"Company prefers sheep over wolves.  If you are happy following someones lead blindly, then this is the company for you.  Anyone who stirs the pot does not have a long shelf life."
good,"I never once met a supervisor"
good,"The homeowners insurance rates were very competitive in Central NC, however, the auto insurance rates were terrible. Lost many cases as the package policy with auto & home was terrible. I liked the company but was terribly misled by company who said they were very competitive with other insurance carriers."
good,If MetLife would take the time to get some management that is on fire and ready to do the work things would get better. We need individuals that know the jobs and are ready to put these fires out. No more yes men/women that just go along with the flow. The employees need advocats and also correction following bad practices. They need to get better with showing appreciaton and more coaching with career paths of the employees.
good,"At most times there was little direction provided by management.  The Operations Manager was excellent.  However, other management was rarely in contact with agents and when he was, it was not considered a welcoming visit."
good,"In my department, the did not provide adequate training. Benefits were excellent. Our department was short handed and needed additional hires to perform tasks effectively."
good,"A typical day is taking anywhere from 30-80 inbound phone calls from customers. Usually just assisting with anything from death claims, to enrolling in coverage to adding or updating coverage information. Every once in a while there would be a team meeting."
good,"Was a fairly easy job, fast paced which I like, co-workers were not the nicest though. Management was usually very nice. A typical day was very busy, lots of mail to sort though/fold and stuff into envelopes. They had lunches brought in every once in awhile which was nice."
good,"Go to the office get the news paper and work electric cut ins, no leads provided. All you sell is life insurance. No annuities, no 401k rollovers no SEPS no Health Insurance, no tax knowledge, it was a rough rod to hoe. Compensation was small, I made more as a Pepsi truck driver. What I learned was people in that culture could care less about insurance and they did not want to part with the money. The hardest part of the job was to convince people to buy as well as finding the prospects to buy."
good,A typical day at work is on the computer and phone following up on leads. What I learned was how the insurance and life insurance companies work. My supervisor was very professional and good at his job of sales. The hardest part of the job was the continuing phone call to convince people to schedule appointment to discuss there life and financial needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the professional office experience.
good,got to know about private company and it was nice to work there in terms of learning
good,"The local agency is a descent place, with good support staff especially from advanced markets and investment specialist.  New business processing is lacking talent.  From a compensation standpoint one would definately take home more from individual production with an independent b/d.  Since this is a large corporation compliance is heavily monitoring every email transaction."
good,Taking Variable calls from clients agents and transfer company doing fund reallocation and withdrawals and helping the customer with anything they need
good,This is a great company just not very understanding when it comes to problems in your personal life
good,"a typical day is sitting at a desk answering phones all day, i learned that you have to have patience when sitting for long periods of time. the management was nice and easy to get along with.  the co workers were great, the hardest part was going to the job and most enjoyable was leaving."
good,"New building, nice colleagues. Not as much as advancement as anyone thought. Current management doesn't emphasize employee development or growth. I'm usually under-utilized and bored."
good,"Every day is challenging."
good,"Great coworkers, Management is not the most appreciative of their workers."
good,"Worked in the mailroom, sorting and distributing mail, picked up mail at post office."
good,At Metlife is doesn't matter what you know it is who you know that will allow you to advance.
good,"IT Security auditing experience was very valuable.  MetLife did not reinvest back into employees - major changes, relocation and salary cuts"
good,"See above ratings."
good,MetLife had some decent training to begin a career in financial services.
good,"Work at the complete discretion of the undecided (potential) buyer.  Stay late to set appointments, meet at all hours of the day, any day of the week."
good,"As I work in Metlfealico, is a good company but as it is a Insurance company,There is no salary, only commision, So some times it become very difficult to survive."
good,This was an okay place to work.
good,Depending on the time of year and account that you service the workload is manageable but High levels of attrition lead to understaffing and overwhelming amounts of work.
good,"cumplir metas en ventas y retención de clientes, aprender nuevos productos y capacitacion en venta de intangibles"
good,It was an ok place to work.  Management was all about the dollar and not about the employee.  10 minute breaks are not enough and you are dinged if you go over on a call
good,as a associate claims adjuster you investigate auto claims to determine fault. Spend most of your day on the phone trying to contact people to get info about their claim. Didnt enjoy the amount of time spent on the phone.
good,"Lots of bulletin boards with charts and fun stuff, but does distract from the lack of organic direction by management. Recently split and numerous people laid off"
good,Met amazing people at MetLife and had rewarding work that I enjoyed. Fast paced environment.  Unfortunately IT funding mechanism where projects can be unfunded most of the year.  IT jobs can be insecure as being tied to this funding.  Many New Jersey jobs are moving to North Carolina.
good,Fast paced IT environment. Taking on new applications and work responsibilities was part of the excitement. Always learning something new. Daily responsibilities included taking calls from various groups regarding a wide array of issues.
good,Call center experience was no longer what I wanted to do as a career.  The company is a good place to work I just had the desire to work at a day care at the time and being attached to a headset was not what wanted to do.
good,MetLife provided me with the challenges and training needed to become an independent contributor and people manager at the same time.  I greatly value my time at MetLife to develop the skills needed to become an asset to future employers and team player for all coworkers.
good,So far I feel the company has its limitations and there is not much room to get a better salary and growth in the company. The culture is very closed to what the company has done for years instead of update to new things.
good,"MetLife Call Center does offer a good job with many growth opportunities but it is also provides much unnecessary stress and poor hours.  The workplace culture is very open, but due to a high turnover rate many employees are not welcoming to newcomers."
good,"No job security for Contracts, look out for other opportunities"
good,"A day at work is characterised by  professionalism, friendliness from colleagues and managers."
good,"Typical corporate environment. The job isn't bad overall, however, some supervisors go out there way, to make the job more difficult than it has to be. Upper management needs to do a better job of listening to all their employees, no matter how long they've worked there. Very click-ish in my department."
good,"Everything is always changing, Managment doesn’t care about work/life balance. People always coming in and out the door. Must meet productivity everyday"
good,"Training doesn't match the actual job once on the floor. Management is really nice in the beginning and slowly reveal themselves after training. Everything is very micromanaged regardless of how well you perform. The pay for Disability Service does not equal the role, and definitely underpaid for the stress alone."
good,"This was a relaxed place to work even if it was just a temp job. Managers where helpful, understanding, professional, and friendly."
good,This was a position that I worked for that was not presented accurately by the hiring manager. There was very little structure and the supervisor  had very little knowledge about the position I was in.
good,"The earning potential this inside sales position is heavily dependent on your assigned territory and the broker/GA relationships of your regional market account executive. The big metro areas tend to have the best territories and volume, and smaller metro's with less volume and earning potential. Changes in the role and responsibilities will be presented when the digital platform is rolled out."
good,"All good it just very far from my home location else good to join to imporve the communication or confidence........."
good,"Lamentablemente, no cumplieron con lo ofrecido como en la entrevista de trabajo. Indicaron que el trabajo no sería 100% de renta variable, finalmente, lo fue. La remuneración no era acorde al tipo de trabajo que realizaba versus mis pare que llevaban más tiempo."
good,"Difficult with work life balance"
good,Did not like being on the phone.  Supervisor knit picking about what you did or didn't say even though the customer was happy with the service.  Not enough advancement unless you were willing to get your insurance licence.
good,"typical day of work includes browsing different websites for hours, or being absolutely slammed."
good,The culture is OK but many difficulties.  Employees are very polite and work environment is good.  Too many cops hanging around the main lobby ... not safe
good,The career of a Financial Adviser requires complete dedication and long hours until you establish a client base.  Since the job is 100% commission it is hard to live when there is only one salary coming into the house.  Great job for kids fresh out of college and living at home.
good,I was joined the Metlife company in 2013 as a insurance manager.First month i had 10 customer..i feel great at that time.i received 40000 as a commission and 17000 as salary..
good,Commendable focus on community engagement and allowing employees time to volunteer. Facilities are top notch with areas for collaboration with teams across the globe.
good,"required to have an office 1 hour away from residence. Little to no training. Extremely small market for MetLife products. Promise of large commercial opportunity, come to find out they have little to no Commercial market."
good,"Work life balance is average, it is  tough to take time off you must keep up with tasks assigned if you out for a day or two. Making the workload difficult at times. Compensation and benefits are good. Advancement appears to be good, Management is not realistic with the volume of work and the training is scattered does not have a flow. The company does do a lot of  fun events that are enjoyable. However you need the time to participate."
good,"it was an enjoyable experience. there was a lot of change.The company did not have a good vision. The pay was not comparable to industry standards. However, the team of folks were very friendly."
good,They are amateurs when it comes to claim handling. Daily I defended this company knowing full well that the criticism levied by customers was valid and right on point.
good,The floor manager dictated who received raises and bonuses and those raises and bonuses tended to go to the people that were on her social list. It was too political of an environment.
good,La cultura y espíritu de la empresa cambió dramáticamente cuando se funcionó Interamericana con Mtlife.
good,"A company that gives you very less social life because of always night shifts."
good,"Metlife is undergoing a human resource change and with change comes resistance. There are the old guards, experienced and comfortable in their old ways and mostly detesting the new wave."
good,"The current culture in MetLife is Plug and Play. The management believes that they can pull people from one place and plug them to another place. Knowledge, experience and expertise are not valued."
good,I learned a lot in this role. I assisted with claims. Advised insureds and claimants of coverages. Processed payments at the direction of the claim adjuster.
good,"Busy and energetic environment , freedom to express yourself , great  intranet portal , work from home option , friendly colleagues and valuing manager"
good,"Slow to transform , unrecognized talent , no growth & development , high turnover , great marketing & social media presence , workplace culture is secretive"
good,Time alotted to get on board was not what we agreed upon from when I started to when my contract was cut.   I was replacing a very experienced manager and basically given one month to assume all her work without the experience that went with the engagement.
good,"very challenging work "
good,I enjoyed the position as there was a variety of duties I had to perform each day. I took employer calls in reference to employee dental coverage.  I also answered calls in reference to the marketing weekly/monthly commissions.
good,Position i worked for there was very little job advancement. Did not like the work culture. Overall position was not something i saw myself doing for a long time so i decided to leave and pursue another position with better benefits and better pay.
good,"Good, solid company to work for...usually.  Typically a lot of opportunity, especially at entry-level positions. However, increasing competition and MetLife's initiatives to reduce costs are creating a lot of uncertainty in recent years."
good,"Very compartmentalized company with a lot of duplication of work because departments are unwilling to share information with each other for fear of losing their work and being seen as unnecessary. This trend is only increased by the companies constant purging of employees as people scramble to ensure that their departments work not be shuffled off to another group."
good,"El promotor con el que trabaje, no le toma interes a su Equipo de trabajo."
good,"Although I learned about employer provided benefits.  You could tell that management was tired of their job.  They did provide a sufficient training on the important need-to-know details about the product.  Lord forbid that you need help.  My manager intentionally left me out of the daily update email chains.  Then would act like she didn't know what I was talking about when I would inquire about something that was passed on to me.  I eventually would have one of my team members forward me any of the emails that she received so that I could stay up to date with the changes.  "
good,"For the most part, unless you are an actuary or actuarial student, opportunities to move around and learn more about the business are very limited in the Group Insurance business."
good,"handling walk-in customers, processing their application and requests;"
good,"More of an informal job no office spaces sharing "
good,"This was a second job I took to earn money for my trip to my parents' home country of Poland.  Good compensation and flexible work schedule, would have continued working there except that they would not allow me the two weeks off I needed to take my trip."
good,"Good Company - helpful Life Department if you have questions on submissions. Enjoyed working with the group out of Freeport, Ill.  Devon was the best."
good,"Work life balance was not very good. Required to have work information on personal cell phones in order to log in at any time. Lack of proper training, some managers were hostile and not very helpful. Coworkers were always helpful & friendly. Enjoyed helping my customers, but the environment was difficult as a remote worker with little guidance from management. The culture was one of inclusion but was not seen by many."
good,"I was unimpressed with management's review process.  No matter what you brought to the plate the whole year and how many processes you improved to create efficiencies within your department, it all came down to money.  If they had $12,000 to disperse for bonuses between 2 people and they liked ""Mary"" better and wanted her to get a $9,000 bonus, you were getting $3,000 regardless of what you contributed or how much better you've made the department.  When you ask what you could have done to make it a better, the spin doctors take over and give you false hopes.  Pure favortism throughout their review process."
good,"MetLife may have refreshed values and a new employee value proposition, but the way it treats employees is far from what they extoll. Don't expect manager coaching. Spend all year working your butt off and then during a performance calibration, one ""manager"" has a comment about you that sways the table one way or the other for you. If you have another offer take it."
good,"They seem the change something in the way calls are routed and some months it is easier than other to make goal and get paid incentive. Managers are always changing things and when trying to hold you to what is being changed, instead of inspiring you to do it, they threaten you with things that could happen if you don't do it. Over all, it was awesome when I first started but over time became toxic."
good,It was a great experience to learn what not to do and what to leave out of my craft of selling many years after.  All they cared about was selling and transactional.  There was no effort in relationship building.
good,"Empresa com filosofia de trabalho da empresa mãe Norte Americana, no entanto os incentivos e as condições para o desempenho de uma atividade extremamente lucrativa não são os melhores para quem procura estabilidade e progressão na carreira. Demasiadas exigências diárias na actividade de angariação de novos clientes mas as compensações são escassas e tardam demasiadas vezes."
good,A Typical BPO with no relevant processes. Mostly data operating or data entry jobs. Mostly IC role jobs. Team Leading only at a very higher level. Lack of internal growth opportunities.
good,"Ambiente competitivo y condiciones poco confortables."
good,Good company and benefits.  Constant state of change at executive level drives unrealistic and non productive changes forced upon the long term employees that held the company together.
good,"Department I worked in was split between two locations and management always had favorites.  Company overall was good to work for, but managers need to stop treating employees like grade schoolers. Reward based upon work."
good,Provides a good work life balance; able to move to different positions pretty easily; ever changing culture so need to be able to adapt to change well
good,"I liked the job, I just wished it would've last longer. I wanted a permanent position but I was led to believe there were none available and found out later that there were. I was contacted for an interview and a couple days later was told the position had been filled. I thought that was a bit unprofessional to mislead me into thinking the position was available and contact me for an interview and then cancel the interview."
good,to me it was just a first job I didn't care about the benefits and the high earnings. I have learn so many things there and the experience I have now its enough to get me where I want to be
good,"The environment is totally based on stats and how well your numbers are at the end of the month.  everything is based on a matrix. Your adherence, Quality, attendance, work behavior, After call work and handle time."
good,"A typical day runs about 10-12 hours, supporting the international and domestic projection and planning applications. Additionally, I currently work as a Project Manager for enhancements and new Hyperion applications.  "
good,"even though we were in Sales, we were always encouraged to do only ethical sales no wrong selling, company is very customer focused and have good reward system to keep their employees motivated."
good,"Metlife has long been known as a great company for which to work.  Until it went public in the early 2000's, Met was a 'cradle-to-grave' company, where employees were highly valued and often spend many years at Met.  "
good,"I was there close to 9 years and worked my way up to ""c"" level area. very ""catty"" in some departments. Long hours, work inundated and not much time for balancing one's life.  If you want to make $$ then this company is where you can make it."
good,Great people and challenging work. The hardest part of the job is managing multiple priorities and executing on ambitious deadlines. Culture has significantly changed since the reorganization.
good,"A typical day at work involves cold calling people and trying to set appointments. To sell Insurance and annuities."
good,Being employed at Metropolitan Life Insurance from 2013-2015 was a good and humbling experience. This job helped me develop tons of interpersonal skills.
good,"As company wise is good however no benefits for office staff, they only give preference to sales staff. "
good,"Team leads and colleagues were motivational. Workplace and atmosphere is matched with US culture. Give the importance to the employes and take initiative for their problems. Gives lots of beneifts to the employe such as US leaves, family day and many more which engaged to the family as well as company to each other."
good,Metlife is like any other company. They are a business and will make decisions from a business standpoint. And they ten to pay less than other companies in the same industry.
good,Learnt so much about working on a commission based structure it was frustrating but very eye opening. i loved all the training that the company gave us
good,"Co workers were best part of job. For the most part, caring, dedicated and friendly individuals. Training of product knowledge questionable. And backing from management concerning many customer complaints and issue is fairly non existent. Overall, the company treats you well and offers some flexibility is scheduling. But trying to be dedicated, caring of customer needs is very difficult because of the lack of assistance from management involvement. CSR is limited in what they can do, and often need management assistance to resolve issues, and at the point it becomes very difficult."
good,Company is a typical Fortune 500 copmany where it has its positives and negatives.  Colleagues were great to work with.
good,"Company is constantly focused on change. I have been here almost 4 years and I have had 8 different managers. It is hard to get aqcuainted with a manager if they are constantly changing. the job itself is a good job, pay is decent and a lot of schedule flexibility."
good,"*Calls/appointments/solution presentation/close"
good,Great opportunities to learn. They offers you very good insurance courses.
good,"Recently Our office has closed, before that I really enjoyed my job"
good,"A day start with meeting and plan for day, after that start my prospective client for getting their appointment for financial planning."
good,"The company itself has great benefits and a laid back work environment. But much of the management is a joke. It is all about who you know, not what you know. Opportunities for advancement are hard when you aren't one of the bosses ""favorites"""
good,Pay and benefits are good. There is a lot of unprofessionalism. I expected a different atmosphere than what is there.
good,lots of over time but dept managers don't let their employees advance or post out.
good,"Typical day at work: There are never enough hours in a day to get what always needs to get done."
good,"MetLife was a great place to work when I began working there. Now it seems they want to pinch any penny they can and they are very stingy staffing our department in Southfield, MI. They expect us to wear too many hats and multi task. making  our jobs very  difficult to concentrate on. Management concentrates on the numbers and stats instead of excellent service and job quality. We are not given much room to grow. Most jobs have been outsourced or cut out completely."
good,It's very difficult to meet the time contraints on and after the calls.
good,"As i was working in direct marketing , this was my first experience to  manage a team of members .I learned a lot form there."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being the determinate of whether or not a person would be approved for disability benefits based on the review of all submitted medical information and if you could not approve their benefits, having to explain to them why they would not receive payment."
good,Worked on the first of the daily-valued 401K recordkeeping systems in the country.  Very valuable experience.
good,La promotoria donde me contrataron contaba con graves problemas de etica y valores que se tradujeron en conflictos laborales y productividad de su personal marcados. Complicada situacion para eficientar procesos.
good,1st job out of college
good,Everyday is different and can be interesting. I've learned to be more patient with people. Hardest part of the job is trying to calm an irate person down.
good,"In HR there is no typical work day, which is part of the reason I like it so much."
good,"Collect information on customer, ie. 4506, income verification, paystubs. prepare loan package to sent to mortgage loan processor."
good,"It was a good place to work for, if a manager didn't like you, you were targeted, as well as reaching a certain age, they will lay you off"
good,Hardest part of the job was the lack of formal training. Expectations are high but the internal support doesn't match up to what is expected.
good,a good company to work however upper management has no loyalty to employees
good,"The Cary GTO campus has lots of amenities, and cool features. It includes a gym, cafeteria with lots of different options, Starbucks, and ping pong tables across the entire campus"
good,I have worked in other Call Centers and this was a real step up. If your were willing to work hard and come to work all the time you would get a raise and a change to win games and prizes and a place to park your car for a month up front. There were free lunches at times and free online training classes if you wanted to move up in the company.
good,"Always after monthly target u work everyday of the week except  Sunday and there is no leave and not a fun environment there is no time to knock off, lunch is 30 minutes the salary is flactuating there is no basic salary"
good,Metlife is a good place to work but it’s very fast-paced and they do expect a lot from you! Unfortunately employees come and go on a continual basis and sometimes there’s not enough people to handle the jobs that are put forth.
good,It was a great stepping stone in the world of customer service and insurance. I LEARNED alot working there. I met a lot of nice people. Management was a little disorganized
good,Large company with good benefits. Ability to transfer within departments. I would have rated higher regarding job stability however my department was transferred to Tampa.
good,"The culture is very traditional and conservative. There is not a lot of room for growth in Investments and it was hard to find new opportunities even in my current role. The pay and vacation is great, but the culture really isn't flexible or collaborative."
good,I enjoyed working with the people I met at MetLife. The company's culture of acceptance and embracement of diversity was much appreciated. The training was more of a bait and switch experience. Telling you one thing and then when you are release out on the floor it becomes a different game.
good,Numbers driven and stressful environment. High case loads and unreasonable performance goals placed on employees. Management appears to be stressed out as well.
good,"Okay if you can handle office politics and a call center, the benefits are great and pay is good. the training for sales is a few weeks and then based on your overall grade your shift is chosen, I had a vacation while in training and it bumped me down even though management said it wouldn't so I ended up with a shift I didn't want nor deserved."
good,"MetLife was a typical executive assistant position that involved expense report management, travel, etc.  My manager was located in London for my final two  years with the company so I was required to work in a very independent environment, which I liked."
good,fast pace many calls dealing with customers people were nice to work with however the salary does not match the work you do company very understanding regarding personal maters
good,"I really enjoyed working at MetLife. I had worked 11 years full time and was let go when the office in Wooster OH closed.  In May, 1992 I returned to MetLife as a part time employee.  Having done this work for 11 years full time, I was not really happy with the part time position but I continued working at MetLife until November, 1999 when I was once again let go due to poor production in the Mansfield OH office.  That office also closed."
good,Decent experience. Great people. Poor leadership. Good benefits. High turnover. Good facility. Good cafeteria and food vendors. Slow onboarding process.
good,"Lost of Process with no documentation.  Team was fully sourced with external contractors American workers didn't have much clout in this particular organization. "
good,This is a very competitive performance focused work place.  There isn't a lot of room for growth once in the sales and service department.  The managers are overworked in some departments and can't dedicate enough time to their teams to help with recognition and performance reviews.
good,"Muy buen lugar de trabajo para personas con ganas de crecer rápido, te da seguridad y confianza en que todo lo puedes lograr. Solo que dan muy poco soporte a los asesores."
good,"A very fast paced environment, opportunities to move up. Management a little unprofessional. Absolutely nothing hard about the job, very self explanatory. There was no work life balance, as I lost my brother and dad in one week while studying and prepping for the license exam, I got fired as a result of not passing due to stress and grievance."
good,The Company was great to work for.  The management was not great at all.  Management would talk behind your back to other employees.  I was the worse experience I had in my career with management.
good,"I enjoyed the flexible hours, meaning I could structure my day to my advantage. Had a very supportive manager. Targets only challenge."
good,Responsible for sales to major corporations.  management was supportive and helpful. This was accomplished by broker networks and direct prospecting.  Your compensation was based on sales so my pay was very good.
good,It was a good job. Busy fast paced place to work. Management was wonderful. I was sad to leave there. I had real satisfaction in assisting in a small way to borrowers buying their homes.
good,es una empresa que facilita un seguro de vida para diferentes rubros
good,"Workers were under appreciated. Management was poor at its best. You had to watch your back at all times. Management would steal your ideas, and take credit away from you when your ideas were successful."
good,"Flexible work environment, good work/home balance.  Room to grow and advance.  The company is currently undergoing many changes.  Casual work environment."
good,"If you are looking for a innovative environment, don't go to an insurance company.  In the grand scheme of big companies, this was an average experience.  "
good,I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from having two different jobs within MetLife and spent roughly the same amount of time in Annuity Services and as a Short Term Disability Case Manager.  I learned a great deal specifically with customer service and how to manage difficult situations.  Unfortunately the customer we serviced chose to go in a different direction causing my job to be eliminated.
good,"A typically day consisted of arriving earlier that my schedule, returning multiple call request voice mail and tempted to research caller's concerns and calling them back."
good,"Disappointed on how things were handled."
good,"The company has been undergoing many changes in the last several years so there is a lot of uncertainty and job insecurity, especially given several moves within the company"
good,"One thing is consistent: change. Team members were usually what got you through the day, week, month, etc. They tell people they want their opinions, ideas, etc. but it falls on deaf ears. If you do suggest an improvement, no credit is directly given to you."
good,"Great compensation but high stress and very long hours. You will definitely work a lot of weekends and the work life balance is non existing."
good,Great work life balance company. Great co/workers. Company is only concerned about profits. Is not diversified. Little or no minority's in management.
good,"Great colleagues    "
good,Es una oficina de seguros de vida y se mantiene a base de ventas de los agentes. Yo trabajo de administrativo y atiendo a las personas y el teléfono aparte de manejar distintos programas para hacer tramites
good,"Its an company that is striving for the best. There operations side of the business is very annoying at times. But, they strive to put customers first"
good,"MetLife is a great place overall with great work life balance. Most people work more than one day at home per week."
good,"Good company to work only disappointed thing is no salary on time ."
good,II learned the selling skills in this organisation about insurance product. And maintained a healthy relationship with our management.  While i worked and experienced typical sales experience.
good,"Company is not to organized, training materials are not put together as well as they could be. They continually mess up on your pay. They have a lot more growing to do."
good,"Though its an international company, like most insurance agency companies operating in UAE they force you to sign two sets of contract, one set to fulfill the UAE laws and another the actual set which states you work solely on commission and not entitled to any salary or end of service benefits."
good,"I love my job and feel as thought I make a difference in each customer I speak with.  As a whole, in my sixteen years with MetLife I have been given various opportunities which has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about the insurance industry.  A big Pro for MetLife is it's work/life balance."
good,Grato ambiente laboral pero sin proyecciones profesionales.
good,"MetLife was a growing experience with excellent co-workers. I enjoyed working with the many different teams I had the opportunity to work with, allowing me to learn more about different departments and job functions. As a whole it das a great experience and company to work for."
good,Full of politics going on there....3rd class management.....Most of the finance process are irrelevant like copy and paste job...Even a 3rd standard kid can perform those activities
good,I was the primary contact for  for large corporate accounts . I monitored the electronic billing process and troubleshooted issues for payroll deductions on policy holders insurance benefits through there employers. I worked closely with the group customer on all questions and concerns for the auto and home voluntary product . on worked in a very high pressure position and was the facilitator for all internal departments assigned to the account.
good,"Very difficult to make a living on 100% commission. I did however, learn a lot about investments and how different asset classes were advantageous for different prospects depending on their investing goals."
good,"Good company to work for depending on the department.  In my particular department, management communication had room for improvement but the overall work experience there was very good."
good,"I enjoyed working for my boss about aa much as any boss I have worked for.  The work was QA and was pretty boring.  However I am thankful for the experience I had there,"
good,Great work culture.  Part time Technical Assistant employee has little chance of becoming full time.  Most employee's leave to work for other big companies to get a full time position.  Management encourages growth but seems to hire only existing full time Metlife employees for new positions and rarely draw from part time talent.  Great place to work for part time parents or semi retired who will never need a full time job or benefits.
good,Communication is so secretive at Metlife. And the quality of employees that have been hired of recent is lacking. Thus quality suffers and middle management has their hands tied.
good,"The culture and technology stack were both in disarray."
good,"As above, worked here for 2 years in my previous career gaining invaluable skills in organisation and team work which have served me well in my future endeavours."
good,"In charge of several areas, assisted management with training, and also was available to answer incoming phone calls from customers. Management also tried to be involved and know everything that was going on. Everyone was in charge of their own areas, but worked together as a team as well."
good,Work life balance is a struggle in the National Accounts department.  Management is very REACTIVE instead of PROACTIVE.
good,"MetLife has been a great company to work for and I've learned a lot thus far about financial services industry and the importance of benefits in everyone's lives.  Speaking of benefits, they are great - very happy with what we have and it's hard to find similar elsewhere.  From a culture perspective, there is a big gap that keeps growing between the ""haves"" vs. the ""have nots"":  if you're an officer, you are set for life, but if you're one of the worker bees, you're working your heart out and not always getting credit / recognition / compensation you deserve.  There's lots of talk about getting compensation parity to the market but that's not being executed well in practice.  Also concerns about strategy and way forward - insurance is not a nimble industry by nature and there is growing fear that an older, established company won't innovate fast enough.  Right job, right group - it's a great place to work.  ""Buyer beware"" with your actual manager - some are great and some are not."
good,"Beginning as a temporary employee in Disability Claims is the way I started.  I was then promoted to Disability Liaison working with 10 representatives.  This is where I was able to interview individuals who were seeking disability insurance."
good,I would take customer calls through entire shift. The calls would range from paying premiums to changing insurance plan. I learned how a lot about the insurance business. Management would do a team huddle once a week and we would have a team meeting once a month. Coaching reviews were performed once a month as well. Co-workers were very friendly and willing to help if needed. The hardest part of the job was increasing a customer's rates and keeping them happy. The best part of the job was saving customers money on premiums by helping them understand plans better.
good,my work is challenging everyday as it is different enquiries and different challenges everyday it is exciting and i feel fullfilled by assisting clients with various needs
good,Great company but has layoffs. If you can find a position that will not get bought off or closed down. Stay with the company.
good,"Daily work experience is very good because when i work of out door sales i really enjoy my work to meet new peoples, every day i learned new experiences from the market e.g How to deals the peoples with different natures.Hardworking is not enough to do this sort of job smart working is also required. "
good,"MetLife is a huge company but for many years they stood still and are now trying to catch up. "
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for. They have excellent benefits, but they do not allow you to use your accured PTO time. They only allow 2 people off a day, and we have over 40 people in our department."
good,Had a wonderful experience working with this well recognized company into Life insurance industry. Provides you a good work life.
good,This job isn't for everyone.  It is fast paced and you need to be a good salesperson to be successful.  Good learning experience.
good,Management was open to new ways of doing the job better.  Open to new ideas.  You stayed busy all day and there was some overtime.  The co-workers were always willing to help.
good,"Aún cuando Metlife es una empresa multinacional, hasta ahora se está definiendo el gobierno de TI, perdiendo así sinergias y oportunidades de mejora y la definición de un modelo a Nivel Global."
good,"my typical day at work, is busy. Target needs to be made and the calls is very hectic. I learned everyday of the different cultures we have in life and how to treat people. My co- workers is making my day and we can work together as a team. We always reach our targets. Management is around to assist but you also have to make your own decitions as well. My enjoyable time is going home to see my boy, he is the light of my life."
good,MetLife can be a great company to work for.  I learned a great deal and was able to continue my education.
good,Good co-workers that were motivated by providing customer service.
good,"one of my agent he came to my home around 5am with a file. "
good,"Project Management"
good,coordinated all closings and learned a lot about home loans and the process of them.
good,"culture is status quo, discovering mistakes is shun upon and not looked at as an opportunity to improve"
good,"Pros: Great work/life balance"
good,This is a good company in regards to benefits and Salary.The People that work here are great. However there is no room for advancements even though you work hard here for years you seem not to get anywhere
good,"Company is in constant state of flux in recent years.  While change is expected, the direction needed to execute is lacking in recent years.  Also, I have been working on senior level accounts for several years yet have seen no opportunity for advavncement."
good,"It was a nice place to work years ago but time passes and companies change.  MetLife has certainly changed and no one expects a free lunch, but actually in the old days they provided one.  It was great company to grow up in, but that company is long gone. "
good,At Metropolitan we as consultants are able to manage our own time as alot of the work was field based. As a result consultants tend to be working on their own individual clients and therefore determine their own work schedule. I learned alot about the Financial Services Industry and this remains an industry I still find fascinating. The management is very target driven. The hardest part of the job is the instability caused by the commission payment basis. The most enjoyable was providing financial solutions for the people of South Africa.
good,"Speaking with the callers throughout the day was something I enjoyed doing. Helping out the callers who were not receiving any sort of benefits, due them either being diagnosed with cancer to having a broken leg. So I was there to help callers get their claim info needed to get their claims approved. Providing them with excellent service. While working at Metlife I was chosen by management to become an Adjunct Trainer for not only new hire but for management as well. I assisted in Co-Facilitating classes with other trainers. I also enjoyed assisting new hires and job coaching, and call monitoring for quality assurance. The co-workers were a close knit group of people and we still are to this day."
good,Great at the beginning till you start to see the flaws of their systems.
good,Coordinating of tasks to ensure speed to market with products while staying within the outlined annual budget
good,Co-workers were nice to work with and would help with a problem if they were too busy with their own work.
good,"Tranquilo si ya tienes cumplido tu objetivo, aprendi a respetar y recoinocer a mis compañeros, la direccion distante y me parece absoleta, desinteresada de sus empleados., La gerencia dinamica. La parte mas dificil ,cuando esta por cerrarse el periodo para cumplir tus metas y aun te hace falta para llegar a ellas, lo que mas me gusta es la confianza que te da el gerente si eres cumplidor de tus metas y te da a ti el desafio para llegar a ellas"
good,A typical day at work consists of sitting at a desk taking calls from customers and working off of a computer. I have learned to be more comfortable speaking directly to customers and have gained the skills to handle most situations on this job on my own. The management is not very hands on and when they are asked questions it takes them too long to respond in most cases but they are willing to help and explain when they can. The coworkers are great. We all seem to get along well when we have time to talk in between calls. They are friendly and willing to help if they have more experience. The hardest part of the job would working on slow days when we only have a couple calls an hour. In this office we are only authorized to do certain tasks and when those tasks are not available and the call volume is low we have nothing else to do so it makes for a boring and long day. The most enjoyable part of the job is bringing peace of mind to those customers who are distressed after having an accident or any other claim they might have.
good,Temporary assignment and achieved great results. No full time job openings.
good,I returned to MetLife after pursuing other avenues saying I was returnng home and where I would retire from. We then were blind sided by the fact we were being acquired by MassMutual. Very difficult time.
good,Good place to work and a good career path exists. Strong leadership and goal driven. Willing to listen to feedback and create actionable plans. Great culture
good,Always seems to come out on top in the market. Over the years the company remains in the top position due to product offering. Lots of employees with long years of service.
good,"buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Aunque pagan buen sueldo si superan las UF exigidas la presión constante para que vendas es agobiante, los jefes inmediatos te acosan por tlf para exigirte más rendimiento constante, no son concientes con los horarios ya que en cierre de mes te manipulan para que te quedes más de tu hora de trabajo... El trabajo es bueno pero tiene mal ambiente laboral producto de los jefes inmediatos (supervisores)"
good,"It's a call center, but they do what they can as far a pay and benefits. Still it is hard work especially when calls are back to back. I found all the managers to be friendly, which is a novelty."
good,The Dallas office was closed and the employees were laid off. The company offers a casual dress code and strives for a work life balance with opportunity to work from home when appropriate.
good,"First job out of school, calls on phone whole day. did not love being on phone that much. It went okay but i just did not love it and felt like I would enjoy doing something else."
good,"Work environment and culture is decent. Great flexibility with work/life balance, but certain departments does not promote or have opportunity for advancement. Need to seek outside opportunities or another division within."
good,I would like to work more on administration duties because i am good at it.i approach work as a will to win.i can work under a minimum supervision and can handle pressure.i am a fast learner.
good,"The company was purchased by Mass Mutual.  This is what caused me to leave.  There wasn't room for a Disability Specialist at the new firm, so I looked for another job before I was terminated."
good,"My experience was before they consolidated IT facilities to three locations from more than 10, so the work environment might be changed.  They pay well."
good,"OK place to work. Can be stressful, but people are OK. The benefits are good, however 401k match is only about 20%. They do have frequent layoffs. There is a gym in the basement, about $25/mo decent equipment."
good,It started out ok working at MetLife.  Very people centric and work life balance.  The management changed over and there were employees promoted to manager positions that had no prior experience and were more in it for the money grab then for managing people.
good,Nice environment. Not schedule friendly especially if you have kids. Management are all friends so you feel like you can't bring your problems to any of them.
good,"the company has good cmmetion for the staff but it is not easy to get a client and it is hard to close a deal,"
good,lavorare per quest'azienda è stato molto costruttivo
good,A constantly changing and evolving culture in the insurance field.  Customer service skills are a requirement and a good background in this will help you be successful
good,The management team lost its sense of direction and the company seemed to be drifting for a significant amount of time. Employees lost their motivation.
good,Lots of Employee engagement if you work in the office. Overtime is usually available but always available during enrollment season October thru February.
good,"MetLife was a good place to work if you're getting started in sales.  I had no complaints and the only reason I left, was for a better opportunity elsewhere."
good,"No pueden esperar que los ejecutivos nuevos den resultado en un mes, deberían garantizar a los nuevos por lo menos 3 meses, le quitas la preocupación de que no va a ganar nada y se concentra en sembrar para así cosechar ya en el tercer mes."
good,I really enjoyed my tenure at MetLife...I wish I could join back in future....it had good working conditions and supportive leadership...It didn't help me much in my career progression
good,"I worked at MetLife through an outsourcing technology partner. Overall experience at MetLife was OK. "
good,"Good place to work. Got lots of products. Life insurance, accident and Illness plans. Medical insurance plans also. Lots of agents working there. 3 offices."
good,"System issues do not allow call center reps to complete their tasks at hand. Great co workers and immediate supervisors. Good work life balance, but day to day functions are a grind."
good,It's a good company. Great Work life balance. Salary wise they definitely are on the.lower side. I would love to work for them again only if they make their salary competitive.
good,I learned a lot about both the disability industry and the medical field. MetLife is a fast paced work environment with great maternity time and benefits.
good,"Great benefits, cultural environment and advancement opportunities are often available.  Very poor management and training. Very old systems and software used daily."
good,"I am a highly motivated individual who has a strong work ethic, sense of discipline and integrity. I relish challenges, however demanding, work enthusiastically within a team and demand high standards of myself. I hold a Bachelor of Commerce in economics, Obtained from the University of South Africa."
good,"Great work environment, lack of mobility and advancement.  Very organized given the size of the company. Managers have lots of experience which makes it a good experience for the other employees. No politics you can just be yourself."
good,The company offers good benefits and PTO but you are competing with everyone else in the company to get the time off you want and the same applies to the schedules. The company can go on incredibly long stretches of not hiring which leads to all meetings and coaching being canceled. They also have broken several promises regarding compensation and positions being offered. get any offers being made in writing
good,"I loved being salaried and having a real career. It was hard and not easy for me to grasp, but I passed my OJT ( On the Job Training) Due to Sarah and McLemore!!! They were AWESOME and did what they could with what they were given from our northeast, out of touch corporate.  "
good,Offered good benefits but the training process is intense. Pass/fail. Fail = loss your job. The job itself is intense and stressful. Very much micromanaged.
good,"My time at MetLife was rewarding in some ways. My immediate manager was an easy going person. She telecommuted and that was a major plus."
good,Working in customer service at Metlife requires to have a good positive attitude and great people skills. The ability to multitask and recognize voice cues while talking to a customer is vital. There is always available training through web portal. Co-workers always willing to help.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo adecuado, mas falta de claridad en ordenes ya que varias personas al llevar el mando, se contradicen normalmente, lo cual confunde al personal y causa mal entendidos."
good,"Antiquated systems, stressful environment, and a workload that in the long run human beings are not meant to endure. Avoid this company if at all possible unless it is your only other option besides retail or fast food."
good,Experience tends to depend on which department you work since each are managed so differently. Entry level positions are a bit tedious and not a great work/life balance but there is room for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working with my peers and the work environment was very positive. I would recommend met life to anyone who is looking forward to a lifetime career of customer service. Met life also has many different departments you may apply to and has a wide variety of growth.
good,Fast paced competitive company. Well known Life Insurance Company offering many financial services with a large number of employees around the country.
good,I worked as a Temp through an agency. I worked in dental claims. You could get angry phone calls. I enjoyed the people I worked with and my trainer was great.
good,"For a Fortune 50 company, you would expect a better support system (service, billing, & implementation) to surround the sales force. Without a decent support system in place, it makes your job as a Sales Rep way more difficult than it would otherwise need to be."
good,My department closed down. I was working wilt an agency. A new company came in and brought out the company EGA which I was working for. It was an excellent fob. I wish that it was permanent. I was working under a contract.
good,I was a temporary employee hired by a third party.  MetLife was a good learning experience in the corporate office. The staff in the office was great. We all had our own work to be completed by day. The environment was friendly and productive.
good,"This call center was like most centers, it lacked true leadership and the schedules, and selection of employees for permanent employment was unprofessional."
good,Met some great contacts here and enjoyed the work.  Only reason I left was to increase my income and work closer to home.  I would work there again if they still had the mortgage division.
good,It was a nice first real job with benefits for someone that was just out of high school. Gave me the opportunity to learn a field I probably would not have gone into if not given an opprotunity
good,"Good company to work. Excellent office space. Many different culture, Gym is excellent and cafeteria is ok. Flexible working hours. Only downside is walking through Grand Central."
good,"Typical call center job. Must sit 8hours watching a monitor and answering calls. High call volume quarterly and and at tax season. Management micro-manages the teams and you have to watch stats (AHT average handle time, ACW after call work, talk time, AUX etc) to stay in good standing."
good,I had a great supervisor at the Dayton Ohio location. I worked in Auto & Home as a Customer Care Advocate and there is a lot to learn and it was always busy.
good,Good place to work with prior call center experience. The hours requires you to have more flexibility than I have. I prefer to have a work schedule that is more permanent
good,MetLife does not have local offices any longer. There is nothing more to say about this company as you have to call an 800 number to get any information in regards to this company.
good,"It is not a terrible place, just do not go and expect a perfect place. Salary was not impressive either. The workplace has a lot of potential to be healthy, but chooses not to be. Maybe things have changed since I was there, but management was a incompetent. The requirements to work a case or to ""earn"" the benefits to work from home were the hardest part of this job, especially when really needed. The work area was very nice. Very comfortable desks, monitors, beautiful facilities. Just try it, and see if it is a place that matches what you want."
good,Metlife has been sold and no longer exsist.  It has been bought out by a Wall street company.  The company did have wonderful name recognition and that was worth a lot when it comes to closes.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was work with cross functional teams and solving issues as the applied to the project. I also like working on new technology being delivered to customers.
good,Fast paced environment. to process claims in a timely manner. Deterring outcome of the claims and giving notice to both parties and there respected response to the outcome.
good,"I learned a lot about investments and financial health. Passing the test for the securities license was a lot of hard work but worth it. The people I interacted with were super pleasant as well as job coaches, supervisors and managers."
good,"Metlife has a superior benefit plan for its employees.  However, the expectations set for the employees on a day to day basis are absurd and unrealistic.  Perfection is not attainable by human beings, and to expect perfection from your employees will lead to failure as a business."
good,"I have a passion for ensuring business and technical requirements are well understood and effectively brought together in a comprehensive solution platform. I have extensive experience in marketing technology, SAAS, business and systems analysis, solution delivery, solution management, consulting, and pre-sales."
good,"The company was great to start the career with, however with recent market place, things have changed.  The outsourcing and contractor based rolls have destroyed the quality of deliverables and projects as company."
good,"I loved MetLife when I started, but after 9 years, a terrible manager ruined life for me and I eventually had to leave. The manager I was working for in the end made everyone on my team turn against each other."
good,The work load is flexible.  MetLife provided a quality  benefits package.  Advancement was available.  Mentoring programs were available. Cross training was available.
good,My only real concern was their lack of communication. We found the day of that it was out last day. Friendly staff and willing to come help us learn as temps.
good,"Metlife is a good company to work with.  It provides good salary,  learning opportunities . The only drawback is the management especially at Noida site, they are very baised and the worst part is that the HR function is just for namesake as they hardly work."
good,Met Life is where I began in Health Care Administration.  This division merged with Travelers and was purchased by United Health Care. They no longer offer medical insurance services.
good,The resources that moved down from NY City thought the ruled everything. They would leave work early and not care too much about you - but cared about themselves. Some managers were ok. Most were not.
good,business oriented job every day  was a new day for achieving target. Learned a lot about business strategies and management with supportive colleagues and month end was celebration day for us.
good,MetLife has a holistic view on how to plan for success in releation to competing companies.  Team are self driven and collaborative.  Focus in on using new technology to improve customer experience
good,This was a good company to work for but they decided to sell their U.S. producer field and no longer conducts business in the U.S. other than in group benefits.
good,I answered a multi-phone line system. Environment was ok. I worked first shift. Contract position. Not a fan of insurance. People were polite. Culture is diverse
good,"I start work at 8h00am, reply to all my emails than I call all my customers for orders. I will then process the orders and invoice these for delivery."
good,"I was only part time during my college days.  As I recall it was a fun place to work, and everyone was helpful.  It has been to many years to give a review."
good,I did not spend enough time at MetLife to give a fair and accurate account of the work environment. I learned a lot while I was there about software release management.
good,"trabajo  bajo presión"
good,"Wasn't employed long, if you like sitting behind a computer all day this job is for you. I am more of a social person who likes to talk with people face to face"
good,Nice place to work.  Co-workers were friendly and willing to help each other.  Everyone worked well together to provide quality service to all clients.
good,Everyone in the training organization was let go. It was stressful and competitive.  Purpose was not communicated.  Could  have  had a better plan for success.
good,"The workflow is fast paced and challenging. The processes are antiquated at times. Hopefully, management will actually start to listen to the voice of the customer more and improve these areas"
good,"I've had a good career at my company. I've worked there for many years, and have been promoted several times. The company is focused on technology improvements."
good,"The people weren't the problem. It's the demands of the industry. If you don't want to be involved in heavy-pressure sales, don't enter the insurance industry."
good,I worked as a claims adjuster which was okay in the beginning but slowly turned into a call center. If you like being on the phone 24/7 and getting cursed out by customers this is your job!
good,"MetLife offers solutions and guidance to help customers meet their goals and navigate life's twists and turns."
good,Temp Job. i was transitioning from retail into an office job and had the opportunity to work at Met Life temporarily until i found my full time job at Chestnut Hill Realty
good,"At the agency level there is tons of micromanaging in the area of sales.  Also, lots of meetings just to have meetings.  Meeting to talk about the next meeting seems to be a daily task for all levels of management and all employees in general.  Lots of wasted time due to micromanaging, and cheesy company required sales pitches etc."
good,"MetLife's Investments Department offered a challenging and stimulating environment.  Co-workers were agreeable.  However, management was secretive and opportunities for advancement were limited."
good,"clean and high energy, fast pace atmosphere."
good,"There are lots of procedures in place so it's easy to know what to expect and how things work."
good,"Company was good to work for, communication was good and the atmosphere was a good environment to work. Employees seemed happy to come to work. Co was very fast paced."
good,"Fun, innovative, progressive, modern, relaxed, forward thinking, insurance industry, digital platforming, cloud focused, flexible work arrangements if needed"
good,I would have loved to be employed with them full time but it was only temporary to fill in during Christmas holiday season.  There was disconnection and even separation in seating to remind temporary employees that they were not entitled to certain privileges allotted and allowed for permanent full time employees. Everyone was helpful in assisting the temporary employees.
good,Good job atmosphere  enjoy working for this company. I left because my father had taken ill and I stay home with my mother to take care of him before he passed away. Would like to work for them again
good,I worked at MetLife so long ago I do not really remember much about my experience. From what I do remember it was a good experience. My fellow employees were great to work with. It was an overall good experience.
good,"Met-life is a world class employer, however the pace they put you at is incredible.  Extremely goal oriented, very hard to meet or exceed any goal set forth.  They never seemed to give you the tools to succeed."
good,Process requests from clients and third parties that ask for policy information to make an informed decision about if they should or want to replace their contract.
good,"the company has gone through a lot of change, some good, some not so good.  currently the culture is up and down depending on what area of the company you are in."
good,Doen't apply as there are no jobs in my field to apply to as they sold most of the employees off to concentrate on underwriting Brighthouse policies.  No jobs available.
good,"I answer phones, data entry, daily,review policyholders insurance information, email, and fax out policyholder to third parties.Calculate premiums to supply third parties which requested the information."
good,"Work life balance is OK. Company policies are good"
good,"MetLife is not a company that looks out for their employees.  They are constantly looking to add more to your already full schedule.  It wasn't what you knew, it was who you knew."
good,Perfectly average work environment that adheres to normal standards and protocols one would expect in a modern society. Expect average to slightly above average on all topics.
good,"It was not such a good experience. I joined metlife in its early days when it such started its operations in India. So there was not much to do. My initial few months went in training and later it was more on direct sourcing and training team of advisers. Good work ethics but due to slow recruitment from top to bottom mgt and as branches were coming up, it was not a good place to work. There was not much to do."
good,i learned more in 1 year about the organization and myself.  i developed skills to help me in my career.  Although i am no longer an agent i do recommend the company
good,"Company has been in business over 100 years."
good,"boring boring boring boring "
good,"excelente empresa para laborar, recomendada ampliamente"
good,"Company's policies are wonderfull, they support talent, knowledge, give enough time to groom yourself. Work load is very less and beacuse employees can explore their knowlege or learn new things."
good,"MetLife was a great company to work for.  Once they went public, things changed.  It became a different company.  But what I found was that if you worked hard and produced quality work, you were treated fairly."
good,Ventas comisiones trabajo. Bajo.presión. sin seguro social
good,"Organization is overall run effectively/efficiently.  It is a very large company and as such 'workplace culture"" depends on where one is within the organization."
good,"Company is good, has been there for 150 years so they must have been doing something right but in my one year here, I have seen leaders working in silos wasting time and effort working on same/similar initiative and competing against each other. That's a recipe for disaster but some of them realize the problem so hopeful that they'll get their act together soon."
good,Busy all the time not much time to socialize or enjoy other team members quota always important. If you like to sit at your desk all day its a great place to work.
good,"Culture is to save money and trim expenses.  Data systems and procedures are outdated, but the focus from Senior Management is not how to work more efficiently,but how to improve stock performance."
good,"I am so glad that I was fortunate to work at this job and I wish I had been able to stay but after they were ""partnered"" with Source HOV and had to move. It went downhill personally. Only thing I recommend was a flextime for the mornings"
good,A good company to be with and lot of learning curves and good exposure to technical & functional domains by which we can grow as good professional in carrier.
good,I only worked for Met-Life for less than a year. So I don't have a long enough track record to provide detail about the company. They did have good benefits
good,"En el área operativa es posible apreciar la gran carga laboral en algunas posiciones , es fácil relacionarse con los lideres de las áreas y con las demás personas, me gusto que tuve la oportunidad de estar involucrada en diferentes proyectos dentro de la empresa,de esta manera fue posible desarrollar diferentes habilidades como la planeación y organización del tiempo, trabajo en equipo y liderazgo para el desarrollo de diferentes actividades."
good,Too much information is giving at one time and expect to remember right away . Once you have learned the new stuff the next day there are more things to remember . There is no room for advancements and pay is low compared to other jobs .
good,"Negotiating pricing and promotion with suppliers"
good,MLAH is a great company for somebody who has insurance sales experience.  However if you are a new agent the challenge is great.  MLAH has a management model of putting you on an island.
good,"the best part of the job at metlife was the co workers.  the work was stressful, hard deadlines and upper management that made poor management decisions.  myself along with many others were let go after years of dedicated service"
good,"Revisión e ingresos de las ventas de producción, manejo del sistemas de la empresa."
good,"This was a wonderful place to work until they started changing the management structure and layout of the departments. It is a lot harder to work for the company now, they handle all situations like they are going bankrupt but according to quarterly profit reports, that's not even close to correct."
good,"Working everyday to find new individuals to present insurance ideas."
good,Typical sales job that is all about sales and little regard for employees.  Many trainee agents leave and the position is like a revolving door.  Some management support when needed.
good,"siendo promotora aprendí socializar con la gente, separar los problemas personales de los laborales y ser siempre amable con los clientes haciéndolos sentir en confianza y seguros, también a ser organizada."
good,"I moved to MetLife when ALICO was acquired by MetLife. It was strange at first as I already felt like an outsiders within MetLife as we were always referred to as ""the AIG folks,"" despite promoting a ""OneMetLife"" theme. I made the best of it, and was laid off after a year and a half at the company."
good,I enjoyed my employment experience with MetLife. It was a rewarding experience handling disability claims and being able to help these individuals with their healthcare needs.
good,"It is an OK company.  The ways to manage projects are very inefficient.  There is a PBO model (Plan, Build, Operation), but it is not working well.  People doesn't spend much time to code or develop something useful, instead of using time to fill forms, open tickets, and other overheads."
good,Management need to be more focused when it comes to the people management. They need to focus on providing more opportunities to there people so that employee can groom themselves.
good,Professional environment with proper delegation channel. Work culture is professional and clean environment which helps you in concentrating. DO NOT EXPECT GROWTH TOO SOON.
good,"Responsabilidad"
good,"However, over the past year, a lot of positions and overtime were eliminated resulting in increased job duties for the same salary."
good,Worked in Progressions which was eliminated.   Worked on estate and financial planning.  Enjoyed meeting and working with clients and guiding them through the program.
good,"MetLife has some work to do with it's leaders to ensure success in the future. Strategy is strong, digitally focused, and pays well. "
good,"There was a bad days,week and months because at sales industry its like that.I learn how to communicate with people because you have to approach everyone who's coming your way and you must know your territory,management was good I can say they were assisting where they can,team work is the best way,the haderst part about that(sales) when you work for commission and when the policy laps you have to pay it back,I enjoyed most when we reach our target, we will celebrate and rewarded"
good,Like any sales job it was tough. Have to sell 70% Metlife products to get benefits. Not always the best for the customer. Non-Metlife employees were able to get better rates than captured agents. Very frustrating.
good,There was high pressure to sell financial services that I was not comfortable introducing to clients. The pay was commission based and would take several years to reach a level where you could live on.
good,"The environment was very tense during my time there."
good,"Decent, steady pay, can be a very liberal, accepting, and friendly culture. With the right manager, work/life balance can be really good. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making phone calls and checking emails. Returning messages and checking applications that were submitted,  I did however learn how to work independently with very little supervision. Management was fine but they could have been more proactive .The hardest part of the job was prospecting, trying to developing new clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you made a difference in someones life. Its very satisfying being able to help others."
good,good  place work and lots of learning new things to learn coordinate with the banks for funding and making a healthy relationship with the clients....
good,"Looking for taking forward my carrier to the higher end which obviously start to find the opportunity in overseas. "
good,It was an ok job I might have stayed at MetLife but the company was moving to NC. MetLife had a lot of structure but helped bay for my graduate school.
good,Where I got my introduction to Group Benefits and has been my career for too many years.  Still in contact with my first real boss and he taught me so much.
good,This company was my broker dealer. As far as broker dealers are concerned they did everything I expected of them and had a strong enough brand to instill trust in my clients.
good,"fantastic location, gorgeous campus, great people.  the applied math department does a great job with course development and truly teaching the material"
good,Good company to work for.  Nice benefit package.  Strong reputation within the insurance community.  Good products.  Not the best compensation.  Will make more as an independent.
good,I was the go to person for ensuring that the IT Software department for Metropolitan Retail was working. Implemented a Service Catalogue and event management
good,"The company is going thru transformational changes and cost cutting is one of the focus which impact the culture and environment in workplace. Constant reorganization and extreme expense control measurements makes everyone unsecure about future."
good,"Good place to work, my dept. was very stressful, constant change, sometime supervisors little impatient. Co workers great, most supervisors were great, More pros than cons"
good,"Love everything about this company except the pay.  The people are great, I have never had a bad manager, it is close to home and you do not have to travel into the city.  However, they do not pay you anywhere close to what you deserve."
good,"computer is not user friendly"
good,If hired expect to work there for a few years then the downsize or move your department to another part of the country. They move you around to different locations.
good,"When I worked at MetLife 25 years ago, it was a typical insurance company.  Processes and systems were often outdated and/or needlessly complex, but there was still a sense of purpose and mission with consistent internal messaging and communications, even if those were delivered via physical bulletin boards, memos, and actual town-hall style workplace meetings."
good,"The office I worked at was a very friendly environment. I was struggling to find work, so one of the managers took me in to help him with sending emails and letters."
good,"Employees are responsible for managing their own time and mostly securing clients without any leads. This involved cold-calling and extensive marketing."
good,You work@ your own pace & management is helpful when you struggle.salary is not attractive.Your job is not secure& you must bring new business monthly
good,"MetLife really helps the PCS agents financially, but the Rates for NC are not very competitive right now.  Also the systems are antiquated and clunky.  They have a new system coming next year but if you start this position now you have 6 months to validate so you would probably be better off doing this next year. Overall not a bad company everybody will try to help you, but its tough to get the business going with the rates they offer. If you are good at selling things higher priced then you will be fine if not then stay away."
good,I worked there as a temp. The people that I worked with were very nice but I was there for a liitle over two month. The best part of the job is that they did not micro managed me.

I learned from my immediate supervisors how to maintain a work and at home balance. I learned from my co workers that it is ok to have some kind of fun in the workplace instead of it always being a serious workplace.

The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I changed the work atmosphere for the better.

Lessons learned in mature markets can be applied to emerging markets and new approaches developed in emerging markets can be scaled to improve mature markets.

good,"I had to purchase a laptop when I first started with the company and sell a certain amount of life insurance before I was given a small stipend and medical, dental, vision and short term disability insurance.  We had meetings on a daily basis given by managers on different lessons/exams we were expected to pass related to financial planning.

good,"In Metlife change is always there.  For Metlife employees this isn't a good thing because Metlife can and does use these changes to boot you right out the door.  It wasn't always this way.  Used to be that Metlife was a good company to work for as they worked with their employees in order to keep the employees happy.  Once the words ""business unit"" started being tossed into everything, the company moral dropped lower then sewer level and never recovered.  Of course, the ""business unit"" didn't care that what they were trying to force didn't work, cost more time and effort than they were willing to allow and made customers very angry."

good,"A typical day at work consists of phone calls and appointments... I learned a lot from this position and the main attributes were the importance of networking as well as developing relationships with prospective clients.. The hardest part of the jobs was setting the actual appointments since the leads given weren't all that great but I learned how to work with some of the biggest producers and get a helping hand from them.. Most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom and flexibility.. As long as your doing what you need to do, no one is on your case and all over you.. ."

good,Job is great for any individual who has at least 5 years to invest. You will make close to nothing for the first 5 years. Not a good job for someone who need consistant pay.
good,"On a typical workday we review the general ledger and make sure the company has a balanced balance sheet. We make phone calls to other lines of business to gather information and analytics on trends that may or not be out of the norm.

You can go anywhere you like"
good,"production driven, focus on reporting, learned a tremendous amount about management and leadership"
good,MetLife is a great company to begin a career in the financial services industry.
good,I am not cut out to sell Life Insurance. The rejection is overwhelming.
good,enjoyed selling products for this company. but it was a high stress level set by the sales manager then which I understand is no longer with the company so it would probably be a good place to work again
good,"Not always treated fairly but was paid well. If I only based decisions on money, would work for them again. Since I know there is more to life than money would never work for them again."
good,Learned how to be a team player with diverse group of associates.
good,"working in metlife helped me to a lot to work in corporates as this is my first job as a manager, i learned corporate work culture, working under pressure to increase revenue for the company that will ultimately result in my career growth, life with co-workers is friendly but the hardest part of the job is the reporting managers expect us to work more than we r capable of for their own benifits and growth, but the most enjoyable part of the job is that in life insurance sector there is lot of money if a person works well"
good,"it is a good company to work for but only paid on commission , and you have a lot of service business which you do not get paid for"

good,"Una gran empresa con un buen ambiente laboral y prestaciones, sin embargo las cargas de trabajo e infrastructura digital no ayudan al tipo de responsabilidades del puesto que ofrecen y eso impacta los horarios y el balance laboral / personal."
good,If you are joining MetLife at TL or above level then it’s good for you. Transportation is very poor in MetLife. Appraisal is between 5-7 %. No offsite for the employees below TL
good,"This company is fairly typical of a global financial services institution. It is slow moving corporate culture focused on shareholder value. Insurance is not particularly exciting.  Jobs are plentiful in finance, IT.  Outsourcing is trending in Ops and services."
good,MetLife is an excellent opportunity to help retirees and service clients but the culture has changed significantly over recent years.  The environment while is training is team oriented and gives a newly hired employee a feeling that they made a great choice.  The feeling when on the floor is more metrics driven and assembly line work.  There is very little flexibility for working parents and the work life balance that once attracted people is non-existent now.  The chance in culture is one of the reason I chose to seek other opportunities.
good,A typical say at work is coming in logging into my phone and computer. Then it begins; the phone never stops ringing. Management is awesome they definitely value our input. I feel like we need about 100 more adjusters and the staff to work as a team and company would be great. I also feel a better pay increase would keep staff. Most enjoyable part of my day is talking with so many different customers across the world
good,I would like to work for MetLife on a permanent basis but they will not pay temporary employees what they are worth.   Work/life balance is good but management does not communicate with workers like they should with changes in the company.
good,"Contactarea telefonica prospectiilor"

good,"The most enjoyable part of my job has been the friendships I've developed - I've built trusted partnerships with people across multiple business organizations, have learned a tremendous amount about the different businesses and how they operate, and have learned to navigate for success."
good,MetLife is a good place to work if you like the open office concept. There was a lot of gossip and drama when I was there at the Cary location. I found this hard to avoid in an open office environment.
good,"Company Certified Job Coach/Company Certified Adjunct Trainer - Served as a Subject Matter Expert in the new Dayton Dental class, assisted with Job Coaching for transitioning employees from the training room to the floor, led refresher training to help existing employees with product knowledge and quality in addition to my normal duties such as taking calls from group insurance holders, potential customers, and dentists. Assist callers with benefits, claims and overpayments as well as any other clarification needed to understand benefits. Extensive, continuous training to further knowledge on the product and to understand any changes companies make with their policies.  Involved in focus groups to problem solve and streamline company processes."
good,MetLife offers a lot of great stuff but you can only take advantage of it or benefit from it at your manager's discretion. The things that are supposed to give you work life balance or a flexible schedule are so tightly controlled by management that the purpose of these things starts to be lost on employees. There is also a lot of pressure by upper management to do the impossible which is then shoved down to the employees and those that can't perform often face issues with management. Even just trying to plan time off can be stressful because management is not happy when you try to get away.
good,I liked working at MetLife. I was brought in by my former VP at MONY who started an office around myself and a fellow agent at MONY and it worked well.
good,"Working environment was okay, supervisor was not very engaging and picked favorites,  The hours were flexible though which helps, most people were helpful in other departments"
good,"Nice environment"
good,"The amount of administrative overhead and bureaucracy is painful.  I have been there 6 months, and 80 percent of the time I have been with the company, the Global Technology and Operations group has been under a variety of often overlapping Change Freezes.  They even flow down into the non-production environments on occasion.  Management is inconsistent across the teams"
good,"I took on a lot more Executive Managers which I enjoyed. I love being busy and learning different things. Everyday was busy and never the same repetition work. I learned the likes and dislikes of each manager and as time went on the job seemed easy, however, as my responsibilities grew I did a lot more projects and off site events, which I enjoyed. "
good,"its alright for the benefits the demands are high based on the product you are handling . schedule can change . workplace is stale   "
good,"MetLife offers great employee benefits.  MetLife is very philanthropic, always donating money to hurricane victims, for example, an offering to match employee donations as well."
good,"My employment at MetLife was great for the time spent, however management made work life balance a nightmare. This was do to multiple layoffs through the years and sending most IT jobs offshore. Bad move for all companies that followed suite!"
good,A lot of Upper Management people are not qualified to manage people. They have poor communication skills and often have poor relationships with their direct reports.
good,Did not enjoy the robotic work environment. This review is very unnecessary as I do not have any more feedback to give at this very moment. This is a waste of time.
good,"Good place to work, lot of good people willing to help. OT was mandatory, as well as some Saturdays. Work can be tedious at times. Low level managers willing to help, some issues with higher management. If you are good at the production aspects, there are no issues. Your coworkers will know if you under produce."
good,"Nice to have an onsite gym, covered parking, cafeteria, lactation/privacy room and coffee shop.  Lot of employee events and social groups to become involved in."
good,"I worked in the IAT (Initial Action Team) Customer Service department at MetLife.  We handled taking the claims calls for both auto and home clients.  I learned a different perspective of customer service through the phones instead of face to face.  I also learned what it was like to be the one who had to think fast when it comes to people facing life crises.  It was competitive as far as how we could handle our phone calls, how we were able to help the customers, the times that we spent on the calls, how many calls we took during our shifts, etc.  I appreciated having the opportunity of experiencing customer service in that perspective since I have had customer service publicly prior to this position."
good,"Since relocating to Cary NC from all over the country MetLife here is perceived to be a Southern laid back work environment by employees in PA, NJ,NY, RI and elsewhere. But our IT strategic app support group allows no relaxed work/life balance. Perception is that if you are not at your WS, gossip surfaces about your dedication to your job. Bosses say they support you but most of them are still in NJ, NY, RI and really aren't aware of the stress their PMs, PLs and analysts are under. Unfortunate. They should realize that the higher turnover here in specific teams indicates a problem, but they are protecting their current head count and nothing else. Ability to telecommute is exceptional but under the gun is not utilized as it should be to maintain work/life balance."
good,"Currently, my department is saturated in office politics with particular members of management team."
good,"Good place to work. Senior leadership have a good vision and clear and measurable goal."
good,"Awesome at first, the pay and benefits were great, but I worked in STD, which is very demanding, the job itself wasn't hard, it was the workload that took its toll. At first you love the overtime, but you quickly realize that you have more work to do, than time available in the day. You need to be caught up with your workload, as with any job, but your workload here was outrageous. You will work weekends just to catch yourself up, you will work yourself to death during the week, by the time you get home you're so mentally exhausted that you find yourself almost brain dead and numb. You then try to claim whatever is left of your day by relaxing and  de-escalating, and possibly doing something exciting, but you just fall asleep and repeat. Other departments I hear are a lot better than disability, so try to aim in that direction, the direction away from disability, far away."
good,"Fast paced work environment dealing with staff, customers and accounts while adhering to strict and constantly changed federal financial guidelines.  Required quick thinking and reactions."
good,"MetLife is undergoing a significant transformation including people, process, and technology. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people. MetLife would like to create a culture of motivational leadership, however don't have the leaders in place to achieve."
good,"I was an agent and my position was extremely fliexible by nature, and was very rewarding professionaly. It was the hardest job i ever had simply because i was thrown to the wolves and had to survive. thats changed now. i had to wear many hats, and it seems a lack of company direction is at hand. We were local ""businesses"" but employed by metlife with no buyout option so having that kind of control over the business you work so hard to build on your own is tough."
good,Ambiente de aprendizado e de novos desafios. Estavam em época de mudança de gerencia.
good,"Since most business as moved to BHF, not too many jobs open.  It was a great company to start out with and it helped my career.  Not any more jobs to apply for."
good,MetLife is a good company to work for if you are looking for a steady and consistent type of job/career. Extremely difficult to move up the corporate ladder. There are way too many levels in their org chart. Pretty zero minorities in leadership positions.
good,"- Bring Lean Management to an entire business / function and ensure the transformation within the business is performed to standard and consistent with the Enterprise approach."
good,"The benefits are good and the salary competitive. There company is very concerned about doing right by its customers. It was very supportive of higher learning. I was able to implement what I learned in school in my job. "

good,Metlife is an equal opportunity company.The management encourages individuals to explore and learn new technologies. Learned a lot from teammates and part of my job.
good,This position was usually very busy but also kind of laid back. I had a very inexperienced manager which made it very hard to excel otherwise Metlife was a great place to work.
good,"A typical work day goes by quick, however it seems through time the company required you to handle more accounts with basic training and the compensation was terrible."
good,"flat culture and easy going people to work with; however, not much clarity and transparency on the future of the company from senior management. also not much clarity on upward mobility"
good,Um ambiente agradável para se exercer as funções atribuídas.
good,"Overall I had great work life balance, but MetLife has its issues - just like any other company. I like the people I work with, but ML has a lot of growing to become something awesome. Don't overlook it because it is good enough. But also weigh your options."
good,The compensation is not motivating for the amount of work that is conducted. There is no room for advancement for paralegals. Open floor plan allows for transparency.
good,"Met is spinning out of control. "
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, me desempeñe como telesales, si hay buenas bases de clientes y buenas ventas es muy buen sueldo por pocas horas, si la base es mala o no tuviste un buen mes baja tu sueldo por las comisiones."
good,"There was always something new to learn, and working as a team was always encouraged. They gave incentives to build moral in the workplace. Also flexible with work schedule."
good,"IT Operations currently moved to Cary, NC.  One main goal was to change the culture, be more nimble shorten implementation schedules.  Management didn't change so this hasn't happened."
good,"Project Management, Expense Management with an emphasis on Project Benefits applicable to the P&L."
good,There is always something to learn at MetLife. A great company to take your potential to a greater height. You get a lot of space to work and learn. However too much focus on non productive activities. Red tapism causes work dissemination without proper ROI showcasing
good,"Daily work consists of managing case load of 80 to upwards of 140 cases, constant phone calls and computer updates."
good,"Product knowledge is a plus"
good,"nothing to say but it was a good company and i had a lot of fun there with all the stress and the target that have been given management where helpful but hard as well "
good,"Metlife a multinational insurance company.  My first experience in insurance and have learned about the prospecting, creating need and closing.  Also developed a team of financial advisers.  Portfolio for Life and Medical insurance.  Hardest part of the job was recruiting the right sales people and training them for the job."
good,to work or at least it used to be.  They have underwent many org changes and with that the atmosphere has changed drastically.  Senior Leadership is aggressive and continues to make bad decisions hindering performance and growth.

good,"•	Manage the monthly close and the financial reporting processes in accordance with GAAP and STAT. Provide accounting and reporting guidance for new transactions."
good,"I wasn't there long enough to be very detailed.  I really like the people, but the culture was too slow, too process bound, and too chaotic for me.  I was reorged within a month of joining and the results wasn't good for either me or MetLife."
good,"MetLife offers flexible work life balance, well affording you a competitive salary and exposure to global opportunities."
good,"En general nos daban la libertad de hacer nuestro trabajo, un poco reservados en el apoyo al personal de ventas ya que debiamos por nuestra cuenta buscar nuestras propias herramientas y automotivacion para llevar a cabo las tareas diarias."
good,"I enjoyed the work, and the experience of learning new products. The environment was a little out dated, but it paid well and great benefits."
good,Constant changes and layoffs. Flexible work arrangements and work life balance is not consistent across the organization. Convoluted processes and overlapping roles.
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios e excelente para trabalhar, se preocupa com a qualidade de vida dos seus colaboradores"
good,Repetitive process therefore low chance of gaining more knowledge once enough knowledge about the process in specific department has been gained. Must seek opportunities to work in different departments in order to grow.
good,"I  love working in customer service and I genuinely enjoyed the customers and staff, there are many of things I didn't agree with, but i  still came in with a smile and did my job, in making sure that all my customers that were spoken with felt exceptional."
good,"Process and approve or deny new claims for large companies of over 10,000 employees. Handle both existing and new claims and provide continued support to the policy holder through the life of the claim."
good,it has good benefits. understaffed and required to complete additional work asignments during break time. Floor wide assistance is terrible
good,Doing Challenging work which makes me to learn more and good experience and working in compitation mode with co-works which make my works to  make in quick manner and learning new things from them
good,"Siento que no valoraban mucho al personal, su interés principal como en muchas empresas es ganar dinero y a eso se enfocaban principalmente."
good,"Siempre los días eran muy distintos. Se conocía mucha gente ahí y siempre algo nuevo que aprender."
good,"Es una empresa con buen clima laboral a pesar de haber pasado por una fuerte reestructura laboral en el 2012, con una buena reputacion y posicionada dentro de las mas grandes en seguros de vida a nivel mundial."
good,"A typical day is very productive and engaging. You must be focused and efficient. Team effort, accuracy, and analytical are key components to succeed. Be Proactive and spontaneous to cash flow and liquidity needs.  I had a great learning experience from hiring Director, PMU Associates, Treasury Associates, Trade Settlement & other line of business Groups."
good,"I loved working with my manager for years and"
good,"I work as a Sr Project Test Lead and I worked from home however our meetings schedule has different time zone since METLIFE is a  global company. We have meetings that sometimes starts at 4 am and there are days that I have meetings with our offshore vendors from 9 pm to 12 pm. Aside from this meetings, I also need to monitor progress on the projects that are assigned to me and perform training if needed. I manage minimum of 5 projects every quarter and handles about 12 resources to perform the testing. We do have some communication problems with our offshore resources but at the end we still are able to deliver our projects on time and defect free. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get our bonuses from our company."
good,"Not very fast paced, but lots of research. I've learned a lot about multiple health conditions, and continue to learn everyday. "
good,"Seeing that I started working at a small brokers office was ideal for me. I started off on a small scale of clients but had built up an intimate relationship with them. Management was good and steered me in the right direction. I worked alone at the brokers office, but did some one on one with head office. The hardest part was to tell my clients that our offices are closing down. The most enjoyable part was to see a satisfied client walk out by the door."
good,"Metlife was a great environment, the culture was fast past yet very organized and detailed. The level of knowledge was visible in every facet of job description from duties to duties. The One on One experience with training and interaction was top of the line enhancement on all levels. I took pride in working multiple task (more than 25) while onsite for 18 months at this client."
good,"Like most companies, your experience at MetLife will depend not only on your attitude and work ethic, but on your direct management.  While under the direction of knowledgable and ethical management, I experienced almost  limitless opportunity for growth, motivation, and work/ life balance..  But a move under an inexperienced, unethical supervisor was the end of a much loved career.  This can honestly be the case anywhere - so my advice would be to give them a try - but always make an educated decision about who you are agreeing to work for.  Ask around and do a bit of interviewing of them as well."
good,"MetLife Auto & Home is a terrific company to work for overall.  They stand by their promises to clients, as well as employees.  There is growth potential in that you can easily sell the products and grow your book, but as long as current management stays as is, that is the limit to your growth.  Unfortunately, local management is inexperienced.  That being the case, any attempt to gather information from higher management will be met by severe retaliation.  Co workers are great, they are open to sharing information that will help you grow as a business, as well as a person.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work with people and help them to understand the benefit of the products you offer & how it will help them to meet their goals now and in the future.  The hardest part of the job is working with the current manager.  If you can get past that, the possibilities are limitless."
good,It is really a place where i learnt many things and the management was awesome
good,"Project management for the availability Management team"
good,Everyone worked extremely hard and were dedicated team players.  You were faced with day to day challenges that you over come and are left with the feeling of accomplishment.
good,Lots of hours.  Interesting work.  Company was still in transition so lots of decisions were last minute and not communicated very well.  But the work itself was challenging and interesting.
good,"a typical day at work is being at my desk doing data entry. We did the same thing everyday, I knew what I was getting myself into."
good,"MetLife has an incredible history and I was proud to work there.  However, it is a numbers driven business and you have to sell bottom line.  I realized that environment is not my environment - I'm better served working for a salary at something I'm truly passionate about."
good,"First Job out of college, Discovered my limitations."
good,I like the hours and the team I work with. The team is very helpful and get along with everyone.
good,Good for working Mom. Limited growth. Salaries are ok. Benefits are standard
good,"Working with field offices on process improvement, policies, procedures, guidelines, quality assurance."
good,"I travel each day to work in different work stations e.g hospitals, schools, municipalities and different private companies. I arrive at that particular venue and start my presentations, it can be a group or an individual presantation depending on the need of the people I am providing a service for.I have learned the importance of appreciating each and every client even the ones who don't have pleasant things to say. I have also learned to work independantly. I have a very supportive manager who assists me with any quiries I might have and who understands his role of leadership. My co-workers are team players and driven who have shown true team spirit. The hardest part of my job is constantly worrying about being unable to meet your targets as this affects your salary. Since we earn on commision basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist people in making wise financial choices which they could not have made without my help, as well as being able to see the policies that they have taken truelly assist them in a time of need."
good,The quality of workmanship from staff and counselor was very effective towards the clients and was under the ethical responsibilities required by OASAS federal Act Laws. A tyicalday was to deliver the information in which each client would be able to have their need met towards treatment and the development of positive coping skillsthat were needed to be implemented into their lives.
good,todo es muy bueno solo que dan tablas de comision que nunca cumplen sienpre hay un pero
good,That about sums it up.
good,Great Company to work for. Friendly staff to work for; worked with Mutual Funds; weekly staff meeting to see where we were at with our job tasks and updates on Company
good,"Excelente empresa referente a remuneración y beneficios, lamentablemente la ética de jefaturas en algunas áreas disminuyen a la Compañía."
good,Its a typical nine hours day at work where the first two hours are generally spent reading mails and answering to the queries of the clients .The best part about my job is analytical application of mind.
good,When call volumes are not high it is a chill environment to work in; the calls can be frustrating and there is not always a lot of support; the hours can vary and you can work from home occasionally.
good,Metlife is a fantastic company that supplies many opportunities for promotions. I have met many knowledgable people who have worked for Metlife over 20 years. For young people who are interested in working for Metlife they have internship programs for college juniors and seniors.
good,"good place to work.  Small office community, flexible hours, desirable location, helps during licensing process. generous base salary. Good parking. good place."
good,"Took a ton of inbound calls with minimal supervision, all support was provided by peers in chat. Most questions went unanswered as peers were on calls too. No option to advance as the dental dept was leaving to move to NC.  Skeletal crew day after day as most agents worked from home."
good,"Company is trying to develop a more open culture. Like any large companies, there is still a lot of legacy, command and control mindset. Great, but slow progress in transforming legacy to modern."
good,"Interview was formal and fair.  I just got the wrong manager.  He is gone now but I left before then.  Good benefits, low pay.  Slow advancement.  Decent Job if you have kids."
good,"Good culture, nice benefits "
good,"There is a lot of good that can be said about MetLife. For example, MetLife generally has a very respectful culture. Supervisors seem to generally understand that as the job is quite stressful employees need some level of empathy. The pay and benefits are also extremely good (at least for Freeport, IL)."
good,MetLife provides a great state of the art facility to work in. I have been able to take advantage of many training opportunities to improve and broaden my skillsets during my tenure there.
good,"Great job experience, very slow paced. Great pay, great management, great hours. Not so great on family death emergency’s or understanding people have court."
good,"Challenging workplace culture with many layers of management. "
good,Great company to work for depending on your manager and department. Not much room for growth so be prepared to stay in your same department unless you know someone.
good,A typical day was being a call center rep.  Your logged into the phones and you cant move till breaks. Everything is timed and monitored.  Including breaks
good,"I enjoyed metlife until they moved our entire department to the south and fired everyone."
good,"MetLife is a good place to work provided you stay focused and stay in communications with your manager/director."
good,"lack of training, too much of work, stressful enviroment. managment should relax and should not put too much pressure on the employees. work life is not balanced."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"very flat always cutting back then big growth "
good,"Very competitive and sometimes pretty cutthroat.  Most management was great, with a few bad apples spread around.  I'd avoid working for those few bad apples, if at all possible."
good,"Although MetLife advertises a Flexible Work Arrangement, many managers are not encouraging or flexible with associates working from home. Overall coworkers are extremely nice, and willing to help whenever possible. The benefits are amazing. The hardest part is the glass ceiling with new associates. It is challenging to ask for appropriate wages compared to those who have been with the company for a long time and new associates who are doing the same work."
good,"Our global team helps our customers navigate life’s journey in many regions and cultures. In turn, we help our employees grow and thrive by providing training and development, emphasizing health and wellness, and promoting diversity and inclusion. "
good,Metlife is an okay place to work if you don't mind constant change and always being undermined. working here was a struggle. people silently try to get you in trouble or fired
good,"Heavy workload and many hours of inbound calling required. Active working environment and very professional."
good,"Many challenging opportunities that bring about visability.   "
good,Work days vary.  This is not an 8-5 job Monday through Friday.  Did not have good management.  I had more managing experience then my own manager.  Can be lucrative job if in the right lead matrix.
good,Do not like working in call center. Think that I would enjoy working for a different department. CAN NOT TRUST anyone there. Cut throat environment. Love what I do
good,"Salary is not competitive"
good,"Trabajar en una Afore básicamente es organizar tu tiempo para dar seguimiento y concretar cierre con clientes potenciales, ya que el sueldo principalmente es por comisiones. Como el Mercado es muy competido, a mi me funciono bien darles la asesoría sobre pensiones que originó más confianza."
good,"Workload can change significantly based upon staffing, special projects and time of year.  The company provides sufficient PTO and benefits options.  Advancement can be slow and not always available."
good,"1-Good company to work with"
good,"Working at MetLife in the beginning was a fun and energetic environment. As the months gone by, management has implemented constant changes in processes and causing stress. "
good,"Good and talented team with Impecable work ethics. Low key and low stress environment. A healthy work enviroment with good compensation package. Unfortunately, the company as a whole is too business oriented and management heavy."
good,My co-workers are nice people to work with.  We can always bounce ideas off of each other.  Management lets us brainstorm and think of ways that will make our jobs easier.  The culture is nice.
good,Employee growth is encouraged and management is very supportive. Work life balance is good with option to work from home. Collaborative team environment.
good,Lot of pressure on the Job. Its top to bottom approach.Good part is the process oriented company. Have learnt a lot from this company and also got opportunity to get exposed with different formats of Insurance.
good,The mornings were for meetings. I learned much about connecting with customers. Management was supportive. The culture was nurturing for the most part. The hardest part of my work was having to split commissions with the senior reps. I liked most the work/life balance and networking opportunities.
good,The organization is quickly evolving to meet government regulations and to continue to drive share price.  There are a lot of employees that are collateral damage.  The company is selling off the retail distribution in the US.  The company is also spinning off other large parts of the organization domestically.  The company has a focus of being a benefits leader in global markets.
good,Great place to work There was little room to grow. When I was there the company was not doing very well so they were letting go a lot of people at once. They even fired my supervisor.
good,"The balance of work/ life is spoke about heavily, but its not real. Management discuss work from home, but the requirements are not the same for all employees."
good,"A place where I created the leads and activities. I set my schedule starting at 8:00 am by making appointments for the day and through out the week. I developed leads with business to business connections. Porviding education seminars on retirement planning and investing using the pyramid approach. I enjoyed the independent, training and the leadership. Overall the company had a great team environment. And I felt like I was a part of the team."
good,"productive fun collaborative work place environment,  flexible time and hours"
good,The work it s confortable and easy but they have a lot of complication with customers and they have old materiels and a lot of hours of working
good,"Since going public, this company has grown exponentially and is a giant in its industry.  It is a highly expense conscious organization, and is run purely for profit purposes."
good,"It's a good place to get started, but hard to build a career here.  Most spend a few years and then go elsewhere.  It helps if you have your Series 6 and 63 prior to coming here."
good,"I have learned more in the last 8 years than in any other career that I have had. I have a Series 6, 7, 215, and 66. I have handled retirement plans for large organizations and individual consumers. "
good,"As a front line employer, immediate supervisors were mainly capable, caring and more than willing to stand up for their subordinates. The office environment, consequently, along pleasant and fun co-workers was enjoyable. "
good,"The job consists of making outbound calls to potential Home and Auto insurance customers.  Some of our customers have requested our call, others have already gotten quoted and are on the fence, it is our job to persuade them to speak to a lisenced agent.  The people are great, and it has really improved my sales skills.  The downfall of this job is that it is a new department and one can say therefore it is a pilot program, which means it is strictly a temporary position."
good,"My current office has a great leadership team.  The compensation plan has become a train wreck and works against newer and less experienced employees.  The training programs have become less detailed which will make it harder for new employees coming into the business.  The hours are intense and the expectations are high.  In that sense it is like a typical sales job.  However, you truly have the ability to make a difference in people's lives every day."
good,"learn something new every day, team work environment. very scheduled"
good,Great company to work for.  There is alot of opportunity if you work hard.
good,I have learned so much from this company and have really opened up. This company has matured me so much.
good,Metlife provided my first step into the healthcare industry.
good,"My typical day of work was very enjoyable.  I completed various tasks through my day.  A few of them entailed research of agents commissions along with daily data entry."
good,"Good , learning experience with good rewards and growth opportunity.,   Prime location at bangalore."
good,"Empresa Multinacional de excelentes benefícios e estrutura. Equipe comprometida e extremamente competente, portanto possui uma equipe de seleção eficaz. Dificuldade em lidar com o sistema que poderia ser menos falho, e com a gerência que poderia dar mais voz à equipe muito competente. Relação com os colegas muito agradável, como a capacidade de resolver pendências de clientes."
good,"tough conditions so only the strongest will survive, management is very capable to take company to  new heights."
good,"•	Sell various types of insurance policies to individuals including life and medical insurance."
good,"The corporate environment is a major plus. Growth, both vertically and as an employee, is always encouraged and nurtured. Overall, a great brand and company."
good,"Building was dirty, not a clean environment and no specific job duties."
good,"Company is moving businesses outside of the US.  Eliminating most of their US field offices.  Moving staff from NYC to N. Carolina."
good,"Love my team, small and my manager does not practice micromanagement! Enjoying coming to work. Work is delegated and everyone knows their duties."
good,"Long hours, cold calling. Teaching people the fundamentals of retirement and financial planning."
good,"In retrospect now that I have also see what it is like to work at a leading bank, I think I should have counted my blessings more at MetLife. Great company with great benefits (visible like the Corporate gym, or not so visible like less hours, less stress, great location."
good,MetLife was a good place to work. They offered great benefits and competitive pay.
good,"A typical day at work is applying payments to annuities, staying late if needed."
good,There is always room to move. Co-workers are really friendly
good,"Learned a lot about Term Life Insurance products. Very professional approach with customers,clients and colleagues. Co-workers very co-operative and friendly. Every day was enjoyable and a fruitful experience."
good,Each day presents new challenges and I learned something new each day. The loans were all reverse mortgages but it was important to make sure that the borrower's children were not taking advantage of the parents.
good,"Strong leadership at the top, reigniting our connection to purpose, customer focus and simplification. Culture is shifting and will improve, awesome benefits package."
good,Es una empresa con mucha competitividad dentro de la misma empresa como fuera de ella
good,"During my tenure at MetLife I had opportunities to work on a wide range of digital initiatives.  While the deliverables varied based on project scope, there was one constant - knowledgeable and committed group of colleagues. Everyone brought their unique skill set and expertise to help build relevant customer experiences.  The collaborative and fast-paced enviorment provided a workplace to develop and learn."
good,"Buen ambiente, solo que el tipo de trabajo no me gustaba."
good,"Please excuse errors in review-  I am unable to edit due to the site not allowing me to scroll through to the text or reach the end of my text to add more.  "
good,"Survive on minimum wage for a few years and hopefully catch some breaks.  Leads that the firm ""owns"" are distributed to top producers who have already cornered a market and have established practices."
good,"MetLife is a constantly changing work environment. In my 9 years working for them, I've worked in two different departments in a variety of capacities. They eventually sold off the business I was working in and along with it all the employees. There's not a lot of job security with them despite them being around for over 150 years. I wouldn't recommend anyone working there looking for a long term career."
good,Commission only sales job where you called on new and existing customers in order to sell life insurance and financial products.  No base pay for agents and support was not always consistent
good,MetLife is a good place to work if you like the open office concept.  There was a lot of gossip and drama when I was there at the Cary location.  I found this hard to avoid in an open office environment.
good,"It just wasn't for me. I saw many people who looked like they were content there, I'm just not an office person. I started getting resentful because I wasn't following my heart so I left."
good,Good working environment but no opportunity for advancement. Job is only temporary and the pay is too low for cost of living. Hours are great. Friendly people. Supervisor is nice.
good,"Metlife is a notable company and was working a content associate."
good,"I was a marketing assistant."
good,"There were a lot of great people at MetLife, and they have a great campus in Cary, NC. The benefits were decent, and they provided a good work life balance."
good,"Gran empresa, gran escuela. "
good,"•	Extensive use of MS Share Point for sharing the documents with different departments"
good,The work day at MetLife was very smooth and non stressful. The days consisted of 8 hour work days and there was minimum overtime offered. I learned about assisting member with life insurance information.
good,"Great company to advance your career, great benefits, stressful and competitive. Good and bad managers, all about metrics/numbers and team productivity status and not enough about the individual employee needs for training, support or motivation."
good,"Excelente aprendizaje, excelente equipos de trabajo."
good,"Budget cuts are a focus at MetLife right now which translates to a lot of change and the need to reduce headcount.   For those that are left behind, it increases their workload.   Vision good - but interim state - while in midst of change - challenging."
good,Benefits and programs for employees on many different levels are numerous and extremely accommodating. Opportunity for advancement is few and far in between especially if you are good in one particular department. Overall professional management and leniency with paid time off. Not a bad place to work.
good,"i was selling product like funeral cover,investment and educational plan im was enjoying to help people going to their working places and give them the products they want"
good,"llegar ala oficina alas 8:30 todos los días, realizar la planificación del día con un compañero, salir a los centros de trabajo donde ofrecemos el producto, una vez ahí presentarnos con el director del plantel y solicitar autorización para dirigirnos con todo el personal a su cargo, brindarles la atención y servicios que necesiten así como ofrecer algunos beneficios que les hagan falta en su seguro de vida."
good,"Stress free environment"
good,"It was great atmosphere "
good,"fue agradable trabajar ahi, solo que el sueldo era muy bajo y no cubria mis gastos diarios"
good,Good benefits and lots of room for advancement. Monotonous work.
good,"Hardest part  trying to evaluate damage to autos with snow on them"
good,"It is not easy to work with client.you need to be patient understanding and listening to them"
good,"Muy  buena  empresa  trabajo muy  noble, aprendi a desenvolverme  en frente de las  personas a poder  a traer su atencion"
good,My experience with Metlife was very positive and growing. I have had worked with mentors who has given me all the skills I carry today for my career. It was a very fun and engaged atmosphere at work. Very much team oriented and lot of space for growth.
good,good management. with excellent productive co worker. fast environment. with all latest tools.
good,People are wonderful to work with. Opportunities to work with several departments to broaden knowledge.
good,"I was let go at MetLife Freeport IL after 13 years of loyal employment and they used a bogus excuse to get me out the door. They claimed I had moved files, which I did not and will always claim that nor did they give me a chance to speak for myself as to addressing the issue I was being charged with, at least someone who has been accused of a crime has the right to speak for themself so why was I not allowed to do the same. For those 13 years I never took advantage of any sick day, PTO days or vacation time, in fact I always had days left to roll over to the new year. I got along with all co-workers and never complained about anything. I did feel the training could have been better managed and it seemed like some supervisors didn't have the time to help with the training when asked. My dismissal happened in 2007 and it still hurts, especially when I hear statements that MetLife cares about its employees when in actually I don't believe they do and I would welcome a conversation with anyone to set the story straight."
good,I enjoyed working at Metlife. My supervisors were great. The training was long and intense but overall a good place to work. We even had the option to work from home which was also great.
good,"I felt like the standards are not applied equally to all adjusters, and the adjusters take the first notices of losses, which i don't like. The culture was positive, but there were many discrepancies in managing style per manager, which caused adjusters to have wildly different work experiences."
good,Not a bad company to work for if u can be flexible with hours and like High School festivities like 'spirit week'. Competitive wages and comfortable atmosphere.
good,"Met Life was very good at keeping up with the time and they knew how to make their employees happy, making them feel like they are important. HOWEVER it is a corporate company who look at numbers not realizing Insurance sales is different than a normal sales job. They treat it as a game and it's not how insurance should be. The point system for the sales rep is ridiculous.  They pretty much push salesman into making sales to people that really cant pay it for in the end, causing a ton of cancelations and unpaid premiums. Insurance is a monthly bill in peoples lives that actually can cause them not to be able to afford everyday things like, food and rent. It's not a game to play and it's sad MetLife treats it that way."
good,"I spent a great many years at MetLife and have had mostly good experiences there. The major con, I'd say, was the overall lack of men of color I saw in positions of leadership. Aside from that, annual raises were often small and salaries, in my experience, weren't always competitive with what other large insurance companies were paying."
good,I had the opportunity to work with others in a face pace environment. My supervisor was amazing with letting me work from home when needed. I trained in different products which lead me to be very successful at MetLife. What
good,It was a great place to work. There was a lot going on in the office. I was only an intern at the time but it was a very rewarding experience. I would recommend if trying to learn more about the insurance bussiness.
good,"Buen ambiente, aprendizaje en las diferentes funciones aunque se limita en parte el aprender mas, subgerencia con poca apatía y marcada diferencia con colaboradores externos, buenos compañeros"
good,Temp pay was really great but when offered a full time position MetLife cut hourly rate by $3. Pay was the same for all temps being hired full time. So even someone with 5+ years experience was paid the same as someone with no experience. MetLife manager says the pay cut is so steep because you get benefits... Doesn't really make sense when you think about it.
good,We were all shocked when they decided to close their retail loan departments just after one year.  This would typically inhibit our future employment but we travelled in a group of high producing originator's so job security never was an issue.
good,It is the organisation with high ethical value as core. Though i spent a very little time but this one gave enough time for my family. Your core value was admired a lot.
good,all over it was a pretty good job. The management for most part was awesome. the salary was good and the time off was good. some information on new events could have been uploaded faster so that csr sounded like they knew what the customer was talking about on new issues.
good,"MetLife offers competitive salary and excellent benefits, however, the organization is constantly changing in ways that leave employees and internal partners on the back burner, often struggling to adapt to (constantly) new environments. Joe security dwindles as years and upper management move on."
good,"Met is a massive corporation with lots of areas for growth. The organization does experience relatively high turnover and personnel shifts/reorganizations are frequent. Compensation and Benefits are great. Management has a focus on individual development, but organizational shifts can make this difficult long-term."
good,MetLife is an awesome company to start you business career with and develop your corporate America roots. The support system alone will give you the tools to become the successful business man or woman that thrives in todays work force.
good,Metlife is a great company to work for and they provide good salary that area average. Also Reliable job and good management. Requires few more hours on month end
good,MetLife is a great company. A lot of supportive people on the management team and my peers are great. The work is easy I'm just looking for something more exciting with a little more pay.
good,"It has been a good place to work at. Work/Life balance is great and compensation is fair. Advancement is slow, but it will come"
good,Good company as long as you get the right management. Benefit packages are great. Culture is balanced. Overall working relationships were also good.  The size of the company and the red tape is the worst part.
good,"Each day was typical with the job described, I learned many new computer programs. I absolutely loved my co-workers as that was the best part of the job.  The hardest part of the job was the long drive. The office was 45min away from home and quite a compute especially on winter days. "
good,"Metlife has great benefits for their employees. I learned a lot from working at MetLife. They encourage Work Life Balance, but its hard to do it since projects overlap and expectations are still the same when it comes to deadlines."
good,"I didn't like being tied to my phone, but I was surrounded by people who was very knowledgeable and it was god send."
good,Amazing management and lots of experience working with different types of people and retirement products. This company has a promote within policy which is great unless 99% of your experience was at another company.
good,Working environment is very friendly. My colleagues are very cooperative.
good,* Large company with good management
good,"Stressful job, need to hire more employees, so they are not swamped with work and leave a good company. Show employees flexibility and let "
good,It is a very good environment to work with metlife and establish a very good life-career knowing that it is a multinational company worldwide and it invests a lot on developing people to grow and excel throughout their career which provides a very good salary package....
good,Fast paced work environment.  One must have the ability to multi task and learn the skills of wrapping up a phone call within a acceptable period of time.
good,- my innovative abilities to get along with clients
good,I would recommend working at this company to friends and family. Flexible schedule and a great place to work.  I have enjoyed my tenure at this company.
good,"Come in mentally ready for work.Leave personal issues behind."
good,I worked in many departments and therefore was very well rounded at PNC over my 6 years of employment there. This was a call center environment and although I loved my co-workers and management the overall policies were not very family oriented. Call centers are very numbers based but with great pay and benefits
good,I use to drive a lot and I  have to keep driving 120 on the road even though I had serious deadlines. I have learned that speed kills.
good,"1. Joined MetLife as sr. associate and within one year got a chance to went for a migration to USA for 2 months. After that within one year through IJP become Sr. Process trainer & given the responsibility of handling two different processes with the existing one. Its a service industry where we always concentrate on customer centricity by providing effective services to the end customer."
good,"Was a great company to work for and my colleaguesto were great, work was fun because of this"
good,Was promoted from Administrative Assistant to Executive Assistant
good,"I enjoyed the team I was on for this company."
good,"Es una excelente multinacional, lamentablemente No se tiene estabilidad laboral, en el momento menos esperado te echan así tengas los números de tu lado"
good,"Not a lot a management support, I guess they already knew about the scope change and potential loss of jobs and didn't care any longer.  NO matter how hard you worked it was never going to be enough after the scope change.  I wish I had know also."
good,"Employees of MetLife are great people. They give alot of suggestions and are very open to trying new cuisine. Customer service interactions were excellent, and many customers would stop by in the morning and ask to speak to me to see if there were any changes in the menu, many employees stopped going out for lunch in the time I was there."
good,"I gained lot of experience n how to deal with clients on daily basis,have achieved my qualifications on financials planning through this company,i no how to solve clients problems"
good,The management team asked you to not follow the prescribed protocols in an effort to utilize unused funds to justify job positions even though those positions were not properly funded
good,"Typical day...Come in between 8-9am, generate leads for yourself, take an hour lunch, attempt to contact self generated leads to set appointments to sell Life Insurance and Investments.  Hold appointments and make sales.  Go home.  Repeat."
good,"Management is confused about the direction"

good,"Enjoy working at this company, though over the past few years our workload has dramatically increased while our resources to complete our mission has been reduced."
good,expectations and stressful atmosphere do not meet low salary for this position.  some leave shortly after completing their training due to the high work load.
good,This was a three month temp job only while I had health issues taht I needed to deal with before my last child was born.  Nice three month little position.  Never a long term position.
good,"Eramos un equipo muy bien formado, ambiente agradable, teníamos una sala para coffee breack. Buen trato. "
good,Nothing to add. People were a little stiff. Laid off people while bringing in contract workers. Not good. Needs to monitor lower level managers to reduce the possibility of harassment.
good,I had a terrible manager at Metlife. After I complained about the manager I was not happy that I was not assisted. The manager retaliated against me and in front of my staff.

good,Metlife is a good company to work for I learned a lot with that company and it advanced my customer service skills.
good,"Finished FIRNA Series 6, 63 licenses and learned a lot of selling skills at MetLife."
good,The work demand is very high for one person. Your job is to be a claim adjuster but it is more like a call center. You will take over 14 new claims a day while managing a high pending over 100 claims.
good,"Do not believe any recruiter that promises conversion from contractor to FTE. These are temporary jobs and you will be treated accordingly. Unless management sees a way to utilize your talent for their purposes, you will not be promoted or asked to join the team permanently. Pay is decent for contract work, but team culture needs work."
good,"Muy buena experiencia con respecto a ventas de productos intangibles, se trabaja en equipo como así también los objetivos, muy buen ambiente laboral."
good,"This a great company to work for!  I worked for them twice and loved my jobs!  The management on the second position was too personal in lieu of handling issues, questions or concerns fairly or professional.  Showed major favoritism and."
good,"The company was family oriented in the past; however, as management changed, the direction and culture of the organization changed. It is not the same company it once was. Very disappointing."

good,good management skill. nice place to wrk n gain knowledge. helpfull.
good,Being the MNC it is a nice organization. Having worked with for a lesser period i cant comment much on it. I couldnt adjust with this industry so i preferred to quit early.
good,While I didn't work there long enough to make a true evaluation of the company.  The management team and co-workers were great people who worked very hard.
good,"I was working as customers service Consultant.  Assisting manager with office work while she was in and outside the office. Assisting sales representative  with their retention and making sure they get from new and old clients. Processing death claims,surrender,loans and partial surrender. Make sure clients are happy  are easily to talk to us when thy need assistance, and come back if they need something from our products"
good,It has been several years but if I hadn't been laid off I would still work for Metlife. Best job ever without a college degree.  The pay was good and management was fair.  If you are luck enough to get a good position.  Stay there.
good,"MetLife had a reputation of being one of the best companies to work for that instilled worklife balance. However, just like with everything else things change.  The monetary compensation was not great nor fair for the educational experience that I possessed.  I stayed for one year and found another opportunity closer to my home in the same sector but an increase in pay!!"
good,"The people at MetLife were great!"
good,"less poor language and more professionalism could have been expressed more for new welcoming employees. A dress code would have been nice too. "
good,"Management is not supportive of employee issues with regard to work/life balance. It is easy for managers to be unhelpful or flat out abusive, because nothing will be done to correct it."
good,"It is a good place to work I have enjoyed my time at Met. However, I am looking forward to additional opportunities.  I really do not have anything else to say"
good,Check the applications thoroughly and update the database and calculate the premium. Collect the premium amount the Sales executive the produce receipts for the same.

good,"Challenging Marketing,Sells,Revenue Generation, good communication ability, target achiever Business Development operation ,Shrinkage control ,Company target fulfill,cost Saving"
good,"Its good working in Metlife auto insurance."
good,"Flexible Schedules"
good,"Metlife como empresa no tiene ningún problema si te encuentras trabajando en la casa central, pero cuando trabajas dando la cara al cliente, no se recibe apoyo de material básico para trabajar."
good,El trabajo es inestable porque debes tener una cartera de clientes propios y te presionan constantemente.
good,"MetLife is a trusted name with a holistic product line for financial advisors. On the down side, they are a large company which is slow to make decision, multiple managers, and lack of supporting cast.  The simplest of tasks may take to weeks to preform, by a back office that shows little to urgency.  They easily able to hide and show a lack of accountability. The worst part is that your compensation is delayed, because your deals get bottle necked and you are not paid until the sale is completed.  I took me up to 70 days to get paid on annuity, because multiple departments dropped the ball with not accountability.  "
good,part time experience overall good due to who I was working for.
good,"Met Life is an all right place to work. I have been here since August 1st of 2008. I would not be leaving now if MetLife had not decided to exit the mortgage industry. We could look forward to a bonus every year. I have learned a lot since I have been here in these 5 years. Have had the chance to assist different departments with special projects. "
good,- 3-5 days in market for face to face meetings
good,"I am a consultant in my current postion as an Expense Manager. My days at work heavily revolve around emails. I have gained a vast amount of experience in Project Managment, pivot table creation and advanced excel skills due to the nature of the information requested from VPs. My dealings were with consultants, project managers, VPs and CIOs. The hardest part of my position has been the change in upper management, and the moving of the particular group I am in to different parts of the organizantion, several times within 2.5 years. The most enjoyable part of my job is being busy so my day typically goes quickly. I also enjoy the option of being able to work from home 2 -3 days of the week."
good,Hardest part is recruiting sales agents.Most enjoyable are production related trips.
good,"Its a good work place the problem is on earning comission only, it a hardest thing ever. No clients no pay while people deny insurance since they have their own advisors to help them. I learned that communication is the main key to success as we work with people to get paid. Management and workers are friendly but selfish. The hardest part is when getting no clients for month to month and not getting paid. The most enjoyable part is when getting rewards for the job done"
good,"This is a tale of two cities... contractors and full permanent employees. Both groups seemed very engaged and skilled. Lots of projects and initiatives... great facilities, and many groups to get involved with."
good,Back to back sales covering a small percentage of people in Eastern European countries. Not very good compensation and poor materials and very stiff programs of insurance.
good,"Ser ordenado y planificar tu trabajo, la empresa te da todo el apoyo y te hacen cursos constantemente. Buenos beneficios para el personal."
good,MetLife is a great organization who gives lot of benefits to their employees to keep them happy. Structured and systematic are the words I will use to describe this organization.
good,"absorbe mucho tiempo, en general es una buena empresa pero no se equilibra nada con la vida personal"
good,Work Life balance is not a strong point at MetLife. Employees aren't valued like they should be. I am seeking other opportunities outside of the organization.
good,I really enjoyed my time at MetLife.  They are undergoing many changes which made it difficult for employees to fully understand their role in the company.  Overall my time there was great and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a job.
good,I have worked for MetLife for a long time. I have experienced its metamorphosis from a mutual company to a stock company. The rate of change seems to accelerate which in some ways is very exciting but in other ways some of the change has been poorly thought through and was based on short term rather than long term thinking.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es favorable, recibes estímulos"
good,"Working external sales was mental consuming having to accept rejections. For every sale made, one get to acknowledge the customer and communication process to get the client."
good,"This was a great environment in which to work because the management team brought together former employees that had worked together before.  There was instant camaraderie and respect.   We were humming along, company was making money all over the country and then MetLife decided they didn't want to be in the mortgage business anymore and shut down the whole operation across the country in 45 days."
good,"Team Work is 1 of the important factors within the company."
good,"I was a loan officer, so part of my day included calling existing customers and calling prospective customers"
good,"decent culture, its also a bit political and company seems to go through lots of buyouts and spinoffs in general so a bit unstable in that sense. But other than that it is a decent company to work for overall,"
good,Metlife embraced the work from home culture which worked very well without diluting the ability to communicate with employees company wide.  I was able to work with many different departments to gain a broad knowledge of different areas within MetLife and moved into different roles many times during my years with MetLife.  It became challenging to enjoy the work however in the last couple of years as the stressors of company changes and ultimately the sale to MassMutual became apparent.
good,Our unit was fun and was like a family.  I learned how to be a leader and how to deal with different personalities.  Teamwork was promoted and practiced.
good,"Its a very good company as far as pay and other wages, but only driven by individual stats. Management was lacking, Forgot about needs of customers, and then only wanted individual stats to improve."
good,"La compania de seguros decidio comprar una compania especializada en creditos bancarios. Mala decision, basada en el riesgo intrinsico."
good,"Metlife is a big stodgy company without too much room for promotion."
good,"Working with Metlife, I have learned many things such as building the relation ship with Client, improved my communication skills , meeting the expectation from client as well as our management Side."
good,This is a new avenue for the company. MetLife is attempting to cultivate a work from home experience that will engage employees and help the company be successful in it's Property and Casualty sales.
good,"A typical day consists of answering emails,ledger research, account reconciliations, ledger entries,guidance of lower level staff, task training of lower level staff, becoming familiar with new system applications, creating STAT reporting schedules & footnotes, creating,revising or updating ACCESS databases."
good,"Completely engaging work day.  Long hours due to offshored teams."
good,"It has truly been a humbling experience working for Metropolitan Life I grew from strength to strength each day and more over I learnt to work independently as well as in a team when I was required to. My role as a financial Advisor also sometimes fell over to be a management due to my diligence the management sometimes trusted me in leading the team I was under."
good,Everyone works from home some of the time. There is an easy going culture but management can vary depending on department. Overall there is a somewhat outdated feel to the structure and direction of the company.
good,"A busy environment, the company has great potential for growth and to be a serious contender in the Financial Services market."
good,"Cuando fui asesora entraba a las 8 am, empezabamos haciendo llamadas para conseguir citas con lista de personas que cada asesor debia llevar diariamente."
good,A Multinational Life Insurance Company where everyone would love to make his or her career and go ahead with his or her mission and vision following excellent financial health check services of the clients and providing Financial solutions as well.
good,"its tiring you go around looking for people who wants policies and you getting paid by commission monthly and should the policy lapse or the client cancel they take back their commission , you can spend months without getting paid"
good,"great tools and leardership to learn the business"
good,The department that I worked in went over and beyond to make sure us employees were taking care of. The OFEGLI department had weekly meetings and always made sure that any issues or problems we had as a team were resolved.
good,"none to speak out."
good,"If there is anything to be grateful of which I learned from Metropolitan Life is that ""Hard Work pays"""". "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work independently and make my decisions with little to no supervision and the ability to be creative.
good,"My typical day at would would be speaking with current clients regarding their life insurance needs. "
good,making director or AVP is near impossible unless you come in from outside
good,"is a nice place to work, but the only nice part about it is because of the people. The job itself wears on person over time "
good,I was simply a advisor at the time of my study i have tried to do as per my ability. All people working were so much co-operative and i enjoyed my work till the end of my job
good,"Senior management would not budget for the technology to gain maximum output.  Sometimes felt like I was working in a junior high with all the attitudes.  Simply wanted to do my job, be recognized and paid well and have a work-life balance.  "
good,A typical day at work is helping as many Homeowners as I can. Also Keep my Quality of work at the highest Grade. Always having a positive outlook and helping my co-workers with any problems that they may have.
good,"As i joined the company in 10th Sept 2008 as Senior Executive in Branch ops where i was taking care of customer service, New business application, Policy service and cash tallying and now i have been promoted as Asst Manager."
good,met is a good place to work for those not looking to earn a lot of money.
good,"Depending in what department you work and who your manager is, you will have very strong support or none at all.  Departments and managers very greatly."
good,"Debo decir que me agradó más que cualquier otro trabajo, ya que se puede trabajar tranquilamente, con un buen equipo de trabajo, buen ambiente y buenos colegas. Aprendí mucho más sobre el mundo de los seguros en el área que me desempeñé. Respecto a la jefatura, buenos líderes, se puede encontrar apoyo cuando se necesita."
good,"Good work life balance, reasonable work schedules, Good management team, training could be improved but overall was a positive experience and would recommend."
good,"Great place to work; work environment, benefits, flexibility and people all contribute to make a position at MetLife interesting and appealing. Opportunities for growth are also available, only not really in NJ anymore."
good,"Great company to work for. Work, life,balance I would definitely recommend them."
good,"Great benefits, although it's a tough work environment for legal. If you can handle turnover and do not mind seeing colleagues come and go, then you can handle working here."
good,"Good company and friendly environment. "
good,It's a good company from learning and growth prospective. I have learned a lot as a professional as well as personal because the management is very friendly and helpful.
good,"Es un buen trabajo competitivo y agradable, Es un buen inico de empleo"
good,Continue to find job opportunities they don’t come to you.  There are limited jobs in Mi for MetLife employees. It’s a good company. I worked there 30 years.
good,"Buena empresa con buenos ingresos, manejo de horario personal y flexible"
good,Very adaptable environment. Easy team to grow with and beautiful building. I would certainly work here again given better life circumstances for sure.
good,"MetLife is a good place to work. Great benefits, good work atmosphere, and flexible schedules. Very nice for work life balance. Competitive wages, with generous time off."
good,Multicultural and diversed work environment. Opportunity to work with people from all over around the world. Very competent staff to learn from and help you to progress in your career.
good,family and work balance is great. You always are helping other departments. employees are valued but there is a lot of work to be done on one particular file.
good,pretty good place to work depending on department. Great benefits. Management can be difficult but just like anywhere depends on the manager. extremely clickish
good,"El último trabajo fue en Metlife como supervisor del Contact Center, me lleve mucha experiencia, nuevos procesos, nuevos sistemas y procedimientos. Es una empresa norteamericana que tiene arraigada su cultura organizacional."
good,"Given my experience and skills, I would be able to add value to any organization."
good,"A typical day at Metropolitan life would be competition within teams , which pushes an individual to reach their daily/weekly/monthly target. i have learned how to persuade a client on thinking about the near future in terms of securing their families future."
good,"hay mucho apoyo, tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo y crecimiento"
good,"I advise client about their financial wellness and provide  financial-services."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo. Aprendí a tomar en cuenta todas las sugerencias de los clientes. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue las felicitaciones y reconocimientos de los clientes sobre mi desempeño laboral.
good,"Great people to work with, little advancement.  "
good,"Company had some challenges, all large companies do.  Immediate leadership was very caring and wonderful.  Overall culture was great!  Company was great about recognition."
good,"juntas de trabajo diarias para ver avances con los prospectos nuevos y los que se tenían en puerta."
good,My schedule was 11-8 Monday thru Friday it was a call center setting for past due mortgage accounts and foreclosure took about 30 to 35 inbound calls a day and had to make 50+ outbound calls to try to make any arrangements with home owners .The management was very professional it was a family oriented culture. My manager as well as supervisor were always ready to help and teach us any other procedures and help us succeed in what we did on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was having to tell home owners the home was going to be sent to the foreclosure department. I really enjoyed being there my team was great we always worked as a team to get many mortgages settled and resolve the problem.
good,Buen clima de trabajo y buenas condiciones laborales.
good,Overall great opportunities to learn a lot of about financial services business and get experience in. Great mentors and support system provided to beginners.

good,"A MetLife está buscando seu lugar no mercado. Com isso, atrai profissionais qualificados e com sede para aprender e para implementar, o que a confere vantagens competitivas."
good,Fast paced environment experiencing growth along with an advantageous disrupter strategy. Change was a constant and flexibility was key to success in this work place.
good,MetLife is a large company in a mature industry. It is a steady paycheck with great benefits but not much job satisfaction.
good,"typically answer phone calls based on nature of call, you would assist customer with inquiry on their issue for the policy. You would assist with transferring to another dept also for additional assistance you could not help with/"
good,muy grato ambiente y grandes beneficios que permiten compartir en familia
good,"Enjoyed this job very much. The traveling as a marketing rep could be stressful sometimes, especially in upstate NY winters.  Thoroughly enjoyed work environment there."
good,"MetLife is an excellent company to work for, very flexible with personal life and balance.  However,  our office is a satellite office and there is no room for advancement at the currrent time."
good,I worked for a great boss and great team. I had the flexibility to work from home when needed. I also had the ability to learn systems that would benefit my career.
good,Opportunities for career advances. Days feel long. MetLife did a great job on continuing education. Staff and employees were great to work with. Culture was welcoming and there's was always someone willing to help.
good,"I worked here a few years ago. Worked for a small group with the financial services area.  Fast paced high volume work that was constant. Opportunity for OT was available. Only option for growth was to go apply elsewhere within other departments. Great hours, good insurance coverage, 401k match. I would recommend."
good,"Good, but just not the culture I'm looking for.  More of a friends and family promotion and opportunity culture than I am used to.  I prefer to keep business and social life separate."
good,Volunteer concession stand worker in a fast paced environment serving food to customers. Standing on your feet for a long period of time. Always make sure you are prepared for the customers.
good,I am a contract employee there and I do not work for MetLife so in my assignment as a contract employee I find that I have met a lot of nice people...not all but that is anywhere you go and I like the job that I do and if offered would stay.
good,Most jobs there require you work in the call center. you are more than likely to be busy all day. If you cannot sit for extended periods of time this would not be the job for you.
good,"Travel and self manage cases and schedule that included coverage of NY, NJ, PA and Delaware. Face to face in depth interviews of disability clients that involved extensive medical and occupational inquiry. Followed up by detailed reports that were reviewed by forensic accountants, physicians, psychiatrists and examiners."
good,"made phone calls and schedule appoints for Life, Health or disability"
good,Troubled management since the company went public in 2000. Too many decisions made based on the anticipated outcomes for stockholders. Large scale decisions have negatively impacted the stock price for shareholders as well as the employee environment.
good,"Back of the house in the computer processing invoices and doing a lot of data entry, analyzing information and summarizing reports.  I learned a little bit of accounts receivable, payable, processed invoices, dealt with advanced excel and other financial systems.  Work/life balance and benefits were my favorite.  Hardest part of my job was to keep up with constant laid offs and uncertainty.  I enjoyed working on my own with little supervision, no reception coverage, no  heavy phone...most of my work and communication was done by email which was great."
good,Need better management. The same rules do not apply for everyone. I work in claims so its fast paced and a lot of ongoing work. The culture in my department is laid back yet monotone. The hardest part is catching up on the work. The management shows favoritism towards certain employees but its all in corporate life.
good,great place to work. co-works also enjoyable. Along with the best benefit of being able to enjoy lunch and breaks and get a good meal without have to leave the company building.
good,I wish my stay there was much longer. I'm hoping that they will rehire me soon. MetLife is one of those companies that you definitely want to grow with.
good,I was at MetLife for almost 12 years and had 7 bosses. Strong work-at-home culture in most areas. Training opportunities limited. Tend to hire good people who are personable and technology focused.
good,"Incoming Calls non stop, emails, referrals "
good,Nice place to work with a cafeteria so that you don't have to run off campus for lunch.  Great set schedule of 7:30 am to 4:00 pm.  However it was a temporary job with no benefits.
good,"Muy buena empresa, con crecimiento, buen ambiente de trabajo se tiene buen aprendizaje y constantes cursos de preparación para seguir creciendo para nuestra capacitación."
good,"I worked assisting customers with their home loans.  Everything from payment, insurance, escrow and their loans.  Was very education and stressful and fast paced"
good,"Great place to work, great people and they always offer different things to help you succeed.    I would love to go back and work with a great team..."
good,MetLife promotes progression of their employees offering further training and funding for further qualifications. They are supportive of staff and do their best to be flexible where possible
good,Overall a strong organization that does have an interested in advancing their staff one way or another. My time here has been informative and is teaching the power of relationships in overall growth.
good,The company has strong benefits and they prioritized worklife balance; however they are ruthless with layoffs when they exit a market. Good company overall
good,"Bottom line is, you need to know a lot of people and those people need to have a lot of disposable income.  Be ready to work hard and put in the time it takes to be successful."
good,"Metlife was a great company but the office I worked was mired with politics, cronyism, and favoritism.  The VP inbred the office with graduates from his daughter's college and who were all college friends which really limited our potential.  Work was challenging... PMO was slightly unorganized with lots of red tape.  Very resistant to change.  But good culture.  Lots of smart people and very flexible to work-life balance."
good,"Will handle customer service inquiries via the telephone and/or email and answer questions or resolve problems. "
good,"The atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable, and I am able to get my work done and also enjoy my life outside the office. Management cares about employees well being."

good,Metlife offers good benefits and on he job training for entry level positions. They offer promotion to viable candidates and the facilities offer a very nice working environment.
good,"Nice workplace - the people, the culture and the environment. All goes in great camaraderie. it was nice working with MetLife."
good,"Indeed values your feedback."
good,"MetLife has a massive global presence yet also offered the opportunity to be a ""localized expert"" in your field of expertise. In my work as a Product Consultant, I was contacted by many employees in very different capacities across the country for key product research that I was responsible for producing. Many research situations called for analysis and interpretation that went beyond simple fact-gathering. Each day brought new opportunities to serve ""customers"" within the company."
good,"Es una empresa líder en el mercado asegurador, solo que ya existe mucha competencia entre los mismos compañeros de trabajo y las comisiones que pagaban se reducían"
good,MetLife is for those that wish to find a job and settle down for a long time. It has been progressing in both technology and culture lately as it shifts into a new company.
good,"working there was good for a while, until you have to go on disability yourself. i was basically told because i wasn't trying to kill myself or anyone else my depression wasn't severe enough according to the case managers for me to not work, even tho a therapist and psychologist said otherwise. therefore i was fired because of it."
good,This company was also team oriented. I was able to increase my knowledge as a Jumbo Underwriter. My immediate manager was amazing. My interactions with Quality Assurance Team helped my growth tremendously.
good,Great job for entrepreneur type individual who is willing to work hard and create a business but would also like the flexibility of a sales type position.
good,"Must be highly competitive to succeed as commissioned Financial Advisor.  You must put in a lot of time and know a lot of people.  You must be willing to put in a lot of hours calling people you don't know who don't really want to hear from you, even though you CAN help them."
good,"When I used to work here, things were beginning to become very agile. The customer service team was just coming up, service operations procedures were non existent, basically I had to start from scratch. The learning period never ceased during my 4 yr stint in MetLife. It will be my most cherished and most fondly remembered join in my entire life because I loved being a party of Insurance Industry. It never mattered to me that our data base were on Excel which would take forever to access and start working. From there on to a whole new professional systems, it was a long and tiring journey with numerous unpaid extra working hours, especially the young managers who just come out of college end up making their subordinates stay back for a last minute debrief everyday. "
good,There was always work to be done in the claims office. Morning consisted of making sure all things are stocked for the day and then beginning to mail out claims related statements.
good,MetLife was my place of employment for many years and it was a learning experience for me.  I acquired many skills and enhanced my professionalism as a personal assistant through this company.
good,"Great company, you are respected less when you are a woman...by other women. Management is great, easy to talk to. The people who give you the hardest time are the ones on your level but overall it is a great company to work for. There is a game room, gym and lots of office celebrations."
good,"My manager was great and everyone else fair to moderate.  The workload was very light compared to other assignments I've been on.  Unfortunately there was a breach in the computer network that stalled progress.  Once pass the breach, the workload remained light.  As time went on the budget cuts came or were used up and contractor/consultant roles diminished including mine.  Was directed to a lesser role but knowing the workload was light already I saw no challenge and since I was turning 50, dad just past I took time off."
good,"You have to sit at your workstation and do your job only. Strictly proffessional."
good,I don't think I could accurately represent anything about working at this company since it was so long ago.  These reviews should be optional for such occasions.
good,"Metlife is a good company  i learnt alot about costumer service, to trully care about the costumers,  about  how insurance companies work ... what i used to everyday was  explain the coverages , makes changes in policies, take payments,  calculate payments etc etc   loved it but was way too stressful"
good,"Nice place to work but I feel like I needed more senior management support to help me grow my career.  It has been over a decade since I have been there, so things may have changed."
good,overall good experience. Middle management was under a lot of stress to get the job done by the deadline and shielded the analysts' teams from direct exposure to the heat. It also meant that everyone was working over 100% which was expected.
good,"A much bigger company after the merger with Momentum which allows them to provide more products and services than before."
good,this company was well run and professional the working day was varied. the focus on the bottom line was paramount but there was good support in place to help achieve results
good,"Very experienced and knowledgeable  people. Had the please of working with a few classmates, wonderful environment. Room for advancement and growth with the company."
good,"work load was extremely heavy, and limited resources.  weekends were a must to get all the work done and meet deadlines. everything was fixed with a band aid, rather then fix the issue at the root."
good,"I worked for MetLife for 30 years.  It was a very good experience and allowed me to grow my roles, skills, and relationships.  It was sad when Met changed direction and sold our division to MassMutual."
good,"company is good. i have got more knowledge. we did work with enjoy. wen can not try to go from hard work. we did face challenge  because more knowledge hidden in challenges. i have learn more thinks. how to time management, advance excel, how to work with enjoy."
good,"Met has a great culture....employees are collaborative, go out of their way to provide assistance, and are always friendly....never a negative comment about individuals is ever made in meetings or on emails..."
good,I was looking forward to every check and  I did my work. it was quick little summer job and gave me some good experience ................................................
good,metlife is a very good company providing health and dental insurance to all in united states of america its a very good company and company gives opportunities to grow in the career

good,Although agents compete against each other I found all the agents were helpful and we all learned to rely on each other for education and guidance.  We competed but the point was more to help each other succeed.  I loved working with the customers and my goal every day was to help someone in a big way.  Maybe find them lower premiums or better coverage.  It was a good day if I helped even one person.
good,"a typical day stars with calling clients for service and referrals, new contacts, and appointments."

Also ensuring that the supplimental forms are submitted and correctly filled out. Follow up contact made to the agent to obtain the necessary information needed to process their contracts. I learned a lot while working with the department, particularily time management, attention to detail and organizational skills. Each contract is specify and needs to be handled with care. With very little management supervison, we relied on one another to stay up to date with specific handling of certain contracts. Being the newest member of the team, I depended on my co-workers for guidance and they we're very helpful. The hardest part of the job was making sure that all the information was submitted correctly, the application version, the data entry, the supplimental forms per individual states, the in good order dates and the follow up.

To reach out an make contacts and build relationships with Financial Advisors all over the country helps build self-confidence and a strong sense of accomplishment. In comparision to other roles I have had the work enviornment is top of the line. I work with a happy and motivated group of people that add to the enjoyment of the position. Management has been accessable and open minded to the voices and opinions of the employees. The most stressful part of the job is to have to consistently keep the advisors updated. Life Insurance is a different type of sales, whereas most sales positions require a form or two to be completed and the transaction is complete, Life Insurance requires an application, and underwriting process, and then a final close on the health rating and the premium. At times it can be trying to constently keep advisors informed and still try to reach out to new advisors and make new connections. These complications all tie into the strong sense of achievement that the position provide as well."

good,Busy but satisfying work day. Co-workers are very knowledgable and easy to work with. I enjoyed the fact that there was alway something new to learn.
good,I was a part of Alico before it was bought by MetLife. My experience with working in a transitioning environment and less of working at a MetLife office. Everyone I met and worked with from MetLife did seem friendly and personable.
good,Very smart management and carefully designed change management. Good place to work. I was not able to grow though because I was stuck with my old salary as a basis and performance was not suitably rewarded.
good,"I have been employed with IndyMac, and I have enjoyed working for the company, managers and co-workers. I was the Administrative Assistant for the Disbursement Department. I’ve performed supporting duties for two VPs, seven managers and a staff of fifty-six employees. I've processed documents from TCL, input borrowers’ information, ordered property titles, surveys, and inspections, scanning, answering incoming calls, and making outbound calls, preparing Fed/EX packages for shipping, processing invoices and other duties that were required."

good,Typed 100 duplicate settlement checks (daily quota) and prepared for mailing; reconciled bank account at end of each day.
good,"I respond to RFPs, I have learned greatly about group benefits; life, dental, and disability insurance; my managers are young and getting accustomed to their roles; the most difficult part of the job is dealing with the various personalities of the people that collaborate with me; the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing we are getting our foot in the door to sell insurance to large institutional companies."
good,Dressed in business attire
good,Good company overall. People in general are nice and kind; willing to help each other. Organization is fairly complex and slow in its change. Practical adoption of vision and strategy not always communicated and adopted well.

good,"Good place to work with knowledgeable people and enhance business skills.  The salary is below the average though. "
good,Overall this is a good company to work for as far as job stability to a certain extent. There’s great employee benefits such as health dental  vision and discounts with Auto & Home. However management will bring in and promote family and friends over experienced associates
good,"Sometimes it was difficult to be passionate about what you were doing, i think the main thing that made metlife successful were the people working there, and for them to continue on in success they must take the the time to care for their employees"
good,"Pos:"
good,The daily workload for each of the project managers was light.  The program manger should have given more responsibilities to his staff of project managers..
good,For people who like problem solving this job is perfect but it was easy to get burned out due to the lack of advancement within the department. The greatest benefit they offered was the ability to telecommute so I hope to find that same attribute in my next position.
good,"Una Giornata generale, login, realizzazione delle chiamate, Obbiettivo giornaliero 3 chiusure ,o arrivo di un importo ( no ricordo molto bene)."
good,none to say good people to work with but very low chance to unless advance in the company unless you have been there a long time.  Good food served and free coffee and water all day.
good,"Great team ethic, and good camaraderie"
good,"Learned a great deal. The enjoyable part is the work, I love how I contribute to the business. Specific departmental culture could be better. Typical day at work is busy but it does calm down on Fridays which give us the opportunity to reflect and build."
good,"MetLife is a nice place to work, especially if you have a family and are willing to take a little lower pay for flexibility in the workplace. There are many opportunities to develop yourself and it has a nice culture.  Things are changing however so currently there is a lot of change and turmoil."
good,"Empresa con buenas oportunidades,si trabajas ganas"
good,"i really cannot review as it has been many years since i worked at metlife.  but when i left, there is one thing that bothered me is that there is no more sick days that you would have to use your personal days for sick days which is pretty rough."
good,Good company.  challenges with working in a big company simply due to the size. benefits are great with the flexible schedule and ability to work from home
good,"trabajo ameno y comprensible"
good,"A typical day of work in my team of 4 analysts was very fun and challenging at the same time. It was fun because of in the FP&A everybody was very close together, we have good communication and we enjoyed the time working in there. It was challenging because we have to prepare reports not only for the business units in Santiago but also for the management in New York, so was like a double effort."
good,"Work day is okay just my son comes first"
good,Metlife was a good company to work for during my time. However I was a consultant employee on assignment with this company for 18 months. I must say the staff of Metlife did practice inclusiveness with their contract employments as well as they full time workers. I learned a great deal of knowledge in default servicing at the time of Foreclosure Look Back Review 2011-2013.
good,"el ambiente era agradable una acogida cercana y amigable, fue fácil integrarme"
good,"forget about it this is confidential, words words words more words and more on top of the cat in the hat, one fish two fish there fish blue fish red fish with coke and not Pepsi."

good,process loans.management was supportive. Very warm team environment.All worked together as a team to close the loans.good feeling closing loans people
good,Empresa oferece todas as condições para desempenho das atividades profissionais
good,"The attempt to extend and integrate the company culture was ""pushed down"" by Senior Leaders rather than leading by example."
good,A typical day you are at a desk on the computer and phone. Not much interaction with co workers. But everyone is friendly and helpful. Training is pretty simple and easy.
good,It was a great company until they started to sell departments to third party vendors.  The company that took over was DXC Technology.  This company is not ran correctly and they don't believe in helping the employees.  They did not give raises after they took over or bonuses.  They took over in 2016.
good,The company employed competent and professional people. I worked from home and they provided adequate technology to allow me to be successful. Employed for 18 plus years and enjoyed my position.
good,"I've enjoyed working at MetLife, and have learned many valuable skills.  Embracing the agile methods is fully in swing, for all areas of IT.  The workplace is usually great, but the open floor plan and no work from home sometimes makes it hard to get things done."
good,This position was pleasant and the salary wasn't up to par and the raises were not very impressive.  The overall morale was positive and people were nice to work with.
good,"I worked in a business unit that relocated and later sold off. My experience is that the org culture was ok, compensation was slightly below industry average, and management was mixed. I felt like I learned a lot of skills working there."
good,"Great place if State General Agent turn over was low. Fair pay, flexible expectations, not high pressure. Tie is a must. They are always willing to promote to a 100% commission sales position."
good,"La parte más difícil son las jornadas laborales debido a que van muy relacionados con el nivel de perfección de las tareas asignadas."
good,"MetLife does a great job rewarding and honoring their people for a job well done, which is very nice.  My Team and I have recieved quarteraly awards for the past several years as well as the annual awards from our CIO.  With that said, promotions are few and far inbetween and job relocations are in process for those located in the north east . "
good,"They claim to promote work life balance but its anything but that. The money is great and if you kiss up, advancement is always possible. Give ita try"
good,The company stays out of trouble compared to competitors. The atmosphere is congenial and upper management regularly communicates with employees about current events.
good,Good work-life balance and very professional employees. Recommend this place for professionals looking out for job oppoertunities. Excellent infrastructure.
good,"Απαιτητικό καθημερινό πρόγραμμα."
good,"Allowed to do your own style of work."
good,"It is a constant battle of ""That's not the way we do it"" vs. this is the new way. The jobs are also sold as a way for you to make decisions and influence the outcome. Most positions are only paper pushers and the jobs consist of checking a check box to say you checked a check box. Or have a meeting to discuss what you are going to say at the next meeting"
good,Assisted clients via incoming phone line with inquiries related to Variable Annuity and Life insurance products. I learned listening saves time.  The workplace was a family-like environment.  I have many lasting friendships as a result of my time there.  The hardest part of the job was sitting for long periods of time.  I enjoyed  the team-player attitude of co-workers.
good,"MetLife is a solid brand with many positions. I advanced with the company and pay went up which was nice.However new managers would take over all the time, some good, some bad."
good,It was a laid back place to work. The management was easy to work with.  The only problem is the Top Management decided that they no longer wanted an office in Nevada and has closed the office.
good,"Excelente Formacion Comercial."
good,"MetLife offers great benefits and perks to working for the company. There are some great managers, but also poor managers, they dont make it easy to grow in the business and push you to expand your knowledge"
good,"it was really busy work , i learned to work under pressured , deal with many task in same time ,be fox all time .management was good i like it as it was my first time multinational organization . work place was organized the hardest part was how to do a lot of task in limited time with accurate output  .i enjoy saw my self learning  and updated"
good,I had a blast working here. However the lack of vision got in the way of having success in the new direction MetLife was going. I loved some of the people I worked with as well as the knowledge I gained.
good,Great company to me. Supporting surrounding in that company. All are had Good communication and helpful seniors to juniors.  Work time flexibility was good to me.
good,"Es una empresa con posibilidades de desarrollar tu carrera en un ambiente amable, con buenos compañeros."
good,"Metlife had a very favorable work environment and job advancement possibilities. Enjoyable place to work, they valued employees ideas/change in work flow concepts. Metlife chose to relocate south."
good,"Good worklife balance, good salary. Lots of extra curricular activities and groups to join. Good benefits, health, dental, 401K. Recently lower morale due to change in management."
good,"They kept changing the bonus structure, carrot and stick, so to speak. Hours were alright, but rotated in such a manner as to negate any private life."
good,"Fast Paced, heavy client interaction, client support "
good,"Metropolitan has a great environment, great culture and tries their best to make sure that their employees are comfortable. However, for someone that's competitive, wants to move forward and wants to see the organisation that they work for take bold steps, Metropolitan has been modest in those. They're careful in considering new steps which may at times lead to them being left behind in the industry"
good,"A companhia ao longo dos anos tem se mostrado aderente aos novos formatos de trabalho, trazendo modelos de contrato como horário flexivel, banco de horas e home office, além de oferecer diversos treinamentos de acordo com a necessidade do momento. Todas as decisões da empresa são tomadas em modelo de colegiado, e em alguns casos, a aprovação fica a cargo de estruturas regionais ou globais. Se por um lado há maior segurança nas decisões, por outro a velocidade que as mesmas são tomadas verificam-se lentas."
good,"Overall I would say MetLife as a company is great. PTO days awesome, pay awesome!  Great holiday parties. good benefits and room for advancement if you're that person."
good,"Horario ingreso 8:15"
good,Metlife was a good company to work with.The management and colleagues were helpful and supportive. Learned how to process claims.
good,Wanting to start a job to turn into a career? This would be a great for you. Don't wait...start your path to success today!
good,"lo que aprendí fue como hacer cotización de algún seguro, mis compañeros muy amables, lo que mas me gusto es que había un buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"worked long hours to meet our goals but it was worth it.  We all worked together as a team."
good,"MetLife is good company from the  Job Security prespective, however need to work on the Compensations part."
good,"MetLife is a good place to work, but the advancement opportunities in the St. Louis Market are few and far between.  The new management regime is a nice change from what it used to be."
good,"el trabajar en el area de afores es un poco complejo por lo dificil del tema, tenia que estudia y leer constantemente para actualizarme en cuanto a informacion que le tenia que dar al cliente. al cliente siempre lo asesore con la verdad. y la satisfaccion de poder asesorar a un cliente es algo que como persona te lo agradece la gente. "
good,"Nice work place and management. Some politics and visibility issue."
good,"Mi horario laboral es de lunes a viernes  7am a 10 am en la empresa, de ahi en adelante se hacen la visitas con los clientes durante todo el dia cerrando  negocios o prospectando clientes, aprendi a ser muy fuerte en la parte comercial, creo ser experta en ventas tanto de intangibles como tangibles, lo mas dificil de mi trabajo es el tiempo debido a que muchas veces tocaba visitar clientes tarde en la noche y el tiempo con mi familia no era mucho, eso ha generado que en este momento busque otra alternativa laboral, en el cual me gustaria desempeñarme nuevamente en la parte administrativa, debido al tema de horarios fijos."
good,"Very busy days, excellent co-workers, work/home balance not great, best part of the job is working with my co-workers."
good,Like the employees and customers I work with.  Managers at the company don't have the employees backs much but as long as the work get's done they don't seem to bother you.
good,"good company overall, but push based on production over quality.  People very nice."
good,"My position at Metlife was as a customer service representative.  I was able to learn so much from this position.  I was responsible for answering incoming calls from our policy holders.  They would call to ask questions about their policy (what is and isn't covered).  I would also answer their questions about billing. Cancel policies when requested and fix any issues from previous mistakes."
good,Great place to work. Great people and great compensation for work performed. Gives opportunities to get involved in new things.
good,"Good company, allows to maintain work and family balance. Huge variable income opportunity. Flexible hours to work. Overall good atmosphere to work."
good,"MetLife embraces the L.E.A.N model. Great benefits, perks. Work environment can be highly stressful and company seems to put more emphasis on production than on customer satisfaction. Great teams to work with but pretty negative attitudes all around. Improving training but still has a long way to go."
good,"A typical day includes multiple administrative tasks. I have learned to prioritize tasks and that good customer service is very important. The management is always willing to listen and is very helpful. My co-workers are outstanding; a fun, helpful and hardworking group. The hardest part of my job is, at times, the work load can be very heavy. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing relief in the voice of a client after a process has been explained thoroughly or when a client expresses their appreciation for my help."
good,"This was to be a permanent position, however changed to only a 6 month temp job. Training for the position was lacking and management was less that supportive it expanding training for new information when was added to the job requirements. "
good,"good money"
good,"un dia te levantas a la hora que te hayas organizado un dia antes o ya sea que hagas planeacion semanal o mensual."
good,MetLife is a great company to work for. It is a huge global company that believes in offering their employees a balanced work life.
good,"Worked for three great sales representatives in the wealth management division but were hired by them directly and not MetLife specifically (outsourced), therefore, my benefit cost were very high and what I got paid came out of the salesperson's own pocket.  Love working with the software, great support network.  Enjoyed learning the life and annuity part of the business."
good,"Metlife is a company one should explore and experience. The profile varies from department to department but the opportunity is same within the company for all. It opens a way for learners to learn more and develop self esteem. Work has always been bound with hardship and responsibilities everywhere but to ease the nature of it, Metlife gives you more in return to make it a better place for all. I am fortunate to have a life with Metlife and thankful for the time it gave me."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is ' sky is a limit to earn'. A day at Met Life which I will never forget, when I closed one case and earned incentives of Rs 2L and at the same time got qualified for Hero Honda. The key skill of this job is to lead and manage a team. Working with my co workers is like living with a family at work.The hardest part of this job is working till late. The ejoyable part is the in built system which makes work easy so also the incentives which always add extra income at home"
good,Good Place to work. I have no real complaints. I would still be working there if I didn't need to relocate.
good,"Daily task is all about office administration handling the sales team about approximately 90 field agents. including of total 8.5 years experience of front office operations handling walk in clients ,processing new application handling day to day queries making daily cash collection reports and coordinating in between branch office and head office."
good,"En esta experiencia he aprendido que los seguros son un trabajo muy noble, y que la gente que esta al frente de estas empresas requiere de una gran calidad humana, para entender a su grupo de trabajo. Mis superiores son gente asi, que me han enseñado en estos años que al cliente hay que tratarlo con esa disposicion y compromiso."
good,"Here you will find ton of challenging work which will help you if you want to learn."
good,"There is no typical day as a financial advisor/financial services representative.  I recommend that you treat this ""job"" as your own business, because you do not get paid unless you get results, being that you are 100% commissioned based.  You will be given eLeads to call, but the most successful people have a marketing and business plan to grow their practice.  "
good,"MetLife has become more structured. It was a loose environment, no one cared about what you did, until the year 2010. Now they do annual reports or survey's on employees to see what they did the past year, and what they hope to accomplish in the upcoming year. Most everyone just copy and pastes what they had the previous report to their manager's. Everyone cares only about themselves and their own lives. If you want to hang out for happy hour, 80- 90 percent of the employees would rather go home and not hang around their co workers. Once your at work, put on your fake smiles because payday is twice a month."
good,"Good Work place, Do your work and your good to go, no problems"
good,"1.Productive and Classical workplace"
good,I have had the opportunity to work with Metlife for over seven years and I have learned to work with people and build relationships throughout the years and because of this I was a great resource for my clients.  I felt proud to know that my clients had trust in knowing that I was one that they can rely on and get the job done.  My motto is to learn my job to the best of my ability and in turn be able to provide the best customer service to my clients.  Building rapports with my clients is so very important to me because it not only make me feel good about my job but helps the company look good as well.
good,"In my most recent position at MetLife as a Claim Support Specialist, I was afforded the opportunity to pass along my knowledge to new hires and guide them to a successful career."
good,"After 5 years at Met Life, the company overhauled the organization and shifted over 3,500 people down to the Southeast US.  Many of us were affected by the move and were not offered re-location.  It's a shame that it occurred like this as I was ready to finish out my career at this company.  It was a great place to work."
good,"huge sales pressure by branch manager,"
good,"Metlife is very diversified and a fun place to work. I enjoyed the company of my licensing and registration team as there was a lot of corporation and team work. "
good,A typical day consisted of answering calls and documenting information.
good,During my employment at MetLife I developed a vast network with all associates and management.   Which enabled me to experience different products and services we offer our customers.
good,"MetLife is a tremendous company that prides itself on the core values it was founded on over 143 years ago. The company is designed to recruit and retain brokers and support staff, then train them with all the necessary methods and tools. "
good,"My job with MetLife is enjoyable as I talk to financial advisers all across the country to see if I can help them identify clients who have wealth transfer concerns and how MetLife products can help them. "
good,excellent career opportunity and great place to work and learn.
good,"Metlife Auto and Home was a good place to work. They had excellent training and benefits. Salary compensation was good. Unfortunely the Lowell, Massachusetts office is closing and I could not perform my job from home. So I was laid off."
good,"MetLife was a great place to work. The culture was one of inclusion and the people were friendly, hardworking and productive."
good,"Loved working here, but management was terrible. This is a typical corporate world working in environment and it will tear you to pieces if you are not ready for this world. Felt like working in a highschool. However, I loved the work I did. Promoted to work from home after one year, so really didnt have to deal with working with an office environment."
good,A typical day at work for me presented new and exciting challenges.
good,Working with MetLife is truly a corporate learning experience. Gained networking skills with agencies and internal customers.
good,Working at MetLife as a Client Service Consultant position was a great learning experience. It gave me the opportunity to work with the customers and brokers. In my past experience in the healthcare industry I worked more behind the scenes. My co-workers were very knowledgible and helpful when it came to assisting me with questions or directing me to where I might find the information needed. I enjoyed the interaction with multiple departments within the company.
good,Traditional insurance company. Very stable and very strong. Good for those who want to work in insurance and finance.
good,Full time job no specific time
good,took inbound phone call all day. co workers were great. the company is a fortune 500 company
good,"another good place to work, an friendly co-workers. definitely would of wanted to pursue my career there, but was only a temp job."
good,"As an HR assistant, I learn how to select, through out a guideline and knockout factors."
good,"I was hired only a few months prior to the announcement of the entire division being cut/laid off. The work was very rewarding, and management was superb. MetLife offered a lot of freedom to build your own business and thrive in an entrepreneurial environment."
good,"Very corporate type environment all the time, lunch meetings frequently, mandatory sales meetings, a lot of traveling, cold calling, hit or miss."
good,"Reasonable compensation within industry. Good benefits. Knowledgeable & professional staff that will cross responsibilities when another team needs assistance, Generally flexible group. Company philosophy & dynamics have changed over the years, more consolidation of work practices, but still a good place to work."
good,As long as you did your work management waws fair to you and the other associates. You knew what was expected and what saturdays you would have over time.
good,"Gave good lunches,and also had a gym. Was able to work in a few departments."
good,"As work was moved offshore, headcount ruled. So what happened is they went with the headcount, never taking into account that offshore would be sending work back onshore for handling known as referrals. End result onshore does not have enough associates to do the work that was left, and now has also to do the work sent back from offshore. And is then being held accountable for not making the targets. Offshore is not being held accountable and Customer Service is suffering as is the morale of the onshore associates. And the supervisors and managers onshore are between the rock and hard place. Being told too much overtime is being used, why is your team not making its goal. Meanwhile defects in the systems that are over a year old still not being fixed which is not helping the situation. End result will be middle management will be held accountable and let go, as senior management will not admit that any part of the issue was theirs in moving more headcount offshore than they should have."
good,"Great place to get your feet wet in the insurance industry. Provided a great work life balance. Met only hires the best people, all in all a great place to work!"
good,"Great organization and support.  There's  a lot of interesting work to be completed.  Transformation projects, new accounting standards and technical enhancements are all initiatives by the company."
good,"It is a good company to work with but it has less opportunities of learning new things. Management is like other companies not that good, give more chances to people who do buttering. Earlier the Salary packages were less but now they are offering good packages."
good,This company is a good company to work for.  I like the cost of living adjustment granted to my salary each year.  I was given the opportunity to choose my work schedule.  I recommend this company.
good,Good place to work and there is lot of learning opportunities in the company. Bit pressure now waydays as they are implementing cost control mechanism
good,"MetLife is a great company once you get in. However, the interview process takes months. For my last job, the interview/recruitment process lasted about 4 months before I received the offer. In addition, they don't tell you if you haven't gotten the position, you are left to deduce that. They go through constant restructuring so the job security level is quite low."
good,"MetLife is still a conservative company and is best for employees who want a 'good, corporate' job. Not very progressive nor open to new innovations. Good benefits. Pay is not competitive compared to competitors"
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Very good people to work for and the management for the most part really seem to care about the employees.  Although an established company, they have many of the same issues a smaller or even startup would encounter.  There is definitely plenty of work to do."
good,"- Strong focus on Technology and Talent management"
good,"Great benefits and pay . "
good,No thank you do not have time. . I do not care to continue explaining.  My co-workers were great but upper management did not think about the workers who dedicated them selves to the company.
good,"A empresa tem bom nivel de beneficios, salários na media de mercado, clima muito bom. Ainda há alguns favoritismos, pois os mesmos colaboradores são os reconhecidos."
good,Management was more focused on social cliques. Had to he a friend to get anywhere. This was just a problem with junior managers but once you went above them everything was fine. Overall great company.
good,"I worked with great people who pitch in and help out when needed. The managament is supportive and will listen to ideas for making the job better.  PTO time is good, but taking time off is difficult due to work load."
good,About what you would expect working for a large company.  Some great employees and some senior management who you can only scratch your head at.  Company mostly focused on being compliant and avoiding lawsuits to protect the brand.  Legacy systems and SOPs hinder new growth.  Go to a smaller company or broker if that is your focus.  Middle Management has no real power so get to know your VPs (or become one) if your considering a long employment history with MetLife.  Also embrace change - It is constant.
good,"Employees were expected to produce every day and keep their numbers up. It was a very isolating job. Employees were very nice, when you had a chance to talk to them."
good,"no comment at this time"
good,"Since I have not been with MetLife since the sale of their agency distribution system and broker dealer to MassMutual (which resulted in the layoff of the entire sales team), I cannot give an unbiased review of MetLife anymore."
good,Was never sure who was steering the ship. Culture created quite a bit of internal conflicts. Very channelized. Dealt with pan sponsors and financial advisers on large retirement cases.
good,"But - it is corporate america and you cannot trust them not to move your job out of state which is exactly what they did to my entire division, and others."
good,"Pay is average with great benefits and plenty of Paid Time Off.  The culture is great and the company caters in breakfast, lunches and diners on a regular basis."
good,The company has changed significantly since my departure many years ago due to acquisitions and subsequent divestitures. An iconic brand with strong values.
good,"MetLife offers great benefits such as healthcare, 401K and even a pension plan. Flex-time is also available on a departmental basis. Some drawbacks are management's inability to listen to the workers who identify issues and possible solutions which, in some instance, result in reactive measures as opposed to being proactive. This generally results in rush work and longer work hours than necessary."
good,"I worked at MetLife only for a few months as a contractor, but the team I worked with is very memorable for their dedication and their care of MetLife customers."
good,"I worked on many good projects with really smart and dedicated people. Very team-oriented atmosphere in the beginning and there are opportunities for learning and advancement. Over the years though, worker morale and job quality suffered due to multiple reorganizations, reductions in force, changing priorities at MetLife, and company relocations. Life/work balance is good and overall the company is flexible with the ability to telecommute. Pay is average, but they provide good benefits. Overall, it was a positive work experience that slowly deteriorated due to the loss of good coworkers and management to whom I had developed strong relationships. Focus of company has shifted and many feel that the company is searching for an identity."
good,"Comfortable work environment. Flexible hours and sometimes overtime opportunities. Good and spacious facilities. Good security as a good parking area. Good variety of cooked meals, salads, soups, beverages and healthy snacks."
good,my normal day consisted of taking up to 35-40 calls per day helping clients with any and all questions or concerns about their dental insurance and then completed all data about calls. I learned how to work better with a team which ended up being fun. The only hard part about the job was learning all the systems
good,Wonderful work experience. Miss my Metlife family in NJ. Wish I could have retired there. Hours were flexible. Salary was a decent living wage. It was a the best job EVER!
good,"Modern work environment. Good technology."
good,"Los agentes de seguros disfrutan de muchos beneficios, sin embargo considero que es un trabajo de tiempo completo, pero el ambiente laboral es buenísismo."
good,Very structured guidelines. Always very busy. Lot of overtime. Union rules applied. employees were happy for the most part. The pay was very good. Pretty flexible hours. There was room for promotion.
good,"Would return to work here. Liked the flex schedule and work from. Paid time off, holidays and benefits were a huge bonus. Lots of opportunities for advancement."
good,"It was a standard corporate environment with not many highs or lows. It was a bland company. A typical day would be arrive at 9am, review emails and execute the reporting needed for the day. Lunch at 12 and home at 5pm. Nothing special or stressful."
good,"In the IT department, we participated in over five meetings per day, including meetings to prepare for other meetings. We were part of a global department with internal clients in a number of European countries. Our external development partners were based in India, so we were given the flexibility to work from home in order to facilitate complex scheduling needs. "
good,The office was like a family and I am still close friends with many people I met during my time there. Also there was a lot of support from management. If you worked hard and did your job well you were given freedom for continuing education and ad hoc projects.
good,It was an okay experience new technology was coming into play. Nice people to work with. Making the shift to becoming more flexible in the technology space internally.
good,Metlife is a global leader the  insurance and financial services industry leveraging innovative technological solutions to strengthen market share.  The workplace culture is one in which team work and collaboration are encouraged.
good,Fast pace a lot of changes in management.  Changes every week due to system updates . Good Disability products .  Opportunity to work remotely.  Ample space.
good,I loved working for MetLife but wished there was more opportunity to advance. My direct supervisor worked hard to help me improve on my managerial skill set as well as being a student of my business.  My experiences at MetLife helped me hone my skills as a manager and more importantly as a business analyst.
good,Had a very good experience working in Metlife. They provided a lot of training and even language courses for expat employees. Good salary for those hard working individuals.
good,"Considero que no hay tiempo para la vida personal, pero en es una gran compañia"
good,I enjoyed the people and work environment along with the job itself. It was when Metlife started selling off parts of the company and initiated layoffs is when it all went down hill.
good,Met Life is a leader in worldwide financial services and a professionals run company. The Canadian operations were bought out and amalgamation took place several times over around the turn of the millennium.
good,Position evolved over the last number of years and morphed into something much different than when I began in the role.  Organizational changes created disturbances and morale decreased.
good,I really enjoy the flexibility and support I receive at MetLife. The only downside is that it's 100% commission making it difficult to budget and pay bills due to the uncertainty of resources. I work really hard but it does not always produce a sale for me to get paid. This is the only reason I am in search of something else with more security.
good,"Very few advancement options in Atlanta area. Overall good benefits and competitive salary. Good location and flexible schedule,  ability to telecommute is a plus."
good,"Overall Metlife Insurance Company, is a great company. Very diversified company with a lot of empathy, company has website for employees to achieve next level with in company"
good,"Entreprise à forte croissance dans le domaine de l'assurance crédit et de la prévoyance, MetLife sait prendre soin de ses salariés en leur donnant les outils et les méthodes nécessaires à leur tâches. "
good,The people were always friendly. I was a student at the time and they always worked around my schedule. The pay is competitive for the area and the benefits started day one
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Metlife Disability. Everyone rallied together, was kind, and committed to their work. I wish the branch had never shut down. The most enjoyable part of the job was how collaborative it had to be. Disability Insurance requires so much on the perspective of interpretation that it forces you to become better at understanding and considering other's points of view before delivering a decision. I learned how to develop relationships and trust agents I'd never met, but would have to reassure every week. I improved at how to deal with disrespectful agents in a way that helped them achieve what they were looking for while not misrepresenting myself or the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was just how often each person on staff got the opportunity to come through and help a coworker with problem solving a particular case. Best team atmosphere I've experienced in a work place."
good,Metlife is a good company to work for  with great benefits and salary. My day  working at Metlife dealing with metlife agents and brokers. Management was good always available ( open door policy).The most enjoyable part of job was my co-workers. The hardest part of job was telling agents and brokers their client ws declined for coveasge.
good,Overall MetLife was a great place to work.  The management there is fair and supports your growth.  You will work long hours at times depending on your department.
good,Nothing at this time. Everything was good. I had a great team and I enjoyed my sales team and brokers. The benefits were good and I met friends for a lifetime there
good,"I really enjoyed working at MetLife, I was a contract worker so I'm not familiar with the policies and procedures of the full time employees. I experience a family oriented atmosphere, management was involved and encourage employee to do the same. There was a sense of loyalty and respect that was present at all time. I would have love to be a permanent employee."
good,"Very good benefits.  I was a commissioned sales rep.  My income was based on my performance of life insurance, annuities and mutual funds.  They gave you the where to get the information but the manager I had was more about the sales rather than the sales process.  I learned from this job.  It was a great opportunity to develop myself as a leader and manager."
good,Put more confidence in your employees. Promote expanding employee knowledge. Play an active role in impacting your employees' career outlook. Give employees the chance to take on more responsibility - allow them to make mistakes and be there to help them to identify where they went wrong and how to move forward. Make everyone feel like a leader.
good,"Buena empresa "
good,Relocation to Raleigh and Charlotte lost an enormous amount of knowledge in IT and other areas in the company.  The savings could have been achieved by consoldating multiple office locations within the Northeast.
good,"Good experience overall. "
good,"I enjoyed working with my last team and manager. They were all wonderful individuals. They compensation and benefits were reasonable. MetLife would have team building exercises. outings, special events to show their appreciation for their employees."
good,Empresa en crecimiento con un reto importante para mantener el negocio público. Buen ambiente laboral y con oportunidades de desarrollo
good,"Great Place to work. It gives you complete work life balance. Great working environment. Various learning opportunity.. You are well supported by your seniors. This organization support various NGO's. "
good,La empresa en buena tiene un buen ambiente laboral
good,"New employee, may not stay due to passing a difficult licensing exam. The people I've met are very supportive and positive. Overall it seems a great company to work for."
good,"It was one of my best jobs. Worked well with others"
good,I don't really have much to say about working at MetLife.  It can be stressful at times. They try to make you feel like you are a part of the big picture.  I can honestly say I enjoyed my team/co-workers.
good,Provided case review for disability claims.  Very detail oriented.  Need to have good knowledge base of nursing.  Need to be able to meet quota of claims per day.
good,"The benefits were average, the compensation was average but the work-life balance was better than any company I have ever worked with before. The managers were fair and attempted to provide you with a fair assessment of your work"
good,Buen ambiente laboral y personal  ambiente agradable.
good,"MetLife is a wonderful place the work. The people are friendly and there is so much learning to do.  You always do something different at MetLife. Learning is the key, and you will always learn if you are in the back end of the company doing administrative duties."
good,"Nice place to work, Their training and development is jump in and go on your with little to no guidance. Everyday was different so you are never just on one thing."
good,"Gran equipo de trabajo y excelentes condiciones de clima laboral,ingresé en un momento de resstructuración de la empresa en mi área por lo que rápidamente fuimos reinsertados en diferentes sucursales. Planificación diaria, reuniones en conjunto, actividades sociales y mucho apoyo de gestión,"
good,"Metlife is a very good company.Good work,Great Work life balance."
good,What I did like was that no one day is the same. I did learn that you have to be a go-getter in the company. The work place was laid back but everyone was willing to show you the job.  The hardest part was the not knowing if they were going to hire me permantely
good,"Over all MetLife was a great place to work. I would recommend Metlife to anyone. The people were great to work with, job load was fair, hours were within the norm; occasionally, you might have to put in long hours."
good,"MetLife was a good place to work for many years. The benefits were generous and the company did a lot to revamp salaries to market standards."
good,"Earlier was working off-Rolls for the company & depending on the performance was taken on-Rolls,the hardest part was to satisfy customers.we had a good understanding b/n management & employees."
good,"My department was allowed to get our work done without constant micromanagement. "
good,"A decent place to work.  Depending on the position, there is the option to work from home.  Conscious of the work/life balance by offering flex time."
good,"Great benefits and pay, as with any corporate america job employment is stable until the business demands otherwise. Awesome coworkers and advancement opportunity."
good,It is a good entry level job. Managers are nice and the culture is great. Significant amount of PTO. Limited amount of Personal Growth/Advancement Opportunities.
good,"I was employed with MetLife CO. from 2/2004 - 5/ 2004. I was hired as a temp. through a temp. agency.    I was in the Finance department hired as a Communication Clerk...I  did data entry entering change of addresses in Company data base for their current clients...I had a great boss and co-workers were the best to work with...Very helpful.   "
good,"I joined this company as a Desktop support. now I am willing to troubleshoot various technical issues related to desktop and network domain. I learned new things like how ticketing tool works in company."
good,"Good place to work overall, not much room for advancement."
good,"Constantly reorganizing enough so that changes don't have time to take effect.  Good Benefits, Flexible schedule, casual attire.  Overall it is a superior place to work.  I enjoyed working there until the last couple of years."
good,"typical work day fast paced"
good,During my time at Met Life I enjoyed many aspects of my job. I enjoyed getting the opportunity to work with numbers and help people understand their policy.
good,"We used to have fun with work. This would increase our energy and we use to feel active for entire day."

This was not the Temp company fault for Met-Life had set up the contract with them.   I only worked with them once.  They sent me to Met-Life in Warwick.  My job tittle was  Data Entry Clerk.

Though you go into your office thinking about meetings that you need to attend, calls that need to be made and emails that need to be returned, in my role as a supervisor, within the first hour of every day my ""outline of the day"" would change.  I would need to anticipate associates calling out for sick time, those on vacation days and other unexpected items.

good,"Enjoyed my time there.  Change at times is hard.  Mid to large market sales makes the world tick and they drive the agenda.  Change at times is difficult as while they have been successful, moving to enhance opportunities is met with some resistance.  Company is very strong in its Product and Underwriting areas."

good,"We have a chance to advance working  on different programs on the pc to work with visitors & staff.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off when it is time to leave. I've earn a lot since I been there. We have advanced our visitation system. Our goal is to transfer or paper work to paperless.Some managers are easy to get along with , the hardest part of the job is to register visitors in the system when you have alot people to put in your system at a short period of time."
good,Very demanding and overall stressful day. Teams compete with one another on a regular basis. Changes in life insurance underwriting take place every few months.
good,"I was brought on board during the company's transition from being a mutual company with little performance oversight and very mixed skill levels to a publicly traded stock company needing to compete with world-class financial institutions.  My role was to create an I/T function and ongoing support for an area in which I have high subject-matter expertise."

good,"I enjoy working for MetLife, however I believe it could be better.  It's not horrible, but it's not great.  It's a balance between the two.  The one thing I enjoy is  that in my department, there is work-life-balance, peak season that can be very stressful, great pto and paid holiday, an annual bonus (that could potentially go away), but the pay may not always be that great; but it's not  the lowest  either.  If your in the right department, have great management, you will reap the benefits of all things.  Overall, it's a job!  I have better and I've had worse."

good,"Great Company to work for with great benefits.  But, you would need to be flexible with all the changes going on. Depending what your position,  there is Work from Home availability."
good,"This is a place where you can start your career.  If you want something that is very repetitive you can go with the CSC position. The pay is ok but the repetition day in and day out can be draining, to say the least."
good,"MetLife offers great pay, benefits and security.  The morale of the employees could be higher - especially in the Greenville office.  If senior management was more involved in the overall satisfaction of the employees' happiness, the culture would be much better."

good,The company itself is very responsive to how you as an employee do on the job. There are constant reviews and opportunities to improve your work. The management is responsive and friendly and will be nice about it if you have made a mistake. The job I was in was the I.A.T. and it was good work. Friendly people on the phone and a great opportunity to help and listen to people.
good,"It is a challenging environment with very knowledgeable co-workers.  You need to be able to multi-task and prioritize because there are always several major projects in the pipeline.

good,"El ambiente laboral y el trato amable son características de la empresa, es un buen lugar para trabajar, es un reto el trato con la gente, porque toca atender personas con diversos problemas y hay que tratar de resolverlos de la mejor manera tanto para la empresa como para la persona involucrada.

good,"its been really great working with such a big company,Metlife alico which is an American life insurance company i worked there as an insurance consultant for about one year and i did quite well,its difficult to sell a life insurance but if someone has an ability and confident to do that they can rule the world on roast....onething i would like to include for some rude senior manager's that they should know the quality of good leadership and consider their employees as a profession instead of treating them like a slave sometime,thats all i can say "

good,"Generally, a typical day would include anywhere from 3-5 claims inspections per day starting at 8am. I learned to put my orginaztional skills to work to schedule these appointments throughout the Memphis metropolitan area. I would inspect, discuss, evaluate and write an estiamte of damages and pay the insured either with a check or electronically based upon my estimate of damages. I enjoyed my co-workers and my interaction with management. It only became difficult when there was a company wide re-evaluation of jobs and everyone had to re-apply for their position. although, I retained my position, I was under new management which had a difficult time in adjusting to the new position. I traveled outside of my area about 40% of the time. The job was not hard and the experience was a positive one for me. I learned how to deal with an ever changing dynamic of the corporate philosphy and still have a positive outlook on things when they do not go my way."
good,I've enjoyed working for MetLife for the past 7 years. I'm in a position that I need to find a new career due to them moving my office out of state. 
good,"Summer internship at Metlife Bank"
good,MetLife is an okay company. If you're looking for a place to stay for a while MetLife may be the right place.  Advancement can be difficult depending on the job and who you work for.  If you can be 'best friends' with your management you have a chance otherwise you could be liked but ignored a great deal of the time.  Depending on the management there may be a lot of consultants around which can limit the opportunities for employees as far as expanding skills.  There's a chance to work from home if you're interested and in the right area.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo mi jefe y  compañeros son personas trabajadoras y agradables,  es una trabajo donde constantemente aprendes tramites y cosas relacionadas con instituciones de gobierno ya sea IMSS e INFONAVIT y esto ayuda ser mejor trabajadorLo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es que obtienes buenas comisiones y que puedes orientar  a tus clientes  con respecto de tramites como jubilación o pensión. Lo que no me gusta es que son demasiados requisitos los que necesitamos para  complementar el tramite de traspasos de cuestas de afore a afore  y muchos clientes no están dispuestos a  hacerlos  y por eso se pierde la venta."

good,"Reviewed applications and performed complete background checks and confirm integrity of company and officers/owners.

With the many changes and diversity in the mortgage business working close to management and communicating w/co- workers were a must."

I was one of the lucky ones that was able to stay with the company until the very end. They started to lay of employees in January & I stayed on until May 31st.

MetLife was fair notifying us of the layoffs months ahead of time, offering a generous severance package and allowing time for us to interview with other companies during business hours."
good,I appreciated all of the leaders that assisted me in my learning new skills and positioning me to enhance my career.  The team culture was great and the workload was a balanced for the most part.

good,It was a okay place to work.     My supervisor was the best supervisor and my co-workers were very supportive. The work was not very challenging and growth wasn’t incouraged.
good,What was a great company became a shell of itself after the major sell off of the Premier client Group (Advisors and Agencies).  The focus was on shareholders and stock price and not the longevity of the company.
good,"MetLife is fairly standard in terms of its employment practices. I would never want to be a manager there, as a lot is expected of managers and there is not a lot of latitude to deploy changes and improvements that do not come as orders from upper management. Being an individual contributor was fine, and for the last 8 years I was fortunate to have very good people-managers."
good,Currently work 10-12 hour days speaking with various Issuers and MetLife Front Office Analyst in regards to re-registrations. Spend most of my day writing emails and updating wire instructions for various clients and MetLife entities with Paying Agents.

Only downfall was hired in to one schedule the company decided to put a rule forcing one Saturday a month and one late night schedule per wk.
good,"The new Office in Cary is state of the art. It is Metlifes attempt at creating a google-esque environment. Architecturally at least they achieved this. "
good,"Working in insurance is hard enough, but being the first point of contact with all of the customers can either make or break your day. Most people are very uneducated about insurance and as a claims adjuster you are ridiculed simply for doing your job. On a daily basis you are called names and yelled at because of lack of education surrounding insurance. Management creates an enjoyable office culture by recognizing, thanking, and rewarding their employees for the work they do, almost as if they are trying to hide how horrible your job is. It is appreciated how hard they work to keep you coming back and they are very very good at it. It is definitely a tolerable job because you get to work with great people. But if you can't multitask, handle stress, or getting called names on a daily basis. this is not the job for you."
good,"enjoyed helping and talking with our Military Troops. Daily working alongside my coworkers, we made a difference with every person that called into the center."
good,MetLife was a good place to work for training and career advancement.    I enjoyed my work and performed well.  I moved up quickly within the company and was highly satisfied with my job.
good,"very stressful, micro managed, fast paced. I have learned alot regarding Group Life Insurance. Company has great benefits. Good for long time work for a career"
good,"Great company with extensive perks I received numerous benefits while working at MetLife and gained experience in Group Benefits despite the 2-week crash course I was first given. The company did start a more elaborate training program however due to numerous customer account changes and the daily ops being inconsistent. Metrics and compliance goals were constantly changed to achieve the daily goals and meet the needs of the new customer contracts. Which during my time caused a high employee turn over in the department. Leadership also needed additional mentoring on how to properly implement interpersonal skills. The office attire worn was also a constant issue as to which corporate emails were frequently sent, especially during warmer seasons. I found MetLife to be a great a company to get your foot in the door unless you're already in the Industry or in a Leadership Role. The pay rate does start low compared to others in the industry but it's still competitive. Career advancement is available but due to favoritism, it appears it's given to the same people at this particular office location."
good,"Met Life was an excellent and fun company to work for,  they gave you the opportunity for job advancement within the company, training and schooling to move around in the company,"
good,"Capture the client information on the system, and to service the existing clients."
good,"Company was great but sold to Mass Mutual.  Had Wi rooms and quite space, team environment, management was there to assist when needed but also gave room for free thought.  Provided a modern work space."
good,"This job can definitely be stressful but the pay is good and the benefits are great. The environment is awesome though, we had many potlucks, team meetings, job parties, etc. I made a lot of friends."
good,"Great company to work for but in P&C there is such a high turnover rate due to stress of trying to hit your metrics but also still be customer centric, as well as the work/life balance due to schedules."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my internship at MetLife. My supervisor was great and offered to assistant whenever I was in need.  I was able to take advantages of a few of the online training courses. Had there been full time positions available i would have without a doubt applied.
good,"There are days I love my job. But many days I hate it. I feel like I'm only working for a corporation, not a customer/client. It's as if my position has lost its true purpose. I am paid very well for what I do, which is a positive. And my direct boss is amazing - they are laid back, realistic, rational, and flexible. Some other leaders are not as easy going, which makes my actual job difficult. Bonuses each year are based on performance; I have gotten some great bonuses, though I don't agree with how they are determined. It isn't always fair to others who have gone above and beyond what their role dictates. Overall, I have learned a lot at Met, though I'm not sure I will ever be able to get out of this industry."
good,I enjoyed my time with Metlife. I worked with good people who did their best to approach work with positive attitudes. It is a company that wants to be better.
good,"I enjoyed working in Metlife. "
good,MetLife is a houshold name. They are a leader in the Life insurance business. A good company to work for. A big conglomerate with global presence. Definitely consider MetLife if you are in the insurance business.
good,I have worked there as a contractor and my time was ok there. I left the company because my contract was ended. I liked there work culture. Management try to care there employees in this company.
good,The days are long and there's more work than hours in the day. Management is awesome though and extremely supportive. The hardest part of the job is learning how to do it as there is no formal training program.
good,"I certainly loved my time working for MetLife however, the strict structure of the demand of the job did not allow for adequate time off to enjoy life."
good,They do take care of their employees for the most part. Just real strict which is why they have a high turnover. They give the option to work overtime and feed you when you do.
good,"I had 4 employees under my supervision, the object of the work day was to meet a quota entering insurance claims. the knowledge that I took from that job allowed me to see I work well with people and highly competitive situations. The culture was high paced which it prepared me for my future positions although the hardest part of the job was meeting your Quota (data input) I probably would still be there but it was difficult with 3 small children at home that is the only reason I left the position"
good,"Great work life balance"
good,"excelente capacitación a los empleados, con libertades horarias y proyección laboral"
good,Being in a 24/7 IT environment encouraged the process of restoration in very timely manner.  Great co-workers with good skill sets.  Management always had an open door policy.  Good benefits
good,great company but started with a new group and things weren't in order from the start. Great training program. Great facilities and discounts locally.
good,Lot's of activities / focus on growing GITO in Cary.  Growing global reach of management.  Still a fair amount of legacy resistance to becoming a nimble organization
good,"When I worked for MetLife Home loans it acquired another mortgage servicing company in 2010. Therefore, same people & work environment from the prior company.  This company is no longer in operations."
good,"En general es una Empresa en donde se puede encontrar Estabilidad Laboral, pues la Capacitación Constante te permite estar en Aptitud y Actitud de ofrecer un excelente servicio al Cliente, cuyo resultado se refleja en el logro de Metas de Producción Propuestas y gozar de una Estabilidad Financiera deseable."
good,"Metlife provides for a good work and personal life balance, It support the employees in there growth also provides you with the training supporting your overall and personal growth."

good,"Good place to work, compensation may increase. I learnt so many things in this organization. I have given so many responsibilities which  I was always ready to take and gave my best at all the times."
good,"Each day, our work is fielded through a queue and distributed to the appropriate level associate. In my time working for MetLife I learned the processing of surrendering policies, 1035 exchanges, and loans. I truly enjoy my job. At times the research that is involved can be challenging but for me, that is one of the most interesting parts of my job."
good,"it was a great place to work, you could go in and start work immediately and day went by very fast .  Someone was there to help if needed , excellent benefits and time management skills"
good,"Unfortunately, I worked at the Alpharetta, GA location and this site appears to be relocating to Florida/North Carolina in the next year or so.  Over the years, I've witnessed mass layoffs and forced retirements.  Despite all of that, I really enjoyed my time there, met some amazing people and learned  valuable knowledge about the pension risk transfer industry."
good,Very good employer. Attended various trainings and learnt a lot and got the opportunity to move up the ladder. Overall employee centric and fun place to work
good,groups of hard working individuals working hard for various companies retirement plans.  Many people willing to give extra time to achieve plan goals.
good,"Working at Metlife was very fulfilling as I was able to expand on my skills in my position while assisting the overall company to better the processing in the Statement of Health department. I was lucky to have a manager who believed in assisting his staff with career advancement internally as well as recognizing their skills and utilizing them to better the department and company as a whole. It is a very intense work environment with all of the stats you must meet, however it teaches you along the way to be accurate and efficient. They did have great training programs and offered great benefits. I would recommend working for MetLife."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Some opportunities for advancement. Generous with time off. Benefits are good with minimal annual price increases.
good,good company with nice benefits and advanced technology to work with. nice and friendly management and many lines of business to choose to work for is also good.
good,"Overall a good company, but the higher you advance the more politics you will have to deal with. Poor management can prevent you from doing your job and a successful outcome."
good,Culture is pretty competitive with adequate opportunity for advancement.  Work life balance is very good with various options for telecommuting and shared office arrangements.  Management can be a bit insular but there are talented leaders across the business willing to help and mentor high potentials.
good,"Good place to work for, there is a good balance of work life community.  The culture is relaxed but rewarded by high performance. The benefits are comparable to other companies within the industry.  Management for the most part is off hands allowing to self motivation and self drive for success."
good,Empresa transnacional muy fuerte en el mundo segundo lugar en México en ventas de seguros
good,Nice place to work with onsite cafeteria and gym.  Good environment overall.  Good culture overall with lots of opportunities to get involved in the community via service and over outreach programs.

good,"Working at MetLife was challenging and at times could be intimidating. With that being said I am thankful for each and every experience that I had there. This job has taught me how to talk properly maintain conversation with clientele wether it be face to face, over the phone, or even via email. The challenges in the workplace make sure that you are on your toes at all times. The skills I have been granted from this company have been slowly shaping my career choice over the course of the past 5 years and I would definitely suggest taking the chance with the company. I was in the creative services dept. I not only learned how to properly edit videos, but pictures and graphics as well. Great opportunity and I suggest it to all who plan on sharpening there tools in the creative world as well as the communications world."
good,"I spent several years with MetLife and for the most part they were very good years. I made a lot of friends, became used to daily change in policy and processing."
good,"What can I say, It's a busy restaurant with a beautiful view. Never worked for new management so i'm not sure what I can say about that. I did make a ton of $ there"

I have learned through this job how to use great customer service skills while also problem solving in a short amount of time. Management is always there to be a great support system on questions, examples, and updates to the FMLA process. The culture at MetLife is great! co workers are always there to help you with any question you might have as well as keeping morale high. The hardest  part of the job is handling calls from frustrated patients and keeping calm as some patients at times talk to you as if you're against them. The most enjoyable aspect is when you have helped someone with their claim. Its feels great when you're able to tell a patient the claim is approved and they no longer have that weight on their shoulders on if they'll be covered when they are unable to work, care for a loved one, or spend time with a new baby."

good,Waking up every morning looking for potential clients you'd have to bring on board in as far as signing up for policies. Had to create time to make clients understand the importance of having their lives insured. The difficult part of the job was when you have not been able to secure a single client and have to get a Zero cheque at the end of the month. As a family man with mouths to feed that would be embarrasing. I am grateful for the experince as this was a learning curve

good,Metlife is a place where change is embraced and independent thinking and new ideas are encouraged.  Each day would bring a new challenge.  There was no typical day.  I might be reviewing a critical application for operational excellence or engaging a team of support personnel to solve an application issue.

good,"When I started, we were a small IT shop of gunslingers - direct contact with business partners, coded/unit tested/deployed on our schedule. After assimilation in huge MetLife organization, structured methodology meant more red tape and delays to solve problems. Off-shore staffing model actually meant more problems for employees to solve..."
good,"My day was typically spent on a computer/phone discussing benefits with customers and dental offices. I learned ALOT about dental procedures and how much dental offices can actually make you pay. The management was excellent. We planned food days and went out together as a team. My co-workers were excellent people. Although they were all significantly older than me, they all accepted me in the work place and treated me no different from everyone else. The hardest part of the job was processing certain requests from providers. These requests weren't something that took 2 secondas. They were lengthy requests and having the patience to deal with someone talking to you and processing something quite complicated could be aggrivating at times. But it did teach me to have better patience! I loved that I got to help people better understand their benefits and what they should be paying at the office."

This would definitely help in determining the target on a daily basis and on a monthly basis and even could calculate how would you be able to reach the desired numbers. Team members or the Co workers and the supervisors were always ready to help in case of any difficulties. In case of any issues that had been addressed, we were more likely to get an answer within 48hrs. All in all a great place to work with some good people."
good,"In my position at MetLife Resources I worked a lot in Microsoft Office to develop finalist presentations, managed a database to track our team's development, accountable for deadlines during the RFP process, developed marketing campaigns, and worked with internal and external individuals (consultants and Plan Sponsors).

I was fortunate enough to be an employee with this outstanding firm for nearly nine years. Unfortunately, my position was eliminated during the height of the recession in 2008."
good,"All in all, MetLife in Johnstown, Pa was a decent place to work. It was one of the highest paying jobs you could get without a college degree. Frequently, management would close down the office, hire a DJ and have a party....(Non-alcoholic). They take good care of their empolyees."
good,"At IBM, we don't have any time boundation. We are free to do anything if our work is done. Its a developer friendly workplace with supporting team leads and managers."

good,"I loved my time at MetLife, I worked across two departments within the Claims team and was hired as an intern but remained an intern after almost a year of working with them.

good,"MetLife is a nice place to work,  the pay is good , the benefits are ok , the campus is nice, management is smart and organized, However, its very very difficult to advance,   Why, people never retire,"
good,"While MetLife doesn't promote or pay much attention to career advancement, they have a respectful culture and attempts to make employees feel valued. They offer online courses so you can brush up on Microsoft Office and basic skills, have a competent HR department, and good work/life balance. The NYC office offers a gym, and cafeteria, and promote wellness. They're a solid company to work for with some of the best people."

good,"Most days involved several conference calls involving review around any financial analysis requirements for that week, month or quarter.  A bit of autonomy is allowed to develop or redevelop existing processes to increase efficiency.  On the downside the company is a large corporation and data is provided from several different sources using different formats so it’s a challenge working to get everything in sync.  The most enjoyable part of the day was the free coffee provided in the breakroom."
good,"Fun Team to work with."
good,typical day at work would be going in seeing my coworkers working on the phones recieving calls from customers about there accounts and claims and if they had any questions regarding policy
good,"I started in customer service answering questions about life insurance for about a year.  There was room for advancement and I moved into life insurance claims after that.  I wasn't training to actually pay out life insurance claims after being in the position for a year which was discouraging.  However, I applied and was hired internally in the position of a life insurance report analyst.  I like the job, but I left the company for a better opportunity at another organization outside of Met Life."
good,"*Mi día si era movido o no, dependía 100 % de mi. "

good,"Manejo del tiempo."
good,"Aseguradora multinacional con un muy buen portafolio y respaldo para sus clientes,ofrece a sus colaboradores excelentes programas de formación y desarrollo profesional."
good,"Culture is very good. However, the company is very slow in moving things. It has a lot of baggage in terms of old traditions, needs to shed that to move forward and keep up with the market."
good,"Great company, perks and structured SVP supported mentor program. Some teams are great some are tedious.  The manager makes the difference here. All in all a good company for any career level."
good,"The position was considered virtual licensed agent role. A typical day at work would be taking inbound calls from all around the nation. I would educate customers on a variety of different products, rate the customer, and write policies accordingly."
good,The training room provided an adequate base of knowledge of how to maneuver around the systems at a bare minimum. Immediate supervisors lacked basic knowledge to provide to team members constantly referred to seasoned reps or group chat that was at best a hit or miss for assistance.

good,Verified customer insurance level and gave advice on required changes or updates to an insurance policy and gave a market analyst to other insurance policies.
good,Good Place to work as work life balance is  good here! Salary is less as compare to other companies however its a good learning in terms of one's educations and training. I would like to rate 8/10 as the score of the company!!!!
good,"The Company provided competitive wages and benefits as well as room for advancement. However, there are a lot of ""Lifers"" at Metlife and at times it was extremely challenging to achieve the objectives of my department given their reluctance to change or redefine their roles and responsibilities."
good,it was the best paymaster in the industry. This company dealt with the different type of insurance for people staying in the USA. I worked in 3 tier process as an underwriter and also prepared many useful documents which were helpful in doing the underwriting job more efficiently
good,MetLife has great benefits and a great pension plan but the job is very stressful and repetitive. Most of the time you get back-to-back calls 8 hours a day.
good,"MetLife was a very nice place to work. Training was great, management was wonderful. It's too bad that within a year and a half we got bought by MassMutual and had to be re-trained accordingly."

good,"MetLife provided me with opportunities I never thought I would have and they treated me very well for 19 years. When my position was moved to North Carolina, they gave me 6 months notice, an opportunity to move (I declined) and a very generous severance package.  They made the best of a bad situation for me."
good,"Da cursos buenos dinámicos,  entretenidos, entregan conocimientos"
good,"Never worked for metlife "

good,"The Leadership team within my Department was very supportive in helping me to advance within the Company. "
good,It was a fun place to work with lot of senior people full of knowledge and energy. It was very relaxed work environment which some times was not motivating for people like me who like to work in a fast paced environment.
good,This was a great company to work for and they have great brand recognition.  I only left to pursue other opportunities and this was my very first job in insurance
good,"Great environment to learn, collaborate and affect positive change. Enjoyed multiple stretch opportunities within the organization. Great Charlotte campus."
good,A typical morning work day begins at the MetLife dining hall where you get to interact with all aspects of MetLifes' culture. As a Litigation intern you will learn via observation as well as hands on how to conduct oneself in a legal corporate environment. The end of the internship is hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of being a MetLife intern was the opportunity to speak to attorney's who shared their community college/law school experience and how they became part of MetLife.

good,"Gran empresa , con un sistema de integración de transparencia"
good,"Met is a great company to work for if you have interest in Insurance, annuities, etc. It is a call center environment that will manage every moment of your day. If this is not something you feel comfortable with it can be stressful. There are plenty of opportunities to apply out to however you do have to wait for those jobs to open up. Annual raises and bonus opportunities are a big plus."

good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar en metlife , la gente de administración muy amable y el jefe muy comprometido con su labor."
good,I learned alot at MetLife which led to future sales jobs at Citizens.  We worked on our own without supervision which did not leave much room for mentoring.  Could have learned more.
good,"Era un ambiente bueno con buenos compañeros. Mucha libertad en la forma de trabajo y ganancias sobre comisiones. Lo difícil aquí es la estabilidad de un pago consistente debido a que sólo se puede ganar de las comisiones. Aprendí mucho sobre ventas y las relaciones públicas, presentación, desenvolvimiento oral y escrita. Hay demasiada competencia con otras compañías, lo que no lo hace molesto pero interesante, a veces era difícil seguirles el ritmo."
good,"Metlife is a great company to work for. Unfortunately due to workforce reduction in the KC Home Office, after 15 years of service my position has been eliminated. I'll truly miss the Benefits, flexibility, Remote work permitted, work/Life Balance as they are phenomenal, not to mention the many relationship/friendships that were built. I've grown and learned so much. Never had 1 bad Manager during my tenure here."

good,Spent a lot of time learning how to approach a sales objective from seasoned professionals. Based strictly off commission the opportunities for advancement were what you made the. This gave me a first hand look at the effort needed to really move the needle. Management did a good job at equipping their staff with the necessary tools to be successful making sure they were both current and concise. It was most enjoyable to see how much revenue can be generated as a result of collective effort.
good,"This is a great place to work and has an amazing culture but this company is experiencing a lot of change and career opportunities, depending on your focus,  may not exist."
good,"Write Policies "

good,"everyday coming into work it  was non stressful enjoyed it friendly and professional, everyone has a smile and says hello even though they dont know you"
good,the place treats their employees very well compares to most call centers. what makes the job frustrating is the customers and the some of the inconsistencies with procedures.
good,"At my first location, work mostly involved entering data from dental claims into text boxes in a program. While the program was a little clunky, workers acknowledged this and it was, at worst, a slight nuisance. Other work included editing billing status for certain families (workers, while hired for one job, may occasionally be trained in other parts depending on workload)."

good,"Met life es una excelente empresa, ofrece seguros de vida aptos para cualquier necesidad, realmente no habia mucha comunicacion de colegas ya que cada quien se dedicaba a su territorio, aprendi a tener facilidad de palabra, la parte dificil fue al principio ya que las persona no confian mucho en los seguros de vida , pero en cuanto te das a conocer, tus asegurados se vuelven tus amigos, eso fue lo facil de mi trabajo."
good,MetLife is great company to work for they have a great work life balance. They are very flexible when comes to their employees. overall goo company to work for.
good,"bueno me catalogo como una persona responsable asi mismo con metas en la vida como en lo laboral un dia típico en mi trabajo es realizar lo solicitado y terminarlo a su tiempo, aprender a controlar situaciones y problemas por el mismo empleo, dirigirme con mis superiores de la manera que se merece ya que son mis altos directivos, el compañerismo en el trabajo es escencial para llevar un mejor ambiente siempre y cuando recordemos que tenemos limites y puestos a respetar, creo que la parte mas difícil del trabajo seria no cumplir con lo solicitado no tener la facilidad de realizarlo no me ha tocado pero todo puede pasar, lo que mas me gusta de un trabajo es entregarme a el como se merece me gusta que la empresa vea el desempeño de uno asi como los compañeros de trabajo esto lo digo porque todos tenemos la oportunidad de salir adelante."
good,"People are respectful.  Salary is fair.  Management varies, but most managers are reasonable and helpful.  Free coffee and quiet rooms.  The culture is constant change.  The hardest part of the job is seeing the company make mistakes which you can not stop as the initatives are passed down from much higher up management.  Job security, at this point, is 'not safe'.  I enjoy complex coding projects that take a lot of time.  They keep me busy and allow my days to pass quickly."
good,"A typical day at work is make appointmentsure and seeing clients. I learned to work independent and on my own. The management are great they help where they can. The culture is very good, they operate as a family. The hardest part of the jobs is to get new business. Working with people was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,okay place to work...believe they were a little deceiving when we were hired considering the company was sold and divided into 3 or 4 new parts.......................................................
good,"Good health benefits, good work/life balance, management team that gave support and empowered their employees. Management style that both my supervisor and manager had was to allow their employees to work independently but be available to answer questions and give guidance, but not micromanage. Was definitely the funnest place that i worked at."
good,"Was always focus on Customer Centricity, for both internal and external customers. "
good,I'm a virtual worker and spend most of my day working on the computer. I work on information sent through mail boxes and email. There are also call listening completed on a monthly basis that our team completes. Since our team is virtual we meet at least once a week to touch base. There are also several other meetings that I attend to connect with other areas of the company on a regular basis.
good,"The environment at MetLife was a fast pace, metric driven, team oriented type of environment. Their benefits, vacation and sick time were one of the best out there. Management was supportive and had an open door policy. Some of the hardest days were due to the influx of applications coming in for review to meet commission cut offs; however case managers would group together get a game plan together and knock it out within the allotted SLA time services standards that was required. The department would have team pot lucks & team outings after work. Teams work together to decorate cubical aisles around the holidays to be festive and would recognize other associates' birthdays and get a card and a gift that everyone contributed to allowing that associate to feel special & thought of. It was a very tight knit, family oriented department that learned from one another and grew for the better."

good,"Metlife is a top-level multinational company, but with a very familiar job culture among its country branches. A typical day of my life includes talking with co-workers around the world making long-lasting and intercultural relationships.

We eat Spanish home-made food everyday (since I am based in Spain), we have intensive short shifts and free sandwiches on Friday, employees have a long-time record working in Metlife (even though unemployment rates in Spain are super high) and the company give high importance to social benefits.

good,"un dia laboral se basa en 6hs de trabajo, en el cual hay 50 minutos de break, el ambiente es tranquilo y con buena predisposicion. aprendi sobre la necesidad de tener un seguro y tranquilidad economica, desarrollo del manejo de objeciones y trato al cliente. Hay buena predisposicion de la gerencia con el trato al empleado. Los colegas se dividen en dos turnos, pero todos se saludan y conocen. la parte mas dificil es cuando no se consigue un objetivo grupal o individual.

They really do care about their employees. The management is very serious, ""A"" type personalities, so if they yell don't be alarmed. If you focus on your job, then you will be fine. They are looking for someone who takes the initiative and knows their job very well. Not someone who spends their time on the computer or their cell phone."
good,"Highly productive and dynamic workplace. I learned to work under pressure and meeting up goal expectations while maintaining high level of accuracy. Management is supportive and assist lower level employees to achieve theirs goals.

good,The balance between work and life is amazing. the benefits are great. the hours and benefits are great. the ability to transfer between departments is easy.
good,"Enjoyed team that I worked with.  Worked in a call center setting that also offered the ability to work remotely from home.  The job involved handling customer service calls from policy holders and dental offices. Job requirements required meeting typical call center requirements such as key performance indicators related to productivity (AHT, ACW, schedule adherence, attendance) and customer satisfaction (customer survey ratings, compliments/complaints). Offered better hours, pay/benefits and workplace than many other call center positions in the area. Initial training was good, but would have preferred more recurrent/progressive training in an interactive group setting versus completing all training programs independently online. This approach did not allow for an exchange of ideas based on experience and having the ability to ask questions.  Overall a very good job experience."

Like an NFL FOOTBALL COACH.  It never ever leaves you.  It is ingrained in you.  Phone calls, work the computer, notes, read, class, referrals, question, who do you know,etc,,,etc,,,,,,always asking,,,,,90% prospecting, 10 % product knowledge!!!=Most enjoyable part=when the people put their trust in YOU!!!"

good,My typical day at work at metlife was after signing on to my computer i would begin to take calls from employees that either wanted to file or check the status of a disability claim. The job required multitasking. The most enjoyable part of my day was talking on the phone and being able to help and provide the once and done service that metlife prided on. The hardest part of my job was maintaining and continuallly working on my average handle time this was a work in progress for a least a year or more and because i was unable to rectify the situation with my stats i was let go my metlife.

good,Retired out of MetLife! Working here was the best gift God could give!  I loved everyone I worked with! I loved my job in every aspect!

That says a lot with a brand new project!!

good,"I believe MetLife is an overall good company that offers excellent benefits for its full time permanent employees. However, I was a contractor and didn't get to participate in those benefits."
good,I loved my work at Metlife but because it is such a large company areas do not always understand the needs of other areas. The company has extremely good benefits with company paid pension plus 401k match. The company is also changing its direction moving away from many of its core products and trying to re-position to more of a global market.

Being an international corporate, the work culture is very interesting and exciting. You can learn so many things in a short period of time. MetLife is demanding and needs hard-working people to achieve the company's goals and perform up to its vision and mission, which can be quite hectic. Nevertheless, MetLife is an enjoyable place to work at."
good,I just started in the Metlife office and was excited to start with such a cool company but I found that I'm not receiving what I was promised. IT issues were frequent and learning and training was few and far between. There seems to be a trend of sourpuss leaders in our office; it's very discouraging and detracts from the overall culture. I'd love to see this improved!

good,I enjoyed the collaborative with my colleagues and found the organization to be a positive work environment.   The company provides a generous work/life balance.

good,"Great company to work with great work in Sourcing and Procurement domain. Amazing onshore partners with amazing knowledge."
good,"Todos los dias son diferentes, lo que aprendi es que hay que salir a buscar al cliente y darle el mejor servicio, siempre hay estar en capacitacion para mejorar los resultados, la direccion esta siempre buscando la manera de cumplir la meta haciendo nuevas estrategias de venta, en las ventas siempre hay una sana competencia sobre los bonos promovidos, la parte dificil son las reclamaciones de los clientes inconformes por un mal servicio. Una de las partes mas agradables en las ventas es que no tienes limites en tus ingresos, siempre hay retos y compromisos tanto personales como con la empresa."
good,Data Entry.  Terminated appointments and licenses.  Filed cases that were 		 terminated.  Did daily audits on employees.  Various projects as assigned.
good,"MetLife is a great company and I gained new skills, was able to use all of my past skills and met fantastic professionals and would recommend MetLife to anyone."
good,"Good company, but if you start at the bottom it will be a long time before you can move to a high level. Would suggest starting here then leaving and coming back if wanting to advance."

The most important part of my job is we never work alone because we believe in team work. As we all know that in each and every aspects of our life there are certain challenges because of this sometime it becomes a hardest time in your life when you are not able to meet your targets. Despite of many challenges when you become successful to meet your goals it turns into enjoyable part  of your job. "

I was on the Engagement committee where we had at least 2 activities per month. This really helped boost morale and made it a fun place to work. We were like family, always celebrating the good and comforting each other during the bad times. The only reason I am no longer employed there is I married and relocated."

good,"I come to work in the morning, log in and start taking calls. I deal with customers on a one on one basis per policy. I deal with auto & home insurance. I spend most of my day replacing customer's vehicles and setting up new drivers. I take payments and help with ways to save money and different payment options so they can manage their money better. I get coached once a month from my supervisor. We have team meetings in which we listen to our calls, judge, and look for ways to improve. The hardest part of the job is assuring an upset customer that has called back multiple times that you will take care of all their problems. The most enjoyable part is going above and beyond for a customer, then hearing at the end of the call how much they enjoyed your service. Co-workers are very friendly and always available to help. The management is very well trained on dealing with our representatives. Overall, I've learned how to become the best customer service representative I can be. Thus I've learned what customers want."

I enjoy working with people, me and my co-workers worked as a team, if anyone needed help we helped eachother always. The hardest part of my job was telling someone that a benefit was not covered. Dental procedures can be expensive and some think because they have insurance that everything is covered. I love being able to help people and make a difference, I was able to do that working at MetLife."

good,"A great company to work for. Office work can be a curse, but it pays off in other ways. Good pay and benefits. Management can be tricky, at times, but if you're willing to work hard it'll reap it's rewards. The building in Blomfield is a very nice facility with a lot of natural light coming in from the copious amount of windows. They have a gym on-site. The cafeteria and pseudo coffee-bar serves Starbucks, which makes the day a little easier. However, if you worry about job security, then this is not the place or industry for you. At a moments notice your department can be axed, leaving you in the lurch. Don't live above your means and you will do just fine if it comes to that. Good luck. You will make many nice friends and feel good making decent money. One last thing; always be aware of the people who over achieve. They will do anything to climb the corporate ladder, including selling you and any other friend they have out."
