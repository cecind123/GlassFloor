good,"Great opportunity but you need capital behind you to last through the pay cycles. Mileage reimbursement is low in my opinion.  Managers are awesome and will work with you in every aspect.

good,Sears was my first job as a young lady. I grow up with the company and the store in Jacksonville North Carolina was like family. Hardest part of the job was the budget cut in scheduling. I have to admit the grading scale for raises was awful. I think it will be an awesome start job for a teenager.

good,"Sears was a good experience. It was fun getting to know the customers, helping them solve their problems, and helping them find what they need. The work load and intensity could vary during the week and holidays, but one thing I did not like about working there was the pay. Did not like getting paid $7.25 for the amount of manual labor we did in the backroom. Moving, refrigerators and freezer, all sizes of lawnmowers, weight benches with weights, and exercise machines just to name a few items. It was a stress because the associates working on the floor got paid more."

good,"This is a good place to work as an entry level job. The company treats the employee well and they have lots of opportunity for personal growth, if the employee seeks it."
good,Sears wasn't to bad a place to work. sears is/was caught in a salary deli-ma. personally in my opinion a lot of their departments are salary based and they don't do enough business to support you. why work there when you could literally work anywhere else and make more

good,I enjoy my direct manager and people I work with. I like being challenged and appreciated for what I do.  Overall I like this company and would like to stay with the company for many years to come. Unfortunately I do not feel it's a secure job as there are many changes from month to month.

I would love to get the opportunity to work there again."
good,"A day in the store involves two jobs for two different apartments. The Sears desk requires the employee to learn some general knowledge about Sears (shipment dates, ordering online, policies, etc) for customer questions, receive and organize shipment from Sears, and provide customers with parcel pick-ups and returns. On the other hand, there is the dry-cleaning part of responsibility. This requires the employee to take in various clothing pieces for dry-cleaning (or as per customer specifications - steaming, press only, etc) and prepare them for cleaning."
good,"A typical day at work for sears is stationing yourself primarily at the cash register during the day but also moving throughout the store to perform other tasks when needed, for example folding clothing or putting them in the correct locations. As a cashier at sears you help customers locate items they need, respond to customer issues/complaints and sign them up for credit cards. We would often work closely with sales associates and share overlapping duties. What i have learned working for sears is patience and organization as well as being cooperative. The hardest part of this job was signing up customers for credit. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and knowing they left satisfied."

good,this is a great company to work for but be prepared to work long days. there are normally only two delivery guys and they can only do so much in a day
good,"A normal day at sears would best be described as a normal paced sales floor. Sometimes busy, sometimes slow. When its slow though, I try to keep myself busy doing additional side work. Like doing POG (Plan-O-Grams), clean the department or just help out other busy areas in the store. It is a good place to work in because after a couple of days in, it already feels like family. Everyone gets along and even managers are fun to work with. We all look to them for any assistant and they are always there to lend a helping hand. I most enjoy the smiles on all the members I encounter on a daily basis. Just helping them and knowing I am providing a great service, plus helping them find anything they need, makes me feel like I have accomplished a goal in life. A feeling of satisfaction that my job there has been done and done the right way."

good,Come in go to the start up meeting of what the day has in store for us then we'll go to the trailers we was assigned to that day. Co-workers was friendly never had a problem with anyone.

good,"Never a dull moment here. I go into customers homes, listen to what their complaint is with the appliance, run diagnostics on the machine, present my estimate for the repair, repair the unit then if approved, and if i have the parts. If I do not have the parts i must attempt to find it locally or order it if can not be found. I offer the customer any products or warranties they are eligible for. Thus the customer is happy and possibly secure that future repairs will not be as costly. I have learned that each assignment must not be though of as ""another call"" but to teat each problem like it is my own problem, and work diligently to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.Management is a bit shady though, they go through a lot of managers and each one has a different idea on how to make things better but almost always make it worse. The advancement opportunities are limited, and very hard to achieve. Most employees are very friendly, unfortunately i rarely get to know my fellow techs as we tend to work alone. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who cannot be made happy regardless of what i say or do. fortunately those type of customers are very few in number. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have successfully completed a repair and the customer thanks me.  Kind of like a hero complex. keeps me motivated to tackle the next customer issue."

We always had each others backs for example, if there was ever a problem we couldn't handle ourselves one of us would always step in and assist them in any way we can. Management is more like a coin flip. One day they will help you in every way and they're always there, but most of the time they're never to be found and while you cannot find any of them you find yourself left with your daily tasks but your own managers daily tasks as well. The hardest part about my job is waiting around 20-30 minutes for an approval swipe when we're so close to closing a sale. The most enjoyable part about the job was when a customer would return to the store just so they could shake our hands and thank us for all the help we've gave them because thanks to our knowledge of all the products we were able to find the exact item that he needed for the job he/she was about to do."

good,"Now in order to understand my duties, you must first understand that Sears Seasonal is its own little store attached to the side of Sears, which is located inside the Seaway Mall. Once I arrive at 9:30 in the morning, I open up seasonal, which consists of opening the doors, turning on all the lights, opening the cash register, making sure the total float is the same as the previous night, checking for old signs that might be out of date and set up for that day, weather it be pulling out tales with clearance merchandise, or setting up new displays. After all my morning duties have been completed, I check the task sheet in the schedule book for my daily duties. Those duties range from sweeping/dusting to reorganization the stock room. If no duties are on the task sheet, I make my own and fill them in as I complete them throughout the day. I complete my tasks in between my daily interactions with customers. Weather that is ordering parts, helping carry out a garage door opener, explaining to them the benefits of a Sears Mater card, or filling them in on up coming sales and promotions. Now all the tasks for a day shift are the same as night shift but closing seasonal is a little. Once 9pm hits, I close down the cash, count all the coins, and bills. Then I balance the float and collect the receipts. I shut down all the lights, lock up what needs to be locked up and close the doors, I bring the receipts, money, and cash register sheet to the back to be filed."

good,"I started the day by checking inventory, setting up the cash registers and then opening the doors for business. I learned a lot about appliances and how when you treat customers with class and respect you will come out on top. I enjoyed my management team as well as my co workers. I lead my co workers at a sales lead so they could sell more and have better customer service skills. I was the number one salesman in all of the northwest. Hardest part of the job would have been the lack of upward mobility it was all about seniority not work skill and drive. the part i enjoyed most was building a relationship with the customers and seeing they were happy. I actually got invited on many occasions to come to BBQ's."

Management helped as much as they could with the process, however because I didn't have local management it often times would be a slower process to get proper support. My co-workers were in the exact same position as myself. Often times I would (as they) rely on my co-workers for help. Meeting new people constantly was an enjoyable part of my job."
good,"A typical day of work is folding and putting away clothes. Trying to organize them as best as possible so that they are organized and more appealing to customers that come in to buy them. I learned from this job that you must work to the best of your ability if you want things done right. If not, then you will not be able to succeed as far in life. The management at Sears is pretty good. They will always have a manager there, and they are good about time off requests. There is really no hard part in my job, sometimes looking things up for figuring out how to please the customer can be kind of hard, but most of it is easy.

good,"For a seasonal position, I was treated with fairness and equal kindness from other Sears Team Members. Due to being new at backstocking, I was tasked to tidy up the shelves of the shoe department, and at rare chances tidying up the clothes display and stock, as well returning inventory to their rightful places. I learned a lot from my errors, but there is still room I need to learn that working at Seasonal is not enough. Management is like a sports team: We as associates and back stockers have to make sure that every shelves is full of inventory displayed and in a tidy fashion as possible! The environment is unfortunately very quiet thanks to the decline of mall culture, but there were still folks coming over during holidays and post-holidays shopping for discounts. The most hardest of the job is dealing with the shoe stock missing its mates. The reasons? There are worst case scenarios where the mates do get lost or misplaced elsewhere, and lacking of a set structure to easily find shoe mates or their right box packaging. It was a disaster on the back stage. What I enjoy the most is the friendliness of the associates (and which we all have a common goal when it comes to working with Sears!), and I researched a bit more about Sears, its retail history and the current situation with Sears. If I were to return to work again, it would be for the friendship bonds I made with the associates, and an unfortunate that I don't get the spare time to know them more. Lets HOPE that some Sears do stay around, with a RIGHT path to manage a huge chain against the likes of Amazon."
good,"Good culture, although retail is a tough industry.  As more purchases move to online retailers, the brick and mortar channel is getting squeezed.  Good work life balance."
good,Sears is a good place to work to get experience in many different fields with out having to hop from company to company. The environment and the bonds you build with the other associates is something you take away even after your work has ended.

Great managers, always helped in anyway they could and understood when things happened with home life. The hardest part of the job was the mandatory weekends I had to work because of my home life it made it difficult to do. It was a joy to come to work here. Its hard for me to work for a company where there is nothing to do but site around and wait. At this job if it got slow there was always something you could find to do."

good,"Es una gran empresa que ofrece grandes beneficios a sus colaboradores, resaltando las prestaciones superiores a las de la ley"
good,"I would say that while you have to be quick, it's not stressful. Generally speaking, nothing was too hard to do. The only thing to be wary of is the heavy lifting. Only so many people can do it and it can be dangerous."
good,I liked working here. lack of hours. loved people who I worked with. Only down side was timed when packaging products for the customers. never know how many hours your going to get.

good,i had a fun productive environment all the coworkers were anxious to make the customers happy and everyone had there own role to play when it came to the metrics part of getting the job done.
good,Company great to work for until it went out of business. Salary was good. Great coworkers. Pay was 100 percent comission. Management constantly turned over which was difficult.

good,Mi estancia en Sears fue buena siempre me sentí agusto con mi trabajo y el ambiente laboral

good,Great first job with plenty of work hrs. This was the job with the fastest job growth. Went from a bun loader to a lead in less than 4 years. Would have still been there if pay ceiling was higher.
good,"Change is good.  The executives at Sears Canada had the vision and the willingness to push for a complete reinvention of the brand.  Starting with the product and then to the store design/planning.  "
good,"Sears Woodfield was a good place to work, The culture changed as I moved to Rockford, If I did not move, I might still be at that store."

good,Sears  had a good environment for teamwork.  Our crew would all work together to get the best results. We had a good manager who was very supportive and encouraging.
good,"The work is easy, just very fast paced. And tasks have an average completion time. And need to be done in a timely manner. Also need to know department codes, it is sometimes necessary to transfer your time to different departments when taking on certain tasks."
good,"Estar en esta empresa me ayudo en mi crecimiento laboral, debido a que cada dia aprendes algo nuevo, un nuevo procedimiento, una nueva experiencia con el cliente o aprender a soluciobar problemas y situaciones inesperadas o poco comunes."
good,"selling sears credit was the goal. the merchandise was great, i love department stores. it gives you a chance to expand with your career. to bad that they had to close down"
good,I really enjoyed my time at work. The fellow employees and management made it relaxing. I wish hadn't had to leave.  I will try again someday. I would recommend Sears to my friends.
good,"working was great i made new friends. I also learned alot about the retail world. Though i was pregnant at the time, I felt I wasnt getting my needs. I had a very rough start to my prengnancy so i did have to sit down quit a bit. I was always told that i need to be up dpoing something when i really needed to sit and rest. I worked there when we transitioned into a new manager, which then when we had our new manager he passed away months after starting to work at sears. it was very sad because he was such a nice guy and a family man. my most enjoyable time working there was the people you meet and the friendships you come upon."
good,"un dia normal de trabajo es limpiar tu area de trabajo acomodo de mercancia surtido dese bodega, aprendi como mercadear la mercancia y como acomodar exhibiciones para una mejor vista al publico, la gerencia siempre fue muy humana con los trabajadores sin olvidar su trabajo, la parte mas dificil del trabajo fueron los cortes de caja, ya que si te faltaba dinero en tu corte fueras o no tu el que lo tomo a ti te lo descontaban, lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente laboral"
good,"-open registers"
good,"Was a great place to work, very people focused. big family and team based culture.  Will be greatly missed."

good,There were so many metrics that you were asked to meet. The pay and commission structure was absolutely designed to benefit the company more  than the employee.
good,"Es un excelente ambiente laboral, se puede aprender bastante en cada área. "
good,"As a cashier, you greet members kindly, make sure your customers found everything they were looking for, promote sears store and MasterCard, fold and bag clothes, handle money drops, close/open registers and recover sales floor. The management was stern but understanding, just really there for the extra push and effort. The store was like a family, coworkers were great to be around, good energy and better vibes. The hardest part of the job is convincing people to open a sears card, persuasion is a must! Everyday work was great, even if you didn't feel like going to work that day, once you reached work your day brightened."
good,"Muy buenas prestaciones, en general un buen ambiente laboral."
good,I learned a lot while working at Sears. Most of it was do to some great supervisors. When they left it was not the same. Even though I eventually got burnt out.
good,Sears is a holding company that is comprised of several quasi-independent business units. A holding company is unique in that each business unit has a primary responsibility to their own P&L. This focus needs to be understood so that each employee can do their best to grow their business unit so that executive management’s plans can come together.
good,Very friendly employees felt like i was a part of the sears family. Great work environment where I learned more about customer service in all level. My favorite part of this jobs to resolved customer's issued it was a great feeling to see a smile on customer face. As a jewelry sales associate when customer considered you a part their events when they buy jewelry for themselves or their love ones. I love challenges where i have to maintain my sales goals as well customer feedback and selling Sears Credit Cards.
good,good place to work had lots fun and experience hard working enviorment fixing the  appliance is the most rewarding part of the job threy to find out what the problem is the hardest part of the job

good,Over my years of working for the company I met a lot of people that I enjoyed working with.help some really nice customers. I miss a lot of my coworkers.
good,"You can enjoy your job, weekends are usually busy. Everyone gets along with one another. Department must be cleaned often and checked. The reward system is worth getting."
good,Setting up display's and planograms for the department. Giving direction and duties to my staff. Stepping in and cashiering as needed and observing to make sure all is done correctly. I learned that retail is a hard job and benefits everyone. We all wear clothes and finding what works best for people brings me enjoyment. The hardest part of my job is that hours are based on quarterly revenue and if the store is not profitable hours can be lessened.
good,"sears was a really nice environment. The staff was nice and fair.I hated working every weekend and it was really hard to get a schedile change. luckily,Working on commision worked out well for me bc the hourly pay wasnt good."
good,You are able to take certain shifts of hours or with  an okay from  manager stay longer than the schedule intended. Though if you were part time they would only attempt to let you stay under a certain amount of hours.
good,Shifts were different everyday depending on the merchandise and customer flow. Everybody helped each other no matter what department you worked in. Hardest part of the job was finding space to put merchandise when there was and overflow of trailers.
good,My position at Sears allowed me to be the most of the time when the store was closed. I enjoyed creating displays for the different departments that Sears has.
good,I liked the relaxed atmosphere Sears presented. Meeting and greeting of customers and providing them the best customer service. My manager at the time was very helpful and taught me a lot. I liked that all of the employees worked as a team.
good,Driving sales was new for me. I had great fun learning to be independent. This gave me people skills far as being social. I learned a great deal here and a need experience.
good,"Cuenta con un buen ambiente de trabajo, si buscas explotar al máximo tus habilidades acá puedes lograrlo ya que te permite desarrollar y mejorar tus habilidades. Los jefes te exigen dar lo mejor de ti y los sueldos comparados con la zona son muy buenos. Es un hecho que la jornada se ve amplia pero esto es por el horario de comida además de que se compensa con el descanso doble de cada dos semanas."
good,"With a store that has many different departments, being aware of the many product types helps in the long run. Learning more about the daily lives of the people you sell to is an enjoyable experience."
good,"Sears Outlet has a relaxed and smooth-paced work environment. I started at Sears with no retail experience and was able to pick up on it quickly thanks to the detailed instruction and help from my co-workers. Management is about what you would expect, they want productivity but they care about the employees. Being a slow-paced environment, it's easy to go in, and have peace of mind while completing your tasks. The worst part about the job would be that mood of your day depends on the customers, but the enjoyable part is the employees/most customers are nice and you can meet new friends easily."
good,"A part of my typical day at work as a sales floor associate  is composed of: the responsibility to attend on customers needs and questions, answer phone calls, sell merchandise and meet the days' sale goal."

good,"random hour cuts to to meet job needs and random dismissals or layoffs company wide. Pay and work life balance is great but job "
good,A typical day at work requires gathering as a team before opening and discussing goals and sales for the day and what we will do to reach them. Management is helpful and dependable. Great workplace culture. Hardest part of the job is time management and convincing members to apply for a Sears Credit card. Employees are fun to work with and are very supportive.
good,Typical day would include multiple sales with some amount of issues due to anything from delivery to installation or customer wanting discounts. Ability to advance with proper work ethic and knowledge. Hardest part of job is customers wanting discounts just because they say so for any random reason. Most enjoyable is offering quality service and getting the positive feedback from members
good,"Great People "
good,"Sears, was a very friendly atmosphere with the customers as well as fellow employees. The only complaint I would have is  that it is kind of slow. In all, I feel that Sears was an excellent company. Sears really knows the business!"
good,"I start the day logging on computer into my designated work area and warming up with some light duties, getting ready for the day. "
good,Go in to do your job. Easy to get along with other workers and management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and that is pretty much what you learn to do the most.
good,"Sears was a very cool place, very faced paced with the calls but pretty easy once you got the hang of things. Managers were always very hands on with their team members. I would refer a friend to this company."
good,Company provided ongoing training on all products and provided individual customer service scores and balance score card. Company provided benefits for all part time and full time associates.
good,"I worked for Sears for 5 years"

good,Buen ambiente de trabajó estabilidad laboral. Lo unico malo trabajo de todo el dia y algunas veces ventas hasta las 12 de la noche.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears Contract Sales. The environment was relaxed and fun.  Management and the teams were like family. There were pot lucks, games, barbecues and other fun events going on that kept the moral going.  Work was more enjoyable than stressful. The only down side was having a couple unappreciative consultants."
good,"Sears leadership has done excellent work with being open with its employees on sharing successes as well as current and upcoming challenges and expected consequences. I loved the open channels of communication with leadership and opportunity for feedback to executive leadership. Sears scored very low in my case regarding compensation and advancement opportunities but scored very high on flexible work options (start/end times, remote access/work from home option, summer hours). Overall Sears is well organized and structured and always searching for out of the box ideas and new technology to improve overall employee experience as well as members and shoppers experience. In my typical day, I worked with 17 BU's and it's really had a positive impact on me to open my mind to a world of flexibility not just in dealing with a wide range of personalities but also looking for innovative ways to satisfy BU needs while at the same time keep deadlines and get projects and information completed on time. The diversity of personalities of the staff from 17 different business units was challenging at first but it became the most enjoyable part of the job as I enhanced my flexibility skills and collaborated with each team to get to the finish line by deadlines."
good,"Una de las mejores empresas que eh laborado, excelente ambiente de trabajo."
good,"j adore mon emploie chez sear "
good,I worked there for over 9 years providing customer service. I put out merchandise and provided product knowledge. I enjoyed working as a team with my co-workers and management.
good,"I was responsible mostly for almost everything in my my department. From making schedules to making sure the new merchandise sent was displayed on the floor. Management at this location is not poorly used, but it could be improved."
good,"While I did work with some great people, there was way too much downtime. Hardly anyone came in to the store, which ultimately led to the closure of our store."
good,Working at Sears was a blessing. The job was stressful when there was deadlines but other than that it was great. The manager and buyers that I worked alongside were wonderful. It was a great place to work. If it weren't for the company moving to Illinois I most likely would still be there.
good,"Every product you fix or replace, first you must undergo a training to retrieve a knowhow to work on customers needs, put your game face on and learn all you can."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Sears. the work was fairly easy and fast paced so days went by quickly. the atmosphere was very fun and the work was fun as well to do. the management was excellent and easy to work for.  being pregnant at the time of working there, there were some parts that were hard being I was short and unable to reach but had a wonderful team who would help out if I needed them. also I loved the hours and the fact it was seasonal work."
good,This was a great first job for a teenager. I loved working at Sears but I was not impressed with the pay per hour. I will always love the fact that I got a chance to be a part of the Sears family.
good,"Good company to work for, The Clean Air Division allowed maximized earning potential while developing strong problem solving skills. The staff were excellent and the growth potential was phenomenal."
good,"Everyday brought forth something new. Communication was very good and there was a positive mindset with everyone, from management to everyone else. You can grow with Sears as an employer"

good,"If you are fortunate enough to work for one of the top 200 stores, dedicate yourself and know that there is always a reason for what they do. If you have a more efficient way to do a task or complete a goal, be respectful and honest. Work with the company and be prepared to compromise to get where you want to be. Be knowledgeable, and willing to help others."
good,It was my first summer job. Training was adequate. Immediate supervisor and coworkers  were very helpful and the manger was very patient.  Generally a great place to work.
good,"Sizing clothes, straightening up merchandise and taking care of abandon clothes. Being able to work under pressure is a must but, the most important thing they strive for is their employees to have the ability to get credit. Sears MasterCard is to be pushed and although its hard its not impossible! I was one of the best in that department as far as successfully meeting my metrics and daily goals. Management are understanding. They understand things happen and you might not be able to work but, some are a little unfit for their position. The only part I can say I absolutely love was the customer/ members because they were a lot of consistent customers that were amazing and sweet people!"
good,"Top notch business philosophy. I'll have between 1 and 3 clients per day. The earliest we see a customer is 10:00 am. As a consultant, I really enjoy educating customers on their projects and on products. I always have, even before I ever went to work for Sears. The hardest thing is dealing with credit rejects. I go to my customers homes intending to help them. It's sad when your unable to."
good,"great call center to work for great staff and awesome benefits , great advancements with the company very rapidly. nice home and work balance nice workload"
good,una empresa donde puedes crecer mucho tanto en lo laboral como en lo personal buen ambiente laboral y un horario accesible
good,"the job is very easy training was a lot of fun. the system is great. this is a good job, the only thing I don't like is that they don't train you on things you really need to know when you get to floor."
good,"C'est une bonne endroit, avec une bonne ambiance. Une bonne place. Les employer sont sympathique et les patrons compréhensibles."
good,"i worked during the Christmas season, so that meant that lines are packed with customers waiting to just get out."
good,great nice time here love the chicken and gravy Yes this is a great job but how do I get to the next level of love and hip hop my jailer is in a great mood
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo, funciones a realizar de acuerdo a tu puesto."

good,Sears is a great company where you can learn a lot of new technologies with great work culture and good benefits. It has flexible working hours and good platform to enhance personally and professionally.
good,"An Average work day keeps you pretty Busy. You will find yourself spending most of your time solving problems and closing sales with members. The management is great, they try to work with you the best they can, and they try to keep the work place as friendly as they can. The hardest parts of the job are the hours, during certain times of the year I find myself only working 4.5-10 hours a week. The pay is very nice when the hours are good. Over all Sears is a great place to work."
good,"Sears has a great work inviroment and is good comapany to work for. on a typical day i am helping anywhere from 25-75 people and biulding items for the floor desplays and also pciking web orders for online orders, my managment is very helpful if i can not find something they will jump in and help me look. the most enjoyable part of my job is the poeple i work with, they are always so up beat and positive even when we are faced with short time lines to get projects done. the hardest part of my job are the time lines that im given to get everything done with the short hours they give me to staff my reveiving area."
good,great job. i excelled in every way. volunteer work for anyone trying to help the community. i would recommend to anyome. the staff were friendly and awesome.

good,I met a lot of wonderful people that I have developed great relationships with. I enjoyed my time around my co-workers and the daily encounters with customers.
good,"day was simple since we were an outlet store everything was cheaper and the rules were more relaxed.  I learnt a lot about customer service. management was fair, co workers were awesome we still keep in contact today after it has been closed for 1.5 years.  hardest part was dealing with unruly customers the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere."
good,Overall I gained a great sales and retail experience whilst working at Sears. The hardest part of the job was having to sign customers up for the Sears Master card as most of them didn't want it and already have a credit card.
good,"Cuenta con buenos valores (Trabajo, Crecimiento, Responsabilidad Social y Eficiencia)."
good,one of the best places I've worked at by far. from the beginning till the day I left I felt home. from the management to the janitor everyone got along. it was very welcoming.
good,"•	Involved in 	Requirement Analysis for new Bolt on modules and Recruitment module customizations."
good,"•A typical day is fairly busy."
good,"I loved working as an Admin, the co-worker's were always happy or smiling, same goes for the management team. Always happy to help."
good,"As the first experience in Canada, I started to learn the ""working culture"" and improving my communication skills"
good,"Rewrite policies, research, releasing communications regarding process changes.  I work great with my co-workers.  If I can find the answer I am not afraid to get assistance in finding it."
good,"Was grateful for the experience, my co-workers all felt like family to me. Sometimes the store can be a little hectic, especially keeping the fitting rooms and keeping the floors clean was challenging. The best part of the job was watching and coversating with the shop-your-way sear members. Watching them smile after they make their perches, it warms my heart to know that I did a great job."
good,Sears is really focusing on creating a fun a cool work vibe. But with I found it hard to communicate or get direction from my superiors even with just an open-communication environment.
good,"i am a Customer Service representative at sears."
good,They are not organized.Management I wouldnt approve. There is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many changes in the work enviroment. I like a steady work place. I can see changes every now and then but every week. They dont think about workers who have a family.
good,"Excellent benefits and pay. Excellent orientation for phone services. You will be asked to sell, even though it is an inbound call center."
good,"People always want to say bad things about call centers but I believe the environment from Sears is really amazingly flexible. Loose dress code, various departments where someone can always find a place to fit whether it involves sales or customer service, and management are always willing to work with you!"
good,merchandise pickup is very business and we as a team get things done as a member of the warehouse t learned about stocking merchandise pulling orders shipping orders customer service . my co-workers was a great help to me they made my job less stressful and more enjoyable. there are times we would get heavy products with no room for them but as a team we made room.management was great because we as a team got things done.
good,"I worked in the house wears and bed and bath department. Basically I'd just help any customers with any questions, help them find what they wanted, and made sure everything on the shelf was tidy and presented well. "
good,"This store was a joy to work for, from the management team to the part timers, the atmosphere in the store was always positive. I'm very much a people person and very outgoing, so the most enjoyable part of my day is the interactions I'd have with either customers or coworkers. Hardest part of the job there would have to have been trying to convince the customer to take the warranties for their electronics. But, with better training, I'm sure I could've done a better job."
good,"I have learned a vast amount of product knowledge at Sears and work with a great staff! The Sears I work for is a Hometown store, meaning it is a franchised store with no chance for advancement and no benefits"
good,"A typical day we will count the registers before opening and usually assist our members with returns. Most purchases made in the day were customers who were in a rush to an event and had to have a speedy transaction so your customer service skills should be intact. I learned how to run checks, communicate with customer service, find items in and out of stock, sign up members for credit cards, and handle cash registers. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my credit percent up. For every seven customers we should have signed up at least one person for a Sears credit card. This was hard because most members knew of the card and during a busy day signing up members weren't beneficial since the line got backed up and if the customer wasn't approved they would feel as if we wasted their time. The best part of this job was working in an environment with people my age. It was fun and wasn't too intimidating."
good,I have learned a lot in the two years I have been with Sears. They are very accommodating to employee's with families. They offer summer work hours and days where you may work remotely.
good,"un dia tipico era llegar hacer inventario de los productos en piso y en almacen, abrir caja. hacer cambio de etiquetas cuando fuese requerido, atender al cliente,"
good,Great first job. The hours were decent and the sears team was friendly and welcoming. The retail experience at sears was pleasant for the most part. Most of the downsides are the typical things that come with working in retail.
good,excellent knowledge base to expand from. Excellent Management. Great people to work with. Low staffing caused undo stress. Typical day at Sears is working under heavy loads of work orders typically from 10-12 hrs
good,"Sears required me to do at least two months of training to be an appliance sales associate and it definitely paid off. I was able to show the features of a washer or how much fridges have changed in ten years. The pay was very good if you consistently sold, even if it was small items, there was always a lot of customers passing through."
good,Sears est une entreprise tres bonne elle prend de ses employes
good,No words can express my gratitude with my former manager. She was kind and understanding to her employees needs and a very hard-worker.
good,I learned sales and customer service from working in this position. Along with some management skills being a shift leader.
good,The work environment is good. Co workers are friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand. The managers are very professional & knowledgeable. The hardest part of my job is bridging the language barrier with foreign members who do not speak English so well.
good,A typical day at work is analyzing data and communicating with clients to ensure that all the data information is correct. Work as a team to offer excellent customer service. The job is challenging and you learn something new everyday.
good,"Great work culture, great management. A typical work day is relatively easy and stress free. The employees are friendly and team oriented. Management is always available for guidance."
good,"Company is ok to work for . "

good,This was a fast-paced working environment with lots to do throughout the day. Management was always looking to help employees advance and better themselves.

good,"A mi parecer es una empresa que me ayudo mucho a crecer no solo profesionalmente sino también personalmente, tuve la oportunidad de tener muy buenos gerentes de venta y compañeros de área. Generalmente el esfuerzo realizado lo hacia notar la empresa al otorgar incentivos o cambios de departamentos donde se podría tener una mejor ganancia.

good,"I help with stocking, recovery, cleaning, and pricing. Everyone is cross-trained. My coworkers are amazing; they are a main reason I look forward to going to work. Management tends to be pretty relaxed, but not to the point where they don't handle their responsibilities. I think the hardest part of this job is finding things to do when it is slow--and it tends to be slow a lot during the week at night. The most enjoyable part is talking with customers and coworkers."
good,"Very flexible with schedules and coworkers are awesome!"

I established a healthy relationship with the servers and managers which makes the job that much easier. Overall not a bad job.

good,Here I would assist cashiers with giving them money bags in case they needed change.  I also helped to count money in the safe and make sure it was all ok.  I looked over at people who were applying to set up appointments to get an interview.  I also sold shoes in the footwear department and reached my sales goal each time.

good,"Learned retail process, retail delivery processes, helpful colleagues."
good,"A typical day at work would be handling customer transactions and complaints.  Although I have been there for almost 2 years, a lot of people come and go for one reason or another, but everyone has always been great to work with.  It's a small store and the mangers have been there for years so their is not much room for advancement.  This is my first job and I have learned a lot of good retail and customer service skills.  The hardest part of the job is getting to know a co-work, having a great work relation ship and than that person leaves the company.  I enjoy the customer interactions.  Sears is a great place."
good,"- Early morning planning"

Co-workers were very helpful and friendly! Hardest part of the job I would probably say would be pitching Sears Cards to members. Most enjoyable part of the job would most definitely be the work environment!"

Management was tough since they were new and didn't know what they were doing."
good,"I would come in check inventory at work, stock shelves, change prices and greet and help customers as much as I can in a timely manner. Managment was great there. Very friendly, and would try to help out any way possible. Some coworkers were great to work with, others were lazy and young, that did not no what work eithics were.

The Footwear Department was where I learned and reinforced my ability to show overwhelming care and concern for those I worked with and for those I served.  The manager was outstanding. My manager in this department helped to refine the worker I was when I came in. I am glad to say that she boosted my efficiency in ""floor sales."" I enjoyed working with my co-workers because we automatically became a family. There was no question that we knew what teamwork is. The hardest part of the job in footwear was having to report bad news to a guest that may inconvenience them-even if all of the bases of guest fulfillment have been covered and all options have been exhausted. What I enjoyed most was the big projects. In the Footwear department, big jobs consisted of unloading shipments,shelving product, making floor moves and merchandising."
good,"Un dia de trabajo en sears es llegar checar , recojer tu fondo de caja , pasar a junta del fin , posteriormente limpiar y acomodar tu area de trabajo , atender excelentemente a nuestrso clientes. Como en toda empresa hay altas y bajas pero e aprendido que hay que ignorar las malas vibras que despiden otros compañeros y contestarles con una gran sonriza, algunos gerentes abusan de su puesto y tienen muchos aires de superioridad."

It is a very fast paced,friendly environment. My co-workers and management team are extremely supportive.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the feedback that you receive daily for providing outstanding customer service."

good,"I was going through a battle of keeping a job when I stumbled on Sears, I remember walking through the parking lot and the Manager was outside taking a break and I've walked pass them not even knowing it was the Manager. I've applied twice and got the job, I later found out the manager had two of my application and was trying to put me through the system before corporate sears even got a to it. It was some days I was like why not quit, but the manager was like ""Why would you do something as stupid as that?"" every time. Later on the company got sold under a Dad and Son company. Their main idea was to get new team members, but again the manager could not save me that time."
good,"Pros: sears is honestly the best job I've had. Managers vary; I am from a transition store and I wish we had more stability in store managers staying. Sales are difficult but extremely rewarding. I started at sears when I was sixteen in sales and it has taught me SO much about dealing with people and communicating how products work and why they need insurance with them. When it comes down to it I am proud to work at sears."
good,"I help stock the inventory and attend to all of the customers needs regarding footwear. I learned to be more outgoing and lively when it comes to interacting with different members, and I also learned how to work successfully as a team. My managers are great, and I get along with everybody. My co-workers are awesome we work together to sell our products, and also have a few laughs along the way! I would say the hardest part about my job would have to be dealing with rude customers that try to give me a hard time. The most enjoyable part about my job is interacting with customers with great personalities, especially kids because they love shoes and I'm always happy to assist them."
good,I learned how to work with other people on getting the job done. Working with the technicans to complete a task/job for the customer to get done on time.
good,Learned numerous of micro-management skills. It was a great team that I worked with and the co-workers were fantastic. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my team make a difference within the company. Helping and seeing customers happy is what made me happy as a manager.
good,I worked in all departments and I loved my job experience. Managers always had your back and worked around your personal life schedules.
good,Coming in to work with something new to expect everyday. The atmosphere is lively and enjoyable. Co-workers make you feel like we are all one great big friendly family.  No matter the case there always there. Credit and Shop your Way are the two factors that I would say are the hardest to achieve because it is not something you can just learn and go with you have to be able to promote and engage like a true salesman.
good,Co-workers are friendly and a blast to work with and the job itself is very simple.
good,"Gained a lot of knowledge pertaining to the business and business itself. "
good,"Work is usually busy always something to do never boring."

Everyone was a team member helped each other out when needed, always had at least one other person working with me."
good,"I worked as a sales rep for four years and as a sales manager or two. Great company, quality products, but long hours."
good,It was my first real job. I enjoyed it but I didn't feel like I was going anywhere. I enjoyed the people and management greatly. I would probably still be there if it wasn't for school.
good,"I started working at Kmart as my first job. I started as a sales floor associate, restocking merchandise and keeping product off of the floor. After a few months I was moved to cashiering which I soon learned was something I enjoyed a lot as well. This job introduced me to customer service and helped me realize it was something I would enjoy pursuing."
good,"I come into work and I immediately engage in my daily tasks, "
good,"In terms of working retail, this company might be one of the best for college students. The schedule was very flexible, management was very easy-going, and workload was not overbearing at all."
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Atención a clientes, mercadeo de la tienda."
good,This was my first job in a call center. The environment was one full of competition but it was fun. Every agent wanted to put their best foot forward. Sears paid you according to how well you performed. Commission was a sweet bonus to the by-weekly pay. Many contests to promote productivity.
good,"Sears is OK! the pay could be be than it now. I work there part time, it's not too bad, but they are not providing me with a reliable income."
good,I have learned that customer's always come first and to be able to multi-task. I have learned that each manager is different and you just have to adapt to their ways in order to succeed in the company. The co-workers are generally very friendly and allows you to meet new friends in the work place. The hardest part is to be able to relate to the customer and put yourself in their shoes so that you can end on a good note or first call resolution. I always challenge myself to excel in the place of work in order to advance in the work place.
good,A typical day is pretty much smooth. Customers are nice for the most part. My managers were very understanding of certain schedules and with new associates training. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a happy customer.

good,A typical day at work was busy. There was always something to do. Even on days where there weren't many customers in the store you would see employees cleaning and organizing things throughout the store. I learned a lot about customer service and running the register. I have great coworkers who make each day go by a little bit faster and are always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needs help. The hardest part of working at Sears is that its a retail job and sometimes you come across a not so happy customer and you have to do whatever possible to make this customer happy while maintaining a smile even if they are yelling at you. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you do come across that one customer who is the sweetest person ever and makes you day 10x better without even realizing it.
good,"I work from 9am to 9:30pm 6 days a week. I sale parts for sears."
good,"While working at sears we started out the day by clearing room in storage for incoming shipments. This was tedious work at times because there was enough space in some instances and everything thing had to be in a certain order.

good,"Being a Loss Prevention Lead for Kmart was a great experience for me because it helped me become more vocal and improved leadership skills extremely. Being in charge of a group of loss prevention associates while the manager is gone is a fun way for me to prove we can still get the job done without a supervisors help. Working everyday as loss prevention opened up relations with the police and going to civil court for apprehensions which is a good experience for ANYONE who is trying to get into security type work which I enjoy doing. The job environment there was always enjoyable working with co-workers who were always motivated to do more even if we are over achieving already. The hardest part of the job for me was transitioning from being a follow into a leader, it took awhile to get used to but I felt like I filled the role perfectly. The most enjoyable part of the job was apprehending shoplifters. It was always a new challenge everyday, dealing with different personalities; but it was always fun making apprehensions and saving the company money by busting the criminals."
good,Interactions with co-workers and other business units make it a very friendly work atmosphere.
good,"It is peaceful when working there, coworkers are nice and helpful. Management is ok. The wage is not as good as the bay, maybe due to the situation they are facing. But there benefit is way better than the bay. It is better for a person who wants a stable job with good benefit."

If I wanted to stay and get hours I was able to o so."

good,Sears was a wonderful place to work at. I enjoyed having the chance to learn about the products in the store and as well as having the opportunity to gained some great sales experience.
good,Pay was based on commission. If you are slow your ay was very low. There was nothing that could be done about this.
good,"Just a job, but it teaches customer service values. Pleasant working environment and the people are generally good to work with."
good,"Like the way it works, credits, enrollments, co workers are good people...i enjoy my job and i learning a lot"

Hardest part of the job was supporting stores on west coast sometimes 3-4 hour time difference and we only had dial-up at the time so was very painful to sign-on and fix problems from home.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the environment and the people I worked with."
good,"Improved in my communication skills because we had to follow a strict call flow and vocabulary, our calls were graded. Quality Assurance was always above 90%. The management team was very helpful and knew how to coach in a motivational way instead of putting down an associate. My coworkers helped the days of work go by better. Hardest part of the job was handling angry customers but always made sure they felt I was there for helping not to deny any special requests. The best part was talking to random people from all U.S."
good,Observe and apprehend any external/internal theft.  Ive learned to identify alert signals to theft.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I helped in saving company assets.
good,"I spend most days dealing with customers through sales and inquires."
good,"Starting time usually 5-6 am making the day go by fast with the work ready and plenty to keep busy with. Learned many new programs and procedures with training available all year long. Coaching and training was always just a question away, my supervisor was excellent at instructing and guidance.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, the special days that we had to boost moral or sales. That was fun and competitive."
good,fun company to work for I have learned a lot in my time with this organization.  I have always been a fan of sears as a company this is my second term with them in my career.
good,"I typical day at Sears it slow but when it's busy it is manageable. I have learned to keep up to date with product knowledge, and to be aware of my surroundings so I don't miss a sale. The management staff is the best management staff I've had in years. My coworkers are friendly and knowledgeable about sales and the products. But the hardest part is that some days its too slow especially when your check depends on a sales. But when sales event happen it can make up for a bad day of sales."
good,"I enjoy working at sears, I get to meet a variety of people and work with a good team they are good at what they do. The hardest part is the pay is not what I am seeking at the time or the hours."
good,My co-workers were very easy to work with. This was actually my first job as a Cashier. I learned how to operate a cashier. I also learned how to provide great customer assitant.

good,it could have been more up going with their employee's and more of a fast pace of a work enviornment
good,"A typical day at Sears Outlet usually includes reviewing trends from last years sales, setting goals to meet daily metrics, servicing customers with a smile and resolving issues. The most useful skill that I've acquired while working here would definitely be the tactful use of overcoming objections and persuading customers into purchasing warranties, credit shares and other miscellaneous items. I have a wonderful management team dedicated to my success and growth as a sales associate and fun-spirited co-workers who make the time on the job fly by. The most challenging aspect of selling is also, in my opinion, the most rewarding, and that is adjusting to the diversity of personalities and overcoming objections."
good,"Great company to work for. Stable, pays the market standard."
good,"Sears is a busy place to work because there are many other tasks to complete other than just selling merchandises. Sears management is very helpful for employees to complete any job duty. Sears management rewards employees even for their small achievements to encourage them in future. Because Sears is able to keep and maintain the same culture throughout the company by its effective work, all the team members and co-workers have the similar believes and thought about the company and they do their work very effectively and efficiently in a team. "

good,I enjoyed working for Sears for many years.  I learned a lot and acquired most of my experience.  It was a friendly environment and very professional.
good,"Es un lugar de trabajo muy cómodo, pero con mucho trabajo hay que tener mucha paciencia para darle al cliente lo que necesita; al estar en un departamento de alimentos es necesaria mucha higiene en los mismos y mostrarlos de la manera mas exquisita a los ojos del cliente consintiendo su paladar y gusto. Aprendí a trabajar en equipo y a buscar siempre una solución al cliente que mejor le convenga. La dirección es muy buena y ayudan siempre a los trabajadores. La parte mas difícil del trabajo era hacer solicitudes de crédito ya que aveces era muchísimo trabajo el que teníamos para mantener el área en perfectas condiciones y e horario pues era muy pesado."
good,"a great job to have if you are a good sales person, and great management "
good,"The Hours are great. Learned a lot as far as great customer service, organization and neatness.

My coworkers at Sears appliances were very competitive. The hardest part of my job there was getting enough customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the particulars of the appliances and the company of my coworkers.

good,"I have learned so much at Sears. The Management is great, my co-workers all work together, The hardest part of the job is scheduling, we have rotational schedules so sometime it does not allow me to work with my staff. the most enjoyable part is working with the staff I enjoy training, and working."

Through both points-of-views I have learned and understood how to properly handle and deal with much of the operations as well as handle customers whether they would be happy, angry, sad, etc."
good,"Being a cashier at sears is not easy by any means, you have these questions to ask every customer:"

We have a great managment team that works with us to make sure we have the tools and assistance we need to complete each task. My co-workers are a great group of guys who practice team work.

I was usually just a seasonal employee which did not provide enough income for my family, otherwise I would still be there!"
good,"The employees are great, theres always something new, you come across some interesting customers."
good,"A typical day starts with walking the sales floor to observe to make sure that all manneqinns are fully dresses, backwalls are appealing and the floors are presentable from the preveious day, so the customer's feel that our facility is a clean environment to shop. Then after that I check my email and sales for updates and work on projects to be completed for the month. I have learned to improve my work by making a more appealing shopping experience for the customer's by constructing inviting shops, and backwall presentations, and experiences. I have learned also how to work alone with my managment at impacting sales and finding differnent ways to appeal to the customer's more to make them want to continue to remain lifetime Sears customer's. I have trainned my co-worker to have a deeper visual eye. The most enjoyable thing about my job as a Visual Merchandiser would be starting from scratch in a not so appealing department and transfering it into a more appealing more open welcoming area,to draw the customer's in and also dressing the mannequinns setting different trends."

I started out as a cashier, and the manager of the tool department looked my work ethic and my ebergy as he asked me to come work for him. Upon becoming a salesman in hardware i was moved around to other departs to help out. Sears offer a number of oppertunites as well as benifits, they take care of their employees as well as the customers."
good,"The supervisors are very understanding when it comes to needing to request off or taking a quick break. They always try to cheer us up. They are very focused on making customers happy, and making things easier for them."
good,"A typical day would involve helping the customers get what they need from the store, as well as helping them to save money by implementing the Shop Your Way program. Shop Your Way is a system that helps the customer to earn points as they shop. The managers would always make sure that we are following our metrics like we are supposed to. Hardest part about working in Sears is product unavailability. Having to order a products is painstaking and the customer would have to wait longer. I have learned to consider the customer's needs to ensure that I am product specific rather than giving them what I think they need."
good,"I'm gonna be honest, I loved my job at Kmart while it was still around, though it may not have looked like it at the time. I had great co-workers (or, at least the ones who stuck around were great) and we got raises every so often, which was nice. "
good,Loved the opportunities and experience. The laid back environment made it easy to complete task and build rapport with customers. Wish I had more time to grow into the position.
good,Sears is really a good place to work and so is any retail place for that matter. The only reason why I wouldn’t work in retail is because they don’t pay that much.
good,Aunque sean ventas nocturnas son buenos momentos para vender y hacer el trabajo que a uno le corresponde que es el vender la verdad bien bonito el ambiente
good,I worked for Sears 10 years I enjoyed it but was very hard to see what was happening to sears. I enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the management
good,"Es muy buena empresa, me agrado mucho el ambiente laboral que había, solo que por la distancia tuve que renunciar."
good,"Was kept busy everyday. Managers were willing to work with my limitations. It was difficult at times to handle combative customers(problems with their orders, or credit card statements). Employees were very friendly and it was hard to lose what felt like a family. No raises were given the last 10 yrs. I was there. When I finished my daily jobs I would help out wherever needed."

good,"It was a great place to work, loved the atmosphere and everyone that I worked with. However it was difficult with such a low amount of people coming in and people who were older and didn't care about the product we're selling. My manager was great and helped us to keep great energy regardless."
good,"One of the best jobs I had for many reasons, but mostly the people I worked with. Not so much the pay because that honestly stunk and so did the benefits."
good,I would highly recommend Sears as an ideal workplace. Sears culture offers constant growth and training opportunities. Management is encouraging and educational. Sears runs a tight ship and teaches its employees discipline and optimal customer service experience standards.
good,Sears was a great place to work for the holidays. The people you worked with was great. The whole management team was amazing. No complaints. Our backroom was always kept clean after every truck.
good,Everyday was a new adventure. We drive to 8-9 houses everyday and each repair was different and interesting. The people made the work interesting. It's nice to be independent with your own truck amd tools as if ot were you had your own repair business.
good,"Para empezar el día siempre hay que pasar el plumero y tener limpio el piso, aprendí a desenvolverme y quitarme la pena al hablar a alguien, el gerente anterior era muy considerado al dar horarios especiales, me gusta los valores que se tienen dentro de la empresa, lo mas dificil esta en la competencia por clientes y ordenar lo qeu se desordena, me gusta mucho el ambiente laboral"
good,It was a fast paced working place. Fun coworkers. stressful at times but not too much. Enjoyed emplyee discounts. hours were enough for a student or part time.
good,"Sears Canada was a good company to work in , but unfortunately  they did not respond to the new wave of social media era and did not improve or changed their system resulting in bankruptcy and closing ."
good,"Sears was a great place to work. Great atmosphere,great management."
good,"Management was so/so but overall when you clock in, It was a good environment from co workers to customers. Always on your feet, never sitting down always wanting to assist members. Within little time you can learn a lot. They train you on how you can handle manager situation with out being an actual manager which is the one thing I Will always carry with me and thankful to my management for. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unique customers and our unique delivery team."
good,"My typical day at work every one day to other, from payroll to hiring and training new staff. Managing the department and reordering stock. I learned to be a great manager you have to be a leader, not a boss. A leader helps its staff and don't just tell them to want to do."
good,"The Parts Dpt. within Sears was considered separate from Sears Management though we were situated within the same store."
good,"Sears was big on up-selling and selling the total package, you were compensated for meeting goals and bonuses were a big payout. you do have to approach many customers and deal with many issues. Many training meetings and materials are provided for you. It was mostly a fun place to be with many associates to converse with. Management was loose until regional managers appeared, then they were more conservative and strict. You do work a lot during holidays."
good,"I loved working with the customers. Working the sales floor was my favorite, moving things around and organizing. Tried their best to work with me if I needed certain days off."
good,"every job has its cons but for the most part the people and management are great."
good,"A typical day at work would mostly be coming in the afternoon and working until closing, which was 9. I would sign in for my shift and begin my shift. Which was either cashiering or on the floor putting stock back onto the shelves. On weekdays, I would be working a 5 hour shift and on weekends, I would be working an 8 hour shift. 13.60/ hour and that would describe my time working at sears. Throughout my experience I have learned that when dealing with customers, you must always show composure because the customer is always right. Management was great in the beginning when I started working for Sears, but towards the end; when Sears went into liquidation sales, is when I believe management became lazy in my department. Every time there was a customer complaint, they would never pick up my calls and whenever I would catch them around the store for some help, they would show annoyance. Not all management showed this kind behavior, some were really a pleasure to work with. I believe towards the end, when sears was closing was the hardest part of the job. Sales became cheaper and the store was constantly full off customers. But above all, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new individuals and creating a friendship outside of the workplace."
good,"Great management actually care about the people’s feelings and what’s going on in there lives and very understanding, fast pace and hands on also busy."
good,Working at Sears is actually fun. Employess help each other assist other customers and management is always there to help and ensure things are going as expected.

good,"rien à ajouter, ce travaille ma fait beaucoup apprendre"
good,"My time at Sears was the best year of my life! I was fully submerged into the retail world and although it had its challenges it was a great job. A typical day at work consisted of maintaining to cleanliness of fitting rooms, restocking merchandise, sales, or any combination of the three. Because it was a department store I was able to bounce and familiarize myself with many of the numerous departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of family created between my coworkers and I."
good,Interacting with the clients was a treat everyone was so cheerful and had lots of story's. The team I was working with was also great (attitude and likeness).
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con todos los compañeros, asó como con jefes directos."

good,I LOVED working for Sears I wish it was still open I would still be working there great people to work with all types of people it was great loved the people and my job
good,"At the location, I really didn't have much to do if I didn't have customers around. The way to get the day by when I didn't have customers was research products, check where I'm at on sales, and help with other departments. Cashiering and customer satisfaction every day simple work. Holidays are always crazy there."
good,Les superviseurs toujours prêt a répondre aux questions et a aider les employers en cas de besoin ou d'incompréhension de la tache a executer.
good,Management respect to employees was great. Products were very high quality e.g. Craftsman and Kenmore. We have a really good sales team and all work well together.Work days typically for me were Friday- Monday 9:45- 5. If I needed time off for medical or other important business management would always work with me to accommodate those. Management was helpful in problem solving and helping with complex issues that could arrive from time to time. Management had really good knowledge of products and computer and IT systems and were good teachers of that where needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with members(customers).

good,"I enjoyed working with our store management and my peers.  I had no ambitions to assume a department or store manager position, although they allowed me to assume a lead role in my departments following a couple of years of service.  The job was a commission based position, whereby the more you sold and kept sold (no returns) the more you made. I was able to build my own customer base that would only return for purchases or advice regarding lawn and garden, tools or fitness equipment.  I continue to meet my customer base throughout Kansas City, as they recognize me and I recognize them.  These are happy engagements."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is answer incoming calls from customers on the computer and looking up parts information for many sources and input parts information in the system.

good,"I enjoyed my time working at Kmart, co-workers were great at training you on what to do and how to do it. Met some interesting people some younger and some older than me. Although thr pay was low due to the location, but overall I enjoyed working for the company and would work again."

I handle multiple tasks at once that really stand out and excel in my sales as an associate. I greet every member with a friendly smile and hello, and make sure i treat them as my own family.

good,A typical day at work was over 15 costumers a day that already knew what they came for and if not sure on which brand that they would want to buy I had to compare both brands. I learned that work is not always the easiest. The management was fairly good and my co-workers were always friendly. The hardest part about the job was learning how to use the cashier but I got the hang of it really fast. The part I enjoyed most about the job was speaking to different costumers each day having a friendly conversation with them.

good,"Trabajar en Sears no me resultó difícil acomodarme, suelo aprender rapido, el ambiente de trabajo solía ponerse tensó. Tuve la oportunidad de hacer examen para el puesto de Supervisor de Recibo, pero no me quede con el puesto ya que para la empresa tengo muy poca edad (20 años) y se requiere de mas nivel de responsabilidad. El puesto se lo dieron a un auxiliar de mantenimiento, que nunca mostró interes alguno en capacitarse para el puesto. No obstante, cabe mencionar que cada vez nos ponían mas boletines; o normas por asi decirlo, que ponian el ambiente de trabajo aun mas laborioso y estresante ya que no respetaban nuestra area de trabajo. La tienda (o mejor dicho; tanto la gerente como la jefa administrativa) nos pedian apoyo y lo otorgabamos, pero a la hora de nosotros necesitarlo nadie nos apoyaba. Son muchas las discrepancias que se dieron a luz ultimamente en mi antiguo trabajo. Me gusta trabajar, me distrae de muchas cosas, aparte de que me ayuda a fortalecer mi caracter. Pero cuando un empleo no te gusta o te estresa, o cosas que generen una negatividad en tu mente, no sueles dar tu 100%, y es por eso que preferí renunciar a terminar por despedido y con una mancha en mi CV."
good,"Sears is my first company and I personally feel lucky to start my career with SEARS. I learned many thins related to corporate world here.

Management always gave me honest communication and fairness among my fellow associates. A typical day at work consisted of organizing materials and merchandise while providing quality help to customers who needed assistance. I gave each one attention and interest in their needs, and each left with either the product or the information they needed. The hardest area of the work was its fast paced nature and my initial time management. Balancing my duties to the store and the customer became the focus of my endeavor.

good,"This is a call center. How many calls I take and how I work my calls is how I am managed. A typical day is 8 hours of calls from associates or members asking or telling me what they need and all expecting a quick solution. Sears has several computer programs that I have worked with. Sometimes its about 25-30 calls a day sometimes those call last 7-15 minutes but a lot of calls can last up to hours, depending on what needs done from speaking to other departments to get hold of vendors and manufacturers.

But I was literally moving heavy appliances most of the day so you can not expect manual labor to pay exceptionally well."

good,"A typical work day was always productive working here. I enjoyed being a sales person and helping customers with their needs. The hardest part of the job was having to show a customer why they might not need the item they intended on buying, and showing them what they really need. The workplace culture was amazing for the simple fact that everyone works there really enjoys the job. The managers were amazing as well. I have learned how to not persuade, but to listen to a customer and really pinpoint their problem and guide them in a right direction of product choice."
good,"•	Accueillir les clients, évaluer leurs besoins et offrir des produits et services personnalisés et complémentaires. "
good,Provided the customer with the best customer service. Load merchandise like it was yours. The managment was fair. The hardest part of the job was not being able to helo the customer out with a problem because it was either against company policy or it was not fixable.
good,"I was shown how to fold clothes, how to remove and pick up dressing room clothes left by customers.  I loved the elderly customers who came in to shop and ask questions!"
good,My manager at Sears in California was really good and understanding.  That branch was fun to work for and was constantly busy.  They created interesting weekly bonuses which made the work week more fun.

good,"-normal shifts"
good,"This was my first commission based job. Much different from an hourly salary and has its perks, also is available for employment with a similar skill requirement for most part-time jobs. Though the full time position is a bump from a part-time job, it is NOT a stopping point to settle career wise or financially for an independent. Which is also my reasoning for looking for a higher up job with another bump in pay and skill level."
good,"Great place to work at Sears Tallahassee. Managers really care about their employees, everyone works as a team, and there are absolutely no headaches."

Its very important at sears to succeed communication to our members Pros and Cons appear everywhere. Pros are being able to work in a team and always getting good re assurance from team members. Cons are when the customer discloses with you unsatisfied."
good,They are too pushy for credit cards. It was something mandatory for credit cards every week . It was hard and looked bad upon if you didn't have at least 1 for the day . You need to get 1 credit for every certain amount of people you have . If you don't have enough at the end of the week you have to explain yourself to the store manager on why you didn't earn enough credit. Other than that the job was fun . Enjoyed customers and co workers
good,"Sears in Colorado Springs Colorado is a very fun, great place to work. Not to sure on the outlook which is hurting business as well as cashier hours unfortunately. Full-Time is a little hard to find with the cut backs, but if you're looking for a great part time job or second job, I recommend it for sure. As far as moving up in the company they will set you up for success as long as you're self driven and hardworking."
good,"I enjoyed working with the guys funnest part about working was getting down under the vehicle and gretting greased messy funn i only thing that was hard about the job was the computer test they make you do in order to get hired on."

good,i love working at sears. it has helped me grow in different areas. i worked with different types of customers that had different types of problems i like helping them and making sure everything is right and working at sears you have to always make sure customers are leaving satisfied. i think the hardest part about this job is dealing with an anger customers because you always have to remain calm and keep reminding yourself customers first.

I along with my team helped the store make a 11% increase from last year in sales, unfortunately it wasn't enough and they closed the store and sold the property. We actually were awarded for our sale increase upon other things. We didn't get benefits because we were a privately owned Sears store. Other then that I had a great experience at Sears."
good,Sears cares about the associates and strives to maintain a a good work life balance. timely consideration is given for time off requests and schedules are flexible to work with school or a second job.
good,Everyone at my store were very nice and made working there a good time. Some days could be frustrating when someone's point did not work or an item did not right up the right price but it teaches you how to handle those situations. There are requirements that you have to take breaks which is good and you get a discount on certain items that aren't on sale. It is a great job for part time. There is room for advancement if you show initiative.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking sales adds to prep for certain sale items, walking the sales floor to make sure the store was ready for our customers. I learned how to listen to customers and put my self in their position to be able to offer them a solution that they would be pleased with. As part of the management team we made sure that we were available to our employees for coaching and training when asked for assistance. the hardest part of the job was when we had customers yelling in our face for not giving in to their unreasonable demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was the family environment."
good,My typical day was working on customers vehicles according to the work order.  I learned to work fast and doing the job right.  Management and co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest part was informing customers what needs to be done when they do not know anything about what I am talking about.  The most enjoyable was the experience and time management.
good,"This was by far my favorite job to work. The company provides its sales associate with multiple forms of training before letting them out on their own. The company will provide training seminars twice a year. One for all consultative sales associates, and one for each department. The coworkers and management are very nice and friendly and makes everyone feel welcome. The company eventually started going down hill and sales became rare"

good,"Enjoyable work place with a positive amount of competition and camaraderie.  An understanding management team that allows improvement without traditional techniques.  Gained ability of performing all job duties from sales to management.

To do so I would need to open the safe, register, and computers. I needed to count the items and set them all out while documenting them. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to find the perfect watch or piece of jewelry for someone and see their faces light up when they saw it."
good,"Working at Sears was an  a beneficial experience. It's an ideal place to work for students because they are very good with establishing a schedule for you around your school. You also learn a lot of new skills, which  is helpful if you plan to move up in the career ladder. The easiest part of the job would have to be meeting your goals.

I learned a lot about what it means to be a member of a cohesive and productive team. I always feel like my coworkers had my back and I will always have there's. I think the hardest part of my job was deciding whether or not to prosecute. There were a few cases that it really was my choice of what to do. I learned to look at cases objectively and deal with just the facts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I get a good case or find a solution to a problem the office is experiencing.

good,wasn't a bad place to work if you were good at selling credit cards. That determined your hours and any other privileges you got. You got a lot of credit card signups you could demand anything and do what you want but only if you were the best at it. They wanted credit cards so bad for every sign up you got you got an extra two dollars added to your paycheck. So if you signed twenty people up in a week that was an extra forty dollars added to your pay which was nice.
good,"I worked as Part-time cashier at Kmart, and my job experience was really friendly. Since I was just a cashier, there was not much to do when there were not too many people in the store, so my manager gave me other tasks to do, such as relocating toys, clothes, and other materials. Thus, I was learning where some objects where put in the store. I did enjoy worked as part-time cashier. There were some customers that came a little upset for some materials that had discount or the materials were ruined. The workplace culture was friendly, and with culture variation.

good,"Being a SLMCA is not a hard job at all. The tasks were to simply check fitting rooms, assist customers, organize racks, set up plan-o-grams, mark clearance, bring out new merchandise, etc. I learned how to merchandise, how to help customers the right way that was quick and easy for them to understand. Although, working at the Sears where I worked, they were not modernized. Their signs were still paper, we had old and worn out equipment, we had no headphones to talk to each other with (we had a store announcer) and portable walk-e-talkies that were also worn out. Our SNC's were old and broke often, our printers and computers were slow, etc. So, customers see the modern appeal in other stores where Sears does not have."
good,"I found commission sales challenging and sometime frustrating when they would put too many sales people on the floor. It made for a dog-eat-dog contest at times. They put more emphasis on selling the warranties than selling the product, so they would harrass us alot about our percentages."

good,"Sears is a great place to go, a lot of people come into sears to buy electronics. The typical day at sears is busy and time goes by. There are some rude customers that walk into thes tore but I am very polite to them, I try to help any way that I can."
good,Every day is different with its own unique challenges and rewards!  Customers can be demanding but there is always a solution when you listen.  Management is always supportive and will advocate for both the consumer and associate finding a balanced solution. There is a very strong family type of morale!  Each associate supports the others creating a fun and comfortable work environment.  I love creating the best possible customer and associate experiences!

good,The mangers don't really care if you are a hard working person they only care about making Metric goals. Which isn't far because the associates aren't appreciated as much as they should be.

My co-workers and I had shared responsibility of those tasks and worked really well together.

good,i really enjoyed working here. it was not really to stressful to me. i enjoyed all the staff with of course the select few. i just dislike the fact that the people that been there for a long time felt like they were managment but infact were not.
good,great place to work i learned alot about customer service unloading trucks and stocking
good,"Also, a coop for school. But I loved the fast pace and the work enviroment. The staff was great!"
good,Sears is a great place to work if you can live on part time wages or if you are re-entering the work force. low pay and short hours with no benifits are three reasons Sears is where you work when you are looking for a better job
good,prepared salads and prep for sandwich bar
good,overall overworked and under paid...upper management lacked structure and core
good,Customer service was always first. They would have classes to teach us things that were helpful in our job. This inabled us to help our customers more when they had questions and need suggestions as to what they might need before starting a project or dressing for success. They also did things to help humanity such as blood drives and programs to help well known charities.
good,"Sears has been on the decline for years, this shows with the morale at the company. IT was a challenge working for a company with the constant concern that it was going to close."
good,"Commission-based sales in the appliance department is a good deal if you're a decent salesperson. Downside is if you're good, they work the heck out of you. Work 6 days a week for a year. Money is there if you're willing to sell."
good,It was a good job.. i was a sales associate so i liked that. Talking to people helping them out. I was never bored there was always work to do there and it was a convenient spot to travel to everyday
good,The upper management was a mess. The counter managers in cosmetics were very sweet. The workplace culture was pretty relaxed. It is unfortunate that the store shut down.
good,I enjoyed sales and my co workers.   I was compensated for sales and credit card and spp/pa but not as well as other departments. No room for advancement.
good,"Mentoring, teaching, dealing with customers. "
good,good management less hours they dont give full time employment which is a problem. no benifits since u stay part time and schedule is different everyday. cant lead normal life
good,"worked in the sears catalog center taking orders loved the job., Loved working at the counter meeting people when they came in to get their orders. Managers were great."
good,Not a bad place to work. But not the same company is was 10 years ago when I first worked for them. But thats the nature of the beast as far as Big Box stores and the future goes.
good,Greatly enjoyed working there - genuinely wish Sears-Canada had NOT gone into receivership. Duties were as varied as a job of this description demands.
good,If you are young and still in highschool it's perfect. For sales consultants you need to be over the age of 18 and the pay is commission only. Over all this is an okay job.
good,lo mas dificil es lidiar con las ventas nocturnas y horarios extendidos
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Taking tire and battery orders from sears.com website and transferring information to store register, for installation or deliver for services. Also Taking credit card payments from store with existing orders taking in store."
good,"Very professional and neat atmosphere, smooth operation.  They make sure that all documentations are update, inform me when something is about to expire so I can renew it. Jobs go very well, correct amount of material to complete. They reimburse anything that I needed to buy for a job."

good,"A typical day at work consist of offering customer service deal with money, and be able to obtain credit card applications as well as maintaining the environment clean."
good,Sears works with my schedule when I need it. Awesome managers and associates. Associates offer friendly customer service/support to every member. I have loved working there these past 8 yrs.
good,"Management did not listen to hour requests while I was In school and needed to further my education, which ended up in me having to leave school for work often and even when I requested less hours they did not listen, but overall it has been a fun place to work with the other employees."
good,Work hard as always and do delivery's through out the day and installations to if needed at the end of the day make sure your truck is up to kept and do all paper work properly before leaving .
good,"good store, ok hours, not very busy, some sales associate are great other esp makeup counter unfriendly. Some Managers unfriendly. Recent dess code silly.."
good,"A typical day at Sears would be upon arrival login into systems, check company emails, close any unresolved account, prepare for inbound calls, sale and retain accounts, discuss products features and benefits. Update, input, and correct demographics per HIPAA regulations."
good,"they are great with celebrating holidays, since you will be working every holiday. They will want you to go to parts sales which is more harder and complicated."
good,"I worked in Clothing depts, made sure new merchandise was out on shelves or hangers, cash registers were opened and customers met their needs. , the hardest part of the job was trying to be in all depts at the same time, most enjoyable part was able to use my imagination to design/decorate and help customers decide."
good,"Sears canoga park gave me a handful of lifelong friends, it was extremely unfortunate that the location was closed down."
good,A typical day consisted of helping customers and keeping the store nice and clean. I learned quite a bit about customer service and how to help people. Management was great. My supervisor was nice and helpful. My co-workers were very nice and helpful.
good,working here was nice . everyone seemed to get along. good trainers. nights went by fast. never slow work.  it was overall a good job.

good,The company was small and was family driven. The company was sold and because poorly managed.The pay was decreased and the hours were decreased.
good,"I've worked for Sears for 3 years and i changed to 3 different departments when i was there cashier, sales, and Mca being at Sears it changed alot and I would recommand people to work there if they have what it takes too"
good,I had a part time job which I enjoyed. The supervisor and colleagues were supportive and friendly. It was a good experience working with a team of highly professional colleagues.
good,This job keeps you on your toes. You never experience the same day twice. Fun place to work. High expectations and standards.
good,"I worked here during my pregnancy and during the Christmas rush.  Short lived experience, but differently worth it. They do not discriminate and unlike many other places, they hold true to this!"
good,I enjoyed working with co-workers and creating customer satisfaction with all customers.
good,laid back fast paced work style. Easy to get along with manager who are willing to work with you on any problems that you may have. Overall delightful work experience.
good,"A typical day at work for me, I arrive 15 minutes before starting my shift. I will usually begin with heading to my locker, then punch in the clock. Open the cash drawer assigned to me before i then count my drawer down from the last shifts. I learned in this experience the importance of organization and awareness. I love my Sears Family, my co-workers were truly team players.I enjoyed pushing for superior Customer Service and would not settle for anything less. I presented every customer with a smile and concern. This job particularly was challenging because staff was so short I had an immediate start without the proper orientation and training. Furthermore, I made my way through and i enjoyed every minute. Helping customers find the right products to fit their needs and getting comfortable with my position as to where I am getting acknowledged and rewarded had to be the most enjoyable part for me, it felt great to accomplish something and reach my goals. It helps motivate me to do better and be great. I will not settle for anything less."

good,"work day was long every day 9 to 10 hours a day."
good,"I was lucky enough to have been on the ground floor when  Sears came to Calgary,, Plenty of promises from upper management, We were looked over for vacant positions only to have new hireries  given the new jobs. This created a intense situation between employer and employee.."
good,"Unload Sears Retail truck. Unload UPS, FedEx,and other commercial carrier  store equipment and goods for retail sale. Receiving customer orders. Computer entry of price-changes, inventory updates, loss prevention and removal of ""very-old-merchandise""/ Co-workers are the best. Sears does not generally tolerate negativity between associates or between associates and customers. Making customers happy with their purchase when they ""really didn't want to buy something that would not fit in their vehicle."
good,"Typical day would consist of sitting in a back room viewing monitors and observing staff and customer and attempting to catch shop lifters. Great staff to work with, easy going. Hardest part of the job was to process shop lifters and send them to jail."
good,Management hard to find when needed. Good co-workers. Not enough training to be good at my job. Short breaks if any at all.
good,"I totally Love working for Sears Canada"
good,I really enjoyed working here when I first started. They went under new management and a lot of changes were made. I liked the fact you could trade hours with people allowing you to pick up more hours if you needed them or get off if something came up. Also that you could do this without being penalized. 
good,"A typical day at Sears included maintaining overall presentation of my department and assisting customers with purchases. That pretty much remained the same every day. I did cash handeling. I processed credit applications to interested applicants. My management team was super, always very helpful in anyway. Not really a company which offered to much advancement but for the position I held I was content for my age and position in life at that time. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers with their purchases. I seemed to enjoy the cash register and counting back the money etc."
good,learning new thing
good,"This job was a start for me. I was hired as a Warehouse Manager,but was never paid the same. I was told my management that in a year this position would go to salary. I work with all the store staff and managers. I had the Warehouse straight and looking good. We had customers items in the back for more then the rules allowed. The customers had 60 max days in storage then all items had to be pick up. When I tried to enforce the rules others would say its ok till next month. I worked along with the department managers untill we started running out of warehouse space. I would call the customers ask them to make arrangments to pick up their goods. It was a hard battel and the warehouse rules didn;t matter nor apply. Even my manager couldn't get things back on track. So i requested a meeting with staff and managers. We did a walk thur the warehouse explaining the small problems we had. The managers now had to make some arrangements so they wanted more items from the warehouse on dispay to show the customers. I just help them and my year was coming up and left to go work for boeing.."
good,"You get a discount on items you purchase. Working with customers to inform them of products they are about to purchase makes me feel good. There are good days and bad days, but that is possible with any job. I want to put the best into what I do to help make a difference any way I can."
good,"I miss the days that all of these job were not outsource, the company had a great team, people that worked here for years and that their lives depended on this job, the work environment was really good, breaks and lunches were on schedule, I experience 911 here so it has a very special place in my heart, I don’t think that there is a person that does not remember where they were that day."

good,Typically you start your day by opening up the store and conference calls. Then you push your team to sale sale sale. Never get a day off and alot of times work beel to bell even on thanksgiving
good,The management needs to foster more emloyee happiness. They need to pay better to keep employees around and promote more of a constructive attitude for employees.
good,"Love the customers, but the pay is not worth what is expected."
good,Fue una experiencia grata y pude desarrollar y adquirir muchos conocimientos en diferentes áreas laborales
good,Working for Sears was very hard work. But I enjoyed going there everyday. Just to see the smile's that I put in my clients faces. The job teaches you job safety. How to operate different tools.

good,Excelente compañía de trabajo con muchos beneficios.
good,"Such a great company to work for. I've learned so much within the company, from scheduling delivery dates to data entry.

The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying all customers, and keeping them as loyal, happy and returning customers."

good,The CEO is running the company into the ground and they are selling assets like it's going out of style but the work environment is chill and going to work to hang out with friends is the only upside since they took away the associate discount. Pay sucks. They've cut hours and staff to bare bones so badly to try and save money and make themselves look profitable that everyone is stretched thin and customers walk out the door constantly because there isn't anyone to help them. Essentially shooting themselves in the foot.
good,Sears is a great retail place to start a career for retail. The company gives is a fun and friendly place of work while focusing on consumers and growing equity.

good,Working with Sears technically improves knowledge. Learned about different servers and printers they handle and also to configure. I was one of the co-workers under a team lead.

good,"Atencion y apoyo al personal de las diferentes areas, aprendi a que nadie es indispensable, la gerencia me trato con respeto, pero muchas veces habia problemas por caprichos. La cultura laboral es de apoyo mutuo, sobre todo con todas las areas y departamentos. "
good,"My typical day at work are enjoyable, I learned new things everyday. Everyone on management are great to work with. Sears have a great workplace culture that is fair at all times. The hardest part of the job to make sure all my associates are happy and have a great day at work. The most enjoyable day at work when I engaged with my associates and make them feel comfortable and take care of all their needs."
good,I have made a decent living and have enjoyed working for Sears. It is a shame to see them close their doors. They offered some great sales training techniques and always offered great incentives for performing over metric goals.
good,"Best job I've had, great management and staff, was always fun to be there, got plenty of hours, Store could have defanitely have done things diffrently, felt outdated inside."
good,Lo mejor en cuestión de ambiente atención y comunicación
good,working at sears was another honorable and prestigious job i have had during my career. great management team as well as amazing yet competitive team members.
good,Hours are difficult which include night closings and weekends.  The Management works with me and it is a friendly work environment.  Dealing with customers can be challenging but usually is a very pleasant experience.
good,C’est un travail agreable dommage que c’est fermer
good,"Department worked in was fun and a great learning experience."
good,I worked there for 18 years.  I would still be there and probably moved up again by now.   The pay could have been better.   I liked the people I worked with and had room for advancement.
good,"Made friends for life. "
good,very calm place relaxed.management very friendly reliable.typical day would be helping the customers with anything they needed.what i like about the job was it was working with good people

good,"I was only here for a short period of time, but from what I can remember this was a fair job. I was in high school and they were flexible to my schedule."
good,"Inventory control, stocking, loading/unloading of trucks and warehouse, customer service, knowledge of technology and computer applications as well as knowledge of assembly or repair. This location closed a couple of years after I left. I would assume due to lack of management because the team I worked with were very good at their job and never missed a beat, All great guys. Management was lazy and didn't know the job."
good,"Good place to work. Very fun, exciting and challenging work place. Growing company, provides a lot of growth opportunities for staff. Great teams, great upper management. Always promotes a good work-life balance. Great company to work for and learn from."

good,"A pleasant work environment with a friendly and experienced staff."
good,"Es una buena empresa, con excelentes prestaciones, pero la administración de la empresa deja mucho que desear."
good,While working here was how I learned how to deal with troubled customers because you would get customers who weren't satisfied with the product and would like to return it but they couldn't. So they would always lash out at us.
good,"My brief time spent in sears was enjoyed. We had to work hard at the time due to a shortage in staff, which meant the managers more often than not, were on the floor with you. Which is a blessing in disguise, because they do the work, they know how it feels. So they are very reasonable and realistic in terms of things that they expect from their employees. Everyone is very friendly and well mannered. There is alot of teamwork and communication. My one complaint is the pay. It was minimum wage, biweekly. So it wasnt so impressive."
good,great joib management is great learned how to use high powered vacuums to clean carpets an the use of different chemicals also how to clean upholstery an hard wood also somne air duct training
good,i got to tell people what to do  with such a pleasure  and have the same in return from my guys..one of the nicest part was that management  never had  nothing bad to tell me..the hardest part was  working sundays ..and  not being with my family
good,Organizing chutes and confirming order details before packing them into bags/boxes to ship to customer. It was a great environment of many people around but you basically work within your own area.
good,"Great people to work with and positive approach on the outlook of company, however the company has done a re-structure and we are now looking for employment."
good,"Sears is a good company to work for, the pay is low but the co-workers are nice and work as a team. Management is fair. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers."
good,Very good company.  Pay and benefits are good.  The management does an adequate job. The hardest part of the job is the workload and adjusting to frequently changing shifts
good,"Generally a good company. Inclusive of all people. Has good general operating practices. Could use an overhaul in insurance and benefits, to help employees instead of cut costs. Needs to divert from corporate interest and put more work into the ""smaller"" people. Very good HR, accommodating and understanding across the board. There are many compassionate people that work for Sears."
good,Was a very nice place to work and my work associates were wonderful. And a couple of associates became friends The training was very good and helpful as well as the management staff being there when it was curcial
good,I enjoyed working at Sears I had tried something in the field I was going to school for that is the only reason I had to leave.I enjoyed communicating and helping people pick out clothing that helped them feel good about their selves
good,The job is alright. Good pay. Managers are okay. Would be better if the commission structure was different. Had a good time working in appliances as a sales associate.
good,Todo pudiera estar mejor si el salario fuera mayor y se trabajara 2 turnos .
good,I enjoyed my time working for sears and the customers we served. A typical day consisted of reviewing the work loads and ensuring items were in house for the jobs on the schedule for the coming days. In addition fleet maintenance had to be up to date and vehicles had to be in great condition to meet the needs of the customers we served. Management was great and enjoyable to work with. All of my co workers were great and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of the sales team. Trying to find source items on short notice. The most enjoyable part was reviewing some of the quality work the staff was able to do while making quality assurance rounds.
good,"Entreprise avec de bonnes valeurs "
good,"Typical day at work would be, hit the ground running."
good,The people I worked with were very motivated even though they knew that the company was gonna go down soon.  Even though we were in our own world Sears itself was very cooperative in our needs.
good,mostly a supportive working environment. Able to advance and move around into different departments as needed. Love the repeat customers ad being able to help them find what they were looking for.
good,Good company. Just never knew weather they were going to close you store down or not. Constant changing of management. Management was also nice to work with.
good,I worked at two locations and luck for me the people i worked with were awesome. The only thing that they need to fix is the base pay for tech and CSA's and they also dont really look for good managers. I was with the company for two years at a point where a manager position came avail and they went and hired someone they had never worked with cars twice before i got the position.
good,"I am dependable, reliable, open minded, I believe in going above and beyond, I take a lot of pride in everything I do. I get along with well with others. All my Accomplishments in the learning that I did. the ability to work without supervision. and to have earned for my Employers to trust and count on me and to have the desire to move up and learn other skills in management."
good,Sears is a great place to work for and also I have only positive feedback from them and the employs are very nice as well. I would encourage anyone seek employment  with them.
good,"The company is continuously focused on improving the company brand, culture, and customer satisfaction results.  They are highly invested in in improving their multi-channel business model to improve the company's growth."
good,Managment could have been better. the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below.
good,Job was exciting and you learn a lot from different managers and mechanics. A lot to learn even if you know automotive already. A lot of responsibility.
good,"Working for Sears has helped me improve my Customer Service skills and has given me an opportunity to learn and interact with various personalities at the work place. The diversity of the customers has given me an invaluable insight on how different ethnic groups communicate.  A typical day would be helping my co-workers and customers have a better overall working or shopping experience. The Signing of the store is very important along with how the presentation of the merchandise is displayed, this takes a great deal of time and detail to fulfill this aspect of the job.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to solve all the issues that may come up without asking for a manager to step in and take care of the issue. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people."
good,"great co workers that helped me succeed and taught me great customer service. daily activities included ups incoming and out going, jewelry inventory, unloading trucks, Fixing store inventory. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the experience."
good,ability to work in a place where interacting with the public is an everyday experience. having the ability to make others smile and see my great attitude through my customer service
good,Either you get worked like a dog or not at all. It has it's fun days and working LP can be exciting.
good,"Good place to start out. Most management people are friendly and helpful. Not ideal for long term. It is not easy to move up in this company and raises have not been given out in many many years. Training is not thorough. You are given minimal training, mostly thrown out there to sink or swim."
good,Sears had a lot of managers that didn't not last and not all managers that work at this company was good. I really enjoyed working for sears. Sears had very good supervisors and leads that was fun to work with. hardest part about working for sears was trying to move up.
good,A day at work is calm and quiet.you get to satisfy customers and make them happy.
good,"prepared drivers bills of laden, and manifests. As well as printed picking tickets and shipping labels. Sealed and updated yard management system on daily basis. Great working environment."
good,My day began at 9 am and ended at 6 pm. In the mornings I would check that all appliances were clean and well displayed. I worked as a sales person and enjoyed interacting with the customers very much. I had a wonderful boss who was very special to me. She passed away. The hardest thing about this job was leaving it.
good,"This was an awesome job, I enjoyed every minute of it. the communication was a little off between top level management and employees, but it was a great job none the less"
good,spent 10 years with this company and loved it. very challenging and fast paced.
good,"It was a small shop and a awesome place to work, but the pay was low although the tips made up for it."
good,"learned how to pack items from small to large then trying to pick up the heavy items by yourself, all the workers were very nice and I liked the job very much"
good,"Worked with various customer who came into the store for products."
good,"I love working there, but there was no advancement for my job as sales person.  A typical day would be opening new account of customers.  Deal with 50+ customers while handing phone call from customers as well.  Provide customer services.  I had best co-workers.  All were very good at doing their job.  I learnt a lot of things ( job related) from them. Management was good.  The most parts of my job fairly easy except dealing with though customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customer find what they are looking for.  I also suggest if what they want weren't available in store.  I love working with people, so I enjoyed my job at Sears."
good,"good environment towork and learn."
good,getting  restaurant set before opens   getting  things from store  that we need   banking .
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I learned how different appliances function and how to repair them. My co workers helped to reach team goals by trying to meet deadlines and quotas. The hardest part of my job is pleasing quality assurance while trying to be attentive to the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the incentives. Our managers would coach us and help us come up with plans on how to reach our weekly goals.
good,"Every day was full of hard work, meeting new people, and learning something new. Like any job, being friends with the people you work with will help to keep a smile on your face even on the busiest, most frustrating days. It is always helpful when management helps with the smaller jobs to keep customers happy. The hardest part of the job was seeing a customer walk away unsatisfied. The best part is when that customer understands that you went that extra mile to make their shopping experience all they hoped it would be and then they come back for the excellent service only your company can provide."
good,"Cashier, customer service, sales, cash handling, cash balancing, cash cage, weekly/monthly rewards and sales pgm goals."
good,"I would probably still would be working here but my location closed."
good,"Learned a lot on filling trucks.  Met some great workers. Long days on the computer, but worth every moment.  Great working with a company that has a procedure manual and uses it."
good,"Knowing what was expected of me I was able to learn about the major categories of sales I was responsible for.  That included lawn and garden, appliances, hardware and tools.  The owners were the managers and there was occasional dissension between them.  The hardest part of the job was pleasing both of them at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling comfortable talking with customers about the product they were looking to purchase."
good,Great team of people.  Hardest part of job was customer service in areas I did not have control over.  Best part of job my sales associates and department managers.
good,"Good company, just unsure of its future in the industry. Great place to work for, has it's drama just like any other company, just really really unsure if they will stay open or not."
good,great experience and well rounded environmental workplace.
good,"A typical day at work would consider assisting customers, helping my fellow employees, and maintaining the sales floor.  We work as team.  Management is always keeping us informed on how we're doing compared to other stores in our district as well as inventing new strategies on how we can be better.  The hardest part of the job is trying to incorporate new merchandise on the sales floor when there seems to be no room for it.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you've worked hard and it shows."
good,"Its quiet and you get alot of work done,just wasnt as organized as much as i would like and the pay isnt that great"
good,"the day was funfilled with the children you meet"
good,"A typical day at work is, i either open or close my department, i am a cashier, if i am not at the register i will be doing re-inventory or pcns."
good,my manager was great so were my co workers i enjoyed working with this company the pay just wasnt that good
good,"A typical day would include helpling customers, putting merchandisie on sale floor from stockroom, and being a fitting room attendent."
good,this was a great job to have staff are very friendly and management gave you lots of extra to keep you doing a good job ( ei mystery shopper bucks)
good,"Most of the people you wrok with are great. However, the ""management team"" has no more regard for the people doing the work than the man in the moon."
good,I loved this job. I liked my hours 4am- 12pm. I had fun doing this job. I liked being one of the fastest there.
good,A typical day at Sears is one of being very busy from start to finish. Each sales associate is to look after their appointed area.
good,This is a great company to work for. The management will work with you on schedules and hours.
good,"started in the catalog department and then held such positions as head cashier, manager in the delivery department and manager of telephone sales"
good,More than 10 years general clerking experience providing quality customer support
good,Even though i took a photography class in college(which i didn't finish) i leaned a lot more working there than what i ever learned in class. I never had a problem with working here everything was good except when i had no hours but a lot of jobs are like that so i couldn't complain.
good,Never been in retail before owning/operating A Sears hometown store.
good,"great staff, easy to learn, just not a lot of opportunity for advancements."
good,This was my morning shift part time I delivered items to off-sight location or to costumers. Unloaded trucks as well as stock. Sales team members should have more supervision and hiring or interviewing personnel should be monitored for content at times.
good,"There is not a typical day at Sears. Each day is different. All depends on what customer walks through the doors. You learn to be flexable. At one point your a cashier taking a payment; next your a professional salesman trying to sell a set of headphones or a wireless phone all the way up to a 70 inch led TV or a camera. When I first started I sold a whole lot of shoes. Everyone on the sales floors is a customer service representive. My Job also includes authorizing special pricing for other associates sales or answering one of many questions they have. Though I am not paid as a supervisor, I actually enjoy helping other associates and developing their knowledge that leads towards better sales."
good,It was great job to me. it was my first job. It nice if you are in high school.
good,Sears was a good place to work. Was able to interact with different people everyday. It was a very rewarding job to have.
good,"A typical day at work was me fixing the clothes on the floor, helping coustomers, and working the cash regester. I leared how to deal with different types of coustomers. My co-workers were great and made it very easy and fun to work at Sears. The hardest part of my job was finding certain items for coustomers. My most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,Enjoyed working part time and talking to customers about their needs
good,great work experience.alot of great people.i enjoyed working in this enviroment
good,"A typical day at work is greeting my co workers and begin working .I learned that continued hard work brings success.Management has a direct influence on morale, behavior and overall productivity.I have had an excellent working relationship with my co-workers.The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours.The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling gratified of your contribution to the success of the company."
good,this place was a ok place they worked you hard but your good wasn't good enough most times and they still worked with you when it came to your schedule but it was a ok place
good,A typical day at Sears Auto center is to sale as much tires as you can. What i have learned while i was working for Sears Auto center is you need to push your sale no matter what it take to get that sale. They go through Management like new empolyee on probation. Some co-workers are nice and some just steal your sells even when you make a price quote for your customer. Since you are on an hourly wage pluse commission. At Sears auto center its a hard place to work for if you hardly sell any tires the day you work. The most enjoyable part of that job i would have to say the customer that i meet.
good,Working for Sears can be a fun and interesting place to work. The everyday tasks of the job can either keep you very busy or slightly busy depending on how much or how quickly it is done. It is a great place to get new skills that I can apply to the future whether it be at Sears or at a different company.
good,Learned more from my boss and fellow workers than I have ever before. Gave me confidence in myself as a person and as a salesperson.
good,"The culture was very good, you felt like you belong. once in a while, you other associates can be out of place. Overall Sears was awesome. Most of people I worked with were friendly and were responsible. They were not not trying to backstab you."
good,"It’s good place to work at it’s a lot of hours it just sucks that they are closing it was a good store and all the people"
good,The people were great management was great you could easily get help if needed. It ashamed the Sears distribution center where I worked went bankrupt.
good,the day to day work was for the most part the same. the only things that changed were the garage door it self. i learned how to remove and install new doors. removal and install of garage door openers were pretty simple but arm strength was definitely needed. luckily my partner and mentor was there to aid and instruct me on the tricks of the trade
good,"A great place to work. Our team is helpful, kind and full of knowledge. I feel proud to work around Co-workers that have been with Sears for 30 years, 10 year's!"
good,Es un area de trabajo en donde generas otro tipo de aptitudes y ademas generas experencia en desenvolverte con las demas personas ya se de alto rango o rango promedio (medio).
good,"Great company, with many wonderful people. Although the pay and incentives lack greatly; it has major skill building opportunities. Also, it can be a great way to have a life outside of work while working."
good,On your feet all day but it is a laid back environment. There is always something to do or someone to help but for the most part it is never chaotic or stressful.
good,"I don’t get much hours but when I do I get to my area I’m assigned. I then start organizing, such as taking stuff out the fitting room, folding tables, and helping customers with whatever they need."
good,Great place to work. Woking at sears I gained people  skills working with the public.
good,Fun but customers always had complaints with a lot of small problems that wasn't any of sears employees fault. They would try to return items that have been used and broken and try to return it after.
good,I love the fact that Sears did not discriminate against any person and gave everyone a chance to work. I worked with amazing people and it was a great environment.
good,"Great Company to work for nice people to work with enjoyed all my co workers and managers also"
good,"Worked in the Automotive department and it was very fast past. Dealt with some customers that didn't have the nicest thing to say to the sweet hearts that brought snacks for me while waiting. Had those other customers that just asked questions after questions while there is a long line of people waiting to be helped. Overall love the fast/ busy past, you never get a break BUT time does go by fast."
good,"Fun and productive work environment. A little fast paced at times but not overwhelming. Nice, understanding and friendly managers. Flexible schedule.."
good,Typical day was counting money and balancing registers. researched shortages and made bank deposit. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with situations that i personally could not control. Sears is a great stepping stone for technicians to harness their skills. But for the amount of pay that you receive you have to put aside the low pay rate and push forward.
good,Very good Job. A place where you learn a lot and can succeed but you have to be productive. A place one can look up for starters to earn experience in the areas of sales and customer service.
good,"Es un lugar estable para trabajar, con excelentes prestaciones y beneficios"
good,"Typical work day included: Working in cash room-checking vault balance,  inputting all monies collected from registers, asking out daily deposits. Checking cash drawers on floor that were over/short. Filing; computer reports for days deposits, Reported any glaring discrepancies for registers to security. Running money to cash registers that needed change or had to much cash on hand. Calling prospects that applied for jobs as needed. Checked mail daily and delivered to appropriate divisions.Kept work area clean and orderly."
good,"I had worked for Sears Auto for 4 years. Made my way up from CSA to Assistant Automotive Manager within a year and a couple of Months. During my time there I had gone through about 8 managers. It got to the point where the Management decided to put my name on the parts purchase credit cards since I would outlast any manager we would have.  I loved the people I worked with, the techs, the other CSAs. I really enjoyed the work, fellow employees and most customers.  The pay was really good too. But as you may have seen recently we have no idea what will happen with Sears.  I left because my position was eliminated. They did offer me a chance to go down a step to lead CSA.. they told me i would make as much if not more than my position of asst. mngr. But  I figured it would look better on my resume  that I had left as an assistant manager than being demoted to a lead csa.  Also I have seen how  buisness has been affected by the news of sears."
good,"I wish this company was not in such dire financial straights.  The work is incredibly rewarding and we are empowered to try new things and given the support to be very innovative and work independently.  We are making strides, but not fast enough.  I would never leave this wonderful group of people and this proud company except the uncertainty and low pay with no promotional opportunity is driving me to seek another position with a company that can offer me a future.  So Sad."
good,"Management was horrible. there was no work/life balance. Management always overbooked and techs got stuck working mandatory ot with zero thanks.. When I started they wanted us to sell one thing per day. By the time I left they were wanting us to average $15 per work order. We received no extra pay for this. We had 6 metrics to meet but all they cared about was $/work order, which wasn't even one of our metrics.. I was the top tech of the month one month but all I heard about was how my $/work order sucked. We were sent out to work in any weather conditions with no thought to our safety. When techs would bring our concerns up in weekly meetings we were told they would look into things- they never did. The health insurance was horrendous with a 2500 deductible. Once the deductible was met they only would pay 80%, not 100%.. The only decent thing was getting every channel for only $20/per month."
good,"Working at Sears was a great experience, it was my first job in retail and the assistance managers were so awesome. they were willing to teach their new employers everything it took to perform excellent with their customers as well as running the sales floor with great customer service."
good,"My typical day at work includes answering incoming calls from customers and drivers regarding scheduling deliveries; installations; delivery issues; and responding to desk emails.  Our number one priority is customer satisfaction  Customer is always first and my main focus is satisfying the customer by finding ways to resolve their delivery and installation issues in a timely manner.  My goal is to answer at least 100 inbound calls, and responding to 50 desk cases per day.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve customer issues due to it being out of my control.  The most enjoyable is when I have a day with no escalation and I am able to cater to the needs of all my customers who call in with issues regarding their delivery and installation."
good,"A typical day at Sears involves me interacting with customers that are interested in knowing more about our products with the hopes of purchasing them. I learned how to communicate better with customers as well as valuabl. selling skills,"
good,"Great place to work. Management and employees are great to work with. Everyone helps out to get the work done. You do get a discount off ourchases. Working in he backroom , duties are timely."
good,"We were each assigned our own specific area, which we merchandised to store standards, with planograms wherever possible, to incorporate them into the area."
good,Bonne esprit d'équipe et de culture de l'entreprise. Un directeur proche de ses employés. Une rotation pour pouvoir être polyvalent
good,"I got several promotions working at Sears and they provided training.  It was a fun,active and competitive place to work.  One of my favorite jobs, but the pay was so low."
good,People are great. The training is detailed and specific so you know what your job entails. There are various positions you can apply for that will utilize various skills as well as teach you new skills.
good,I ran service and repair calls as a field technician; my route of aprox 9 calls per day were downloaded onto a company laptop computer I kept at home; I would leave at aprox 9:00 am and return home at about 7:00 PM...usually only stopping at my shop to pick up parts that were previously ordered for specific jobs
good,It was a joy to work for Sears for so many years 20 years looking for a job to be able to live comfortable I have experience in computers driving a van for small packages being a supervisor as well as a physical laborer
good,I really liked the people I worked with.  We were like a family and worked well together. We learned how to be team players and also to work alone. The management team were wonderful and supported us at all times.  The  staff really did value our customers.  The hard part of the job was having to leave.
good,"It was a fast paced environment engaging customers, qualifying sales leads and closing business. It was a great place to work as they always put the customer first and had amazing customer service."
good,Nice workplace with good team members and boss. Hd a good experience working at Sears. Team leader was great to work with and fellow workers were helpful.
good,"Sears was at one time the greatest retailer to work for , fair practices great leadership. After the creation of Sears Holding Company the company lost sight of the customer and workers and was primary goal was profit."
good,"a very calm and quiet working environment.  All the ladies worked together and everyone seemed to get along.  The customers became like family, we were all on a first name basis."
good,"A typical day at work is providing customer service for customers who need help find what they need. I have learned to be very diligent with my knowledge of my department and how to work in a new environment. The management was excellent, i do not have complaints due to i was able to have clear communication and direction. The hardest part of the job is the lack of employees, sometimes there just werent enough and we did have busy days. The most enjoyable part was getting to know a new environment and meeting new people, also to learn about different merchandising."
good,"Sears is the best place to start sales, you just learned so much I never have such a great sales training techniques. the company keeps you motivated. They know how to separate the aftersales stress from the motivation a sales person needs to be able to achieve there goals. The hardest part of the job is that is commission only and when you have bills to pay and family it can't be hard not to count with a base salary. the working hrs where difficult too, since they are unpredictable and you get then every morning depending on  appointments. the bes sales opportunities are at nigh which can be great fro some people but when you have young children it could be very difficult."
good,"Nice and friendly environment. Struggled to keep the clothes folded and picked up off of the floor and incorrect areas and dressing room area. Co-Workers would leave their work undone for me since I worked until closing 9pm. I accepted the pay because most retail jobs offer the same amount unless your title if in Sales, Management, IT Department."
good,"Stressful job with the company doing poorly in sales and stock prices.   "
good,Sears fue mi patrono por 30 años me voy en Septiembre 10 2017 por mejor salario y beneficios para mi futuro mas atractivo mas ingresos mas horas de trabajo garantizadas pero mi gustaba la tienda y mis compañeros y gerenciales pero la empresa en estos momentos no esta muy estable en el mercado por eso decidi renunciar .
good,What's a good place to work for. The boss is a great guy. One of the best work environments I had met him. Unfortunately there is no chance for advancement due to the fact that it was a privately owned franchise.
good,"What an interesting place to work. Typical day you go in, sell, merchandise even though you don't have to, cover other departments because people call in sick often and deal with the consequences should they arise for covering someone elses shift as it will negatively affect you as youre unable to take care of your own responsibilities."
good,Pues solo era yo la unica que estaba en la oficina junto al dueño nada mas
good,"wonderful parties and entertainment on a daily basis, great food and friendly coworkers, management is extremely friendly and informative, diverse work culture"

good,"had some great managers there, fun team to work with, competition was great, and customer service skills were exercised. the hardest part of the job was when it was slow paced trying to keep busy."
good,Unless you have to deal with an angry customer this job is very easy-going. Every week I had a list of things to complete which were usually quick and easy things.
good,"I enjoy the Sears store in Quincy, but due to company restructuring it makes working uneasy. I always keep busy with deposits, payroll, filing, and working on the floor."
good,Sears is a fun place to work. The people are great that work there. You can work on your own or with a team and you still get stuff done! The company needs to pay more. Their employees work hard and don't earn enough. They also shouldn't ask for you to get credit or you don't get to keep your job as a cashier. Need more people on the floor.
good,provided customer service and upsold sears product to our customers that needed sears products. Maintained a relationship with  all Sears customers and getting feedback of the result for a  repair call from a tech
good,Sears has bin a very rewarding company the management of the store is good but mid level management thinks its the dark ages and do not care about employees
good,"typical work day was about doing as good as possible, pay was based on commission "
good,Sears Auto is a good place to work for if your are looking to advance your career in the automotive field. They send you to training pretty often so you can become a better technician and become master tech.

good,"Good call center, most calls were easy. lots of support during training and coworkers were friendly. had contest for top performers. individual coaching weekly."
good,"I was working in a part of Sears called ""home improvement"". We were almost as bad as an outside vendor, and it was stressful, and the business was slow. I was able to make money to save for school, but it would not cover rent as a primary form of employment. I felt sorry for my district manager."
good,"I liked working here.  I loved my manager,  I learned a lot about jewelry at this job.  It is hard selling it since it is so expensive.  I pretty much stood around, there wasn't much I could do."
good,We made the sales signs for the local running ads and we also helped customers find what they were looking for. I also handled some bank deposits and cashed customers out at the register.
good,Had nice employees and decent pace during the day. Very productive on Thursdays when truck would come in. We would all work together to get the job done.
good,"It was my first jobs. it help me built morals and the value of a dollar. The associates are really nice, and always had a flexible schedule to work around my personal life."
good,"Great company to work for, have been working there for over 10 years. A company that promotes with in hard workers. Sears does is one of the better companies that really train there employees to do the job."
good,"Wonderful place to work. My first job out of high school."
good,great staff and great hours during the holidays. However once the holidays end so do all the hours you where use to working. They kept me on after the holidays and i just cant live off of working only 4 hours a week for $10.00 an hour its not right.
good,Great place to work an get to know others on the job. Managment was great. Hard working job. Gotta really look at the tickets to make sure there right to go on the belt. Loved the job
good,"I liked that I got to speak to different customers from all over the U,S and make sales. Training was great because I learned about all types of appliances."
good,Coworkers are always friendly and ready to start the day positively. Most of the management is friendly and understanding of each individuals personal life.
good,"Overall sears was a great place to work, I got along well with the other employees I enjoyed going to work and it was a good environment. It was a good experience"
good,"It was in a great location, easy to get to. many places to eat within walking distance. the managers however, cared ore about the metrics than the employees."
good,"It was in a great location, easy to get to. many places to eat within walking distance. the managers however, cared ore about the metrics than the employees."
good,A great place to build a high performing team to achieve best in class results. Day to Day customer interaction is the driving force to success.
good,"Unloaded trucks, put merchandise on carts to be taken to the sales floor. Co Workers were great. "
good,très bonne compagnie agréable a travailler bonne employeur
good,"* Scheduled Monday thru Friday 7am to 4pm.  We had approximately 650 workstations and phones in the inbound call-center I was stationed at.  The last 4 years had been working with outside customers mostly in the USA but also in other countries for those that traveled. "
good,buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros.ambiente sano y de confianza con los integrantes de la empresa.la parte mas dificil fue el salario no remuneraba todos los ambitos  culturales sociales y basicos para mi familia.
good,"customer service, sales, a bit of management.  Merchandising, signing, pricing, cash register operations and loss prevention in adherence to all company policy/store standards. Handle cash register and manage cash receivable and payables"
good,A typical day at Sears was scheduling appointments for customers who Heating and Cooling units were not working. I learned a lot about good customer service qualities and always delivering a WOW experience to customers.
good,Typical day starts with you clocking in and getting money bags. Going to the morning rally and finally opening up the registers. The management is very incompetent. The store is ran down inside. Major improvements need to be made first if they expect to turn it around.
good,"Make outbound calls to people around the united states to try and set appointments for our sears dispatch service to come to their house and present home improvements such as roofs, doors, windows, and hvac units."
good,encourage others to be team players and friendly to others also build up customer relationship and helped them to work the hardest was not having enough hours
good,"for part time was great while in school, customer service and administration is what i did and catalogue, christmas was always fun , most busy, dealt with difficult customers but pulled through. Great team, everyone helped each other, created great friends."
good,"I've learned a lot within my time at the company, and I experienced new things; in which gained me more skills. I've opened up a lot as a person, from dealing with apprehensions, giving orientations, and interviewing. Many of my co-workers that trained me, have now moved on to higher positions or new jobs. I've maintained to stay motivated without them. For me, the hardest part of this job is to sit in the chairs and watch cameras for long periods of time. For the most part, I like to move around a lot. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is catching people while watching those cameras. It is always exciting when we have a case going."
good,"I enjoyed my time there just not enough money. Management was good, but not enough hours or business to make make a living"
good,"Other then not enough hours it is a good place to work. The staff and management are very helpful and will work with you, when needed. Training is very easy, if you can stand for extended periods this is a great place to work, one downfall I find is that they push people to hard to get credit applications."
good,"My overall experience at Sears was great. The people were very committed to providing excellent customer service. If I did not have to move from New York, I will still be employed there."
good,"Flexible hours,  just not given enough. Versatile schedule. Great mix of culture. Great learning experience in all departments."
good,"Me gusto el ambiente de trabajo, solo que hay que buscar una superacion economica. Me voy satisfecho de la empresa"
good,"Staff, managers and trainers are accessible. Clean facilities. Learned a lot about Sears services for the customers. My co-workers are friendly."
good,Constantly interacted with customers face to face and over the telephone. Would sell auto parts to them and also had the certification to install the parts. When I worked at sears I was going through college for communication and it pushed me to be above average in my sales by having a good positive personality.
good,"I serviced daily customer routes, included sales and service. Sears eventually sold their franchise, but L learned a lot there.going to peoples homes and taking care of their problems."
good,"usually would work M-F 8am to 2pm and over time as needed. i learnt all 3 main departments, shipping, receiving and order filler."
good,"This job was wonderful, no one every knew who you would meet in person.  Always in contact with someone interesting."
good,"Great store to work in. Senior Management left alot to be desired. Always seemed short of staff, large turn over of staff in retail part of store The hardest part of job was watching the  young people been let go."
good,It is nice to have an employer that gives the option to choose between weekday and weekend shifts and also flexible hours.
good,"Overall rating is 4 stars, Working for this company was a very good learning experience, Ilearned  a lot about  merchandising and the management was great."
good,"This was a fun and inviting job., the doctor's where very nice and everyone in the office were fun loving but professional as well, we all did or part and the office was well maintained ."
good,"The team was very welcoming to a student coming on board to help out around the store and office."
good,"great experience being in retail , coworkers were great , the job environment is good .everybody got along great and costumers were wonderful."
good,"This is a place that offers opportunities in other areas and leaves it open for all to apply from within.."
good,"This position was a learning experience!  We worked hard.  From the minute of clocking in you were learning, you were helping and you were not slowing down for the minute.  You left the day feeling overworked, but under compensated for the tasks required of you.  Somehow through that came teamwork, loyalty, respect and dedication to getting a job done and being rated such among your fellow retail districts."
good,Worked for sears only for the holiday season and loved it! But it was only temporary and I wish it wasn't. I was able to monitor cameras and approve out going merchandise. Was my second holiday season with Black Friday shoppers.
good,"When I found out I was being hired for a position in Mens Wear, I was literally ecstatic. I was working harder than most people with a smile on my face mostly due to the working environments. I was told 95% of the seasonal workers would be getting fired so to speak as they do every year which was reasonable. I ended up getting called to the Managers office and he offered me a job as an official Sears employee. I was extremely happy and couldnt wait to prove they made the right choice. Everything was going great until for two months in a row I was getting no more than 6 hours a week. I loved Sears but I couldnt survive with those amount of hours. I would have loved to stick it out and wait to see if anything changes but the manager literally told me that my hours wont change for another 4 months so I absolutely had to give my 2 weeks notice with great sadness but it had to be done. All in all, great relationships and experience are still with me to this day from working at Sears. No hard feelings !"
good,"desde que empece a trabajar en sears la emocion era grande ya que era mi primer trabajo en las ventas y siempre quise vestir de manera elegante en un trabajo y tener un traje e ir al trabajo para mi era muy importante, me sentia un ejecutivo alquien importante, pero fue una gran enseñanza ya que aprendi muchas cosas y me enseñaron a vender; la primer quincena saque muy poco de comision pero en mi mismo decidi echarle muchas ganar y a vender mas y asi fue fui incrementando mis ventas obiamente teniendo mis demas responsabilidades sin descuidarlas, todas mis compañeras  me apoyaron mucho nunca me dejaron solo y asi fui aprendiendo, me encanto formar parte de esa empresa y me llevo muy bueno recuerdos de sears."
good,I always enjoyed being employed with sears. My days were enjoyable. I worked hard and had a good time doing it. I trained many associates to be just like me. The hardest part of my job was figuring out who was going to help me lift merchandise. The best thing is I walked away with a very good friend.
good,"sears waterford was an amazing place to work, coworkers were friendly and hospitable. management always pushed us to be the best we could be as well as discipling us when the need arised, it's a shame that this location is no longer in business."
good,Sears was a fun and a great place to work at.  I enjoyed the people they were great to work with.
good,"Good place to work, friendly eniornment, mulitipule associates to assist with wants and needs."
good,Spent 15 years with Sears and enjoyed my involvement within this Corporation.
good,"Assisting customers with their needs, how to watch body language, straightening and stocking floor inventory, soliciting credit applications, and sometimes demonstrating products are some of the typical duties.  I learned about the various products in four different areas of the Home Improvement  section.  The hardest part would have been taking heavy merchandise down from a high shelf in stockroom by myself.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers, building a relationship with them over the years."
good,"fun "
good,Like Where I'm working . But the workplace has came to an end. They are closing where I work due to non-profitable sales.
good,A typical day of work consisted of preparing large orders for all stores in the region. I have learned management skills with organization skills. The hardest part of the job had to be the short deadlines. the most enjoyable part of the job was the professional environment.
good,it was a job that i went to everyday for the pas 32 year and now my job ended because of the unit close now I need to find a job
good,"it was nice with my co workers but one person was not so great"
good,I was very upset when we closed I loved taking photos and being apart ofthelittle employee family that we had!!
good,good flexible scheduling a good work environment and all the co workers worked together as a team
good,"Sold large appliances,ran credit, set up deliveries, handled customer problems,helped customers in any department which was needed. With large appliances you have to really get involved with you customer one on one. Every customer was a new experience."
good,"It was a great place to work"
good,this was one of the hardest manual labor jobs ive ever had but my manager was good to me and respected the work I did. it was difficult for me to unload the trucks and that had to be the worse part of the job but I did it and wouldn't give up. the best part for me was the paperwork because ive always been good at organizing what needed it. breaks were two fifteen minute breaks and one half hour lunch and it had to be on schedule.
good,"I was always organizing clothing on the racks by size, color, type, and brand. I learned a lot of organization skills and how to deal with customers. My management was very consistent and very direct with what they wanted. They taught me very well where everything went and how it should be done. My coworkers were a blast to work with and they were always happy to come into work each day. The hardest part of my job was remembering where everything was.The most enjoyable part of my day was organizing the clothes."
good,Sears is one of the best places I have worked.  The managers are all on the same page and communicate with everyone about what the numbers need to be day to day.  The co-workers were fun and down to earth and ready to help anyone who walked through the doors.
good,I love to work I like to socialize with people give them ideas and I will positive about my job

good,"I knew the management very well, because she birthed me. My mother is the softlines asm and it kind of dampened my enjoyment of the place. But overall it is very easy to make an extra pay check as a cashier, and it was very nice."
good,"""If you find a job that you like you will never have to work another day in your life"""
good," This amazing job let me create and capture precious moments and getting to work with the most AMAZING kids and their families. And the best part was selling the either the bronze, silver or gold packages for competition to the other co workers. I was seasonal at the establishment and unfortunately it went out of business."
good,You are customer friendly working in an enviroment where customers are treated with respect..These are customers who have come to Sears for many years..Co-workers are like an extended family..Customers are like family as well.
good,loved the job cause i was able to work on cars and most of all work with my hands.
good,"I loved working for Sears. The time I spent working for them is not replacable in my opinion. The only reason that I left was because the pay structure is comission based and when the economy tanked I wasnt making as much as I was in previous years. I learned from one of the best managers that I have every had. I would love to go back and work for them, that is, if I knew I could make something."
good,A typical day at sears was very generic..I handled many of the same scenarios repeatedly with cst's but alot times the primary difference was based on the cst and each one of their personal situations ..I learned more than anything that in life you never know what each person you come in contact with is going through so its best to approach every situation whether it be a customer or a co-worker with an open mind and an open heart so that you can be prepared to extend every possible form of assistance to them .That alone was one of the main things i enjoyed about my job helping people
good,A day at Sears was kind of fun I reqlly did enjoyed working at Sears
good,The Jewelry industry is exciting and you find yourself surrounded by lovely pieces. I cannot think of anything negative with the exception of only certain time periods that you can make large sums of money.
good,Change in management and was just used to the old team. Love the customer base usually very friendly. Great availbility to brands. Known for Kenmore and Craftsman.
good,"Well a typical day was getting to work before store opened and setup the weekly advertisement sales through out the womens department. It take about 4 hours to 8 hours to set up. Then if I had time I would mark down old merchandise reorganize the racks and set out new merchandise in place of the marked down merchandise. Management was good. I mostly worked alone; but if I did work with any of my co-workers they were fantastic. The hardest part of my job was making sure that the sales were accurate and matched. I really enjoyed marking down old merchandise, reorganizing the racks, and setting out new merchandise, helping customes recommend and select merchandise."
good,"Nice work environment, with amazing co-workers. The management team at sears were helpful whenever i had a problem."
good,A lot of dealing with customers on the phone.
good,"A typical day would be drive forklift, unload and load trucks."
good,"While I am looking for a full time job, I absolutely love it at sears. Great place to work, friendly co workers and relaxed atmosphere. The experience i gain is great, i have learned so much from becoming a sales representative."
good,"Cashier -Provides support to the Front-End/Cashier operation in the form of servicing customers, carry outs, product information, back-up support."
good,"Each day consists of numerous customer service issues. I fully understand that I'm in a business that caters to the consumer, and with that knowledge I do all that I can to ensure that each customer is taken care of. Sales floor management takes up a good portion of my day as I'm trusted to make sure our floor is signed properly and our product is merchandised. Maintaining sales figures and utilizing tools to increase customer traffic is imperative. I also emphasize proper inventory controls every other day. In just a few months time I've really transformed into a dependable leader. I've come to understand that my actions speak much louder than anything I say. I dedicate hours outside of work to learn about the business and shadow other managers and even go to work when I'm not scheduled. This work ethic encourages others to give it every thing they've got even if this isn't the path they dreamed of. My employees are certainly one of my main priorities. Proper training and guidance takes place each day. Positive encouragement along with helpful criticism ensures that I'm getting the most out of each worker. Occasionally there is an outcry for more pay and more hours, but everyone understands that rewards are performanced based. The hardest part of the job is scheduling people during the holidays when I know I'm taking them away from their families, but I understand that if the business doesn't profit than none of us would have jobs. I will say the most enjoyable part of the job is the recognition I get from customers letting me know that I've made a difference in their retail"
good,The people you work makes the atmosphere great. Ther is no more to tell.
good,"I had a great experience with the company. They were very friendly but business oriented people. With their well known name and quality of products, we always had a lot of runs for the day which kept us busy and motivated."
good,"I am a I.T Supervisor currently with this company. My daily tasks were to load and unload carrier trucks, inventory stock, liquidate certain products, ship packages all over the world using UPS Worldship, checking in stores that closed down using Excel Spreadsheet, traing new hires. I forced myseld to learn every inch of this location so i could not only be efficent, but a valued asset to this company. I am very relied upon in my positioin and to be honest, i will miss this job and the amazing managment team. The only reason for leaving is the simple fact of my job assignment is coming to an end and there is no way around it."
good,"a typical day at work was to clean the backroom and restock the shelves, and help any customer that purchesed any big appliances such as washers, dryers, freezers, lawn mowers."
good,A typical day at work can be very hectic but fun. I learned alot from the store in greensboro nc the associates and mangers are awesome to work with. The hardest part of the job is when you are swamped with people and not enough help.
good,During Christmas it was really fast. I had to multi-task and learn several jobs at a time. I liked working as a Shoe Merchandise Associate.
good,I've worked part time at Sears as a sales consultant for the the last five years. I enjoyed working with customers on a daily and one on one basis. Working at sears for me wasn't like having a job the managers and supervisors made is a great place to be. I'd say the most enjoyable experience working at sears is getting the sale.
good,This job was the best job I ever had and I regret ever quitting. I had to leave under personal reasons.
good,Clean and electroplate copper electrical parts. I am learning what it takes to plate one metal onto another. The management looks out for their employees. The hardest part of the job would have to be the summer heat.
good,on phones and breaks inbetween
good,great atmosphere. Awesome training. Even thoug i only worked there for one season i learned a lot and am now shooting to have my own photography business.
good,Old American Company that has had difficulty competing with newer retail outlets. Appliances and hardware are the 2 best departments. Too much pressure on management to meet credit application goals. Store Manager was positive and a very sharp motivated individual that was a pleasure to work for. The Corporate regional and divisional managers are only interested in numbers and are trying to change a company constantly behind.
good,work with restocking shelves and clothing on designed areas and kept an eye on the conditions of the fitting rooms. I also watch for shoplifting crimes as well.
good,"Greet and respond to customers. Help customers with their needs, answer merchandise questions, inform them of special sales."
good,Very flowing work area. It was a pleasurable work experience.
good,The Tech's helped make a system that went national. We went from as much as a 24 day to service to a 2 day in large city's and a 4 day everywhere else in the Region's. We went from a 35% first call complete average to a 80% first call complete. And we improved the number of service calls in a day by our routing staff.
good,I loved working at Sears because I'm a people person and I have 2 children to provide for and it was a great work experience for me.I also enjoyed seeing customers pleased as they leave the establishment which makes your day even better.
good,"High standard work ethics. On spot job training, Equal opportunity to all races, flexible work, friendly management and poor salary. Work is much with limited workforce."
good,I learned how to be a better leader and also how to obtain a great sales culture. The hardest part was being a salary manager working almost 60 a week.
good,"This was my first job so I did not know what to really expect but having grown up around that store with a parent working there, it was a good experience. I had a parent work for the company for ,many years and getting to be a part of the group for a few weeks was a new experience. My co-workers were friendly and helpful and made it enjoyable. My hours spent in the cashrap helping the customers with their purchases made the days fly by."
good,Market Coordinator is a very fast paced position.  Not everyone can do it.  I worked with a great team.  I established a great repor with my team of sales people.
good,"Most of my shift is spent answering customers questions and making sure the department is clean and organized or moving mattresses to make space for new mattresses to be displayed. In this job I've learned to be more assertive and more confident in my product knowledge. Management is very helpful when you need something. The hardest part of this job is moving and setting up the mattresses for display, they're really heavy. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you get to work with."
good,There is plenty to learn and ample flexibility. I had a great boss and brilliant colleagues. But would not rely on the top management. No job security.
good,"Your day at Sears can be going along smoothly and then before you know it, you have multiple customers, phone is ringing, and you hear your name over the intercom. I enjoyed these moments and found them challenging. While working at Sears I learned a great deal about not only the mattress and retail industry, but I learned a great deal about appliances which I had not expected. I also learned about signage and inventory in retail."
good,"I was the lead sales associate for Power tools, paint and hardware. I enjoyed my job selling these items.  My manager had a great way of supporting me when ever I needed it."
good,The management is the best groups of people I have seen at any job. You’re treated like a family and it’s a wonderful work environment. I have worked at Sears for almost 3 years and it’s been my favorite job. You’re expected to do work and get all your stuff done.
good,"My manager was great, however while I was employed it became obvious that the company was in financial trouble and would not like long. About 4 months after I left the store I worked at was closed"
good,"I enjoyed working there. The pay was low as it can be with retail. They offered fair healthcare, generous discounts but, not enough hours. I understand the store has had financial troubles, it's unfortunate because they are a great company. Working there got me out of a hole financially. I would work there again if I needed a second job. Good luck Sears I hope you make it. I really don't want to see you go."
good,"I  had to open register by counting the cash and answer question about merchandise to assist member with purchasing items, explain about Credit options and ring up the sale."
good,Empresa la cuál me permitió terminar mis estudios de ingeniería ya que el trabajo era fines de semana
good,"Worked hard but left satisfied that I have helped many people either find exactly what they were looking for, or solved a problem others had not been able to solve before me."
good,It was a great place to be and if sears didn’t close I would still be there I love that the customers we so nice and loved that I was there to help them
good,I love working there. Great people to work with and even greater when a job is fun to do. The job can be easy or hard depending on the size of the store. But it is otherwise a worthwhile job to gain great experience in retail or warehouse like jobs.
good,"Everyday felt like something new. ALways excited to get a new customer to enroll in the credit cards sears had to offer. Supportive meeting every morning, and sometimes different types of food in the backgrounds."
good,Sears was one of my favorite jobs out of most the jobs I had . The work was fast paced and a little complicated but became very easy In time . The work place was great . Your fellow associates pitch in and help when it is needed. No one really slacked on the job unless there literally wasn’t a thing to do .
good,Lots of team work. The manager I had was good he didn't yell at us if we did the work well then we were always on his good side. He was good and good and he was a nice guy.
good,"Helped the customers with various issues, lost cards, payments, credit checks, and billing."
good,Great co-workers. Great environment to work in. Supervisors make sure that you go on lunch breaks ad eat. And you will be able to take a 15 minuute break between your shift.
good,"I loved working with Sears portrait studio,  I loved taking pictures,  posing,  seeking beautiful pictures,  reaching my goals and more.  The props,  background and fun stuff was always fun to make the pictures perfect.  I loved it there,  great people,  happy, fun place to work."
good,"Everybody had a great personality, lots of laughs, enthusiasm, everyone was very helpful when they could be - always quick to help someone out who was new find where things went"
good,"I worked for Kmart, which owns Sears, however they are mostly going out of business. I miss working with my staff. A typical day at work, for me, involved dealing with customers either in store or via phone. I would be responsible for projects in the evening, as well as maintenance of the departments."
good,Very good work environment loved working with the customers and resetting the modules keeping all the shelves and accessories straighten neat and clean
good,"Best place to work.Sears have lot of new technology and opportunity to work multiple challenging project. Good opportunity to build new program from search and streamline the executing system."
good,I would review new product that would come into the store. I then would call back customers to see If they still liked a product they saw. I would help customers that would come in the store.
good,Buen empleo aun que hace falta dar seguro a los empleados
good,I enjoyed working at Sears where I can happily greet and help the customers.. as a floor assistant I used to merchandise the Sears products on Floor.. organized and clean the shelves.. folding or hanging the clothes in a way the store look so nice and easy for the customer to shop..  I used to do PC and help the visual team on floor. Or if I work on the cash register also I enjoy helping the customer wishing them a nice day.. 
good,"clocked in and worked on the computer for 10 hour days. "

No wonder they are still going strong as an organization after all these decades. It is a pleasure working for Sears Canada!!!! Bravo Sears!!!!"

This was my first corporate job, I enjoyed talking to every customer and establishing a positive customer experience.

The location I worked has turned around a lot, it has some bad weeds but those that were mean, rude and made others feel bad are gone."

good,"I enjoyed working here, as the environment was laid back for the most part. The managers pushed for their numbers but weren't complete robots most the time, they could laugh and crack jokes about each other with. Being that I had a commission based position I got an opportunity to really earn my paychecks and that proved to be my biggest motivator while I worked there. However, near the end of 2014 and the beginning of  2015 our inventory was not being resupplied with the products I sold, which meant I had less and less to sell to customers in the store. Management would not give any clue as to why, but I knew something was going on to restructure the composition of the departments. Eventually management announced that the commission base pay was being eliminated and I would be earning a base pay. The base pay was decent but below what I was making with my sales. I decide to walk away a few weeks after this announcement as I just did not have the same drive to sell stuff as I had before."

But besides the heat, the workplace was good there were friendly co-workers and the warehouse manager was a good manager who would work with your schedule as much as possible"
good,"When I worked for Sears I was young but I liked working there, never had much of any type of problem there. Training was great, I was trained on my job thoroughly. If my situation hadn't changed at the moment and needed to make more money then I would still be there. Very Good Company."
good,Everyday a employee meeting was held informing employees of daily numbers. I met alot of different people from many different backgrounds. Managers are always out on the floor assisting members with their puchases. Being able to have someone leave your register with a smile made my days enjoyable.
good,I have worked for Sears since I was 16 years old. I have been with the company for 2 years now. I started off as a Cashier and then became a Jewelry Sales Associate about 5 months ago. Sears has been very flexible with my schedule. Flexibility is something that I really need because I will be attending Penn State University in the Fall.
good,"Driving is what you need to do all over the state of Ohio, you'll be driving from Cleveland area to as far South as Coshocton, Ohio to Youngstown to Ashtabula to as far West as Toledo to Lima to Mansfield Ohio. Be prepared for one leggers or no shows when you arrive at your lead address. Sears does not pay for your fuel, it comes out of your pocket, just remember to log your mileage for taxes at the end of the year. You may be paired up with another sales associate at the beginning to show you the ropes, then they cut you loose to ride solo. You also need to turn in your leads the next day or that night if you have a fax so they can log your achievements or not. They do not have per diem, you must pay for everything out of pocket. If you like outside sales and you then can earn as much as your heart desires, but as much as I have earned while working there was around 60K the first year before the bottom fell out in 2008. Benefits are awesome, but pay is either hit or miss."

My co workers were all very nice and friendly I have no complaints and management was nice and helpful however I found there was a lot of pressure to sell, sell, sell which in turn took away from helping customers to the full extent because most of our customers didn't have a lot of money. The hardest part of the job was meeting quota on a weekly basis. The best part of the job was helping customers and making them happy."

Meaning, It never changed unless you make things happen. YOU, make all the difference at any job. Sears for the most part was organized and schedules were pretty much laid out and available to everyone who worked there. How you analyse the information given was all up to  attitude.  Training others was my favorite part of the job. Sears gave associates the help needed to succeed in this business. I enjoyed training others and watching them grow and move on to better things.  I never got a pat on the back, but I did make a name for myself and was respected by both management and associates."

good,"I loved working at Sears. It was a wonderful place to work with an amazing environment. Everyone I knew was so happy and cheerful but management was always a little sour faced.

A typical day in the jewelry department usually included me counting the registers/opening the registers when the store opened.  I also operated the register, persuaded customers to buy warranties to go along with their jewelry.  I also had to pitch credit or any other offer we had going on at the time.  I processed jewelry repairs electronically and manually.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to communicate with people.  I am an outgoing individual.  The hardest part of the job was persuading customers to sign up for credit.  Most customers are firm in their decision and there is no way you can change their minds. My co-workers and management loved me.  I had to leave because I attended college two hours away.  But they want me to come back in the summer.  That shows me that I make a very positive impact on jobs."

They all had different ways of doing things but at the end all achieved their goals.  The hardest part of this job was to go home at the end of your shift.  It's so dynamic that you get involve and the sales aspect of it pulls you in.  The best part was to fulfill customers needs.

Learned to work with barcode scanners, intercom systems, phone systems, portable scanners, pallet jacks and dolleys. Management team was good knowing what needed to be done, but did expect allot out of their employees. My co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the day.

The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is working around state of the art electronics.
good,"Stocking shoes from shipments, filling sales floor , assisting consumers. I learned about reading peoples needs and wants, how things are ordered and average time to receive them. My management team was decent sometimes hard to find or hard to get the same answer from more than one, but over all great people to work with. My co-workers were all younger than me with different core values but they were all hard workers and we all got along great. It was a commission based Job so that made it less of a helpful team setting and more of an out for yourself."

good,"10-15 years ago Sears would have been a fantastic place to work but with the death of malls full-time positions are hard to come by and the commission is pennies on the dollar of what it was. My team was incredible, we all helped one another and the competition was always friendly and loads of fun. Our regular guests were a part of the family as well, nothing put a smile on my face more than seeing one of my customers come back."
good,"Enjoy working there meeting new people the bosses where very nice, and made the job relaxing atomphere. The pay was good hated they had to close Sears call center."

good,"It's too bad that most of the Sears stores are about gone. I recall spending the first 15 minutes of our day in a meeting/recognition pep rally. It was motivational for the day to do well. If you work well, you have plenty of opportunities. I was promoted twice in less than 2 years, and was on the way for a 3rd promotion. Things didn't turn out that way once a new job opportunity came by, but i do remember fondly the days and opportunities i had at Sears."

good,"open up the department"
good,"I worked at Sears during their liquidation period, and even during a hectic time like that (believe me, it was pretty nuts) the staff was friendly, calm and generally collected. They treated me well even with my lack of experience and showed me exactly what to do and how to do it. I wish they didn't close, it was a great place to work."

good,it was an great work place and understanding boss and good hurs ok wage  one hour lunch was far from my house tho so it was hard to get to work sometimes
good,"It was fun working with people and some managers. The overall job was good.  The hardest part was trying to keep your bonus money you made and the definitely had a great open door policy. They were very diverse, excepting all types of people."
good,Sears has Great people working for them but do to online shopping the company is struggling just like other major retail department stores. Sears has a lot of loyal customers who are very supportive of the company.
good,"I had the pleasure of working with a fun, and professional team. I learned a great deal about excellent customer service during this time with Sears. The management at this time was very supportive and professional with all Sales Associates. I enjoyed working with customers in the bedding, bath, housewares, lighting and drapery departments. I became very adept at helping customers with their re-modeling and redecorating needs."
good,I loved working here but the pay just wasn't enough the staff was great and it is a family environment. you can get promoted as long as you work hard but the pay isn't worth it
good,"still currently employed"

good,"Working for sears parts and direct was very fun and relaxed. It's a small store n we only sold small part to home electronics. Never got too busy, but working there was fun because of my coworkers and manager."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears because I was able to meet a lot of different people and learn what it was like to work in a department store. The management staff was nice and professional, and they would do whatever they could to satisfy their members. (we don't call them customers, we call them members)."
good,"Yes, I had a few problems with a couple co-workers, but I loved my job enough to not care so much. I loved most of my co-workers and I was confident in my abilities with the cash registers. I was also used to the environment since I had worked apparel once before."
good,Sears treated you like family. The job isn't hard at all. Management was always there for any questions you needed and would be willing to help with everything. The hardest part of the job was investing time into customers and they decided not to buy. I loved working with everyone.
good,The hardest part was when you would be alone with like 20 customers trying to receive help & nobody shows up to assist. Especially not know how to answer questions about specific things especially the credits & rewards. The enjoyable part is being able to work with amazing people.

good,"Sears was a great place to work. Management was always helpful and fun. I was paid minimum wage but that wasnt a problem because the were plenty of hours to be handed out, however i didn't enjoy being paid biweekly. This location has closed."
good,We worked on commission it was quit competitive. If we didn't sell anything we basically had no pay. Now it's by law to get paid so they would pay you 8 an hour but as soon as you got a good commission check you have to pay them back
good,"Empresa departamental líder en su ramo comercial, con buen trato al personal y buenas prestaciones de ley."

good,i love working here. everyone is super friendly. manager and supervisors are always willing to help. great customer service at all times. low prices too.

Termina com a concretização de vendas e o reforço do lema ""satisfação garantida ou seu dinheiro de volta"". Aprendi a aplicar com maestria as técnicas de vendas baseadas na satisfação do cliente. A direção é pragmática e não deixa decisões importantes demorarem. A cultura e o ambiente de trabalho favorecem as vendas e os bons resultados. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era levar os pacotes comprados pelo cliente até o carro. A parte mais agradável era quando o cliente não aceitava ser atendido por outro vendedor e esperava o vendedor terminar o atendimento que tinha começado com outra pessoa."
good,I enjoyed working their.  It was very relaxed & had lots of fun working with the Public & Helping them with their Home Appliance Needs.  The Pay & lack of hours could have been better.

good,I worked during the holiday season and I loved it there it was only dull the first hour of opening. But after that it was busy at all hours of the time. I like multitasking so being able to work in all places at any given time was my specialty. The only negative thing I can say was that they only had 5 openings for the 15 different seasonal cashiers and some of us weren't hired on after the holiday season. My manager was amazing but I loved all the managers except one but I knew how to work around him. My favorite floor is the tools and hardware I got to work with people who actually talk and love to have fun so I always had a great day at sears.
good,"I was very happy at this job as a cashier.  My assistant manager helped me learn everything I needed to in a timely manner, and let me learn at my own pace.  I felt like it was laid back too and not really crazy busy.  The only time we got busy and packed was when we had our closing sales, about three weeks before our store went out of business.  Overall, I didn't feel overwhelmed with stress. Other than working the cash register, I only had to do the trash, vacuum, and keep the counters clean. I give this job a great review!"
good,"I loved working for Sears the people and management team were great. Unfortunately, people can't live on $7.25 per hour. Otherwise, I would still have that as my second job."
good,"Generally good. Manager actually cares about his underlings. Strong company emphasis on continuous improvement and taking input from all levels of employees. Working conditions in customer's homes range from horrific to luxurious; at hub office, dusty, disheveled but functional."
good,"Open to benching you for promotions, lots of one on one development.  Willing to work with you concerning family leave.  Work could be hurry up and wait, but overall very stimulating.  If you are open to moving you can get promoted and bounce all around the states."

good,"I always love the people and discount and rewards points looking at the fashion put nice handbag and shoes i like help "
good,This is a easy going job with a lot of hands on work. There is no typical day because everyday you'll have something new to do. You could have a simple day with loading customer merchandise or you could be assembling treadmills all day.
good,It is a good place to start off an automotive job will definitely  give u the experience u will need to go farther into the industry  fun and great to work
good,I would say that Sears has been a good place for me to gain a lot of sales and customer service experience. I have been trained in different departments at Sears and with that training has made me very knowledgeable in many products that Sears carries.
good,"A typical work day, was good, fast pace, enjoyable. What did I learned, Everything about Tires, Batteries and the different services that Sears sold. Management, Fair and keep everything in balance. Workplace culture, Standard Automotive Industry.

good,Great place to work. Everybody is nice to each other I learned how to use heavy machinery. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what to eat for lunch the team here is awesome we work together and get the job done.
good,Only negative aspect of working at Sears was the poor management. Besides that overall great place to start as a first job but its time for me to move on and further my experiences.
good,"Stocking, fixing signage, placing sales fliers, and helping customers was daily routine. This was my first job after the Air Force (13 years later) and in the beginning I was not sure what I was doing. With wonderful managers and co-workers I was welcomed, trained, and unleashed on the public! In the first 8 months there I received customer reviews of the highest scores, I was the first person to receive all 10's on all customer reviews. The people were great. My managers were willing to listen and help when I had difficulties. There was no downside to this job."

good,"Really liked working at Sears, the management that was there at the time I was there were great.  Enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,Store ended up closing due to slow business. Great environment and wonderful group of co-worker to fix any problem. Best part of this job was keeping customers happy by explaining any problems with any issues that bought customers in.
good,"You realize the importance and value that comes with the appliances that are ordered and treasured by customers. Fun crew, awesome management and hours were good"
good,I loved working at Sears. My co-workers were awesome and the pay was decent. I worked in sales in home improvement so I had an hourly pay plus commission.
good,"At Sears I was hired as holiday help. I did my job so well that they ended up keeping me after the holiday season was over. I typically put stock away and helped the customers by finding what they needed and ringing them out, simple cashier duties. I loved my co workers because they helped me learn what I didn't already know. The management was amazing! They were also their for any questions I needed answered."
good,Typical work place in transition.  A lot of great ideas just need to execute quicker and better.  Work life balance is good
good,My manger was very organized and very easy to talk to about any concern I had. My co-workers were very helpful and always willing to lend a helping hand when I needed one.

good,"Daily tasks always changed, but a very good working environment and great co-workers. Management could of had a little better communication"

good,"I enjoyed working for Sears and loved my job.  I always enjoyed going in to work.  I supported a professional and respectful leadership/team.  It was a friendly atmosphere, a fast-paced environment, and we all worked as a team.  I saw my team as a family, who all got along and worked great together.  The hardest thing was to see co-workers leave the company for a better opportunity and better benefits.I've learned not to take anything   personal and change is good. Sears/Kmart use to be the greatest and sales are down and it just breaks my heart."
good,"I start with opening registers. I greet any customers that come in. If we do not have it I try to go on line to place an order. Putting out merchandize from the truck and helping with signs, labels cleaning and straightening is all part of the job. Protect agreements, credit apps and reward sign ups. Helping people save money with their free reward money is great. I have done retail for over 20 years. I do it because I love to help people."

good,A typical day at work consisted of calm work pace. I liked all of my coworkers because they were always willing to lend a helping hand. I also liked this job because it was located at the mall which was convenient.
good,The staff is very friendly and helpful and there is always a senior available to help. Very good call center to get first time experience.
good,"Un día típico en mi trabajo era, llegar, saludar y comenzar a trabajar, normalmente entraba 11:30 y salia 8:30 pm y tenia una hora de comida, en cuanto a lo que aprendí fue a ser agradable con los clientes y saber como abordarlos, también a ser paciente con mis compañeros de trabajo y comprender que todos tenemos caracteres distintos y que a veces por la presión en el trabajo pueden surgir malentendidos pero que siempre se pueden resolver hablándolos."
good,Very enjoyable work place with a decent amount of employees working per department. There was a great set of  management who set out reasonable goals for the store. Their main focus was for us to attend to customers and ask if we could help them out in finding what they were looking for. It was quite an easy process signing in and starting your shift. Breaks were fait timing and the fact the store was located in mall was a plus. As holidays or major sales came around the work flow got a bit busy but overall it was a wonderful experience.

If I had an employee call in sick, I would try to find another to replace him or her.  We would work together and get our work space in proper order as merchandise would come in regularly.  We would send proper inventory to departments and neatly display for the public.  We would speak in friendly terms only when customers were not around. As a manager I would have to maintain a comfortable working environment for my crew.  At times, It would be a simple disagreement and we would sit down and almost always work it out.  I enjoy the public and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day."

It got old after a while. My coworkers were one of the reasons why I stood for so long. They liked to work and have fun with everybody. I enjoy a person and workplace that can give you both and let you work that way. The hardest part of the job was just learning Spanish. Well I didn't need to but it would have helped. What Spanish I know is from that job.

good,"Well the management at Sears was constantly changing due to the fact that the managers were taking new jobs with better pay at other stores. My last manager was a young fresh out of college guy with an attitude and a prejudice against his minority employees, which he thoroughly displayed at times."
good,"muy divertido por que a los que nos gustan las ventas se siente uno mejor cuando esta vendiendo lo que mas le atrae a uno en cuestion de articulos, por ejemplo yo he estudiado sobre computacion y me atrae mucho la tecnologia y trato de estar informado de los nuevos avances y me gusta estar actualizado, mis colegas de ventas tratamos de hacer un hambiente de trabajo ameno, lo mas dificil es que no me dieron el puesto en sistemas de la empresa ya que llego otra persona y se lo otorgaron a este y me postule para otro gerarquia pero no me tomaron encuenta y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo eran las ventas"

good,"A typical day at Sears during the week is pretty slow, this is the time for the merchandisers and the visual team to work on tasks and getting merchandise to the floor. I supervise all the merchandisers and make sure they correctly put out new items, sign it and make sure its presentable. On the weekend I drive the numbers and make sure the cashiers are delivering a ""wow"" member experience and their numbers are up.

good,"I've worked the range of Sears jobs: I worked in warehouse, signage, and sales plus did odd reset work like painting. The pay was standard, but management communicated giving more hours when needed and working with my full-time student job. Cashiers were unempowered, as a sales associates I did their work half the time. Unloading trucks and lifting appliances in the warehouse was sometimes dangerous. Climbing 12 feet was not strictly prohibited. Meetings twice daily, quarterly get-togethers, and many hours of training made employees feel invested. Maybe it was a Midwestern work ethic, but a lot of work got done with a smile."
good,"Over my 2+ years of working at Sears my knowledge of appliances had grown, along with helping customers find which appliance fits their specific needs. My manager and co-workers all worked well together and we all strived to better our store and increase sales as much as possible. The hardest part of my job was ordering parts or a very specific item for customers. This was difficult because sears online does not have specific details or dimensions on the items they sell. Therefore, the customer does know if the item will work until they receive it. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with customers and helping them find what they need."

In addition, going above and beyond in trying to need customer needs also will build a trust relationship with the customer and the company. My hardest part of the job would be in a situation where I am unable to meet the customer needs in any way or having to transfer the customer to another department when they have already been transferred six times of have been waiting on hold for almost an hour, The enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer with all concerns and the customer gives you recognition for it, it brings forth positive energy. My co workers at this job are my family."

good,It was okay well let me take that back the people were great but the work was kind of dangerous due to the nature of the unloading and loading of semi trucks with out lifting machines everyday we had to balance whole ranges or refrigerates on out shoulders and they would slam down on to the inside of the truck. And some of the works were over the age of 50 making this really hard on there backs and bodies and were not getting paid but 8 dollars an hour.
good,"Typical shifts ranged from 5-8 hours. Dealt with many types of customers as well as handled money.

Even if the company was going bankrupt, they still made strives to improve the work place by merging a few jobs that seemed natural. For the longest time, electronics and the appliance sales associates were two different jobs, but after three months of my stay in Sears, they had finally melded the two. As soon as I had moved to the shoe section, everything was a lot less competitive in terms of sales. I didn't have to meet a quote of protection plans or anything, but I did have to man a cash register and organize shoes that were misplaced. They provided a security jacket to me as a deterrent to stop any thefts which were quite common. Loss prevention even reached out to me after I've caught a few thefts. We were short staffed, but I was able to manage, sometimes I get to move appliances, and other times, I boast my knowledge of how expertly crafted a work boot was."

good,"Sears was probably the best first job to have when you're a teenager.  At first, I was sort of a guy who had a hard time talking to people, not because I was shy, just because I never knew how to really communicate.  When I worked at Sears, all of that change.  Sure at first it was a little hard but after a while it's easier when you're around professional management like retail.  They taught me how to communicate because I was going to have to talk to customers who would ask for help.  They know who to hire as well which made it even easier.  Every co-worker I knew were very nice, but I guess they had to be because they were working for a company that deals with helping people.  A typical day at work were relatively short, I would usually just clean the store, help customers, and stock the floor with merchandise from the warehouse.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the women's area because I really had no clue where to put things and when women would ask me for an item that they couldn't find I was embarassed to say that I didn't know.  It really wasn't that bad since I always worked in the Men's section.  The most enjoyable part was closing the store because there were no customers and it was peace and quiet so cleaning the store before I left ran very smoothly.  "

Our managers could be better I am not gonna lie but they do the best with what they have to work with. To be honest I am worried about if the company will still be around. It is to the point that you can't sell things to people in the store they would rather come in and play with the products then go home and buy it online. We are doing skeleton crews of people so when someone calls off or goes on vacation there is a ton more work to do but it has to be done. The appearance and customers suffer."

good,Aprendizaje en el área de capacitación y arte operativa
good,"I loved selling large appliances at Sears. They have a fair commission structure, good training programs and were, overall, a great company to start out with. After the 2008 recession, things took a turn for the worse. I noticed a significant drop in customers, which directly affected my paycheck as well as the company's bottom line. At this point, in 2019, most of the Sears stores have been closed."
good,"The tasks provided was a great learning curve over the amount of time I worked there with the ability to learn and grasp new skills. Great training, awesome work environment, and reasonable schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working in customer service in retail because it taught me how to interact with different customers and handle tasks like clearing the fitting rooms, helping out the company, getting to know my coworkers, and striving to accomplish the same goals. I was trained very well using a computer based training website. I also learned how to sell credit cards, and sales skills, and how to deal with customers, and company structure."

good,The management team is amazing. Never thinks twice about working around your schedule or to see if there is anything you need. The workers are happy and always more than willing to help out.
good,"Work at sears, learn a lot from the senior sales representative in home appliance. They will teach you the old tricks and then when your not on the lookout they grab your customers to teach you a lesson, some reps can take a lesson learn, I personal never had a problem. Work schedule is awesome to some point, the only down is managers will schedule you at times when the sales floor is dead and give the rush hours to senior, I believe in growth so am against the favorable over schedule, everyone should be treated the same we all have mouth to feed"
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears. My co-workers were always kind and genial, and I found it a very comfortable workplace. I worked in Footwear, and my job requirements were clear and simple. I ensured that my work duties were completed efficiently."

good,"Sears was great to me besides the pay I feel as though I should have gotten better pay for the things I done, but over all it was great it was a nice work environment, great managers and coworkers!!!!!"
good,Días largos y cansados pero aprendes demasiado y es muy interesante la clase de personas que llegas a conocer tanto como clientes como compañeros de trabajo.

good,"I loved to work for that great company "
good,El ambiente con los compañeros de trabajo es muy bueno.
good,"Trabajo muy bien organizado, buena comunicación, 6 descansos al mes y respeto a los horarios y horas extras."

good,"I love working for Sears, my coworkers, and the all of the customers. Sears tries to give associates time off that is requested but right now there aren't enough employees to always allow it. Sears gives plenty of resources for learning to include partnerships with universities."
good,"My management always provides me with up to date analysis on certain key issues where I can utilize my skills as a problem solver. "
good,"Before I joined Sears I had no experience with selling products to customers, however when I got involved with selling products I enjoyed my job and I learned lots of experience working with other people such as sale associates with high degree of knowledge.Overall, I learned lots of crucial skills."
good,I absolutely loved going to work. I love meeting new people and had fun with my coworkers and peers. I loved selling the merchandise and making life long customers. The hardest part of the job was when you don't sell you don't make money. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people from different cultures on a daily basis.
good,"The workplace culture was precise and help was available whenever was needed, Sears is a good company and their management takes care of what is needed to help the company."
good,Overall not a bad place to work for a semi-retired person. Growth is general non-existent both career wise and monetarily. Lunch times and break times are limited to 1/2 hr and 15 minutes. 1/2 hour is to little time to rewind.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Sears will cheerish all the memories awesome 28 yrs there,good managers, good working environment,very friendly people, worked as a team, everyone was able to voice there own opinions"
good,"After being hired to work as a CTAC phone representative for Sears, I instantly felt included in the Sears family. Our job was a detailed one, and I enjoyed working with my colleagues  to solve the issues our customers called to get help with. Our management was polite and happy to assist when there was a tough problem or system error. It was a tough job that required good listening skills, and a strong understanding of the products and our services, but there was always a supervisor at hand to help when needed. The hardest part of the job was leaving it in the end when Sears inevitably closed its doors."
good,"I wish sears was still around that place was great."
good,"This position was handed to me...it was a great experience ."
good,"great teams were built, excellent trainings. had to go without store manager 2xs while there, lack of leadership caused the boat to sink, awsome discounts"
good,"•	Customer Service Desk"
good,"Great job, very easygoing pace and easy to learn! Had some issues with management asking me to complete a task against how I was trained and against company policy. I was not comfortable with this so I did not stay when the offer was made and the seasonal position ended."
good,"Sears was a part time job where I was paid minimum wage., $1.70 at the time.  It was my first job right out of high school.  I worked it while I went full time to college, taking a full load.  I worked 20 t0 30 hours a week.  It was mainly a sales job with some clerical work too.   I was the Number 1 sales person in the department many times."
good,Sears was closed since Jan 2018.  It is a good company to work for hence I stayed in the company for 20 years.  Its my co workers that I will missed the most.
good,You work hard everyday and you were rewarded and everyone was treated as equals. You were always proud of your work and accomplishments and you were recognized by your peers during meetings.
good,"After attending Greenville Technical College, I started working at Sears Warehouse in the Maintenance Agreement Office. It was a great experience. I had always wanted to work in an office environment. The most important part of my job was the data entry and with the computer skills that I learned, it was very helpful for my job."
good,"beaucoup de tâches a accomplir"
good,"Energetic and customer focused environment."
good,"Great people to work with, can be stressful sometimes, coaching, training, motivating and proving feedback.  Daily conference calls and administrative work.  Daily communication with team members and manger."

Change signage, set up end caps. etc. Engage on staff meetings, gather all reports pertaining to the department(s). Rotate stock, and pull unsaleables. Mark downs, Change stock according to Plan-o-grams.  I learned in my 25 years with the company,  You work hard, and you get noticed. Sometimes, I have felt unappreciated, other times, the customers come through with their observations. The hardest part of my job, was scheduling help. or getting good help. Writing up an employee for lack of workmanship, or customer complaint, was ""Not"" an easy task. The enjoyable part of my job was volunteering with the youth and elderly. Over the years, I was Santa Claus, and Winnie the Pooh, visited local hospitals, and parades.  Went to nursing homes and spent time with elderly patients. This was giving back to the community. I was fortunate enough to travel and share my testimonials with other Sears employees."
good,"Although , only been here for less than a year. I would recommend working here, to anyone. I love the vibe with my co-workers and managers. Also I love having my weekends off, a set Schedule, and room for advancement with in this job."
good,The workplace is very clean and neat and there is always someone at your needs but the only bad thing is how slow it goes. It flows smoothly on weekends only.

good,It's a great place to work. Good people. You and your team can make great things happen as long as the team is being a strong leader. The people make the store.
good,Sears is a good place to go learn about the real world. Management is great the managers are there to help you learn and want you to succeed in what ever you do in your life. The hardest part of the job is when you are not able to help someone in need due to some part of policy. The most enjoyable is the culture the coworkers and the things management does to want to see your growth.
good,I learnt how to be persuasive and how to pitch protection agreement and I learned how to deal with rude customers and not lose my temper and stay firm and true to our policy. I made a lot of close friends and became close to the managers.
good,"Every day I worked at Sears, we started out with a sales meeting where management would share our previous days results and give us each a daily quota to reach. Once a month we were given a review of our job performance and asked to make our own personal goals to correct our short comings in sales projections or failure to follow company policy if applicable. Each day was a learning experience especially when dealing with customers/members. I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with my customers/members on a personal level. I enjoyed the member recognition when they would call me by name and tell me that someone had recommended that they get in touch with me about a certain product or service request. I actually enjoyed the hardest part of the job and that was the constant physical demands to double check product availability in the store warehouse and walking the sales floor to answer customer inquiries. If I had to do it all over again, I would do it again in heartbeat. I truly miss working at Sears! I was sad to see them close."
good,Todo está perfecto sueldo ambiente de trabajo todo es perfecto exepto los gerentes de ventas no saben portar un gafete de supervisor(@) ni cómo organizar al personal pero de ahí en más todo está excelente

good,"Great workplace, sadly it's closing down"
good,"I learned many things, especially in dealing with different customers, coworkers and managers. We are like a family.  Everybody is helping each other doing stocks and displaying merchandise in our store.  I enjoy working in Sears Garden City.  I will miss everyone in the store.  I enjoyed working with all of them."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of working as a cashier.  All of the people, including the managers and supervisors are extremely friendly, understanding and willing to work with you.  I enjoyed working there, however I didn't get many hours and there was no benefits.  I also felt like there was no room for advancement."
good,I loved the opportunities to both advance my career and grow as a leader that Sears provided for me. As a Logistics Operations Manager and Team Leader I enjoyed being able to mentor and develop new leaders. The shifts at Sears offered me a great balance between work and home life.It was a great company to work for and the only reason I'm leaving is due to it's closure.
good,"Contact with lots of customers,sales,maintaining contact with old customers,presenting appliances that fit the customer needs,close sales,good product knowledge to be able to recommend the right product based on the customer needs."

The hardest part of my job was to call customers and explain technician would not be able to come to their house for service but calm and polite tone of speech won the day."
good,I definitely grew as a customer service representative because I learned to be more emphatic to customer will resolving there issue. Learned through this company that word choices does make a really big difference in helping a customer. I was starting to Grow strong there i got as far as being floor support for amazing group of agents and would had more opportunity to grow but they are going out of business. If they could of stayed open i would loved to stay here.

good,Je répond aux appels téléphonique.  Je fais le rapport après chaque appel.  Je fais les demandes de points pour les clients.  Je réponds aux courriels.  J'appelle les manufactures pour collecter les informations.  L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste c'est de parler avec les clients mécontents.  L'aspect le plus agréable est de pouvoir socialiser avec les gens un peu de partout.

good,"My first position was as a Customer Service Agent selling maintenance agreements by phone. Constantly striving to exceed expectations, I won several awards including the million dollar sales club for two years in a row. This was a challenging but fun job and I enjoyed doing this for 5 years. After that, I was given an opportunity to work in data entry.  It was in this position I came to think of this as a my career of choice. The only reason I retired was because this department was moved to an office in India, At Sears I had some wonderful managers that allowed me to grow personally and in skill set. I also had some management experiences that were a bit challenging. I learned a great deal about working with all types of people from those experiences. I believe this prepared me for a very successful career at Harris Teeter. I am truly looking forward to this new chapter."
good,Great job to work for. very good people around the warehouse. if i did not move would still be working there. my mangers was very helpful on how to maintain the warehouse.

good,"Es muy respinsable de la Atencion a Clientes!"
good,"I love everything about working at SHC except for the fact that company has not been doing well in past few years.

good,"Sears is a great first time job for the experience but not long term. The management there is fair. I have been working there for almost 2 years and have little complaints. They could work on their communication when dealt with associates. Other than that, its well known environment to be there short term."
good,Job is good and easy but if you're getting food stamps the state will make you get a new job cause you'll only get 10 hours a week. I got bored a lot but when I got a new job at Menards as a cashier by my surprise our Sears store manager begs me to stay and become a cashier there. And honestly I don't know if I want to stay with Sears since it's in the news on tv and online that the company may no longer exist by the end of this year. The coworkers were a pleasure to work with and they were very nice when I couldn't work cause my husband was in the hospital and they always checked on how I'm doing. Yes they only pay you minimum wage and in spring and summer very low hours which makes it impossible to pay bills and save any money. Nice part is they offered to rehire me if I ever wanted back.
good,"Working at an eye doctor you come in contact with many people which is exciting because everyday is not the same. I loved the Manager there, and I learned so many things from my team.

good,"I enjoyed working retail overall. Hated the ""customer is always right"" mindset no matter what the issues were. I didn't like working jewelry just for the sake of being trapped behind a counter all day. It was a step up, however, and I was ecstatic that they promoted me. And it was a high ticket department which showed faith in my ability and loyalty to the company. I wish they had provided more training, however."

good,"A typical day involved cashiering to customers of friendliness and anger, cleaning up around the cash wrap and organizing them to make them look nice. I've learned how to help people do purchases, returns, exchanges and payments as well as answer simple to complex questions. Management always kept us busy with project whenever it was dead, also was very helpful when he cashier amount was steadily low. My co-workers were always friendly and cooperative with my outgoing attitude. The hardest part was handling the angry and frustrated customers when they are really focused on getting something they cannot. The most enjoyable was helping the very friendly and open with conversation type of customers who created small talk with me."
good,Productive days and you stay busy working. Nice area and surrounding for the 2009 location itself. Managers are really nice and understandable and they work with your schedule.

good,"I learned multiple new computer programs as well as a new system of communication between a representative and a customer. The hardest part of the job was the management.I would clock into my computer systems. Phone calls would come in immediately. Due to the amount of employees who have recently walked out or simply stopped showing up the call flow had been back to back. The job itself was relatively easy due to my knowledge prior with electronics and computers.But the Management and the ""Leads"" were of no help most the time or physically not there. Not including the onslaught of complaints almost every single caller had with  the dissatisfaction of our companies customer service or technicians. I enjoyed the customers who didn't have a tainted experience with our company and I really liked the coworkers I did get to work with."

Todos los dias hay que llegar a la junta maturina donde se tratan cuestiones importantes. Tambien hay que revisar las promociones diariamente y limpiar o acomodar principalmente hay que dar muy buen servicio a los clientes ya sea que compren o que vayan a realizar pagos. Aprendi que una tienda departamental tiene dias muy buenos para vender y los dias muertos los puedes aprovechar para arreglar mercancia, limpiar, revisar existencias, etc. El area administrativa es muy acogedora y te atienden correctamente.  El compañerismo depende de como los tratas y seras tratado en general nunca tuve ningun problema con ellos ni con jefes. La parte mas dificil del trabajo los horarios de ventas nocturnas y los inventarios.

I was there at work more than my boss, and often the only photographer to come in on time. I was committed, yet I was still let go. Sure there was someone who had been there for twenty years, but even then I was never late. I shadowed her for my hands-on photography training. My boss was flexible, it just got under my skin how I would be the employee to go above and beyond the call of duty, so to speak.

If you don't work as a team your store is going to be falling apart. Management was perfect, not a complain about it. The culture is if customers are happy we're happy.Hardest part of the job was when I was done fitting the apparel into its shelves and kids come around running and throwing everything on the floor.

good,"I was a Fine Jewelry Commissioned Sales Associate. I worked at Sears for 5 years while I was in Nursing School. The job is very flexible and my coworkers were fun and knowledgeable. The base pay rate was not very high-below minimum wage, but most months the commission would make up for it. During the holidays, the management requires you to put in a lot of hours, but the commissions are great during these times. Learning to sell is a skill and takes some getting used to. But once you learn how the department works, it is a lot of fun. The hardest part was standing for long periods of time. After 5 years, my legs would hurt. You should definitely be physically fit for this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people who had been married for years and didn't have a decent wedding band, pick one out. I met a lot of repeat customers and got to know some very well. You definitely need to be a people person for this job. My manager was very flexible with scheduling when I had a school assignment coming up. I would give my manager my schedule for the next month and she was able to coordinate with the other associates to give everyone the hours they needed."

My co-workers were all very friendly and willing to help me learn the system that was required for the truck yard dispatch and for accurately entering all the truck shipments data. The Sears Warehouse, which has since closed down, was a huge operation and without the detailed and friendly training I received, would have been quite overwhelming for someone like myself, who at that time, had never worked in that kind of environment. Sears Warehouse is one of my fondest memories,not just of a job but as well of the wonderful people I met while working there. The work ethics taught to me during my employment have stayed with me all these years and helped me become a better worker and person."

good,"I worked in Lawn & Garden department which was a wage plus commission position. I had come from a non-retail environment, so this was new to me. It was very cut-throat. Co-workers would ask if you would do them a favor so as to tie you up with something meaningless while they took care of a big sales customer. It was not the best department to be in. When I found that the Shoe department manager was leaving, I applied for and received the position. It was non-commission and everyone got along fine.The work was hard and demanding but rewarding when someone got the shoes they were looking for. I was sad when I had to make a choice between Sears and Stop & Shop because of Social Security limits."
good,Working there was truly a joy. From management up to the job itself there wasn't really anything that I didn't like about this job or this company except the wage. Due to the fact that they were going into bankruptcy at the time they cut the pay for all sales associates. That being said it is all commission based and provides a great challenge for young sales professionals who are looking to get some experience while maintaining a solid resume.

My co-workers are very reliable and great to work with. They're fun to work with and all put in the same effort to get our necessary tasks done each day. The hardest part of the job is that at some points we run into moments when we get real busy and we may not have enough time or hands to get certain jobs done but we do what we can. I truly enjoy the different personalities in the store as they as they all help bring that easy going and fun spirit to the store that brings us there each day.

Other times it was a ton of people to the point where my co-workers and I had to call in our supervisor. I learned about teamwork and listening skills, The workplace culture was different from anything I was used to. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the different types of customers, Some were very rude while some were complete angels. The most enjoyable of the job was the overall atmosphere of the place. I felt welcomed to the team as soon as I first started"

good,"I worked at Sears nearly 14 hours ago.  I would probably have been still there if I hadn't need a better paying job.  I was switched from a full commission to base rate and a lower commission under the claim I wasn't making enough in sales.  But my records proved otherwise.  After working 15 years with them, I was basically back to working at minimum wage.  I felt the company had made unwise decision in merging with Kmart,  I left to work in a different field."

I worked at two different locations and was given the opportunity to be the coordinator for the store remodel because of my work during another remodel.

good,"Buen ambiente laboral, posibilidades de ascenso, supervisor siempre disponible"

I loved doing what I did for Sears and would love to continue but the pay is very low and they don't give out raises, even for a 4.5 star rating out of 5! All my job reviews were 4 or higher and still no raise. I stayed because I literally love what I do, but its time to move on."
good,"our team in appliances and mattresses  was great ,everybody understood a team effort . what i learned from the sears team was a respect for all team members , to help or cover an associates position anywhere in the store . our management team was always in sync with our progress for the day and ready to assist in closing all sales . the hardest part of our jobs was a delivery or failure by an associate in completing their task . we all became very adept at customer service and promoting the sears brand . of course the best part of any team members day was a winning outcome of a delivery , helping our customers with any concerns , questions , or sales ."
good,I was hired by one of my three favorite managers in my career. Friendly staff and co-workers who avoid gossip and game-playing. Family-like atmosphere that made working there pleasant. Excellent benefits despite the lower pay of retail everywhere. Would recommend working there.

good,"Typically we opened boxes, store clothes away, cleaned our warehouse and handle customer orders through pickup or delivery. Weekly we unload trucks, send our repair order and repeat our daily tasks. This is a job I have joined with experience from previous life work, but what was new for me was the opportunity to train someone else. Unfortunately I was not there long enough to see how my trainee turned out to be. When I joined, there were doing management change. From what I know, the old and new management team were all awesome people. Nothing bad to say, unfortunate to lose good people; That's for sure. The new manager was strictly ""Lets get it done today"" and I loved that of her. The hardest part about this job was the physical stress my body received. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers. Having them leave the store with a smile because of something I did, or said was most enjoyable for me."

Another thing I loved was that you grew bonds with certain customers, and they would come back asking about you."
good,Although I only worked at Sears temporarily I do know it was a nice place to work. A bit stressful at times considering you have to pitch credit cards to every customer and you are told everyday about how important it is so much so that your job relies on it.

good,"I had the pleasure of working along side Sears finest employees."
good,"This job was challenging because of customers, but it was fast paced and very exciting, no day was the same and there was always something new happening.

good,"The company is stuck in the past when it comes to Sales, the idea that you can get more sales by engaging your customers outside of the company's campus is frustrating to anyone not on the sales floor selling, and numbers show it."
good,"At the start and end of everydays shift I would count my drawer and log it down. I had to be sure i had enough change and coins. The amount in our registers would depend on our store events and holiday season.Then I would make my way to our morning company meetings. The meetings would be about our store numbers, events, and sales/ associate contests going on in the store. I had learned how to advertise and inform customers about signing up with a sears credit card application. If the customer is qualified then the will get $10.00 - $15.00 off their qualifying purchase that day. Running the application does affect your credit score,but only a pin cushion. Also if you get the pin cushion to your credit and your discount when the card comes in the mail, it is not active. Alot of customers would be ok with a pin cushion to their credit but the intrest is abit higher than credit card companies so i'd inform them that they may chop it up. Although taking the pin cushion to see if one can qualify for the discount and card but if your denied, you get %15 off your purchase if its not marked down or if you got bad credit you can build it up if u get approved for leasing . Pushing credit apps. was one of the hardest parts of retail but the more people i offered it to the more of a chance i had of processing and application. Management had asked that every $500.00 a cashier rang up had to have processed 1app. I would pitch the offer and leave it in there hands as well as be sure disclosures were signed if so. I won a few associate credit application contests.I had maintained the cash wrap"
good,"Excelente compañía un poco laborioso debido a que tenemos que competir por las ventas, lo más difícil es a veces llevar una buena relación con los compañeros debido a la presión de conseguir suficientes ventas por las metas tan altas que nos ponen y lo que más me gusto fue tener la capacidad de aún cuando soy nueva tengo más suerte en las ventas, excelentes amigas y compañeras y las comisiones que tenia y lo que no me gustaba es que estaba obligada a usar tacones durante todo el día. Algunos gerentes son groseros y muchas veces recursos humanos esta de acuerdo con lo que hacen aunque no esté bien como correr injustificadamente a la gente o si hay una discusión entre compañeras no lo solucionan simplemente son de decir que quién está preocupado por arreglar el problema y se acerca a hablar con los supervisores que son los que buscan los problemas."
good,Some managers are very bipolar and want to run things when they are only 1 step above you. its a good place to work easy money just make sure you do things perfectly
good,The job I had initially applied for was not what I had expected. I had applied to be an office assistant but than was placed in customer service. Was not the responsibilities I had hoped for.
good,"It was a very productive and cooperative work and I enjoy doing it. The work promoted team work. I learned new things about technology, cashier, and much more. This was a work that I had to assist the costumers, accommodate merchandise in the respective areas, keep a well functioning about my work, I had to do multi task, my co-workers were very nice, kind, helping each other. The most enjoyable parts of my work were the use of technology and interact with costumers. I like to help others. In summary, I loved my work and I like to work in an active environment."
good,"Throughout my years as a Customer Service Representative at Sears I have gained a lot of interpersonal skills and a clear knowledge on customer care. Sears has given me the opportunity to build positive relationships with my co-workers and the management team. Overall, It has been a rewarding experience in which I take much pride in. I hope to enhance my extensive skills and be a great asset to my future employers."

Since they were so busy selling fixtures, I basically took over, not only fine jewelry but also soft- lines as well. The hardest part of the job was keeping the young workers working. There is always something to do. That doesn't include cell phones and gossiping. My proudest moment was the main goal at the end was to sell ALL the jewelry to customers instead of to the guy who was getting everything for next to nothing. I sold Everthing!

My Manager was so proud of me!  "
good,Open and close store; balance registers at the end of the day; daily reports. I learned about the difference and values of different manufacturers of appliances.

If it weren't for that, I would still be working for Sears."

good,I uset to work for Sears selling large appliances in Brand Central. It was a great gig and I really enjoyed it a lot.

good,This is where it all stated. Took on many responsibilities regarding customers and explanations of procedures and pricing.  Would of loved to stay there
good,"Sears is definitely a challenging job. Store is located in the Mall making it busy everyday most of the day. First thing bring all items from back stock into the floor, check fitting rooms every hour, make sure cashgraps are nice and clean with all clothing put away to its right place. Co workers are helpful making great team work. management is good but not great still a few areas they should work with.  The hardest part of my job is making sure the store is spotless and all is done before closing time. I enjoy working because its a fast paste job , hours fly by quickly and there is always something to do. Lets not forget the many people I get to interact with in one day!"
good,Sales floor is not my favorite type of job.  I would have much rather worked with the customers or at a job much like mine today.  I do not know what about the warehouse/ product replacement I was not crazy for but not my cup of tea.  I did enjoy the people I worked with.  Maybe I was just lonesome working?  I worked alone everyday and just scanned codes of products that were out of stock and researched why they were out of stock.
good,"A lot of times, we were short staffed and were asked to work extra to hours and perform extra tasks, in order to have a good standing in presentation."
good,"We greet every customer as soon as they walk in and provide knowledge and assistance to the best of our abilities. Product knowledge is a must and thanks to monthly training I make sure my team and I are well-versed in all appliances in order to maximize our sales. In addition, Sears Outlet is all about customer satisfaction so when problems arise, I’m there to rectify situations so customers feel confident about shopping at our establishment again."

good,I enjoy working at Sears because it's professional. They have learning tools employees can access. They don't try to make you work off the clock. They are reasonable with their lunch breaks and also generous with their 15 mins breaks as well. There isn't anything I love more than working for Sears Holdings Center.

good,Typical day consisted of gathering parts when they came in . We had to make sure we had all the parts in the correct area and placing those in the correct are so we knew where they were located.
good,"I learned much about the Health and Safety , some of management skills and Market strategies by working in Sears. The Management is truly supportive so as the co-workers."
good,"My typical day at work was very straight forward I learned everything fast, the types of things that was taught to me was taking the merchandise off the trucks and putting them back on as well as removing the seals off trucks and writing them down. I was promoted to management also being a trainer to the new employees.My co-workers were very friendly and made me feel happy and comfortable to come to work everyday but the hardest thing about my job was lifting the refrigerator off the carts and placing them on the doc.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the boss out with jotting things down also with the washers."
good,Enjoyed what I did.  Gave me the opportunity to do several different jobs within the building but was sad to see them let the office of 75 go to have others do what we did.

The management was great I got along with each of them they gave great constructive criticism, My coworkers there were awesome we always worked as a team to get things done. The hardest part of the job was having to reset the store when we had price changes. The most enjoyable part of sears outlet was working as a team I learned so many things from placing orders sales skills people skills and networking"
good,"My responsibility in the Sears Sales/Use Tax Department was to represent Sears in State & Local jurisdiction audits.  I furnished requested documentation and provided defense for Sears filings and audit findings.  Performed tax research for state sales/use tax filings and updated tax rate schedules.  Provided legal research in defense of audit findings detrimental to Sears.  Consulted directly with Sears Sales Tax Manager on audit progress, findings, and defense against hostile findings."

The best part of work is serving customers, to greet them, to welcome to the store, to tell them about new sales and promotions, to understand their needs, to learn about reason they came to the store, to help them to choose right product using the product knowledge and personal taste. It is privilage for me to work with such a nice team and learn from them."

good,"Sears has been and continues to be a very good job.  I have enjoyed my experience working at Sears.  However, I need more hours and higher pay."
good,Typically as a cashier I would open and close the registers (making sure the set amount of money was correct). Sears has a credit card that they heavily push on their employees to push on their customers. For every credit app we completed we got a bonus on our paycheck. It was something I really enjoyed. The majority of my coworkers were wonderful and very helpful and kind. There were some who didn't pull their weight which I would have to pick up their slack since I was in charge of them. Minor supervision experience (supervised the other cashiers). The hardest part of the job was getting the sales floor employees to respond to the cashier requests for backup cashiers or for help on finding a price. I enjoyed pretty much everything about Sears. Management was very supportive and open to any and all suggestions to make our workplace and the company in itself a better place.
good,Great job to work for and plenty room to grow if that's the field you would like to get in too. they do 1099 so its great if you want to be your own boss.

good,Trabajar en sears es un trabajo donde interactuas mucho con las personas y aprenedes a tener trato con diferentes tipos de gente
good,Co workers are very helpful work as a team. The hardest part of the job is stressing when no one is there to help you with a task you have never done before and you are expected to do it first time on your own. This causes stress and anxiety making me want to do my job correctly without having to screw up. The most rewarding part of my job is when i get a task completed and a customer is happy with what I have done and appreciate my customer service.
good,"Very fast paced work environment which customers come in to pick up large, high value items, which we securely deliver out to them and assist with loading into their vehicle. We always audit our back stock items to ensure that the ""On-Hand"" counts are accurate. We also retrieve items from online orders which we receive through our system. We then create shipments for the customers' online orders and have shipped out to them by the next day. We also securely receive incoming shipments to our store by utilizing a security procedure.

Working there I learned a lot about customer service and people in general, and how to help them find all the products they came in for, whether they were in the store itself, or online with the ""store-to-home"" program. I did truck work, stocking shoes on the floor, inventory reports, special presentations of products, online ordering, and much more. Every single part of the job was thoroughly enjoyable for me. Hated to see the store shut down."
good,"Managed various numbers of associates in accounting, payables, audits, program development and financials."

good,me gustaba ver el creimiento de cada dia en ventas fijando mas actitudes positivas de todos los vendedores
good,"Having a basic understanding that managers have guidelines to run a store will let you thrive in the store.  While everyone else is worried about credit, you should know it is your role to ask for credit and not to worry about peoples responses or the morality of it because if the customer is smart he will see a positive in credit.  Talk couture with people!  Co-workers are the nicest.  The people that work at sears are the ones who actually care about customer satisfaction.  These people are nice all day long.  When they are upset they are still nice."

good,I would call customers each day and inform them it is time to renew their maintenance agreements on their products and inform them of how it would benefit them and save costly repairs. I learned how to communicate with people in a caring way. The hardest part was when people hung up on me.

I love working for Sears, I love the people, I love the work, and I love the customers. I learned so much from the 2 years in fast food, and the 3 years in retail. I got comfortable with the PO system very quick, I learned how to use hand held devices that hold inventory and keep a track of the Weekly Ad change, how to make schedules and go by LRQ's, make weekly goals such as credit card applications, store to homes, base to bonus, member feedbacks, and many more. My favorite thing about the job is working with the public, and making sure every one of my customers walks out of the door completely satisfied. I will bend over backwards for any of my customers, because they are what keeps the store in business! You always have to keep them coming back. Working at Sears, you get mostly repeat customers, because they love the customer service they get and that is what customer service is to me. Management is something I highly enjoy, because I enjoy having the responsibility and the trust of my co-workers and associates to be in charge of something. Management to me is someone who knows how to keep things going, knows how to keep the store together, very respectful and knowledgeable of their work and associates, and someone you can trust with anything. How else are you supposed to work for someone you do not trust or respect?"

The hardest part of the Job was when there were difficult costumers we couldn't satisfy. The most enjoyable part was coming into work and being greeted by my co-workers, having a motivated and hardworking supervisor who was fair with scheduling and made sure we all got our breaks and lunches on time, defended us when we needed help and was there to assist us when we were shorthanded and busy.

good,"Everyday I learn new things and I really enjoy it. I go into starting my day greeting my co-workers and customers. Then I do what has to be done for the day, but before I go out to my department and offer any help to customers near me. In my department we are a team. We see each other as equal, we divide the work and get it done. If we do not understand the work or is struggling, we help each other. We manage to have a very presentable and clean area. They're is days that are challenging, but I mange to accomplish or learn. One example, during Black Friday or big clearance/sales is quite challenging because of excess of merchandise we have and the all the customers trying to get some get themselves some of the merchandise. So we have to try our best to maintain the department organize and clean, but at the same time assisting customers as well. I really enjoy interacting with people and getting to know them as who they are not just as a customer. I try to create a bond with them to get them comfortable and earn any connection because by accomplishing it, makes it easier and more relaxing for them and as well for me.
