bad,"The head of my department was literally crazy.  From the moment I started people were warning me but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.  No luck  she secretly had legal complaints on her from previous employees.  Some of the workers there were amazing, the others were overtly racist.  This company is doomed."
bad,"I realize it is a tobacco company, but I wish I was aware of this before they hired me. Smoking is allowed pretty much everywhere in the building."
bad,"Decent Vacation"
bad,"High stress position with cigarette company, although very successful and rewarded, outside and inside pressure is tough."
bad,"Ever wonder what goes on behind those gates you see off Interstate 95? What use to be the premier production job is now a plantation simply moved in doors. We're under seige, new management has taken over with the mindset of doing WAY more with WAY less!!! A subjective set of rules for associates, enforced at the will of the powers that be, only used to get rid of tenured associates and/or ""troubled"" associates. What is good for one should be good for all, but it all depends on whose set of eyes are being used at the time. I 100% agree that trimming the fat is always in the best interest of the company and ultimately for the associates. However, when what was 1 job less than 7 years ago and not results driven, paid more and had less demands (physically and mentally) now encompasses 3 times as much, pays less, purely results driven and physically and mentally exhausting - you have to wonder what rights are being violated to make this possible. This is a unionized environment but you would never know as jobs are created and modified at will, with out any intervention from Union ""officials"". When you question changes your labled as a ""trouble maker"" and ostracized. You feel your opinion, background, senority and quality of work you produce would hold some type of merit when it comes to decisions that effect the job you perform, but it only equals to fuel for the fire when it comes time to pick a new bullseye. As an associate your asked to embrace change, but when it comes in the form of being pushed beyond your physical and mental limits, risking your well being and sacraficing"
bad,Not for a seasoned professional.  New college graduates that want to progress in the tobacco industry should consider working for Altria.
bad,"Je suis déçue du management, manque de compétence et rien ne change."
bad,"Not a place for a family man or woman. Focus is placed on the bad and never forgot. The positive receives no praise and is never remembered,"
bad,"Altria is a job with little advancement opportunities, but offers decent pay for the work required.  Most days you are in control of what you do and where you go."
bad,"Altria claims to champion diversity and inclusion, but in practice doesn’t actually value team members who are different. It’s a competitive environment more than a collaborative one. Be expected to have to talk over and interrupt people to make your point, and that upper management/VPs will be consistently rude and will belittle you if they disagree with what you’ve said. They claim to aspire to be the leaders in harm reduction, but stop work on harm reduced products at the drop of a hat. I would not recommend this as a workplace."
bad,Management trained poorly and attempt to intimidate employees and stand over them rather than manage the process and work towards finding innovative ways to make processes run more efficiently.  There is absolutely NO room for advancement!!!!  If you earn a degree you will not be able to use it as an hourly employee.  The company hires interns and does not promote from within.  Hourly employees do not have opportunities for growth and education is no longer being paid for hourly employees.
bad,Fortunately the to find out American express my gratitude for the best ways to you love you love it and the lives of the people who are not going anywhere in the lives and
bad,People were either great or terrible. Annoying work environment if you were paired with the terrible.
bad,The company portrays themselves as high on values however I was hired and laid off a year later as part of a company restructuring of its salaried workforce. Where is the forcasting and planning? CEO gets 10 million bonus and we get laid off.........!
bad,Process invoices on an Online Document Center and update vendors and staff about invoice discrepancies.
bad,"work life balance was good and benefits are great, people are great to work with as well"
bad,Racism racism racism racism management. No room for growth. Forced to work 12-16 hours. Only good pay weekly. Machines dont work properly. Run more equipment with no more pay
bad,"Higher Level Managers look out for themselves and not  their team."
bad,boring job but good pay and benefits nice people but lazy so if you are a good worker you will be asked to do alt because majority of workers work hard at getting out of work so supervisorswill get you to do it
bad,"Very corporate atmosphere.Not the same company that I was hired into. Be there for the money, while preparing yourself to do something else. It's not personal, just business."
bad,PMUSA was a man's world loaded with harassment issues and lack of advancement for females. They paid their account managers poorly and expected the world. When there were promotions available they offered it to the men even in lower level positions because they disrespected women.
bad,"Great company regarding benefits and compensation however unfortunately there is no opportunity for advancement and to utilize your skill-set.   Also, the company has poor management, continually recycling the same ideas and concepts, not receptive to change and innovation."
bad,"They""say""they don't tolerate harassment. My manager and supervisor both harassed me. Outright ignored Illinois labor laws and then wrote me up when I stood up to them. The very next day after refusing to work 7th day I was written up."
bad,driving from store to store in territory; management not supportive; coworkers will assist. hardest part of job is no work/life balance
bad,"This company is all about who you are in good with and is an extremely conservative company.  They are very involved in helping the community, which I liked.  But the culture is very strange and not like anywhere I have been before."
bad,Do not believe anything they tell you it is bull they will work you to death and kick you to the curb in the end of it all don’t trust them you have no vale to them at all.
bad,"Local de desafios constantes, de aprendizado contínuo, pessoas pouco preparadas para gestão de pessoas."
bad,"Altria is a company that rewards the show that you put on while doing a job more than the actual end product of the job. If made a big fuss, made it look like there were huge obstacles in your way and just barely met your deadline, then you did a great job. If you took a project, planned for contingencies, built in extra time in case there were issues and delivered a quality product ahead of schedule, you were just doing your job. The people who put on the show were the ones who got ahead, whereas the people who did their jobs well and efficiently, got left behind."
bad,"Company consistently goes through restructures, realignments, and redeployments.  A scary time for this company.  Good training and a good place to start but not to stay"
bad,"Somewhat progressive culture, struggling with women and diversity in leadership roles, as in any company has good bosses and not good bosses.  Limited career advancement, advancement is somewhat old-school network based."
bad,"	Actively formulates company policies and procedures to apply on outlets"
bad,"This company is officially run by lawyers, CEO and COO. Thus, this company is always saying the right things just to cover itself legally. For example, they say they encourage creativity, different personalities and viewpoints, and employee development, however, this is most certainly not the case. They tell everyone that they can be promoted, but the truth is if you are not recruited from one of their universities that offers internship program you don't stand a chance. Also, they are on diversity push right now; if you are a a minority or a female you will automatically be considered as promotion material."
bad,No real hope for advancement within the company. The people are friendly enough but doesn't not counter-balance the cons.
bad,"Great training and compensation. How much you love your role depends on your manager, as with any job."
bad,Good pay and benefits. Demanding work but good work life balance. management is very young and is sometimes out of touch with training and developing good talent. You have to continually relocate to get promoted.All in all the job is good for a time period.
bad,"Altria is a great place to learn category and account management principles. However, because of the significant decrease in cigarette volume, promotion opportunities are few and far in-between."
bad,"You spend everyday driving to about 5-10 stores in a given area. You have to prepare either in your car, at the stores, or at a coffee shop because there is no office you report to. The best part is the benefits."
good,There was a time when Altria cared about their employees and there was a time when I would defend the decisions of senior leadership but that boat has sailed. This is a great place to launch a career but don't stay as long as I did. You will receive some great training but as soon as you get to the next level (Unit Manager) stay there for 2-3 years and start looking for a new job. You will make more money and there is something better than Altria even if they make you think there isn't.
good,Ok to work for. I was there until I was laid off. They did right by us at the end. No job security in the tobacco industry. The best thimmg to do is to work for yourself.
good,From the call center to corporate there was very little communication and understanding. I was under the impression this was a money hungry company that truly did not care about the rapport they build with consumes about the products and services. as  an call center agent I felt very little support was given.
good,Working for PML means letting customers down A LOT. You will become a puppet and lie to business owners for your short term gains. company too reactive than proactive
good,"Altria offers excellent training and above-average compensation. The pay and benefits are considerably better than many of their peer companies. Also, if you are willing to physically move to different cities where they need you, you can advance quickly and frequently in the company. However, this comes at the cost of job security and the fact that you are selling harmful products. Altria is a tobacco company that generates the vast majority of its revenue from cigarette sales, which continue to decline significantly year-over-year requiring regular widespread layoffs and headcount reductions in order to maintain profitability. This in turn of course negatively impacts morale and culture"
good,"At first, PM allowed people to smoke at their work desk, but during the time on the project, this was discontinued. Hooray! "
good,"The IT culture at Altria is very stagnant. In order to move forward you must not rely on technical skills and turn towards supplier management or business side positions. There are too many cultural road blocks that do not allow for advancement and job satisfaction. The job security is here, which is why there is limited advancement opportunities."
good,"- Financial P&L Responsibilities "
good,"A typical day at work is never typical; there is always a different problem to solve.  I learned everything from how to manage people and lead an organization to how to build a long-term strategy for success.  Most of the people I worked with at Altria are outstanding; I can only hope to find another group with so much talent.  That said, the hardest part of the job was dealing with the people that were in a position they were not capable of managing."
good,"Had a nice feeling when we reached our quota."
good,"The company changed drastically from a bipartisan, moderate government affairs office to a hard core conservative lobbying firm and management changed accordingly."
good,As an employer Altria was one of the top companies in development and agressive marketing. Its employees had a great deal of personal leeway as to how to get jobs accomplished and therefore could come to any problem with as much creativity as they could muster.
good,They are in the middle of transforming their culture. Lots of variety in the Admin Assistant role. Not a lot of development opportunities for admins. You have to seek out your own opportunities across the corporation.
good,Leadership is trying to navigate through the evolving tobacco landscape.  This is creating the need for a large reorganization due to acquisition of stake in Juul.
good,"I have had 6 bosses in my 3 full time years with the company.  Executives are very protected, information only flows up the chain, 3 of my 6 bosses had really no clue what I did.  Don't feel that performance assessments are fair and objective.  Boss has lied to my face on more than one occasion."
good,High paced great benefits. Management is young and inexperienced. Pay is great. The balance of family and work is all the way to work. They can force you at their descretion
good,"Trabalho desenvolvido em torno de 12 horas por dia sem ganhar hora extra, e se almoçar não da tempo de fazer a rota toda, extressante,"
good,unload & load toabacco leaves into the machine . transport to another when done . people friendly . commuication is the key.
good,"If you like work -life balance this is a good company for you. If you are minority that wants to grow in different roles throughout the company its probably not the best for you. Altria does its best to cover up not being a total 'good ole boy"" company. Once you see the executives currently working with the company you see the truth. Start your career here, further your education but its not a good long term place for a minority."
good,Solid Training Program.  The company has a wonderful recruiting program.  The company offers great benefits.  The company provides its employees with tools needed to succeed.
good,Extremely stressful environment with high pressure to achieve sometimes unachievable results.  Was not always like this.  Compensation and benefits were amazing.
good,"Hard to work from the car all day, no real social interactions other then with clients. A lot of valuable experience understanding the market and market drivers. Very flexible schedule but work can take over personal life."
good,"Overall Altria (Phillip Morris) has a god reputation in the Richmond area. They compensate well and have a good benefit package for employees. As a contractor, it is much different. No benefits or sick time is provided and they do not extend contracts or offer contract to hire."
good,"Unionized workforce, where seniority is key to advancement.  Management is not consistent on the production floor and varies when enforcing policy by areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers. The least enjoyable part of the job is although they preach about compliance and integrity, the minute you go to management with an issue expect retaliation."
good,"Great benefits, good salary but way too much management and levels of approval for everything. Very bureaucratic and conservative."
good,"If you love dealing with politics, poor work/life balance, managing teams of contractors, and want to be a manager/project manager, then this place is for you."
good,"As a large company, they had many standards that were easy to follow on a daily basis and learned the principles of how to work as a team in a maintenance and union surroundings.Toughest part of the job was to overcome the strict etiquette of approaching each level of management."
good,"This was my first job out of college. It was a great learning experience. I learned quite a bit in terms of selling, contract negotiation and customer service. Philip Morris does invest quite a bit of time and money in properly training its employees. My growing disapproval with the company's overall product and beliefs as well as the opportunity to own my own business prompted me to leave."
good,Worked for Altria for 29 years. Company had cut backs. Unable tp list details due to agreement sign with company.
good,"Pay, retirement, work/life, and benefits are amazing, however this calculated overcompensation is only to help you look pass the moral issue, the impending downsizing, lack of upward mobility, and untrustworthy senior managers--very few people in the manufacturing segment of the organization trust anyone over a manager. "
good,Very easy going job but you will need to be able to tolerate weird looks for being a cigarette rep. You can really learn a lot about market dynamics and sales techniques.
good,N/A little training;.  No interaction with other PMs.  Invent it as you go ... Not sure how o proceed there ... did the best I could as most PMS are contractors that come and go.
good,The culture is in transition and there is very little room for bringing your authentic self to the workplace. I was fired after 5 months after being promised an investment in my professional development.
good,"Great Benefits, but the Company is antiquated, lack of mobility,  limited product category, for most disciplines Company is not respected, declining industry."
good,"has means and resources to complete required work. Provides workers with the ability to meet goals. Very corporate in structure and lots of processes,"
good,"As it was my first project, i was a bit tensed in the starting but the people over there helped me a lot in the beginning later i felt very comfortable, all the employees are very friendly."
good,If you like a fast paced manufacturing environment you will like this. The worst part is not being able to plan life in advance because anything can happen in production.
good,It was very interesting to learn the process of working with an executive Search firm and how they go about filling certain positions.
good,The company has a good outlook for the future but because of restructuring there has been a change in career development opportunities. The role as a Territory Sales Manager is isolate from your co-workers and the interaction with other Altria employees is minimal each month. Being able to set your hours and when you want to call on each account allows for a lot of flexibility.
good,"The work is challenging and the people are smart.  Efforts to increase diversity, inclusion and innovation are gaining traction. However, the culture is very risk-averse so you must bring your A-game and be prepared to deliver results."
good,"I was hired with 3 other part-time relief nurses and we were let go 6 months later. Grant it, there was no guarantee but the way it was done was not nice. The company went through a $400 million lay off so it affected a lot of the company. the facility is nice at Phillip Morris and the co-workers are nice but tend to get into everyone's business. Being part-time, I did not get benefits but I know they are great."
good,Phillip Morris USA has a great internship program and lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Empresa agradável, equipe motivada. Processos de vendas ainda em desenvolvimento, mas os processos de RH muito bem definidos."
good,Flexible time is great.
good,"Opportunity to work with many trades, and contractors to defend the requirements of the project and insure that the customer was satisfied with the effort by Kellogg."
good,It is a very good company to work for they take good care of their employees. I enjoyed my time with the company and the time I spent there it shaped some of my work characteristics.
good,Large company experiencing declining revenues in their legacy business. Difficult to compare to other similar-sized organizations due to its unique position as a cigarette manufacturer. Struggling to modernize and innovate although employee base is motivated to change.
good,"Culture of Company was constantly changing.  With each new Section Director, the vision of section would change."
good,The training for a recent graduate is above average. You get to learn the corporate structure of a successful fortune 500 company and travel for additional training seminars as well. Management is pretty top heavy but minimal micromanagement. You are responsible for a specific territory and are limited via metrics because of the demographic in said area.
good,There is no long term strategy and employees are not rewarded for thinking differently. Promotions are based on nepotism and the company yells at you if you call them out on specific examples.
good,"Unfortunately US Smokeless Company has closed it's doors to the Franklin Park, IL plant and production was diverted to other facilities within the company.  However, it had great employees and good benefits."
good,"The compensation/benefits are great, and the work is challenging and educational. However, there are many managers who are not focused on their employees' development, and there are not very many opportunities for promotions. The dress code is casual (jeans are allowed every day) and telecommuting is allowed, but management does not seem very willing to promote these progressive concepts."
good,Has some very good people that work at the organization. Work life balance is great. Tough to get promoted because of limited opportunity.
good,It is a good place to work. The work culture is very laid back. People are not flexible to change. Focus is needed on Technology advancement.
good,"With many avenues of business, there is something for everyone at Altria Client services."
good,"While Philip Morris has the financial backing to afford to look after their employees, the job itself has become threatening to its employees and procedure and protocol does is not in place to protect the employees."
good,"Many opportunities to get an array of experience. Never boring. Always a different challenge every day. "
good,"muitas metas a serem batidas, muitos KSI`s a serem cumpridos devido a area competitiva do tabaco. Gerencia com bons conhecimentos mas um pouco rude."
good,Management did not look at their employees for advancement. They looked down on good senior employees. they would pat you on the back for a job done well. Then talk bad about you behind your back.
good,"Work can be boring and repetitive. Great pay and benefits. Fair work life balance. You don't really see the ""fruits of your labor"" and can be unsatisfying."
good,"In sales, management is great!  When you get to corporate, management is very top down.  I learned a lot working here and have been able to take that to my future positions."
good,"Great pay and benefits. Awesome co-workers. Middle level managers have way too much power and can make or break you. If you have a good Unit Manager, this job is a dream, if you have a bad one, it can be the most negative place on earth."
good,"Altria is the premiere company to work for in Richmond, VA - primarily for the excellent pay and benefit packages it provides.  The downside can be the ""culture"" of the company is steeped in those who have been with the company for a very long time and have an ""old school"" view on work ethics (e.g. you must be in your seat, at your desk, in order to be productive). The idea of working from home or flexible work schedules wasn't available when I worked for Altria."
good,"Chaqu'un sait ce qu'il y'a à faire,les opportunités de développement sont larges mais la marge pour progresser en grade est trés serrée. Le management se conforme tant bien que mal à ce qu'on lui demande c'est à dire au respect, à l'encadrement ,à la communication,à l'écoute et à tout ce que les""policies"" recommandent. Mes collaborateurs sont dans l'ensemble impécables et en majorité jeunes ,j'ai ??? ans mais on est comme des cousins,on chahute et on se respecte beaucoup.L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste :je ne peux me prononcer sur ce point. L'aspect le plus agréable est le fait que je suis responsabilisé,parfois j'ai l'impression d'être le seul qui tiens l'usine entre mes mains."
good,A good place to work if you can handle working in the tobacco industry
good,Excellent company that needs to improve the working and personal life balance.
good,"I did this job for almost 6 years.  Altria is a great company to be employed by...the position included a company vehicle, gas card, great pay & benefits.  Excellent 401K profit sharing incentives.  My sales geography was always large, and required over 55,000 miles of driving annually.  It's a good job.  Calling on convenience stores, selling tobacco, and merchandising the tobacco platforms."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers. Our department is very close knit. There is also good work-life balance. Management works to advance high potentials.
good,"Altria is an amazing company to work for. People are all so nice and friendly and they treat interns as if they were full-time employees too. Plus they have the best benefits ever,"
good,"A lot of pressure put on machine operator, pay was great, medical has gone down hill, but the cost has risen.Not a whole lot of team work, really needed management to promote more of it."
good,"good job,good training, good company , confused management ."
good,Best advice here is to adapt and adjust accordingly. This job is much of what you make it. Long hours on your feet in steel toes. Can be diverse and inclusive if you find a way to get involved.
good,"Depends on what department you are working. Overall great company. Some directors are better than others. Some people excel in a stressful highly challenging environment. Some are recognized for great work, while others aren't."
good,Advancement is very difficult especially with requirements to move. The tobacco business is very volatile right now and with the recent restructuring and 3 total in the past 7 years it is hard to not envision more restructuring in the future.
good,Altria is a good company to work for. The company has a bright future but sometimes the restructuring that takes place can totally take you by surprise.
good,The best part in working here is that you get to see all the dynamics of the leading cigarette manufacturer in the world. There are so many different aspects and things to be involved in.
good,"I enjoyed my time working with GMR, the agency who represents Altria. It's never easy promoting a product that is viewed as socially unacceptable, but they did a great job training and developing the field staff."
good,"Starting a career with Altria is very demanding. It teaches you time management, builds sales experience and allows you to take control of personal growth. This job requires a lot of responsibility and hard work. Great starting salary with a lot of benefits and perks. I would recommend this job as a great position to start a career in sales."
good,As a territory sales manager no two days are ever the same.  You work with store owners and managers to help build their business while building the company's business.  You are you're own boss of you're territory and have the autonomy to make decision on how to build the business.
good,"excellent view of corporate world"
good,I have learned a lot about how to operate and maintain multiple large chillers up to 5300 tons. Maintaining the fire suppression system and large air compressors was a challenge too. The employees are great to work with and are very helpful. I have made a lot of friends here. 
good,"Serviços relativamente fácil, onde se aprende a instalar as peças de merchandising, em em lugar de convivência pacifica tanto com colegas e chefia, onde a parte mais difícil é erguer as peças pesadas e a parte mais agradável e que você conhece varias cidades do Rio Grande do Sul. "
good,"Operate machinery, perform quality checks. Kept materials loaded on machine. Would troubleshoot machine when problems occurred. Able to perform minor repairs and corrections. Knowing when to call maintenance or electricians for major repairs. Worked close with packer operators for any issues that might come up. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if I was working 8 hrs. or 12 hrs. each night. I enjoyed the challenges that would come up in trouble shooting quality issues."
good,Worked within the Midwest Region. Traveled to various states to work with District and Regional management to resolve employee issues and concerns.
good,-Retrieve punches and scans and process daily punches.
good,"The company has a leadership model they strive to see their leaders, managers and higher positions follow.  Very excellent program but not followed by all."
good,"Good pay, long hours and can be drafted for overtime without notice. resistance to change is common. Overall a good place to work. Employees are very helpful to new hires."
good,"If you are seeking a strong challenge where you will have the autonomy to work on prioritized initiatives and assigned objects how you want, when you want, and where you want... this is the place for you."
good,"This is the only job that I have had that paid overtime to management. Based on the hours spent there, I thought that was the best thing. This was also a great way to work with an union environment."
good,"Great training and I have made life long friends there!  It is what you make it. "
good,"Great job for a learning experience. The down side is you dealing with tobacco which is hard on your personal life. People will judge you for working here. Up side, you make your own hours and get paid more then you should. Management is 50/50."
good,"Great starting pay and benefits package, one of the best retirement matching programs I have ever seen.  Outside sales with virtually total autonomy.  Excellent work satisfaction."
good,This is an impressive company striving to produce solid legislative and regulatory changes in Richmond as well as Washington for consumer products.
good,You own your own business. The company culture is very team oriented and friendly. Not the best for advancement. Great place to start a career and gain selling skills.
good,"A great co. to work for !!! Management  on a short leash, no flexibility with operations in different manufacturing dept. !!! short lunch breaks 30 minutes ."
good,Great company to start your career. The company is moderately innovative and promotes a team culture. Benefits are outstanding. I have had an overall positive experience with Altria.
good,"The training and development you get at Altria is second to non. "
good,"Nice work environnement,lot of benefits and good salary.Professional managers."
good,"Typical week consists of about 45-60 hours of work, both in office and visiting accounts.  Very autonomous job that allows for flexibility of the work day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping business owners with their own personal goals and achieving them.  The hardest part is the advancement process and the stress that can stretch into your after work hours."
good,"Great compensation and great benefits. The company generally provides the best tools available for its employees. Almost anything that can be outsource is already outsourced.  "
good,"Essendo una persona molto attiva ed energica ho la necessità di stare sempre in movimento possibilmente all'aria aperta ed a contatto con le persone e questo l'ho trovato in PM."
good,clean warehouse load trailers using electric hand jack hand wrap pallets
good,This was a great company. I wish I would have never left this position. The values were straightforward and you could advance in this company with dedication.
good,"I was extremely happy at this company and would have stayed until retirement. Unfortunately, they had to lay off 20% of their qualified workforce country-wide. I am now a displaced worker."
good,* Call on 6-10 Accounts per day
good,Pay and benefits are better then most.  Work life balance is good.  Management is poor.  Company looking to downsize.  Offering generous packages to tenured employees.
good,"A great job to start a career. The foundation of the sales process translates to other fields and positions if you learn it. Meeting new people daily and selling them on lowering their margins the first time you meet them, requires thick skin and charm. If you do not have thick skin and charm, you gain it quickly. "
good,Provides opportunity based on capability and willingness to work hard. Provides higher education opportunities for those who want to pursue this. Focused efforts on workplace culture.
good,"Pros:"
good,A solid CPG company with extensive training in sales and opportunity for advancement if you can relocate.  Pay is competitive but not as good as other CPG companies like those in medical sales.
good,Was the billing accountant and paid the sellers for their products sold. Balanced General Ledger books. Worked closely with local community.
good,"At the beginning, fun and exciting place to work at, with good training provided by management. The position become repetitive after the 2nd year, and management style became very pushy and sometimes even disrespectful towards employees. Compensation was good at the start, but because of lack of promotions within the company without relocating, the salary stayed basic the same."
good,"Organizing events was always an exciting job, it always involve a creation of a wide network."
good,This is a good company to work for.  They do require to much time and there is not work/life balance.  Many of the goals set forth by management are unobtainable
good,Great training and lots of chance for advancement.
good,Great job and wonderful people to work with the only down side is amount of hours expected to work. Twelve hours a day six days a week is physically and mentally taxing.
good,Fast-paced work environment with a lot of opportunities for growth and to learn the business as a whole. Excellent pay with demanding work that prepares the employee to take on any task.
good,"Got the internship through university recruiting. Invited everyone out to a pre-interview dinner to help break the ice and get to know the candidates a bit more. Friendly group of people, interested in cultivating the right culture for them and having the right people instead of taking just anybody to do the work. Which they could do, because the work was very, very easy. If you are someone who highly values work-life balance and wants to leave the office at 4 or 5 and forget about work, this is the place. Rotate to a different department every two years, move up with each rotation, and soon you'll be collecting your six-figure management paycheck while working 5 more hours each week. Cool people, easy job, good compensation in a relatively cheap city (Richmond)."
good,Daily job required quality production with accurate documentation.  Intense preventive maintenance required. Hourly checks with zero tolerance for errors
good,Ability to manage your own territory in a continuously changing industry. Excellent company benefits including company car. Great compensation including a company car.
good,You can be very creative and have a lot of fun driving business goals.  Work shops are great and help build strong foundation for the company to thrive.
good,Every employee has a development plan to improve skills and capabilities at every level. Great culture throughout most of the company and strong executive leadership.
good,"Altria as a company, worked to develop their people and to continue to provide them leadership training and skill development as they progressed in their careers."
good,mooi groot bedrijf waar ik met plezier heb gewerkt. helaas is de vestiging zo goed als gesloten.
good,Worked in a manufacturing facility and much is done through corporate.  Corporate will make decisions based on a corporate environment rather than all facilities.
good,The training and experience I gained working for Altria has provided me with the skills to excel in any organization.  I still have many friends at Altria - many of them are my former supervisors.
good,A great company to work for which has many challenging collaborative or individual opportunities while working in the Information Technology sector. Long standing history of being a quality service provider to our business clients.
good,"I've worked in the Finance department of Altria for going on 10 years.  When I started with the company the culture was awful.  Face-time and ego-stroking were rewarded over hard-work and productivity.  There was lots of talk about work/life balance but those that took advantage of it were ostracized.  And there was an extreme amount of micromanagement and levelism.  However, I can say that in the last 5 years the culture has shifted tremendously.  The company has undergone huge efforts to support work/life balance, diversity, and inclusion.  And these aren't just words, these are things that are being put into action. There is still work to be done, but Altria is well on its way to becoming a top-notched organization."

good,"A typical work day includes servicing about 8 retail accounts on a daily basis located within my territory, Virginia Beach, VA. These retail accounts include chains, independents, and wholesalers, but mainly convenience stores. While in a store, it is my job to provide tobacco category consulting through use of consumer insights and market data to maximize business results and close distribution gaps. In this position I have learned excellent communication skills, time management skills, and independence within my role. My management is only with me one day out of the month, to assess my actions and delivery in retail accounts. I see my co-workers once a month as well when we have a monthly ""unit meeting"" to discuss the month's current initiatives, new product launches, etc. The hardest part about the job is that it can become quite lonely, and you often feel like you are by yourself on an island; I wish there was a stronger company culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of accomplishment when you exceed targets on new product distributions, seasonal sale initiatives, etc."

good,"Working here I learned that rotating swing shifts is hard on the mind and body. You could go into work, work your shift and if your relief didn't show up then you would be drafted for the next shift as well. That was the hardest part of the job.

Management did their best to help us grow both personally and professionally. Most days are spent working by yourself in the field. Hardest part of the job was learning all our programs and knowing them well. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping smaller stores grow their sales and building relationships"
good,"see above, great company, changing culture, not a secure as it once was, the whole ATC environment is a moving target, Altria is probably better than their competitors at evolving, and will remain on top"
good,"Altria provides a good working environment. Facilities are clean and modern. Having the right tools and instruments for your work is not an issue. Parking is a covered lot connected by a bridge to the building. There's a fairly good cafeteria in the building."

good,"As a team leader, I started out the day with a meeting to answer questions and to give information. I learned a lot about the tobacco business. Most of my coworkers were nice and were team players. The hardest part of the job was sometimes getting forced to work over without notice. The most enjoyable part was that the company would acknowledge it's workers by having bonuses, parties, and great pay with outstanding benefits. I really enjoyed working for this company. I would still be there if they hadn't closed."
good,"This job was also a temporally one week position. My typical day at work was dealing with excessive inbound calls, mailing, and filing. I've learned much about the company, and what the company office does on a daily basis. Management was quite friendly and caring. Didn't work with much co-workers as many were on vacation due to the holidays. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the excessive inbound calls and transferring out to different cities and states. Dealing with 25 extension, however, learned how to manage the calls and extensions. The most enjoyable part was the workload was easy and quick to manage."
good,"Great company to start and grow your career. Unfortunately lately they've gotten a lot of bad press for things outside of their control, but the company really does take care of their employees."

Altria uses the STAR interview style so practice possible answers for questions such as... ""Tell me about a time when you had to do xxx"". The culture at Altria is something I miss because it's very collaborative and transparent. The company takes compliance very seriously. The Leadership Team was also great -"
good,Excellence is the goal and Altria achieves it in everything they do.  The employee is highly valued and invested in and it feels like a very big Family there.  It is a place where people start after College and retire from.

The tasks I was given felt important and I was able to learn a lot from them and build myself as an individual. My coworkers were all great people.

The managers I had over the course of my career were extremely supportive of my personal and professional growth.

good,Great company with many benefits. Management kept the floor in line by frequently checking to make sure production never deviated. This company taught me how to work well in stressful circumstances and with others when it comes to running product lines and meeting quality expectations. The hardest part of the job was being up through the night and having to sleep through the day. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was working with others to accomplish the same tasks just in different ways.
