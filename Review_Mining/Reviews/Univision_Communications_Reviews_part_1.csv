rating,review
bad,"If you like working under high stress for low compensation with a somber but yet scandalous office culture, go head and apply. Management is literally just a collective of egotistic upgraded sales people with absolutely no sense of proper business ethics to run an appreciated team. There’s absolutely no room for growth especially if you preform your duties adequately because management will just say “oh but you’re great at what you already do”; unless you’re willing to bite the bullet and decide to toss aside business ethics or integrity out the window just to get in a managerial position. It’s a dog eat dog world there, and I would 10/10 *not* recommend."
bad,waste of time dont need to say anything else if you dont know anyone you wont move up and they let go of people real quick they dont care for the employees
bad,"This place is incredible mediocre. How can a person be a News director if he has not any reporter experience? That show is a disaster and a fast food company pays more than Univision to their professional workers, how can they pay $12 the hour for a multi task journalist?. the pay part time but make you work more. And the anchor for the local news, is very rude."
bad,Sometimes expectations to complete the amount of work needed takes more than the time in the day. Thank you for being understanding when you know an employee is doing their best. Continue to take pride in your work and your team.
bad,"it was fun but didn't last long because company closed down"
bad,worst place to work. do not care about you. just a number. Management will through you under the bus just to cover their back.
bad,"worst paid in the industry, employees burnt out. Upper management doesn't know how to run a company."
bad,"•Reported to VP Training & Operations, IT Director, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer."
bad,"The worse ever, it was a nightmare it was something I did to learn about lighting, colorimetry, etc. I also learned the value of liberty."
bad,Las probabilidades de crecer a nivel profesional son mínimas. Los sueldos no son buenos y no valoran la experiencia profesional ni el compromiso de sus trabajadores.
bad,"An incompetent news director that has no clue on what news is, to the fact that she is more worried in attending social events with her husband than on the logistics and efficiency of her team. Toxic environment of favoritism, and discrimination. The news director Lies consistently and opens files on people she doesn’t like. Univision, please do yourself a favor: remove her from that position."
bad,"This is probably one of the worst companies I ever worked for. They think they are the coolest company in the industry but it is not true. In order to move up in the corporate ladder you have to be friends with CEO and VPs. Your work actually has little to do with moving up. "
bad,"Heavy work loads due to the new hub structures and employee lay offs. The employees that survived the layoffs of the past 2 years have taken on more roles and duties without compensation or the feeling of appreciation.  No longer a community focus, but more of a corporate and money saving mind set.  NO FUN ANYMORE!"
bad,"it is a very political work environment. you have to know the right person to get in, you have to know to the right person to get ahead. i was there for a very long time and never got moved up, i saw women come in at a entry level and a few months later they would be on air talent. very suspicious."
bad,"I worked about 82 hours each week and sometimes more. I would not get paid overtime - salary they call it. They promised they would give me comp days for the Saturdays, Sundays and holidays I had to work and I lost them all when they let me go. They would call in personal favors like working 36 hour shifts to finish some marketing reel or something else and would not consider those favors owed. I finally left because I was owned by them on Saturdays also. If i did something in my personal time they would inquire about it. Not recommended. Besides they are trying to go public but they cant sell anything and they are up to their necks in debt. Every thanksgiving you would see lay offs like clock work. I worked almost 7 years and not a raise. You will always be afraid you are next in line for the lay off."
bad,"The people outside of management are awesome, kind, hardworking and overall a pleasure to work with.  Management from the local director and up are not really there for employees.  They don’t seem to care about their employees much either. It’s always about themselves  from local management to corporate Senior VPs and higher up.  They’re antiquated in their management style and how they sell their products. Across departments, the left hand doesn’t ever seem to know what the right hand is doing."
bad,"This was the worse move I made. These have been the most stressful months of my life! Being micromanaged, can’t take half days. 9-6, working until 10 for 2weeks during Quarter end. Also during month end, leave late as well for 1 week!! Don’t get compensated for the extra time put in. Only 2 weeks vacation. From the network team, most people leave after 2-6 months. Only 2 people have more than 6 months, that says more than I can explain here."
bad,"Constant pressure to do more with less and make no mistakes. Laughable raises and told ""we have no money"" and constant changes in direction and leadership. Constant turnover with no consistency because people are always leaving and people with no experience brought in and you are expected to train them from scratch. "
bad,"Everything here is about who you know, not what you bring to the table.  If your good at office politics, this place is for you.  If you're a back-stabber, or can play the game, this place is for you.  If not, go someplace else.  Everyone is out for themselves, and they'll walk over anyone they need to in order to get what they need and wherever they need to go."
bad,"In my 2 months at Univision, I have had 2 different managers.  Today I saw my job posted on Indeed.  No warning, no write-up, nothing.  Obviously I'm losing my job.  Management doesn't know how to lead.  Just replace employees with contractors and let them go when they are no longer needed."
bad,Univision is a mess.  Lots of lay offs in the past couple of years.  Bad managers all around.  Owners desperate to sell and not finding any buyers.  Shows being cancelled left and right.  Lots of people complaining about the many changes in recent years.  A few good people left.  More lay offs to come.  Stay away if you want a stable work environment.
bad,excellent pay but a career dead end. just go google univision in the news and check out some internal articles published by employees for the full picture.
bad,"There was no strategic direction, lack of vision. Decision making was always difficult for any senior leadership. Reporting meetings that never accomplished anything."
bad,"The first years  were wonderful, I learned a lot about advertisement."
bad,"No advance in company, no benefits at all, not even 40 hrs. You make $10 dls an hr and pay $4 dls/hr for parking."
bad,"After 3 months of being there I wanted out... unfortunately it was not possible. HR is corrupt, and management is allowed to treat employees with little respect or professionalism. Managers micro-manage and there was very little attempt to resolve any issues."
bad,Currently under big changes. Having a difficult time of keeping up with its mission to represent the community it is supposed to serve. Challenged and in need of a strong refocus on its core business.
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow. It is the same routine, wanting people to ""learn"" from other departments. A lor of people don't spend that much time with family because this job requires most of your life time."
bad,Univision is going through a very tough time and the work enviorment is very bad.  No respect for jobs. People are leaving or forced to leave. I hope this changes in the years to come.
bad,"over worked"
bad,Poor local management and the corporate offices turn the other way. The environment is a negative one with so many people unhappy and so many afraid to say a thing for fear of it coming back to them.
bad,They are all running scared that they may be the next to get fired. They have Managers that don't know what they are doing and should not be in the positions that they are in.
bad,Don't be surprised if Univision files for chapter 11 or the like within the next couple of years. Lack of leadership ruined the company long ago. No longer a good place to work.
bad,"busy, fast pace multi-tasking environment. Business hrs typically M-F unless you are in the News/production dept.  Poor communications from management, is easy for managers to blames those under them and they don't care to have a fun environment."
bad,"Very fast and changing work environment, things do change really fast there. flexibility and ability to adjust quickly to different situations are a good skill to have."
bad,"learned a lot from working at the company, very high professionals but the lack of employee advancement is disappointing. Looking forward to my new job."
bad,"If you are looking to start in news, stay 2 years then leave.  Not investing in the latest information distribution and takes their audience for granted."
bad,"overall good place, hard working people, and the café was great. Pay rate is a bit cheap. If you are a contract worker prepare to work at least a year till they offer you a perm position"
bad,"Great exposure. Great opportunities. Nice co-workers."
bad,is complicated and i do not want to talk about it.If someone ask me about Univision i would said just ok and i would'n talk about anything else. I do believe that they have to do some changes.
bad,"Was the worst fortune 500 I worked for, the sales and product training was the worst, very little support from my manager."
bad,"While Univision use to be a great place to work, the new owners and new top management have really made the work environment worse.  the pay and benefits are good, but it is cut throat and they don;t treat employees well."
bad,I had the opportunity to work with a group of great people who are passionate about the work they do. My manager was an easy-going person whose integrity was never compromised or tarnished. He gave me great career advice and also helped me grow within the organization.
bad,"Unless youŕe part of the union, youŕe screwed. Great comraderie among co-workers."
bad,"Career advancement is null, if you want to move up or switch departments, you need to on your own time and if you express an interest in another area of the company it's frowned upon. Work gets incredibly boring and repetitive fast. No challenge whatsoever and sub par training"
bad,"Great people to work with, huge sense of family and community. it doesnt matter if you are doing a great job, people get fired by emails after 22 years of service. If you are a backsabbing as*h**e Univision is a place for you."
bad,"As a Account Executive my daily goal is to develop new business for radio/digital properties.  Daily routine is to manage active accounts as well as followup with potential targets via conferencing, emails and  scheduling meetings to discuss next steps. "
bad,"Company grew too quickly just because of the Hispanic market growth, so the company is extremely disorganized - internal controls, integrated data systems and structured reporting  are nonexistent. Something as simple as pulling revenue for a single advertiser takes hours and internal data needs days of cleaning before it can be used. Something as routine as budgeting is a last minute scramble and you have to hope it ties if a deeper dive is needed. "
bad,"Univision is one of the highest ranking networks in the US for Hispanics, it does not feel like you're working for one though. The ideas are dated, there is zero innovation. Everything is being driven by the studios in Mexico. You either abide by their rules or you can go work for someone else."
bad,It used to be a friendly workplace. Everyone complains about the overwhelming workload and responsibilities corporate expects from the employees.
bad,"Growing organization with opportunity for significant new initiatives. However, serious detrimental organizational changes incurred with new management brought in from a larger media company. The new management mindset is focused on self-promotion at the expense of employee morale and company improvement. This is particularly the case in the technology area."
good,Was deployed as a L3 Information Security Engineer. Was working remotely via sslvpn
good,"The typical workday is never the same.  There is often an emphasis on doing more with a lot less.  One is given tools to put a good product on air however there is a lot of pressure to never make mistakes.  One learns to be efficient with their time and tasks as the workload asked can be crushing at times but deadlines are always met.  Among the workers, there is good chemistry and people look out for one another."
good,"Mondays and Tuesdays consist of chaos, rest of the week pretty normal depending on your work ethic, no micro-managing so big plus but every other aspect of the job is brushed off with high hopes of advancement with such a big company but in reality they can careless about their employees or their knowledge and advancement opportunities."
good,I assisted the weekend news reporter. Conducted interviews and helped with editing pieces and rundowns. Conducted research and organized news pieces. Kept contact with Police active calls and dispatched news crew.
good,"You're treated from the door as being easily dispensable. There is no support or understanding for a life/work balance. The environment was comfortable and relaxed, maybe too much. More structure would've allowed management to see who the slackers were and who the good employees were. Managers would eliminate employees without warning or reason and just replace them with someone else, paying the new employee less. This occurred multiple times during my tenure and got worse after I left. This led to a very uncomfortable work environment for everyone. They show no appreciation for exemplary employees and often speak only of themselves and their accomplishments. The pay was competitive but not worth it. The benefits were horrible, expensive healthcare and  infrequent annual raises, weather or not a 401k match will be awarded is a year by year determination and time off is typical, with the exception of no one will cover your work load when you are gone so to take time off is more of a hassle then its worth."
good,Prospected and developed relationships with potential advertisers. Focused on new direct business.Created radio sales pieces for specific customers.Wrote and edited radio advertising content in Spanish and English. Met revenue goals set by Sales Manager.
good,Very corporate company with very poor communication to employees.  Over worked personnel that does not get compensated fairly for the extra duties they are given that were not part of their original job description.  The morale is very low.
good,"It is managed by people that has a little idea about new technologies, their culture of advancement is more about exploding people that knows how to work well with a little bit of salary, big hours and when you complain, then you are going to be the first to be lay off."
good,Very fast paced. Young edgy co-workers. Learned not to share too much of my personal information with co-workers. Hardest part of my job was having to carry a BlackBerry 24/7. Most enjoyable part of my job were the social events.
good,"Managed a team of coworkers on a day to day in various elements of our departments operations. We handled Client Activations, Festivals, Parades, Private and public concerts etc. Many different layers to the job as it entails dealing with a radio and TV aspect which sometimes are very different."
good,"Working for this company has been at times great and other times very unsteady.  They are in constant flux trying to get the company sold and lay off people to show a higher bottom line income.  I have been given room to do my job with little supervision, which i like and works for me."
good,Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table? Not. I think I'll pass on reviewing Univision. I'm afraid anything I could provide would not be complimentary.
good,"There are many good hard working people working at Univision. There was a very ""Latin Vibe"" and very collaborative, but once they started to look into selling the company or going public the whole company changed. It got very rigid and positions started to change dramatically on a type of ""assembly line"" jobs, with no possibility of growth."
good,The late breaking news environment and live shows make Univision the ideal place to get the hands on experience that make future leaders in the Broadcast Industry.
good,"I used to bring clients to Univision. The first 10 years I worked with them the company was very good. They used to respect our work and give us special rates to bring clients. When they changed manager in 2005, everything changed. "
good,Management is nowhere present which at times is good but the reverse can also be said.
good,"Long hours, fast-paced. Difficult to juggle work/life due to extended hours during Closing and Estimates/Plans. "
good,"I did amazing work for Univision, I also got the opportunity to learn about the media industry in all aspects. I gained a lot of knowledge that will now help me advance in my new career path."
good,Univision was the place of employment when I learned all the aspects of accounting. The payables/receivables department consisted of six employees with various years of experience.
good,"As a reporter, the assignments are different each day.  I have had the opportunity to travel and learn about new topics each day.  As a freelancer, there is no job security.  This is a place to learn and gain experience."
good,"Executive management are slaves to the financial sponsor ownership group and do not care about long term growth of the company.  Only care about short term financial targets in advance of an exit."
good,Univision was a great experience but was looking to advance in my career instead of remaining stagnant.
good,Univision is a very robotic company. Bottom line is they will do anything to save a few pennies including sacrificing quality. I feel the company is a shell of it's former self.
good,"You work alot and you go home, then you work alot and then yiou go home. Actually, if you like to work alot, and then go home this is the place for you"
good,"Working on set, it’s very long hours. The people were fun to work with. As said the hours are very unpredictable, call time would be 7 am and be off at midnight"
good,"Work/life balance is non-existent.  Long work hours, no flexibility.  "
good,Challenging environment with limited negotiation authority for sales representatives to close deals. Lack of direction & engagement from Sr. Leadership.
good,Great work culture.  Management expects long work days with minimal help.  Management has to be coaxed to promote from within.      Hard for females to get management positions
good,Good place to start your career and gain experience.  I was able to learn what goes on in a production from inception to completion.
good,"Account Executive,  Univision Communication"
good,"Selling radio commercials and campaigns in Spanish. A very challenging role, but one that can be very lucrative.  When I was there, however there was much turnover in management which made adjusting to the job tasks quite difficult."
good,Univision has a diverse and unique working culture. They offer good benefits.
good,"Decent company to work for, but management was extremely poor and as a result that led to departments being disorganized, and employees needing to stay longer than necessary to complete job duties."
good,"Univision is the leader in the Spanish Language Media industry in United States, creating and distribution relevant content in language and culture to Hispanics in US."
good,"Employee morale needs to be addressed and wrap up the staff reduction so those that have survived can concentrate on moving forward without further fear of elimination, this causes a very negative and nonproductive environment."
good,"Its a place where you work all day long with very little time to take few minutes off."
good,"not great, not social, unprofessional"
good,"At Univision Puerto Rico you can learn a lot about TV production and all tasks related to the industry.  However, their the way they manage the company and therefore the job culture, is not the best."
good,"I loved my job as an On-Air Talent. The connection with listeners and being able to provide my own original production and scripts for content during my show was a blast. It is a vey demanding job; there are really no vacations for yourself UNLESS you're on of the BIGGEST stars. My direct manager was understanding and gave me the opportunity to train with a refreshment course. Downside of this company is that they expect you to do a lot for very little and incentives or recognitions were not something I came across during my employment,"
good,"It was a productive and fun workplace, it was very interesting working with vacation clubs and the colleagues were fun to work with."
good,"A typical day at work involves communicating with the agency anything related with the current orders on air. Stewarding the accounts to ensure everything runs correctly and deliver-ability. "
good,"Univision gave me my opportunity to go national. Learned a lot, but company heading in a unfriendly direction for employees."
good,This company went from a fun environment to a very stressful & disorganized environment.  Projects were always discussed & planned at the last minute.
good,Univision delivers information that pertain to the Latino community that english language compeditors don't.
good,"Met many interesting people, and was surrounded by many professional individuals, a company with the opportunity to grow and utilize your skills. fast pace and very corporate."
good,Univision is going through very tough times. Struggling with bad programming and ratings are creating a very INTENSE internal battle.  Everyone points fingers.
good,"The time in Univision was a good experience, nice team work and good work schedule. But the job self disorganized.I felt that i didn't get a good training."
good,"Large company, great facilities, centrally located!  I had a great manager who is supportive and great to work with!  Many educational opportunities and trainings are provided throughout the year."
good,"Its a good day to day company, where you learn basic skills but not deep creativity. "
good,"I was responsible for making sure sales orders were entered into system correctly and contracting to schedule on daily log.  Did reconciliation of commercial logs daily and monthly coop and affidavits for barter affiliates.  Also, made sure all money was scheduled in sold out situation.  Enjoyed my job- always felt like I was putting a puzzle together when I did logs"
good,"It's a growing team that is undergoing many changes, trying to keep a process in place with a new team is a challenge"
good,"Univision has been going through several management changes, which has resulted in personnel changes throughout the company.  Although the people that I have worked with are great, they layoffs have taken a toll on the morale on the company.  Overall good experience but looking to advance in my career at this point."
good,Extremely fast paced with multiple floors and duties. Ever changing with moves and team restructuring on an almost daily basis. Very high traffic and back to back meetings.
good,"Stressful work environment"
good,"I had a tremendous experience working for Univision. I enjoyed my daily assignments. They included me in everything- meetings. lunches, brunches etc. They are very professional and caring."
good,"Univision is a great company to work for which offers great benefits.They offer health, dental and eye care. The hours are reasonable but there is very little room for professional growth."
good,"Workplace was indeed relaxed in the beginning, later on everything was tougher. Sales can be difficult in this market we are in considering the 300,000 Hispanics that live here compared to other markets."
good,Great company for the Hispanic market. Family feeling in each department. Needs to work on its career advancement and salaries for their employees (especially those who work long hours). No perks. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with cool coworkers. Company needs to figure out how to stay on top.
good,I didn't like it there. Management is terrible. You're trained by another employee and not the manager. I was trained by someone who had been there for 2 months before I got hired and they expected me to know everything from someone who didn't know everything themselves. I was fired and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was miserable there.
good,"Did not enjoy working there. Not professional way of treating employees.  You are only a number on their Payroll, no understanding for employees. Young people, gossiping, force you to believe what they believe.."
good,Univision Communications is not a bad place to work and gain valuable experience.  If you are also looking to travel and get to know the US pretty well also not a bad place.
good,"Stay current on news and sports, understand what the daily need is and act on it"
good,My bases is only on a summer job with the company in which it was a fun company to work for and a lot to learn about building relationships. The pay was low but great place for work experience
good,"My time working at Univision was an exciting time! Working in sales you really get an understanding for the competitive nature that is media. While everyone thinks you automatically get freebies or tickets, those are rare commodities. But the level of exposure to projects is great! Management is not the best here. People shout, yell and tend to not mentor you."
good,I was only an intern but the environment was amazing and very friendly people to work with. Everyone was eager to help me understand the company system and how to potentially move up within the company.
good,"Upper Management lacks knowledge of what is done at the local level, thus compromising the line of work.  Too many chiefs not enough indians."
good,"People there interfere with each other's work.  There are some smart people there, but not an organized place.  Management can be a bit overbearing."
good,"Like any company going through industry transitions, Univision is trying to hold its footprint."
good,"Great ambience, but not many oportunities to advance locally."
good,"Univision has been a great place to start my career in media. The company has grown immensely from when I started in 2011 and continues to grow. "
good,"I didn't learn anything that I didn't know from school"
good,The company has great content and people who enjoy working there.
good,Opportunity to grow business acumen.  Work with some of the best in production.
good,A great place to build knowledge and skills. Lots of different software programs that other companies don't have.
good,"Good people work at the company. There are a lot of talented, hard working people."
good,There is plenty of chances to learn many Nielsen software packages and they do take the time to make sure you understand the basics. Its a great place to work. Management works with you. Pleasant place to work.
good,"Typical day at work included business meetings, review of weekly/monthly goal status and sales presentations to existing and prospect clients."
good,A typical day started with a nice breakfast and chatting with coworkers.
good,"Univision is a nice place to work although it can be a grind. The company was good in the ratings, however the Spanish language audience has changed and they have not kept up with the bi-cultural trend."
good,"I learnt a a lot while working for this company, it just seems that there isn't really any growth financially in the company. A typical day would be answering e-mails, answering the phone and research."
good,"Every day is different then the other."
good,"I started working in Univision Radio back in 2005 when i was 18 yrs old and it was pretty awesome learning Board Operation, Production, Logs and Interacting with co workers was great."
good,"not willing to provide any further comment to upper management. as i understand, all were a part of the final phase of layoffs and new executives hired."
good,Managers and work environment is fun and ethical. They help you grow in media. Only downside is they constantly lay-off people and re-hire so there is no sense of stability.
good,"I believe is a great company who know how to adapt to modern times, specially when TV business is declining eveyewhere and they find a way to reinvent the company"
good,"In a regular day of work check the perfect functioning of robotic cameras, lights, computers, sound systems, satellite communications system, I meet with the floor manager to find out how everything goes in the studios and more."
good,"In addition to the job that was good because them let our opinions counts, it was interesting to know some of the TV celebrities that came to the station."
good,"I did it all, from coffee runs to sewing buttons, definitely paid my dues! You have to start somewhere right?"
good,"A typical day at work was usually very challenging, however for those of us that love challenges, specially creative challenges while in a business environment  that felt like family. It was great. To this day, the Univision art department feels like family to me. I continued to learn a lot about the corporate world and communication among department. The most challenging part of the job was the fast growth of the division it grew from 7 employees to approximately 70 artist and designers within a year and a half. The most enjoyable part of the job was each time we finished a great production project, the great sense of accomplishment and success among all creative personnel, to know it was done as a team each time more efficiently."
good,Univision Chicago is a good company to work for if you are looking for a fast pace media news outlet.  The expectations are a lot and can be overwhelming at times but the work culture helps employees get through it.  The family atmosphere is very strong there and they make everyone feel welcomed.
good,"Univision Inc. is a good place to find your place or advance your career, but it's easy to fall into a spiral of repetitiveness and lack of opportunities to grow. "
good,"Wonderful  Executive Assistants, always willing to work as a team and help one another in any way possible."
good,"First US Hispanic Network that became one of the top 4. It is a fast paced environment, very creative and dedicated team, US Hispanics is their number #1 priority."
good,I'm looking to grow in the industry and be a successfull person.
good,"Univision is a good place to grow. You can definitely learn a great deal because you have to be resourceful. However, morale is a bit low because competitors have made more investment."
good,It is a fast paced environment but everyone is very nice and helpful. I learned how to choose newsworthy stories. Management is difficult to deal with. Every department is very protective of its employees and it's hard to break barriers between them.
good,"Fast-paced environment. Great people to work with, yet limited resources. Fun, innovative and challenging."
good,"During a typical work day i would take payments from the customers. Read my email ,print a report for unapply payments. Review the transactions on the report then check the corporate email for documentation about that transaction attach it on oracle then apply the payment if possible. Long standing unapply payments would be research."
good,"Fun, relax and way to entertaining."
good,the culture for Univision is very closed up. Unless they know you people don't even acknowledge you. If you are new they are not welcoming at all. There's lots of jealousy and envy with talent.
good,"I learned team work and sacrifice. The hardest part, was the night shift schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the respect and confidence my coworkers had in me."
good,Is hard to describe a typical day at work as new things happen everyday. I have learned to manage my time efficiently where different tasks and projects are given daily. People are very friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,It was interesting but no opportunities to grow. I would have wanted to see more personal treatment and feedback while training.
good,"Excellent company to work for, with strong focus on corporate culture. Being a strong unrivaled leader in the US Hispanic media landscape, Univision has created a ""world of its own"" which at times makes the company feel overweight and decadent, but it is truly an innovative environment."
good,I loved that every show was different on a daily basis. There is always an exciting segment or breaking news that needed to be handled. The production team and on-air talent always made sure that everything ran smoothly.
good,"I don't work full time their, i would love to but currently the positions i'm looking for their isn't.  The people who i've interacted with at Univision have all been great people."
good,"This is my first work in USA and I really like this place, the space to create innovative solutions and be creating it's so important to me. As Data Journalist I was focused in the creation of stories focused in the Hispanic population in USA, covering issues who affect to the undocumented immigrants communities."
good,I worked at Univision for 1 year but then left due to another opportunity that arose (paying $40K more) and also because company was going through re-organization and there was no guarantee I would continue to be hired and keep my position.
good,Maybe try and pay a bit more for the work load that is placed on the consultant. Maybe try to see better ways to assist staff with work load.. Try to make staff feel appreciate.
good,"I enjoyed my career there.  Had three supervisors of top quality.  Had to struggle to work up to their level of experience.  Once you get there, then you realize it is worth the effort."
good,"make the marketing plan for the week, and advertising plan for the media,  make the report for my managers..work for improve the costumers services...."
good,"Going through major restricting, which has led to many layoffs. However it is an overall great company with strong leadership."
good,"A typical day at work is recording news briefs, designing news graphics, ingesting the pre-recorded news briefs into the system. I also work on print ads, special sweeps packages for weather and other news packages. I have learned how to better my photoshop skills and enhance my after effects skills. The hardest part of my job is multi tasking alot of different projects at one time. I enjoy the challenge and the pressure of my job."
good,"Aside from general assignment reporting daily, my position with Univision Philadelphia allowed me to focus on stories more in depth. I was often required to execute investigative reports that required more time and dedication. "
good,Managers have great experience and foster a family environment. Offer constant training and coaching. The co-workers are very close knit.
good,Filming was something I had never done before and I was able to adjust and be able to jump into it smoothly with the help of a very supportive director. It was a fun and new experience and took much practice.
good,"Typical day would be just come in, check out programming, social media, schedule remotes/events."
good,Always something fun and exciting going on!  Great work environment. Company promotes diversity and encourages growth from within.
good,"A great place to work, busy and hard work."
good,I learned to how deal with different Latin cultures in a very diverse City/ Market
good,"•	Involved in complete Life Cycle including Analysis, Design, Development and Testing."

My co-workers came from so many different backgrounds and it was great to meet all of them and work with them. The hardest part of the job was the management.
