bad,"Wants to pay peanuts,,and just blatantly lies about everything,,made deal so he would cover half my fuel expenses from Clydebank to Alloa,,got it once,,the week I left,,after 2 months being promised he would sort it out,,and never got the couple hundred owed for fuel,,so left,,greedy man,"
bad,Pronto Insurance has been one of the worst work experiences I have ever had. Poor management that only care about themselves and instead of helping the employees they just find ways to belittle everyone. They say they will pay commission and promise everything under the moon then they don't pay. I would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"I resigned twice from this company due to its sweatshop atmosphere whether you’re at home or in the office. Everybody has to work almost 24 seven just to keep their job. Very heavy work load. The pay is good but over all when you consider the hours you put in it’s probably more like $.75 an hour. Most  supervisors are nice and helpful but my last supervisor did not give you support or guidance leading with a bull whip!"
bad,"Run don't walk.  If you get an interview you may want to exit left.  This company is beyond sub-par. It is a stressful environment with unrealistic expectations, this is an understatement. The management is inexperienced, inefficient, and uneducated, and therefore unhelpful to say the least and are unable to support their staff in times of need. Oh let's address the elephant in the room, the training, oh that's right there is none! Also, don't look for raises as they do not exist and bonuses are non existent as well.  Not much incentive for keeping employees around, thus the high turnover and job burnout."
bad,Company is notorious for three things. 1- Promising wage increases (even inflationary ones) and never coming to fruition. 2- Hiring and promoting family members (as other mentioned nepotism). 3- Retaliation against those challenging the salesmen or leaderships ethics.
bad,"Lots of stress and verbal abuse I would not recommend Gallagher. They're always taking things away from employees, sick leave vacation and 401k Contributions."
bad,"The best insurance option is a $8k out of pocket and after that 80% is covered.  No room for advancement and they let go of employees all the time for being 1-3 minutes late. The  building has no parking and it is typically a 4-7 min walk from were you park to get to your desk. It is not a great working environment, you have the  General Manager of the site who is very unapproachable and will give you a fake laugh and a fake smile and never look you in the Face."
bad,"Upper Management will not take your phone calls.  Upper Management have and plays favorites.  Some wonderful clients; however, some expecting you to deny everything"
bad,Orlando claims manager pretends to be nice and supportive but she is not. There is a horrible atmosphere in the office. Everyone overworked meeting corporate matrix instead of adjusting claims. Other Florida offices may be different (other than unrealistic daily corporate matrix). Most adjusters in the red daily regardless of file handling quality.
bad,This company communication is  so bad the management was disrespectful. You have to train yourself and they put others work loads on others even if they are not trained properly. A comment was that confirmed that  I wasn't to be at this Job ... RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS JOB.
bad,"Too many claims. Not enough people. They hire inexperienced people and this sets them up for failure. Their failed files then are passed on to experienced people thus causing their failure. The atmosphere is horrible! I left after over 2 years because the work-life balance...well, there is none. Work all day or night to keep your head above water just so they can keep giving because someone else again quit. If you want to work here...be prepared to never have a life outside of the company as long as you stay there. They give only up to 3% raise and most of the time the raises are never at the top but not prepared to tell you why. Its really pathetic."
bad,"They hire idiots  for management positions with no experience and treat the worker bee employees like a sweat shop. Horrible pay, management and hours."
bad,"If you are considering employment at this office, in the interview asks these questions.  When was the last time they obtained a new account.  How many employees have left within the last six months. Why are there so many job openings.  In general, how many hours do the employees ""actually"" work per week. Then you will know what actually goes on in this office.  For years because of nepotism certain employees were paid just for showing up with absolutely no work production.  Now because the accounts are demanding their money's worth, all employees particularly claims have to suffer through changes after changes of micromanagement from Senior Management - because local Management mismanaged this office -  to make sure everyone now tows the line.. There are strict deadlines for every single - read this again - every single job duty, there is no hedging or leeway due to the fallout out of prior terrible claims handling from the chosen few.  Just as fast as someone is hired, they leave within a few weeks time.  Unless you are desperate for a job, DO NOT come here to work.  These people make promises about raises and bonuses, that never happen because they create new rules that is difficult to follow and make that the excuse as to why you are not given the promised raise or promotion.  They make unrealistic promises to the Insured to keep their business and expect the adjusters to somehow make these promises come true.  The workload is heavy. especially in the time frame they demand for it to be completed.  Expect to work very long hours and weekends. Expect little to no reward from"
bad,If you are looking for a HP NonStop Engineer position don’t bother.  The senior engineer acts like a child and management supports that behavior. Good luck.
bad,"Typically most come in early and stay late "
bad,"No advancement, says you can work from home, but are working 50 to 65 hrs a week including weekends just to keep up, with no overtime.  Most of the time responding to EMAILS, at least 50 to 100 a day. They don't care about the employees, just the client. If client doesn't like you, your written up or fired.  No type of training, give you a large case load of files from the start, never able to catch up. If you going on vacation, will take months before you catch up again.  EMs from CEO brags about his travels to different offices around the world and his golf game. Bad pay and not enough personnel. Stay away."
bad,"Completely mismanaged claims office with one of the worst work environments of any third party administrator in the industry. No advancement ability, job satisfaction, or work/life balance. Expect employees to work excessive hours in the office and at home with no respect for an employee's right to time off. When total hours worked are factored into the equation the pay is ridiculously low and not sufficient to cover the cost of living in high cost of living area such as Massachusetts."
bad,"Came back after major surgery and was terminated."
bad,"The management sells their product to clients, misleading them on the level of service they will be given.  This is simply due to the overpromising of employees.  There is far more work than employees can handle and management hides this from the clients."
bad,"Very strange atmosphere in the office, nobody seemed to know what they were doing. High turnover of staff too, somebody was always working their last day in the office. Lot's of leaving night's."
bad,"This company tries to do more with less.  They don't hire enough people for anyone to do a adequate and proper job unless they work at least 10 hours a day and weekends.  The typical day is answering e-mails, emails and more e-mails in between phone calls that makes it difficult to complete typical claim duties.   This company has a history of people just not being able to deal with the amount of work and walking out.  Don't expect a decent raise, because raises only go to the friends and family members of management.  You are not automatically evaluated for a bonus.  You must submit a very detailed professional biography as to why you deserve a  bonus and only 20 people are chosen.  Management follow your work by tic marking almost everything you do. Many of the Supervisors are promoted in that position again because they are part of the friends and family package.  The culture is to get to work done by any means necessary, they don't care how or who as long as it's done.  Would never recommend this company to anyone for employment.  Sad part is this company has all the basics to be a great company but the Management teams are poorly trained and the Sr. Management teams rely solely on numbers and not people who actually do the work to make their decisions..  .."
bad,i worked there for 5 weeks yolanda thomas was supervisor. she did not like new hirees to get help by your neighbors and also she has a poor training plan. it was a terrible environment and also there was no casual friday.
bad,The culture is “let’s catch someone doing something wrong”. They are all about profits versus taking care of the employee. Extremely high turnover.  I was there for 12 years and was unprofessionally tossed out due to a RIF and my age.
bad,"Awful management at the time I was there. Branch manager and operations manager awful people. Employees petty, childish and rude. Office setup for snitching. High school nonsense."
bad,"The management is awful, they do not care about you or anyone else. They will make you do things that you feel are morally wrong. You only work 35 hours per week and if you work more, you likely will not get paid for it. All positions are salary, regardless of what they say."
bad,"No training whatsoever. You are thrown into the ""pool"" and expected to ""learn how to swim"" all on your own. Management is poor and the work culture is flooded with nepotism. You may be given scheduled hours, but it is expected of you to work through your lunches as well as stay later without overtime pay."
bad,Upper management does not communicate with the workers.  There is favoritism toward certain people who always bend the rules.   Best part is it is a very busy job and the day goes by fast.
bad,"Upper mgmnt has no clue how things work in CA. Would never recommend this company to anyone. (And that's coming from a manager!) go to Geico, Mercury, anywhere else but here."
bad,My typical day was working with the existing client base to retain their business and support the sales agent with quoting new business and creating renewal summaries.
bad,This review is of the workers compensation claims department. The level of micro management is beyond ridiculous. More time spent on micro managing on internal processes than on proactively doing the job. Management is completely out of touch with what is required to properly perform the jobs they oversee.

bad,"Wild wild west.  Very disorganized, political and cut throat.  Favorites are picked. Producers are used then thrown in the trash so the leftover can divvy up  their account because they cannot produce on their own."
bad,"Terrible Management that works at home 70 to 80% of the time. Hire you and give you nothing but busy work that no one else wants to do. Cliquey, alot of brown nosers.Bullying etc"
bad,"They over work you, management is horrible, their benefits are horrible and the raises they give their employees is a joke.  No incentives or bonuses some rewards that they guve employees that i remember were some canned foods and hand me downs. The pay is the lowest in the industry. Micromanagement at its best."
bad,Great place to work- but with no room to move up in your career it's difficult.  I have seen great co-workers leave because of this issue.  It is a mans world at AJG
bad,"Poor Pay, long hours, no job training. Only promotion are for Gallagher family or cronys. Clueless management."
bad,"Working at Western Litigation was a nightmare!  Huge turnover in employees and you never knew who you were working for.  The DRAMA in our department was almost like reliving high school with your boss and her minion as the ""mean girls."" I would never recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"i worked here for several years.  At first, it was a great place to work.  Claim counts rose from about 130 to 150 and are now over 200 unless you are a favorite.  Top management spends a lot of time thinking of ways to make it even worse.  Instead of making things easier, they think of ways to add to your workload that are complete time wasters.  No real raise in six years, unless you count a 1% raise once as a real raise.  Thankless and soul sucking place to work.  Even working from home was not enough to keep me there.  All I did was work 10-12 hours per day.  They say you work a 35 hour week.  I never did and it was always my fault for working hard but not smart.  At least my new employer appreciates me!"
bad,Not enough hours to get the job done. Overworked and under paid.  Would not recommend anyone leaving a job to come to Gallagher Bassett.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone looking to progress in the  insurance industry. They do not train well (1-2 weeks) then stick you on a desk with 200+ claims and expect you to learn everything on the ""fly"". Supervisors are never around which makes the learning curve more difficult. Some actually sleep at their desk or drink during work hours. The branch manager supervises his son who is a supervisor. The supervisors also supervise relatives. Nepotism is huge at this company. They are  unethical as some adjusters work files without the proper licenses(NY) which will eventually be found by the insurance department. The clients are often lied to about the way claims are being handled. The only positive note about this company is that it is a job filler until you can secure a position with another  insurance company. I hope to be out of this company by the end of the month!"
bad,"Management is shady, they will throw to the wolves too save themselves.  Supervisors supervise their own relatives, branch manager supervises his own relative.   "
bad,"Management does not understand the needs of their employees.    Employees micromanaged very heavily, monitored and tracked emails to make sure they were being worked.  Micromanaged diary to ensure completion daily.  While diary and email is important, the workload was too heavy and the micromanaging just added to the problem and didn't help it.  No training, adjusters expected to and held to adjust claims outside their expertise level and would be thrown under the bus if not handled correctly.  Overall a horrible place to work."
bad,"Department heads were so overworked they brought you in and you hit the floor running.  Great to come in knowing finance however to know all the nuances of how they need to have things done and in place is impossible.  No time for training but high expectations.  Nepotism permits  a couple unskilled employees to remain over payed to roam like undisciplined children with no work."
bad,"Gallagher laid off the whole check processing department in September and sent the job to India. And then they realized that India couldn't do it and open the position and department back up! Smh! Management is a joke and upper management is Racist. Oh and NO RAISES, AND BONUSES THAT CHANGE so much that they are attainable. One department only has 7 employees when it should be like 60 people this place is a joke!!"
bad,It was horrible to work for the Manhattan location. People made their own rules and treated all the lower level employees horribly. Certain people were always watching every move you made or we’re trying to get you fired for things you had to do that weren’t part of your job. The salary wasn’t conducive for the way we were being treated. If u take a job just do it for a stepping stone but don’t stick around for long.
bad,"This company is not ideal if you want to advance in your career, I got my All lines adjuster license and was not allowed to attend any of the classes in order to keep my license valid, and subsequently ended up having to pay out of pocket for hours that should have provided to me during my time at the company. Also getting my license to be able to train and ultimately be promoted to an adjuster position. which I was also not given the opportunity to do."
bad,"Manager never in the office and left duties up to another employee who was also never there. No room in increase staff to help already overworked staff. No one to go to for help because if you did, you reprimanded asking for help, Made no sense,"
bad,"The culture at AJG would be easily summarized with 'The beatings will continue until morale improves'.  Compensation for work performed did not match promised or described prior to joining.  The dirty internal politics played by coworkers is learned is fostered from management.  The company is keen on acquiring offices followed by cutting the resulting redundant personnel.  Despite suggestions of consulting expertise in the area of compensation, in Canada, the company does not conduct or deliver appropriate compensation by role for staff in the company.  Negotiations for salary is a free for all.  The strategy for Canada seems driven by new western directors who lack competence themselves to do anything well other than throw employees who do not fit down the stairs or under a bus.  The coffee was decent and most coworkers are nice."
bad,"No opportunities for advancement, low pay, incompetent managers, overwhelming work. They say that you will handle claims capped out at 150 at a time but they will add more on top of it. Managers are ill informed and cannot help you with any issues, you're better off asking a peer. You will have to take work home pretty much everyday."
bad,"Gallagher is a company with great potential, but extremely poor leadership and execution.  We are a publicly traded company that lives by the old mantra of quarter by quarter decision making.  In the last quarter of the year it is not uncommon for an announcement from Senior management that limits purchases (including paper and supplies) or even client related travel.  "
bad,"It is a great place to work - if you are male. If you are not, watch out. It is a very old boy sales structure. Some women do okay, but it isn't the norm. HR isn't designed to help you. The ""Gallagher Way"" saying and rules are a joke."
bad,"No advancement  if you're  female or minority. Very low pay for the area and skillsets. Will advance men first ahead of far more qualified women candidates. This is part of the company culture, doesn't deviate at other offices. Company's built on nepotism. They are very open about that. Which means THEY WILL hire and advance someone's wife,sister,brother, son, daughter ,nephew, niece ahead of you if they want to- qualified or not."
bad,"Working here was the most miserable experience of my life. I've worked at other TPA's and while there is definitely a certain level of tedium that goes with the job and it is sad to hear some of the cases that come in, Gallagher Basset takes things to a whole new level. The corporate culture here is definitely low on professionalism and all about dollars and cents. Cutting corners is highly encouraged, as is working within a moral and ethical gray area. Upper-level management is filled with raging tempers who don't care about explanations or reasoning-only money. This place broke me."
bad,"One of the worst companies that I have worked for in my 20 years in the Insurance Industry. Management are micro-managers where they check your e-mail's twice a day to ensure that you are totally caught up and Gallagher gives their client's was too much control over their employees. Disaster of an experience...Glad I left and am working for a ""real"" company now."
bad,"The work load is  unreasonable. Branch manager is unconnected and only speaks to her favorites. The work environment is Very Stressful. Co-workers are ok. There is absolute No training. I think now they are trying to improve. There is a lot of racism in the office. Only a hand full of minority's and most of them are always getting called out for doing the same thing that everyone else in the office is doing. Conversation in the office is Often inappropriate, especially from management. Dressing up is used as a punishment if you are Not Green. Seating is used as a punishment for certain people as well. These issues could be for this location only but they need a change in management. I do however enjoy my clients."
bad,"The company is just not ant it was when I started there over eight years ago.  Claims counts were too high.  I know everyone wants you to ""do more with less"" these days, but the workload became staggering."
bad,"Don't work for this company unless you've been out of work for two years or more and are extremely desperate! This place is filled with employees close to management who will report you for the slightest thing (taking too long a break, being on the internet) and managers who treat various employees differently. "
bad,"I answered phone calls from people looking for there workers comp check wondering where there were. Processed state checks, produced spreadsheets for adjusters and completed projects for them. Completed state form for adjusters that were filing new claims."
bad,"A typical day is very demanding and extremely Each locations has a different atmosphere, one location in particular has an atmosphere of intimidation. By change if you get on the wrong side of management you can forget about a career at the location they will make it do difficult you won't get out of there fast enough. The location manager will put fear in the supervisors to get rid of you by any means necissary. Managment will make your job so miserable that you will quit or they will fire you. The supervisors are afraid of being humiliated by this manager, who will relatilate with any supervisor who does not obey by demoting them that they will do what ever this manager wants without questions. This particular location is run on fear and itimidation to anyone what does not fit the managers mold. And you can forget if you are African American you don't have a chance."
bad,I picked it up really quickly when I was told it would take a while. I wasn't satisfied with the role and wanted more responsibility. They preferred me to leave than accommodate.
bad,Worst paying company in the industry. Pay raises are rare and a joke. Few advancement opportunities and promotions are not worth the money. They want you to work from home that means 50-60 hours per week.
bad,"Take your chances with this company they seem nice until you start working there and get yelled at and everyone passes the buck and tries to deny"
bad,The only good thing about working here is weekends off. No room for advancement and horrendous management. Pay is okay for someone straight out of high school but not enough to support a household and no raises!!!
bad,Worst place I have ever worked at.  No one is happy.  Most people are job hunting.  Management does not care about the employees one bit. Very greedy ownership.
bad,AJG does not care about the employees unless you are a producer bringing in very large accounts. The support staff are treated terribly and raises are very insulting. Work your butt off for very low pay.
bad,"My dedicated client left the company, I am over 55 and the oldest on my team, they were unable to place me with any other client to match my skill set."
bad,"Gallagher might be the worst investment consulting firm in the US. They are probably the one firm that does not provide its consultants a cell phone or a stipend for a phone. Their benefits and compensation are well below their larger and small competitors. As a result of not taking care of their investment consultants and analysts, they are leaving and in turn, clients are leaving too."
bad,Overworks their employees and does little to try and provide a manageable work load. Assigns too much busy work which takes away from normal job duties.
bad,"Gallagher is all about who you know. The signature saying is if you are a friend of the CFO or friend of the CEO. Leadership alignment is non-existent. Management is by division, which leads to inefficiency and directional differences. For those which appreciate systems and automation the Gallagher environment is not for you, with unstable technology and antiquated manual processes."
bad,"Gallagher is known in the industry by now to pay 30% under the going rate for most positions."
bad,This place is the absolute pits. The worst company i've ever worked for. Managers so far up their own backside and so unapproachable. Far too loud so you can't even hear yourself speak. Terrible place. I went on holiday abroad and didn't go back. Don't even bother
bad,"All this company cares about is the bottom line. Emloyees are just a number .The atmosphere is one of mediocrity  with employees feeling that the company does not care about them , so why should they care about the company. Very difficult to have a sense of job satisfaction working under these conditions . Employees in this office have gone for several years without raises which are determined by overall office sales goals, not by individual performance."
bad,"the pay does not make up for the lack of leadership and direction.  Nothing is done ethically.  Unlicensed employees are checking client policies. morale is lacking.  co-workers are ok for the most part.  Some are the ""pets"" of management.  It's like walking into the hunger games everyday.   Agents belittle staff.  Management belittles staff.  do not sell your soul for more $$."
bad,"I think it's been said in previous posts- Do not leave a company to go to GB. "
bad,"Management is not particularly effective, no communication within the divisions and salary is very poor for the amount of work expected of you."
bad,"The  Gallagher way is spoken in full detail but means nothing. No praise and  no appreciation. If you are related or date one of Gallaghers finest you are good, but the miniute you turn your back watch out. Your position is offered to someone else and you are doing a job you did not apply for or you are out the door. Run!!!!"
bad,"No training, supervisors are at home and do not want to come in to train you. Old system that is DOS based and if you have ever worked at a great Insurance company, you will not like this. You will be given unrealistic goals and work 40 hours is a joke... You will be told if you don't meet your deadlines for reports, you cannot go on vacation. So why even give it to you. This is the worst job and culture I have seen in over 30 years. Run as fast as you can, horrible company. When I had my interview, my supervisor was actually texting during the interview. This should have been my first clue. Just horrible I do not recommend this company at all. They will let you go after 90 days or just use you if the supervisor is too lazy to drive in since she works from home.They will read your email, an answer on your behalf if you don't respond quick enough. HORRIBLE."
bad,"Very poor management. Backstabbers, micro management and very very unprofessional. Not a good place to work."
bad,"Small branch office, little or no support from corporate headquarters. Great employees; however the morale within the office is very poor due to Branch Mgr. - lack of anger management skills, nepotism."
bad,"Management lacked vision. Operated on the ""Good Ole Boy"" philosophy. Highly political environment with a culture of back bitting and stabbing."
bad,"Training is a joke. And God forbid you know more than the person who is supposed to train you. They will not do their job, which reflects on you & then cut you like a stranger. I have never met a group of people who seemed so nice but turned out to be so fake, in all my years!"
bad,Worked 80 hours per week and it still was not enough to keep up with the desk.
bad,Changes in upper mgt have hurt the culture of the company.
bad,"Managers hire their friends. Supervisors have no clue about how to do the job of the people they supervise. Low pay, good benefits. No room to advance so be happy at the bottom."
bad,"The SteerCo team for AUS/NZ are not a great team and are not mature in their decision making. "
bad,Horrible place to work.  12 hour days and the workloads are not equally spread out.  Constantly changing their work processes and adding more and more things to get in the way of you doing your work.
bad,Management unhelpful and had a culture of fear. At staff level everything was fine and the people were nice and kind but the management wasn't good and didn't care for it's employees
bad,"you sit in a cubical all day and answer phone calls from people who have no idea what you're asking them and they expect you to get it done right then and there. the bosses aren't helpful, they just want you to sell policies, however, there is no one to sell to."
bad,"The management at Arthur J Gallagher needs improvement with handling and coaching their employee as well as give them the tools needed to complete their task in a timely fashion. "
bad,"No matter how good you are and how hard you work, if you're not family or friend of family you will be treated like dirt by supervisors who protect the family and family friend culture.  No morals, no ethical mindset, no fairness no matter how hard you try."
bad,"Disorganized place to work, with no systems in place for new hires. No one wants to help nor train. Lots of promises from management but no follow through. Poorly run claims management team and service.  No training on any of their systems. Claims managers who could care less. If you don't know an answer to a question, try to find the answer as no one wants to help you. Terrible place to work. Would not recommend."
bad,steady job but a hostile work environment for employees and management.  Fast turn over no real support for staff from management.
bad,"I worked for GB for ten years before being terminated when I turned 60. I specialized as a property adjuster early on in my career. I had very little liability claims experience. I was hired as a senior property adjuster ten years ago and handled property claims for the first eight years. I worked an average 60 hours a week to keep up with Gallagher Way expected claim load. It doesn't matter how complex the claims get, or how many new claims you get, you are expected to keep up. Management is only concerned with the adjusters claims load. When the property claims decreased I was given senior level liability claims and was expected to maintain the same volume of claims with little training or learning curve allowance. Supervisors and management are only concerned about their own jobs and could care less about the employees, other than how to make themselves look better. I am the third to be terminated that were close to my age range in the last couple years. I would not recommend employment with Gallagher."
bad,"Insufficient training on propietary systems.  Terrible management, no support.  It was a bad fit for me.  Tried to make it work, but could not get the help that I needed."
bad,"Management in IT has no respect for employees.  Management is incapable of making a decision and then blames the project team."
bad,VP and management changed making things bad. Losing accounts because they want you to set reserves for the full exposure on medical only claim so they can take money from their own clients. They build a trend to get rid of good people if you speak up. No African Americans in top management. They have a lot of African Americans adjuster but limited your growth. I personally experience racism from my prior manager and he used a African Americans to chime in. I felt like she didn't want to lose her job.
bad,"Supervisors&upper management never do anything all the really do is sit around or in meetings 4-5x a day doing&talking about absolutely nothing. They won’t coach you or give you real tips to use when your struggling with your metrics or qualities. I mean they’re too busy eating Chinese food on Wednesday’s but don’t appreciate their employees at all. If management doesn’t like you then they’ll find ways to fire you. Management doesn’t know how to run a call center or a business in general. They’re very unprofessional and treat their employees like cattle. They have ONE supervisor that’s actually a GREAT supervisor the rest will belittle you, treat you like you’re disposable, and constantly try to tell you you’re not doing your job when indeed they’re the ones not doing theirs. There’s no room for growth or advancement unless you plan on being the biggest brown noser in that company instead of you know actually working hard and doing your job. There’s one supervisor there who is a complete idiot doesn’t do her job, makes snide remarks, several employees have gone to HR or higher management with serious issues pertaining to her but yet she’s still employed since she’s the biggest brown noser in that entire company. They constantly change metrics and quality scores so you don’t make bonus. They say they’re the most ethical company which is hilarious because they’re truly not. They love to give our callers the run around and no your adjuster won’t contact you and they won’t get in trouble for it because Gallagher Bassett doesn’t care about you or their employees. They give new hires"
bad,Over worked and no respect shown by the management. Blind leading the blind. Managers are rude and claims handlers regualrly signed off due to stress!
bad,"Gallagher is a great employer to work for if you want a fast paced workday with many projects.  Everyday there is something different to work on, in addition to your regular workload.  "
bad,"Too many family members working in the same office causing so much unrest..... Not good for staff moral,  very much them and us! "
bad,"Management can use training courses. They only care about their favorite ee's. Raises are few and far between and mostly gauged at favorites. "
bad,"Supervisors have their favorites, and they have around 100 claims, while others have almost 200 or more. Even working 80 hours per week you could not get caught up. High turn over of employees. Micro management and basically scolded by management. They are more concerned about getting company reports completed, than actually adjusting the claim file. Like others have said run from this place!!"
bad,"I was treated like dirt and if I ever defended myself I was told I was blaming others for my mistakes. I worked hard and would get a pat on the back but immediately would get some sort of reprimand because of something else that went wrong. I was constantly asked by my hr representative if I was stupid and upper management is all buddy buddy with lower management so when this was brought up I was told ""I was over exaggerating"" or ""misunderstood"" or just plain ""yeah just ignore it"". "
bad,I enjoyed the work I did as claims adjuster. The company as a whole is not that bad. Management at that branch is horrible in all aspects of the word
bad,The work/caseloads required is ridiculous. There’s no way to ever be on top of everything. You have to be comfortable with “putting out fires”. Management is just as unhappy as the rest of the employees. Apply elsewhere if you have any other options at all.
bad,"If you have no life and want to work 80 hours a week, GB is the place for you. If you have no problem being thrown under the bus by management, GB is for you. If you can handle the stress of dealing with 150 or more claims, under several accounts.. GB is for you."
bad,"I am extremely concerned with my future here day to day, I do my best to make sure I’m at work on time and I even go above and beyond to help my fellow colleagues. The conditions are starting to become unprofessional and stressful. Office morale fluctuates but its usually on the low end."
bad,Not a very good company to work for very deceiving. No room for advancement. Increases in Pay take almost a year to get if you get one and if you do it's like 1%. Supervisor should learn how to do the job first before supervising others. Little to no training  and as a result of that was persecuted for trying to do the job without  proper training. Supervisor needs to treat employees fairly. Workload is extremely heavy. One of the worst places I've ever worked for could not wait to get out of there.
bad,"Odd culture, nobody speaks, no new starts are introduced, no induction/on job training, hence extremely high staff turnover as no induction, poor leadership and cumbersome IT systems.  This is a pity as colleagues are generally pleasant and friendly, and hours of work are not too arduous."
bad,"Run.... employees are very unfriendly to new [people, almost impossible to get anyone to help you with a task or a question, You are pushed out into the industry with no help and its like trading water with anchors on your feet. I have been in Insurance for 20 years, WORST experience I have every had"
bad,"High case loads, Long working hours, No pay raises in over 4 years across the board, High turnover rate, Low morale.  High turnover in staff.  Goals that are not attainable."
bad,Poor management. When new management took over they let multiple good employees go by making up reasons and even straight up lies about an employee's integrity just to fulfill their own agenda and hire people they wanted working there instead.
bad,"Company is going through major organizational structural issues. No real leadership, no support. Never seen so many people leave on their on will. Maybe one day it will be a great company."
bad,"Terms of the work, it was straight forward. You were pushed to do your best, but often without any direction."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. The management don't even know what they are doing and the staff is always to blame. All they worry about is keeping their contacts and make the staff do more than one person is capable of doing such as 4-5 different things with different companies who all call in and if you don't agree with working in overdrive, you will get a warning. No set people for 1 contract with the company dealing. The training is non existant/self taught from the amount of mistakes you make. The pay is no where enough for the amount of work that is being carried out. You can bend over backwards for them and there is no appreciation. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is free hot drinks. No staff parking and strict break/lunch times with being flagged red for being a minute over and comfort breaks are frowned upon to stretch your legs or take a break from staring at the screen and small amount of the chairs actually support your back (Team Leader chairs) the others are all mix and match meaning by lunch time you have a backache. Good place to start off in sales. Not a long term ideal place to work."
bad,"There seems to be confusion, chaos and misleading direction. Several positions have canceled or put on hold after new Management. There are individuals qualified for the positions that they have been doing months and positions are posted outside instead of promoting within. If they do not promote current employees,  I will leave company and others will leave too."
bad,"Good hours, poor management. No commissions on new business. I was given little to no training and was thrown in immediately to a full workload which was impossible to keep up with."
bad,"Management Off Site. No Policies and Procedures, One, day Training.  Work on your own independently, and the work comes from Excel spreads sheet. The hardest part of the job was No communication."
bad,They just don't take care of the people they serve. if your employer has this company and say you get an on job injury. just get a lawyer because your health will suffer waiting on them to do anything for you. The claims workers have way to many clients so you just wait and wait. Then they will stall and keep stalling while you suffer in pain!
bad,"Have been on a contract position there and so far have loved the team I was working with.  The only thing is that I am rather new to the IDM world and the application they were using for their identity management.  "
bad,"For a company with claims of ""most ethical company X years running"" they have allot of unethical occurrences."
bad,There are many opportunities to learn various tasks; however work load and flexibility of the work environment is not balanced. Management many times not aware of the individual work load. The organization is it self very balance to work for.
bad,This is not a great company to work for. They do not have any room for growth. Management does not help you to further your career. I would not recommend this company to work.
bad,"the workload is completely unmanageable due to being forced to use their ridiculous off-shore callcenter flunkies."
bad,Producers and hired interns are well taken care of. Good service team members are overworked and not well compensated. Service members who are incompetent are moved around departments instead of being fired. Promotions and compensation are slow coming. Not much growth unless you are related to someone. Very frustrating place to work.
bad,"They over work you and don't want to pay if you stay late or come in early. The management lacks training and professionalism. There is no training, they email you instructions on what they expect you to do, but if you have never used the systems how d they want you to succeed!?"
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Management isn't in 70% to 80% of the time.  They work from home while your trying to learn the job and co-workers show you how and then the boss comes back and doesn't like the work you have done."
bad,"Favortism, discrimination, if your not a family member or a friend of a friend you are a nobody an treated that way. Left as fast as I could, BIG OVERTURN!"
bad,"Unable to trust direct management - say one thing then do another - no written follow up"
bad,"ONLY work for this company if you have NO OTHER OPTIONS!!!!!!!!  Performance increases are a joke. 401K matches are withheld until the end of the year,"
bad,Leadership is very disconnected and rarely communicates company strategy and direction. Upward movement is based on who you know and not what you know.
bad,"Management plays favorites. They claim transparency and open door policy but it depends on your personal relationships with them. The office has incredibly low morale and is a toxic work environment. There is entirely too much drama and infighting, much of it perpetuated by managers by pitting employees against eachother. Grievances are not taken seriously by managers or corporate human resources and the person brining the complain is often punished for speaking out. Gallagher managers will lie before taking ownership of their own mistakes and the employee suffers for it. Promotions are based on personal relationships rather than merit. When an employee is promoted, they are seldom given proper training and large claim loads are dumped on them with no direction and no grace period to get up to speed. The training is done by other adjusters with their own large claim loads and extremely limited time to spare. There is no accountability, no trust, and no sense of investment from the top down. This has created a non-stop revolving door with a 58% turn over rate. Raises are seldom given and are consistently delayed past their promised date. Training is minimal and does not properly prepare employees for the handling of complex claim issues. Supervisors have a ""sink or swim"" approach to training new adjusters and you are expected to work as many additional hours as necessary to meet  Supervisors spend more time in meetings than they do supporting their teams and only care about quantity, not quality of work (until they need a reason to nitpick). There is a serious lack of communication"
bad,"This is a fast paced environment with many challenges each day.  Not every day is the same and it's a nice change of pace.  If you are willing to put in some hard work and able to roll with the punches, this is a place you will excel in."
bad,"There is nearly no communication from management to staff.  The workload is excessive and pay increases are minimal at best.  Almost no upward mobility, unless you are related to upper management.  My co-workers are good, hardworking people.  Negative feedback is common, while positive reinforcement is rare."
bad,I spent six years there enjoyed at first. Over the years the org chart and management changed every few months. They hire manament from outside and rarely promote from within. Training is poor and managers are insane and micro manage. They ll use you then chew you up and spit you out. Each org restructure you loose all your time and seniority. They pretend your new and starting from scratch rather than respect ypur knowlege and experience. I saw top talent walking out the door weekly. Thats why they need all consultants rather than direct hires. I needed to work remotely which was common practice in my dept. My car was broke and I showed proof of all the work accomplished. A very common practice and many did same. But this mgr counted it as an occurance. This manager had no common sense and treated people like kindergartners. She d write me up every other week for silly things. One time I carried my laptop shoulder bag into morning meeting. She informed me to leave my things at my desk. However in same meeting one of the original owners of the company always walked in with briefcase in hand. IF U LIKE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS join the AJG IT team.
bad,"I was hired as a Senior Property Adjuster to head and lead the office property claims unit. At one point we maintained three dedicated property adjusters. For eight years I was treated as a valued employee. The property claims business fell off due to costs and I remained as the only property adjuster. Gallagher Bassett increased my pending claims expectations and additionally assigned me senior level general liability claims, which I had little handling experience. These general liability claims included construction defect, property and bodily injury claims. Gallagher Bassett provides no training and I had to rely on questioning other liability adjusters in the office to learn how to handle these new types of claims. I worked 60 plus hours weekly attempting to maintain this newer mix of claims. Just prior to my ten year anniversary I was terminated stating customer complaints."
bad,"They intentionally hire people with no experience and have their training model based off a “sink or swim” concept  the GM is a lowkey r*cist who’s been reported to HR on numerous occasions. It’s cliquey, and instead of focusing on actual concerns of employees or how to better the place, they have food catered in to supervisors and ignore all issues at hand. They intentionally give you a shift that conflicts with things outside of work and have no remorse or flexibility with fixing it. Unless you’re a parent, they don’t care. College students BEWARE."
bad,"There is a large laundry list of problems: poor corporate structure, no accountability, favoritism runs rampant, zero work/life balance. They talk a very good game; work from home, great pay/benefits but the exact opposite is done once you are on the desk. You are expected to work 16-20 hrs a day, 7 days a week if that's what it takes to keep the unhappy clients from going somewhere else. They exhaust their workers and then wonder why the turnover is insane."
bad,"Way too heavy of a work load. Supervisors collaborate together to gossip about employees."
bad,"Great job, terrible managers. Micro managing, Scape goating and inconsistent decisions. The company has the right intentions globally but this isn't embedded at local level."
bad,10 to 12 hour days with salespeople who over-promise and therefore we under-deliver.  The culture was the good ole boys network and full of nepotism. The rest of the employees only looked out for themselves.
bad,"There are many issues overtime requirements. complete lack of consideration of employees."
bad,I worked there 5 years ago had a caseload that was ridiculously high with minimal care from management. Most people leave the company to work somewhere else. There are families working there. There is a lot a favoritism.
bad,This is a “family” company that really only benefits you if your last name is Gallagher.  Benefits are awful and way too expensive.  My team and manager are flexible but that is because I’m lucky.  The retaliation and nepotism here ridiculous.  Don’t bother and find somewhere else.
bad,"Be prepared for little guidance and relying on yourself. This is a great job if you don't want to move up in a company. Unfortunately, they don't care about small groups - not enough revenue. All the benefits producers are men and account managers women..."
bad,Employees came and left before you could even get to know them. The training was basically nothing. You were left to your own devices to figure out how to work the archaic system. They work you like a dog. I often worked until 10pm or later. They still constantly criticized me for not getting enough done. DO NOT GO HERE. Everyone hates it.
bad,The people within the teams are great. Training was meant to be 6 weeks but went on for 3 months. Poor management. Poor pay for the location and role.
bad,"If you like being micromanaged to no end and felt that your contribution is not respected or taken into consideration as the professional you are, then this would be the place for you. Management, or lack of, is horrible. Many layers of  ""chiefs"". They only care about statistics and spreadsheets, certainly not claims, which is what we are in the business for. Pay is below the industry standard, cheap on the time off/holidays, constant 'threats' if something is not perfect, impossibly high daily standards. You must walk on water and then some to make any of the management in this place happy."
bad,Gallagher started out-sourcing their work to India which caused many employees to be let  go including myself.  The company has undergone numerous changes in the five years I was employed with them including no raises at all for the 4 of the 5 years I worked there.  We were advised that we made within the guidelines of our job title.
bad,"They expect you to work within analytic expectations calculated by a computer and do not have an open discussion about how other work factors affect productivity, like mix of clients and new business and renewal marketing time spent. People constantly walk out of the job because of over bearing work loads and no support from management."
bad,"Formerly focused on their customers, but now entirely focused on internal politics. The company grew far faster than the management could cope with and the customers are aware that they no longer matter."
bad,Claims adjuster is as far as you will ever get unless you are family with management. There are no bonuses and you won't get a yearly increase of more than 3% a year no matter how much you work.
bad,"I have learned a lot coming from a small agency and transitioning to a very large, fast-growing agency.  My duties are primarily as Benefit Analyst (underwriting) and secondarily as Account Manager (servicing)."
bad,"After 7.5 years of working for this employer without ever being written up or having a bad yearly review I was fired without notice because of new management with a client who dictated who they wanted on their account. I was told there was no where in the office to move my job, which is a lie, I could have easily been switched with another employee/caseload."
bad,Worked for this company for around 3 months. The management are very poor and supervises as always to busy to help. Wouldn’t recommend if you want job security as there are always people coming and going and I can see why
bad,It is a good place to start a career but look elsewhere if you are hoping for long-term. So many employees are unhappy with the culture change at Gallagher but too afraid to speak up for fear of retaliation.
bad,"If you’re not favored by mgmt., you’re nothing.  No structured training. “standards” are loosely followed. Managers are verbally and mentally abusive. Pay is okay, benefits are really expensive (especially for a company that works WITH insurance companies)!!! Overall, not a great career decision."
bad,The St Louis is the worse place to work. From the office manager down to her team management. as all they do is talk all day.The  office morale is low
bad,"Not worth it. They do sponsor employees for a visa, but Work-Life balance is horrible as they expect you to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week."
bad,You are expected to work many hours and have no personal life if in the Finance department.  Managers play favorites and if you’re a woman forget advancing.
bad,"Work day 8-4,"
bad,"My day consist of communicating with injured workers, employers, clients, doctors offices, legal counsel, WC State Agency to find the best ways to manage the claim "
bad,"Good training, difficult team environment.  Passive aggressive, competitive and demeaning of new technicians.  Numbers oriented with unrealistic and at times vague time restrictions.  More mechanical than challenging or stimulating."
bad,"GB is a challenging work place. The amount of work overwhelming at times, little support and a unsympathetic management."
bad,Arthur J. Gallagher is operating with short staff and employees suffer for it.
bad,"Working for Gallagher in the Midwest was a great experience from the culture to the great management. Being a part of the (Midwest) Gallagher company was something I loved and was proud to be a part of the Gallagher Way. "
bad,"Gallagher San Antonio lacks qualified leadership and management. It's an environment of client comes first, at any cost. Constant travel and long work hours is expected. Training is absent and can be detrimental to growth and advancement for anyone with or without industry knowledge. Turnover is high which places a large volume of work on the existing employees. Account Management responsibility is overwhelmingly high resulting in less client face to face and upset clients."
bad,"I was employed as a supervisor during the Christchurch earthquake and was on an employment contract, however we were informed the NZ Government had overspent their budget and we were told that 150 staff were to be dismissed immediately. It made no difference that I was on contract, I was fired immediately and shown the door. Corporate business don't care about staff, as long as the guys at the top keep their jobs, that's all that counts."
bad,"Management has no respect for their employees.  Feedback was always in a negative tone."
bad,"Low compensation, poor management. I learned a lot as a fresh college grad needing professional experience but saw no incentive to stick around. Very minimal advancement opportunities and it was easy to get burned out on the job."
bad,Health and Welfare practice was not organized or integrated.  Each office was an island.  Internal competition and politics unbearable.  Direction of company is questionable.
bad,Company has a very high pressure environment with very low reward for actions.If single people have issues the entire team gets reprimanded a implementations of actions effect all technicians.
bad,"Worked at this company for 4+ years and never received a raise even though everyone of my annual reviews ""exceeded expectations"". The managers are micro managers that lie/keep secrets and play favorites. The hours are reasonable and schedules flexible but you are only allowed 1 lunch break and for any other break you must contact a team leaf for permission( even bathroom breaks. Save yourself the stress/headache and find another place to work"
bad,"If you are not a sales person, you are considered a second class employee - no matter who or what you do. I did not even know we had a diversity lead until my final days there. There is nothing to make minorities or women feel welcome. Around the holidays, there wasn't even an attempt to put any Hanukkah decorations up (not even the token stuff in the corner). I over heard multiple inappropriate comments about female co-workers and know people's personal lives would sometimes come into considerations when discussing job promotions (""she wouldn't want the promotion, it would mean a move and she has family in the area"", ""it would mean travel and she has young kids"")."
bad,"Workers comp adjuster. Raises in the company have been on hold since July. I have been promised two raises since February. You are constantly overwhelmed by clients, clmts, and increasing workload without increased compensation."
bad,"As an account manager for large commercial risk management accounts, service should be paramount but was not at Gallagher.  All they wanted was data processing to achieve their corporate goals and structure.  They had absolutely no respect for client service."
bad,"senior adjustors had high case loads, weekly claim reviews. yearly training. Management experienced and helpful.  At times, co-workers were very loud while talking on phone. there was no separate conference room for case reviews.  Inadequate conference room for all the employees."
bad,"I took the job offer at this company thinking it was a great opportunity. Nonetheless, it's been a very frustrating transition. There is no real training in place. You constantly have to ask people to help and they seem too busy to sit with you and help."
bad,Co-workers were fun to be with. Hardest part was the management. Hard to work for.
bad,Employees are allowed to yell at each other. Account Assistants are allowed to refuse to do their jobs and when they do its as if they are doing you a favor. Top management has no simpathy for the huge work load and lack of support.
bad,If you have nothing nice to say......I could no twait to resign. That is all I have to say
bad,"Over the last several years Corporate has not 'been able' to provide even COL raises - yet bonuses to senior management have not been scaled back or stopped - concern about ability of senior management to manage the rapid growth of the company and Wall Street at the same time.  "
bad,"If you don't have a bachelor degree, you will not advance. They rarely how from within the company. "
bad,"Most of the day I am processing and reviewing payments, running reports, and processing check runs. The most enjoyable time I have working at Gallagher is learning new opportunity and working with my co-workers."
bad,"Advancement for those in any support roles is minimal, but the sales and marketing people are treated well.  It's not a place for someone wanting to advance their career in IT, finance, or operations management unless it's for a relatively short stay."
bad,There was supposed to be growth and opportunity while bringing in new employees. Instead the workload has increased while there are fewer people than when I started.
bad,"Demands placed on examiners are excessive, including redundant reporting requirements (different reports for different purposes). Every single workers comp examiner worked overtime in order to meet demands. Expectations high, availability of support staff low."
bad,"Management were very clicky and some of the senior members could be quite condescending to lower level staff. Always being sold as a 'great place to advance' when, in fact, it's not really at all. The salaries are also quite terrible - especially given the responsibilities and stresses claims officers have to put up with."
bad,"working from home and in office 70 to 90 hours per week."
bad,"I worked as an uw/broker on west coast in a small satellite office. Home office to west coast out of Scottsdale and everyone on west coast reports to the same boss in Scottsdale. She is out of touch with the satellite offices. The support is not there and she relies too much on the person who has been at that office the longest to be her eyes and ears, even though they are not in management. This person was dishonest and did not report truthful information to our boss. This was due to insecurity, felt threatened, ego, negative attitude, a miserable person in general.  Horrible to work with and no support from boss or HR."
bad,I received little training on the technical parts of the job and was dinged at audit of my files because no one taught me how to code them correctly.
bad,"Acknowledgement of your hard work will end at your immediate supervisor which is bad because this is not the person who is in charge of raises and promotions."
bad,I was given little to no training and often told to do things differently each time I did them.  Was unable to get a handle on the expectations.  Great benefits but very high stress.  I think other offices may be different.
bad,It is all about who you are friends with. My supervisor was a liar who lied to cover their hide not caring about how it effected any one else. The will throw you under the bus w/o a thought. STAY AWAY!!!!
bad,"At first they appeal to your personal goals and then with turnover and management constantly changing , your path charges too and then you just have to make a decision to choose yourself over the workload you’re not being compensated well for."
bad,"For an international company they were incredibly poorly managed. The culture was quite terrible due to everyone being very overworked, high staff turnover and little support. Unnecessary reporting made it even harder to get things done. There was a lot of favouritism among the management team. The company was always trying to come up with tactics to improve the culture but all it did was force people into doing activities they didn't have time for."
bad,"The job was very stressful, the other employees were sometimes cut-throat and did whatever they could to undermine another employee or get another employee in trouble.  I would not recommend working there."
bad,"Very stressful-be prepared to work long hours. Huge turnover, no rewards. Pay was fair, however, working in excess of 50 hours a week was hard. Never had the same caseload very long."
bad,"I enjoy my co-workers and the vendors. The incentives are great as well.  I just wish they would have better TEAM programs, make everyone feel included."
bad,"Depending on which position and what you agree to in your interview will determine your tolerance. Advancement possible for some. Management needs work. Majority office low morale is due to management,load, and compensation. Schedule is flexible."
bad,"From the time you sat down at your desk in the morning til the time you left, you were busy. Workers comp is very interesting and I like being an adjuster. I got along with everyone."
bad,"Loved working there for first 15 years, but workload was too much for me to handle; very high stress with lots of change in systems/procedures constantly"
bad,"Managers have no clue to what agents do and do not pretend they want to learn.  Not sure what any manager does besides go to meetings and worry about lunch.  Managers are known to lie on you and to your face. The work is easy, but with changes every other day it make the job complicated and the team is over it.  The bonus incentive changes just as much as our daily tasks and has left most of the team not trying to attain it.  Highlight of work is interacting with each other because we care."
bad,"Set up claims, pay mileage, 3 point contact, filing, prepare for audits internal and state and answer the phones.  Mail correspondances and open mail."
bad,"Learned some great skills, not the best culture, some decent people, not the best training though. Lack of job training was the main negative."
bad,"First job out of college and there's little to no opportunity for advancement. Management doesn't care about your career. They'll just use you for 90 days during their busy season, then dump you for a more experienced, qualified candidate. Sometimes management has closed door meetings with your other teammates. This place may look good on paper, but a completely different story inside the workplace."
bad,Poor management; poor training; and extremely micro-managed. Manager of UA's is extremely unprofessional; relies on other employees to train who are not equipped to do so. Spends a LOT of time watching each team member's performance; has favorites. Job culture is poor - morale is low.
bad,Gallagher day was pressure to complete your diary and contact on new losses and the many other demands placed.  Gallagher would change a procedure and make sure all would acknowledged the change then turn around and change the procedure again.  In the 2 years employed I saw so many employees terminated with great knowledge in the industry to be replaced by younger and not experienced.
bad,"Working in sales is very monotonous and can be very stress full. "
bad,"Worked for this company for 7 years but promotion was not given to next level because I was not one of them. "
bad,"The Miramar, FL office is filled with excessive gossipers, clicks, loud noisy co-workers, backstabbers, and nepotism. I was floored by the conduct of employees at this location. Management would not get involved, being that several employees knew how to skillfully kiss up to management and the VP and they fell for it. You also need to be bilingual to fit in, if you're not, you're set aside. Once you're no longer working there, the so called friends cut off contact."
bad,"A very tense environment between employees and very ""clicky""."
bad,"Working at Gallagher Bassett Services was just ok. A typical day at work was completing tasks as quickly as possibly before much more work is given for completion. What I learned is don't stay at a company too long, its not healthy. Management isn't the best and needs revamping immediately. Workplace culture isn't great as they expect 100% from their employees but don't give them the time or tools to do the job effectively. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work you do for the low wages. The most enjoyable part about of the job was the coworkers."
bad,They don't give raises every year even based on merit.  Very disorganized and no guidance/training  given. I would be cautious applying/working for Gallagher.
good,"Gallagher has limited advancement from a Supervisory role."
good,They don’t offer structural training. Benefits are horrible and almost no work/personal life balance. Expected to work hard for average pay. Would not recommend working here.
good,"Not a bad place if you want to sale insurance.  If you want client support and advancement/growth opportunities, not the place you want.  Most of the people are good.  All focus is on those that sell."
good,"GB's culture indicates family first, but it does not follow that rule, the work load is about 60 to 70 hours a week, you are expected to work at home nights and weekends to stay current."
good,Plan on lots of work and little support. Raises are sporadic and small. Taking a vacation is hard because of the amount of work you have waiting for you when you get back.
good,"Unless you are on a dedicated Account, you will answer to multiple Supervisors as to the numerous accounts assigned to. Work life balance is none existent, the more you work to get ahead the more work they put onto you to keep you down. Everyone is overworked so the factor of a back up person to assist is not existent .. that is a person that is treading to stay afloat as well .. too much work and not enough employees .. the case load is unreasonable on a multiple account desk. "
good,"DONT DO IT........ Your just a number there and all they care about is revenue, retention and revenue.... You don't advance, raises, what  is that... the medical is horrible no choices.  You use 3 or 4 programs to finish one task its Repetitive... I feel like I have gone back in time 10 years."
good,I found myself to be over worked and under paid. The job was exciting and interesting. The loss of several employees in our unit led to my below average views of the company.
good,"Very bad morale. Micromanagement. Very high pendings. The job is not possible on a 40hr work week. Very high manager and employee turnover. Everything depends on what client account you get on, a good account and the job isnt so bad, a bad account and you will be miserable.  They do not allow you off a client or to apply for promotions while on a problem client as to not 'upset' them, but do not care at all about the happiness of their employees."
good,"The job as presented to me was not what it turned out to be.  I was promised certain training which I was not given and the expectations from me after being there such a short time were not fair."
good,"The morale at the Plano office was low. There are supervisors in the office who lack any training in Human Resource issue and will ultimately find themselves the target of litigation. There is no room for advancement and the client is always placed before the employee in terms of chance of advancement. Raises are infrequent and minimal. Tyrincal clients are pampered at the expense of employees despite the clients agenda to break the contract to move the business to another TPA. The file now lack quality because of the intent to drive the audit scores based on the results of the OFFSHORE partners in India who are not claims professionals, merely individuals who are looking for tick marks in boxes and have no understanding of the basics of claims handling. I question a company that hires a search firm and then pays that firm to declare the head of the search firm the best candidate for the position."
good,Work pace is extremely fast and employees are micomanaged every step of the way.  It is not an employee friendly enivronment and requires lots of overtime at night and on weekends to keep up with assigned workload.  Management is not very helpful and does not stand behind their employees.
good,"I was part of an acquisition and I am currently disappointed with the outcome. What keeps me looking forward going into work are my co-workers.  We are group of team oriented people.  Currently the commute is the hardest part.  We moved to a new locaton and it is not only far, but the traffic.  I feel like my life is being taken over by my commute."
good,I worked at this company for a little over a year. You were not allowed to have lunch or do anything with anyone but your group. If you know more than your manager they belittle you and treat you with no respect.
good,"Used to be family oriented, but has changed very dramatically. It's all about work, work, work...without the proper amount of employees. It's more like 3 jobs placed on one desk/ one employee."
good,"Fast past, able to resolve most issues in the office from my Network and computer training. All around person for this office the go to person to get issues resolved and stream line the work flow."
good,this company pays their employees with healthcare benefits beginning day one. Many opportunities for growth to include working from home.
good,"Gallagher is one of the largest TPA's in the Country. However, the work load requires long work hours. "
good,"Claims Managers consistently bully and threaten employees. Rather than offering support and training, managers take pleasure in the failure of their staff."
good,"Good place to work to get started in the insurance industry, however it comes with a price. A lot of emotions in upper management, too many disagreements with staff and unwillingness to convert to new systems. Turnover is rapid, seems like a revolving door. Good place to get your feet wet in the insurance business then move on. *Boston office*"
good,"No room for growth even when told growth was availabke. They hold 401k  employer contributions until end of the year so if you resign in the middle of a year, you don't get any 401k   employer contributions. Pays below average with other brokers and refuse to hire more staff. Management poor and favors younger employees. Acquire a lot of companies but don't give back to employees."
good,I have learned alot about insuring pools but have decided I prefer to be in more of an Account Manager position whether that be in the insurance industry and out of it.    
good,Co-worker are friendly.
good,"Typical Company & Management where no one can understand the company values, takes decessions without the employees confirmationand tries to implement on them forcefully.No job security."
good,Large company and they compare themselves to Fed Ex. Your job is very specific and there is not a lot of flexibility and individuality. Benefits were good.
good,"Over worked - Under paid due to being under staffed."
good,"There was a lot of turn over in management and in employee and client retention."
good,"They throw you into work you've never been trained on, & then later when you make a mistake they wonder why you didnt do it right. They pick favorites"
good,Great company to work for. The culture is a family feel. They really train you to be the best sales person you can be. You will meet a lot of amazing people here.
good,"The culture of the office was great, the people make it easier to come in, but the teams are structured where the account director/sales lead is the only one valued and projects are pushed onto the analysts and account management with no support from the account director. If you aren't a sales person and you're newer, you are paid poorly with no structure on how to advance in your career. There is little to no training. The Medical and Dental benefits are ironically terrible for an insurance broker. They need to re-evaluate their attraction and retention strategy."
good,"Raises for an entire department are dependent on 4-5 sales people making their goals. If the sales people don't reach their goals, nobody is eligible for a raise. No raises in 4 years I''ve been there."
good,"It can be a fair employment. However, I had personal reasons for leaving. Regional supervisor is great, would have loved the opportunity to advance. But there is limited advancement in the Birmingham office."
good,GB was not the right fit for the skill set I have. The account requirements and demands could be met with a lower case load. The co-workers were all very good to work with.
good,"Company lacks structure and governance. "
good,Company demands are at times oppressive.  Much of Senior Management consists of Consultants and have no insurance or claims experience.  Company rarely gives merit increases
good,Was busy every day with tight deadlines and at times understaffed.
good,Arthur J. Gallagher has taught me a lot about the professional world and given me valuable experience in accounting. After being there for 6+ months I've noticed that it's a great place to start your career because you learn a lot but they have no intentions of trying to keep valuable employees for long term.
good,Conceptually great structure and mission. Failure in execution and practicing what they preach. The Gallagher way tenants are promising. I wish the company could deliver on what they lay out to do.
good,"Good place to work if you’re in the right department. Wishy-washy management. But fun work parties and they enjoy celebrating. Willing to teach, but dishonest competition"
good,You never know what the day may bring and the work received. Some days the providers give what is necessary to assist their claimants to get the care they need. Other days require a lot of building and research to bring the provider's request together.
good,"Depending on management, the moral and culture fluctuated.  Overall it was a nice place to work.  The claim loads are ultimately what effected the overall moral."
good,"Insurance is a client focused industry, Gallagher is more focused on Procedures.  Work load is more than can be handled.  Individual offices do not work equally."
good,I was with Pro-Source Financial prior to them getting bought out by Gallagher Benefits. The transition went smoothly with little culture interruptions.
good,"Management changes, high turnover, high stress. Management did not back up their workers. Too much office politics. Was able to work at home. No advancement opportunities."
good,"Gallagher is highly ethical, people are honest and sharing with information. However, there is no career pathing, management consistency on treatment and mentoring, no salary raises in three years, favortism is not controlled and management opinions count much more than operational ee's."
good,"A typical day at this employer was busy and productive.  I learned a lot about the different types off businesses and what their particular needs were as far as insurance was concerned.  Management was ok, but it could show improvement.  The workplace culture was nice.  I particularly liked the people that I worked with, as well as the vendors and customers.  The hardest part of the job was the continued meetings.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the staff and being able to help the customers."
good,They do not have enough staff to make your job manageable.  200 plus claims is an average which is too much to perform at a high level.  Spend more time putting out fires than actually knowing your files.
good,You will work long hours and be expected to put more into the job than is required. Clients will call up asking for things that need to be processed immediately.
good,I had a great experience working for this company. Through my experience with the company the collaboration amongst team members is excellent. The hardest part of the job is gaging multiple personalities for negotiations on the daily basis dealing with client/claimant contacts.
good,"Resources and opportunities are good depending on the area of the company.  Benefits and pay were competitive.  Culture was sales oriented, not team oriented."
good,"Co-Workers are great, Management accountability is from another state. Doesn't feel responsive to the local office. Very small office so you must have the ability to adapt."
good,"Best part of the job is helping injured workers and communication with clients. Also, working with other team members is outstanding. Very caring and helpful employees."
good,"At Arthur J. Gallagher, there is little room for growth or employee recognition despite it being a 23,000 life company."
good,"A good employer, but the job is extremely demanding and often requires significant amount of time after hours to finish up work"
good,"It’s a wholesale banking project. I worked primarily in the capital markets domain of wholesale banking.The role is responsible for development, maintenance and support of ATLAS/GBS family of wholesale banking products used by major European banks for treasury, cash management, position management and payments. I have started as a team member and then became a team lead for the captial markets application. application is very tough at the same time interesting to work and learn as well."
good,"A typical day is the same as any other TPA, very fast-paced, high standards and demands. I've learned that you have to have a system to succeed in this industry and to maintain balance. I telework, so there is not much interaction with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that my clients change often due to caseload changes with other adjusters. This makes it difficult to develop rapport and really get to know and service your clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people."
good,"Day to day basis, claims adjuster will review and investigate new losses, including 3 point contact, the injured employee, employer and medical provider. Examiner's determine compensability following investigation and pay benefits as deemed necessary and per jurisdiction. Depending on type of claims being handled, litigation experience is a must."
good,"-Busy, multi-tasking was applied"
good,"Low salary considering the high work loads, pressure of reaching targets of what they want completed and the cost of living constantly increasing. "
good,"+ considerate of parent workers"
good,Work is good when the claim count is low. Suffered personnel losses and claim count increased to unmanageable levels. Supervisors did not get in the trenches to help you dig out of the whole the entire office is in. They continued to work eight hour days while you were expected to work 10-12.
good,Some management was not fair and worked off the Good ol boy system. No real room for advancement for Claims adjusters. You are kind of stuck in that position
good,"I was the claim manager of the Rochester, NY and responsible for the entire operations of the office. I dealt with training of new employees, handling HR issues and coaching and mentoring the staff that I was responsible for. "
good,"If you have prior Gallagher's experience and you know THEIR systems you should do ok. If you are new to them, do not come here expecting any training but be ready to produce or service any accounts assigned to you from day one.  Even my hiring supervisor  told me when they hired me that the salary was no negotiable because their work week is only 37.5 hours is a lie!  From the 2nd week on, I was expected to be in the office almost 45-50 learning on a obsolete computer system as well as learning about my accounts. I spent a lot of time doing online training to learn on my own since in the San Francisco office they offered no training in public entities department and since they are too busy with their own accounts, you will not get any training.  The office is super quiet, everyone is always busy...so as a newbie you will need to figure things out on your own. No one has the time for you, but yet you are expected to go out do presentations on your accounts that you barely know. If you have commercial brokerage experience and have used EPIC you might be better off that coming without no training. I was so excited to work for them, but they turned me off since they were not willing to do any training."
good,"For better or worse, one thing to keep in mind about Gallagher.  Your pay and work load are heavily influenced by by the client, so each individual will have a different experience based on which branch they work for.  "
good,The side of business I was involved in had its limitations for personal growth. The pay was not the best either. Although I met many people that i would become lifetime friends with.
good,Gallagher Offsore support services private limited has a start-up like environment. its a fun place to work with lots of extracurricular activities happening.
good,"Typical finance role reviewing variances, preparing for budget and forecasts.  Size of the department is extremely large for what needs to be accomplished which shows."
good,"It's a busy noisy, full of dirt on a ship repair. I learned to ignored the unpleasant environment and focus to my responsibility and make it perfectly complete and safe. The management do not provide a good and descent accommodation to  the workers, the hardest part of the job is when the ship has no place to duct, and we the workers will go to the distant location on the sea and do the survey of the damage part of the ship. And the most enjoyable part is when I went home and find a better and good company to work with."
good,Run before you can walk. High work load. Below average pay for licensed professionals decent entryway.  Great starting point. Stability is possible but not permanent The TPA business isn’t for everyone.  Micromanagement and high turnover are the biggest issues. In the TPA world GB is on the better side.
good,"I handled a personal lines book of business which included everything from writing new business to processing renewals and endorsements.  I also took 1st report claims."
good,You must dress appropriately. This job teachers what it is like to be in a professional work environment. The Management is a little dysfunctional the people who are not in charge know what their doing and the people who are in charge are clueless. The hardest part of the job is it can be really fast paced and you will be super busy all day. The best part is some days it is really slow so you almost get a free day.
good,The management in this place is horrible. They are very unorganized and do not have a training program for new employees. They let new employees learn from their own mistakes and none of the managers can answer questions when help is needed. I have never worked for an organization as bad as this one. Run far away.
good,"Great company for the field of Employee Benefits Consulting.  Hands off work environment, self motivation a plus.  Strong teamwork, good benefits.   Great location."
good,the hardest part of the job is to coordinate different departments in different locations. The most enjoyable part is that you always have something new to learn because the company is so big.
good,work harder than most and it is not appreciated and advancement is little to none;  a great deal of favoritism and hard work is not recognized regardless of tenure
good,"You'll meet lots of really great people at Gallagher. That said, this is definitely a place you should CYA."
good,I was a part of Reconciliation Team in Finance and Accounts Department. During TAT we used to perform Bank and General Ledger Reconciliation. I learned lot of Reporting work and also trained many new recruits.
good,Worked aat this company as a contractor. Let Mgr know I was interested in a full time job offer. They disregarded this and hired someone from outside the office despite my good record as a previous employee with this company.
good,"Great salary for mundane work, few chances to advance and poor management. "
good,"Ability to work from home was a plus. "
good,"Not the best experience in my career, however was able to learn to use Oracle."
good,No work life balance.  60 plus hours a week required just to meet standards.  People are nice.  Pay is average for the position and experience level.  Benefits are average for the industry.
good,The workload at this office is what you would expect from a large brokerage. On a daily basis you handle current client needs as well as planning and preparing for upcoming renewals. The strain on the office comes from the corporate organizations push for new systems and offshore resources. These changes corporate emphasized causes additional stress on top of the daily expectations of the position. The work environment at this office can be daunting as the workers have different expectations and often the message from management is not the same for each individual employee. Without clear goals the office can sometimes seem divided and everyone is not always on the same page.
good,"Gallagher Bollinger is a new company entity.  Bollinger Insurance was pruchased by Arthur J. Gallagher in 2013."
good,Women are hired to be secretaries and nothing else. The people at my level were very friendly and smart but management would not promote women.
good,This company has its good points and bad points. The benefits need updating.  They balance work/life pretty well.
good,"Worked remote. Excellent set up at home and great  clerical support. GB is a good company and I had great supervisors who were very supportive. Upper management was out of touch and had unreasonable expectations. I had  my review and got exceeds expectations. My raise was 1% and I was told that was the maximum raise. Work loads increased and I was working "
good,"balacing the work load as there was a lot of work and limited time to complete it all. "
good,"Typical day would consist of receiving new loss, setting them up the losses, contacting the claimants involved and obtaining statements.  "
good,"i worked with gallagher bassett for about 6 years prior to leaving and working as an independent contractor; i learned a lot while working with the company and had a number of clients in chicago and also nationally; i was extremely underwhelmed with the company when it came to salary; i only received one raise in the six years i worked with the company and kept recving promises of a pay raise, like holding a carrot in front of me, when asked about better pay; i worked diligently with this company and could never get fairly compensated; while in between assignments, i went back to work with gb and found most things hadn't changed; glad for the opportunity to work with them and know that i left in good standing but can't get over some of their internal practices that borders on deceptiveness"
good,"The benefits are horrible. For a company in the insurance field, the health insurance offered is horrible. Also, there are very few options for career advancement."
good,"My branch is very busy so there is always something to do."
good,"Typical work day- Good"
good,The most significant aspect of this company is the availability of flexible remote positions. An experienced candidate who works well independently will be able to enjoy success.
good,"They may not acknowledge it, but if you resigned previously they will never interview or allow you to come back again. It doesn't matter if there was no ill will or you voluntarily resigned."
good,please see other reviews that have been submitted as they are mostly in line with one another.......
good,"For an 8 hour days with of work, we are expected to do a lot of task.  For example we have to answer emails that go into our general email.  We also have to answer the phones and help customer with any questions or on line issues they are having.  In addition we have to do our accounting job which includes AP and AR."
good,Good work life balance. Limited Career Paths. Small onsite workout facility. Cramped office. Leading company in it's field.
good,"There were highs and lows just like any other company.  There were some outstanding people and some really unethical, ungrateful people just like any other company."
good,"As Gallagher's are now one of the leading insurance brokers, I would contact existing clients and offer our healthcare services to them. and help with any other queries the customer may have. if the customer lied our current service and wanted us to look at the healthcare for them, then I would take a few basic scheme details and get a consultant to contact the customer as and when they required"
good,GBS is an ethical employee benefits consulting firm that has many tools at their disposal.
good,Great group of people but salary is lower than comparable positions  in the industry market.
good,Bollinger was great place to work prior to acquisition by Gallagher!
good,"It's your typical help desk position along with learning and working with new programs/software specified to this particular company. My co-workers are helpful and great people to be around in and out of the work place. There really is no hard part to the job, more so frustrating with some things as in any other help desk job while troubleshooting. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make someones day by fixing a stressful problem that an end-user is having. Another enjoyable part is being able to easily speak with other managers and get advice on what you can study on your personal time to advance in the IT field."
good,"Positive reinforcement, and clear goals and expectations"
good,"A tough company to work for, but rewarding at the same time. Great support staff and peers."
good,"got too work and had two computer screens, management pushed you to do the work of two or more people, I learned about insurance coverage, my co workers were nice. Lunch was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"HCM / HRIS department great, Gallagher family leaders really cared about employees and business advancement , however senior leader of HR will smile and appraise you however she has a knife in her hand waiting until you turn your back."
good,Manager didn't help you when you had time days off to get you coverage for your store you had to I personally had to find my own coverage when I wanted days off after working 3 -12 hour shifts because the hours are from 8:00 to 8:00.
good,"I would say the company could be a lot better if they took better care of the workers. They hardly offered any"
good,"My company was acquired by AJG, and I left before we were fully integrated. For this reason, I do not know enough to give a review, so I am giving all 3s"
good,Gallagher is a third party carrier.  Depends on what account you work on whether you will like it.   Some account what more control over their claims.
good,"The work culture is great, little supervision where I'm located makes it hard to understand certain practices, but very family oriented and the flexibility is great."
good,"The benefits there were great, management was good but the training was not very structured. Your expected to abide by strict rules of the company. This seem to be the main daily objective of a new hire. I was hired during the holidays and a busy renewal time so no one person had time to properly train me."
good,Not a bad place to intern but they definitely hype it up to be a lot more than it actually is. A lot of down time and some days when you're not really sure what your purpose is.
good,"The company has a great work at home program but they do not focus on outcome of claims "
good,Co-Workers and Management extremely nice. The hardest part of the job is having people complain about every little thing and the work load at times can become very overwhelming.
good,"A Typical day a work:Each day handling workers compensation lost time claim.Each lost time claim is different, Management: management was pretty fair. The hardest part of the job:Sometime stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job :Working with  good team of co-workers."
good,The hire ups make a lot of money but don't give bonuses to support staff who helped them get their bonus. You do not get a raise based on performance as even worse off employees in same title all receive the same raise...totally unfair if you are an excellent employee. No Christmas bonus either which makes you feel you are working so hard for nothing.
good,"Average office experience, pretty cool management great learning opportunity: there are some good quality employees with a lot of experience although opportunities for advancement are limited"
good,"I was a contractor, so my relationship was different, but overall my experience was fine, the people I worked with were professional.  Not enough work to go around."
good,It was a low wage position. Like all corporate  jobs they do not pay you your worth and they treat you like a slave. I wouldn't work there again. Location in STL was nice.
good,"To be fair, your experience at Gallagher will vary by the client that you have.  This is a TPA environment, the technology is old.  There are good people that work there, and they try their best, but ultimately, it is difficult to keep up with the demands of the job if your client is high touch like their many self insured or captive clients.  "
good,I learned to work on large risk accounts however I feel that is all I learned. The culture is not very pleasing and raises are few and far between. I loved the colleagues I worked with but management is another story. It seems the only way to advance was to be the office tattle tale. My manager in particular was extremely inappropriate and several females demanded to be removed from his team as fast as they came on board. I would not recommend this agency to anyone.
good,"A typical day is very busy it is difficult to get your job done within a  reasonable amount of work hours.  Management changes constantly within the office and through out the region.  There is little support staff available.  "
good,"A typical day is processing and delegating work."
good,"I learned many things from AJG."
good,"Too many growing pains for where they are at. High stress environment, lack of follow through from management promises. Lack of a cohesive team atmosphere."
good,"Micro-managed. I was out for 2 weeks for surgery, the disability paperwork was not completed timely, so my whole;e paycheck was withheld over the July 4th weekend."
good,"SENIOR CASE MANAGER"
good,"Managed a new high profile account.  Constant contact with account contact, attendance at mediations, and very hands on client.  Learned a lot.  Not your typical 40 hour a week job."
good,honestly a place where if you do your job they will be pleased with you contribution.  Management appreciates my hard work and willingness to take on any task given to me.  very micromanaged
good,"My review I will keep to my self I will not say anything about this company. What I was promised and for what I did their I never was treated so unfairly, That's all I want to say"
good,"When Gallagher took over, they brought their own IT Dept. with them and we were all let go.  We were contracted back for a short time to complete data conversion."
good,"I had a good manager and team and enjoyed the group of people I worked with, which made it an overall good work experience. I left because I saw little room for career growth, especially if you are not part of the intern/extern program. Good workers don't see adequate raises as they aren't on the fixed raise schedule the externs are on which can result in high turnover."
good,Working from home helps meet the needs of the clients.  Captive Accounts are very demanding and require hand holding and constant communication with the clients.
good,"I have been with AJG for 10 years full time in the accounting department. Over the last 3-4 years things have really gone down hill. Company is growing but cutting on compensation, no bonuses and a 2% salary increase every other year ( maybe if you are lucky).  Management does not care about the employees. Just a 'get your work done' mentality. Only pro is the flexible work from home offered to senior staff, which is helpful to offset the increased commute since they moved to Rolling Meadows."
good,"Good place to work, medical benefits could be better. Typical work day consist of servicing clients and analyzing benefits. Some management is great helps you to excel, others can be demoralizing"
good,"good place to work, safe place  , but salary benefits are very less, long working hours and less benefits."
good,"Typical day consisted of lots of phone calls and setting up losses, negotiating settlements. Co-workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the mail. Most enjoyable was the co-workers and managers"
good,"Typical day is very busy, must be able to multi task. Friendly work environment. Co-workers are always on hand to assist when needed. Claim reviews, and frequent daily diary are the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is definitely working with the clients"
good,"I worked with an extremely nice team, who were always willing to assist with queries that we came across."
good,The employees that work at Arthur J Gallagher are good people. They are committed to their craft and helping the company.
good,"A typical day includes working with multiple clients (15+ a day), processing renewals, certificates, accounting, and over all account maintenance."
good,"8 Hours shift with just 45 min break,"
good,This company changes its values more than often.  The way employees are treated is deplorable. Benefits are expensive and confusing.
good,Large commercial insurance broker still significantly managed and influenced by the Gallagher family.  Nepotism runs rampant.  Find ways to remove older employees to hire younger and cheaper employees.
good,"I worked for a wonderful Manager.  The people there are very nice and helpful.  The location is wonderful.  They have both indoor and outdoor parking, and restaurants in the building."
good,"GB has a great pay structure and some wonderful perks including usable technology, decent supervisors/managers and all the boons that come with having vendors constantly soliciting your business. However with this comes the darker picture that after the honeymoon period you will take on not only your own casework but that of your departing colleagues, to the point of doing two people's jobs eventually.Though all claims jobs are busy, you will not be able to share your job with others while sick or on vacation and will find a 50-60hr workweek is the norm even for management. Some supervisors will go the distance to help but do not expect miracles because they, too, are pulling 55hr workweeks and doing billing from home every night. The service they sell is good but they just don't hire enough people to do the job without taking shortcuts or hoping certain things, like taking full recorded statements or investigating vs rubber-stamping overbilling by various vendors, don't come back to bite them down the road. When it happens the adjuster gets blamed despite the fact the office turned a blind eye to constant shortcuts that whole time, as long as closing ratio was good. Clients catch a lot of these too. Those hired tend to be quality people but too much is expected of them and the good ones eventually leave despite the excellent pay because a 6 to 7 day workweek isn't realistic long-term. Perfect job if you are a single workaholic or have the time to devote to climbing the corporate ladder to the exclusion of much else."
good,The people at GB are awesome. The benefits are comparable for the industry. Expect to work long hours to keep the caseload from escalating. Not a very good work/life balance but this is true of the industry as a whole and not specific to GB.
good,"A well managed company, with a strong family focus and good work ethics."
good,Not the best company in the world to work for. Co-workers are great but the typical day of work is nothing to write home about.
good,Good insurance brokerage firm with outstanding talent pool.  Autonomous working relationship with managers which promotes an excellent environment for persons of extraordinary talent.
good,"A very productive work place, teamwork was good, friendly company to work for, problem solving is a must know, customer service business."
good,My company was acquired by Arthur J. Gallagher a year ago.  I really enjoy my coworkers and learned so much moving up through various positions.  Being bought was an interesting experience and taught me a lot about working for a smaller company versus a larger one.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people make a plan for their financial future.
good,"Fast pace environment and continuous multitasking daily.  A lot of interaction with all levels of management. Extensive contact with branch office management, billing staff and with retail agents."
good,"AJG took Barbon Insurance over. My role changed to IBA Team leader. I had to quickly adapt to managing staff that had previously been co-workers."
good,A pleasant work environment with enjoyable coworkers and a helpful manager. In the past year I have learned basic accounting principles related to to transferring funds across accounts using journal entries. The work place is extremely fast-paced and demanding. Management has been helpful in helping to reach daily deadlines and achieve department goals.
good,Hard work with too many interruptions from fellow works who would rather visit with each other or the vendors. Co workers constant complaining about their work load and others.
good,Enjoyed working directly with the client. Pleasant workplace.
good,There is a very positive working environment and a lot of ambition within the company as shown by recent growth and the move to new premises.
good,"Learned about Agency Management System, and I believe this is more challenging than direct vendor payment."
good,"Being new to the insurance industry, a mentor is very important to ensure success in this job."
good,"I love my managers and coworkers. However I easily work 12 hours a day normally, and 18 hours a day typically. Plus 8 hours a day for days off. And my salary is no where near appropriate for this much work. It is non-stop."
good,"Constant pressure"
good,Trip MATE is a very fast pace environment. The supervisors are very helpful.  The employees are helpful also.  Good teamwork.  Communication between supervisors and employees is good
good,Like most companies has its pros and cons.  Team leaders and management are approachable. Staff targets and rewards are changed often. Some opportunities for advancement.  On-going courses and assessments to gain points towards your CPD.
good,The company provides opportunity to grow and learn within your position. However the hours were not flexible at all and they were little to no company get togethers. Company culture has gone down over the past few years due to lack of increases and bonuses.
good,"This was a contract position to migrate SharePoint material to BMC Remedy.  This was only a short term contract, with only a few thousand documents that required moving."
good,"Work load is too high for one person to handle"
good,"Overall my experience with GB has been positive.  Coworkers are very kind and helpful.  Management is approachable and easy to talk to.  The ability to work from home is great and I truly appreciate the ability to do that.  However, despite that, work/life balance is still difficult if you have a family, because the workload is simply too high for one person to do without working several hours and burning themselves out.Especially, if you do a good job and have demanding clients."
good,"Over all good company to work for. But I don't agree with how much control direct leaders have in regards to employee career path. You won't get to move up if your manager needs you, and you mainly only move into roles your direct leader decides benefits them."
good,"the training program and incentives during training are brilliant. the supervisors and management are approachable and easy to get along with."
good,"Company is doing well, load a lot of work onto employees who are underpaid.  Advancement opportunities minimal.  Fair amount of turnover in my department."
good,It helped me to realize that this was really what I was meant to do.
good,"I was involved in a very small operation within Gallaghers, so my review will not reflect the main scheme of things. There was a good working environment, but due to limited opportunities I was forced to move on if I wished to progress my career."
good,I enjoy the job but the current workload has been overwhelming me the past 8 months.  I really don't know why the program is forcing me to write more about my time at GBS.  It is not that best or worst job in the world but with being there many years I have decided to explore other opportunities.
good,small but nice professional office with friendly staff; independent work supervision with assistant; expectations of 100% closure ratios for liability claims. Some stress associated when time taken off for holidays etc. due to continual work assignments and targets while outside of office.
good,Management do not let to see you grow. They have a lot of turnovers. People come and go a lot with the company. Branches are sometimes shutdown which can leave you without employment.
good,"Friendly team, knowledgeable employees, work schedule not flexible, heavy work load, some management skill could be improved upon by the management team."
good,"In two different roles at Gallagher, I learned that the year mostly is centered around the ""busy season"" at the end of the year when most health insurance plans renew. This part of the year can be intense and stressful. At every other point, all employees are truly dedicated to delivering the highest quality of work to our clients. The office generally feels resistant to change, even though it is generally known as one of the better brokerage houses in the Seattle area."
good,"Coming in with no experience, I didn't know what to expect."
good,"I had a very positive experience until the company reorganized and I was laid off,  The office is dedicated to customers services, but they expect just too much from their 40/week to AVAILABLE 24/7 since the company is a global network,"
good,"I have learned a lot at Gallagher; such as proper phone etiquette, customer relations, how to determine what is considered Time Sensitive documents and how to do Recoveries on returned checks.  "
good,"The job was very involved with high level responsibilites, it paid well, but wasn't recession proof."
good,"I worked for GB for 14 years, and loved working for them. I loved my co-workers, and though the job was face paced, we still took the time to reconnect through potluck and fun office activities."
good,Nice to work from home. Lots to learn in a fast paced environment. Team atmosphere with support from everyone. Many training and learning opportunities. Potential for growth.
good,Good experince to start out. Great training program but it is not for everybody.
good,I enjoyed working here. I worked in the Renewals Department. This department has deadlines which needs to be met. If you enjoy a challenging role then this is the job for you.
good,"This company is very reputed in Pune and in US, its work culture is very great, i am in insurance process, my co worker is very supportive, i have a great team, we enjoy a lot during the shift hours, "
good,"Good, strong corporate culture, more like a big family than a big publicly traded company. Poor local and regional management."
good,"If changing careers this a great stress-free gig. The 401k match is phenomenal and the atmosphere is chill. You'll enjoy the carrier/brokerage luncheons, the staff parties, and the early leave near holidays for sure. Flexible schedule is great for new parents."
good,Gallagher Bassett is a great place to work. They provide lunch and CE classes on a regular. I've learned a lot of the years and enjoyed my work experience at Gallagher Bassett.
good,I often inputted construction surveys regarding employees safety in the workplace. They educated me on excel and helped me update their online website.
good,"This was contract employment that lasted 8 weeks.  The work included travel to out of state work sites.  The company paid for and made the travel arrangements and paid per diem for meals.  "
good,"My work at Gallagher was a  temporary job so I can't tell that much, as far as what I saw it was a good company, I heard my co-workers saying that they have good benefits but like I said I was a temp."
good,Would still be there is I had not been laid off - hard working people who strive for excellence work there.
good,"I love working at Gallagher, but the company is down sizing. Gallagher bought Pronto Insurance."
good,Empresa que crece en el mercado del seguro pero veo poca preocupación sobre quiénes pertenecemos a ella Falta un importante depto de RECURSOS HUMANOS
good,Apply only if you can pick up really quick after being taught once.  Take good notes and do not ask any questions. Run to another company otherwise.  Employees go to lunch with management and if you are not part of the group they tell others you do not play well in the sand box
good,i have really enjoyed working at arthur j gallagher and would recommend it to anyone looking for a career in insurance. good work life balance
good,"Working for Gallagher is great and I have nothing but great things to say about the company, but when it comes to the branch level, corporate doesn't get much involved and allows for the Branch leaders to control everything.  These leaders are Account Management who aren't leadership material and are not great at managing people but they are great at managing their clients.  You are also overworked and underpaid.  Way too many internal policies and procedures that take precedents over client's which is a struggle when client's needs should be your priorities."
good,They need more people for the work they wanted done. I worked in excess of 80 hours a week and they know there is an issue but they gathered the slave driver concept vs proper management to fix the issues.
good,"Good people - hard to define growth in career and path"
good,"If you want a stable job, decent benefits, starting salary then this company is for you. If you want to learn, grown, advance and while doing that increase your salary, well....steer clear of this organization the! You will not be there for more than a few years if you don't advance/get pay increases. I was in the same job for almost 8 years, and only received cost of living adjustments. Management has no communication skills, especially the executives, no loyalty to long term employees and talk out of both sides of their mouth when challenged. Sales producers and especially interns get all of the treatment. Special treatment always go to those who make more money for the company than those who don't. Bark loud enough to the higher ups, you will always get your way if you are on the sales side."
good,"I worked for the family law attorney.  There was never a dull moment with the case files; however, I felt I needed to leave as he was approaching retirement age."
good,Good place to work remotely. Good pay. Benefits are expensive. Management isn’t great working remotely.  Didn’t see potential for advancement. Less than 40 hours a week required.
good,"Good people in Austin, TX"
good,"Area managment is weak and political.  Stressful demands, but really a top notch brokerage to work for all in all.  Very qualified co-workers, and opportunity for advancement.  Compensation is high compared to competitors."
good,"I  enjoyed working for Gallagher Bassett.  However, the work load resulted in my working long hours, weekends, and sometimes during my vacation time.  Had it not been for the long work hours interfering with family time, I would not have left Gallagher Bassett. It was a great place to work and I had great co-workers."
good,"Definitely a pay for performance culture of which I agree with and am familiar with.  This is not a place for someone looking for 'a job' just to pay the bills - requirements and job demands are strenuous, but rewarding if you excel."
good,"A company that is always growing and expanding via mergers and acquisitions, little organic growth."
good,Worked with various departments throughout my time with Gallagher.  Enjoyed working with my fellow team members and others throughout the years.
good,Always logged in and no time to get your work done.  Management does not appear to have your back and only adds more work to your plate even if you are a top performer.
good,As the Identity Access and Technology Lead my day to day goals and objectives were the following:
good,"People here genuinely LOVE what they do!  Their excitement about the Insurance Industry and their Clients is contagious. They don't get bogged down with bureaucracy, which is refreshing."
good,"This job is for you if you do not mind a desk job and taking phone calls from all different type of people. 12 seconds in between each calls. Average 60 calls a day. It is an easy job. You are trained so no experience necessary. Hours are not flexible. No sick days. Only vacation days. Health insurance is okay. They feed you a lot, haha, so get ready to gain weight."
good,"I worked with a national liability insurer, recommending claim reserves based on liability and damages evaluation and completed detailed status reports to the carrier with reserve and settlement recommendations."
good,Location was the main reason for my employment and the salary at the time was satisfactory. Pensions were taken away when I reached my 5 year anniversary and that was my main reason for applying there in the first place.
good,"Setting up new claim, establishing proper reserves, investigating claim and making a liability decision. Making contacts with insured drivers and claimant with 48 hours after claim was setup. Paying or closing files based on investigation."
good,"Small Canadian Branch, US based, good atmosphere, good people, good management. Work independently, benefits ok, salary low, vacation too little only 10 days to start."
good,"The team that I am in is great, everyone in general is very nice and helpful and everyone get on really well. The hardest part of the job is chasing the bad debtors and the most enjoyable part is when the debtors pay the debts. Kerching!"
good,"Job itself is okay, staff are also friendly, although struggle to see much progression and pay is under what would be expected in a role elsewhere. Although, are able to study for qualifications."
good,"Gallagher seems like it may be a good company to work with.  Unfortunately, when they bought the company I worked for, they absorbed all that I did into their corporate offices, and I found myself out of a job and the end of the merger process.  However, they offered a generous severance package due to the elimination of my position.  I think well enough of the company, though, that I encouraged my daughter to apply at the office I'm leaving."
good,A great experience working with an expert mentor who supported my career growth in working with larger self funded plans in the public sector.
good,Gallagher is rich in resources to assist consultants with meeting the demands of clients. Management works very closely with team members to ensure that client needs are met and support the team's development and growth. Transitioning an acquired firm to adapt to the Gallagher Way was challenging as expected.  The ability to retain acquired clients after presenting and reinforcing Gallagher's value proposition was a rewarding experience.
good,Gallagher provided a good work environment within a small IT environment. The pay scale was not the greatest but the workload was not that great. They were a little behind the time in that they required signatures on a stack of paperwork to move tested code into production instead of email confirmations. In any event it was a good place to work for.
good,"Investigate new claims and determine compensability.  Review, approve or deny medical bills.  Communicate with injured worker, clients, attorneys and coworkers."
good,"Through my internship I am learning a lot. I am responsible for recruiting candidates for the on-call positions. The people I work with are great, and seeing our individuals every day is great. Our client's bring smiles to all of our faces."
good,"Worked 40+ hours a week verifying on the job injuries then setting up medical appointments and worker compensation benefits."
good,"Supported the process by performing Quality Audits."
good,Gallagher was a fast paced environment.  I enjoyed my co-workers and the comdradery.
good,"I learned all that I know about workers' compensation from Gallagher Bassett."
good,"I spent roughly 4 years with the company. I enjoyed working with my colleagues, office management and clients. It is a engaging work environment. There are opportunities to increase your experience. "
good,"The company is good to work for, however, the salary is low compared to other similar jobs in the area. There is often a slow time frame for things to get done (promotions, hiring new staff, etc). My coworkers in my branch are phenomenal. We all put in several hours to ensure the job gets done."
good,"•	Underwriter experience includes: Property and Casualty, Professional Liability, Inland Marine, Environmental Liability, Product Liability, Management Liability"
good,Ability to communicate with upper management very easily.
good,Great pay... loved the freedom of self employment. No vacation or holiday though. 
good,"Management at Gallagher is flat.  I work directly with the area president on a daily basis.  I enjoy all of my co-workers.  I am constantly learning. The area president has over 25 years of experience in insurance benefits that includes health, dental, vision, life and disability benefits as the core benefits.  He has a wealth of knowledge that I am always learning from.  The hardest part of my job would be managing the high volume of work that I am responsible for.  No matter how well you plan your day, there is always something that needs immediate attention that will take you away from your plan.  Our clients include employer groups and the most enjoyable part of my job is helping the employees of these groups."
good,"Ability to learn and grow in different areas of the company. Results focused environment. Management knows how to keep employees motivated during busy, stressful periods."
good,There's always plenty of work and you are kept on your toes pretty much all day. Co-workers were helpful when needed and management praised your good work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with so many tasks and five adjusters. The most enjoyable part was working with others in high spirits.
good,"My day varied based on what was necessary for my supervisor. Sometimes this involved making travel arrangements, sometimes scheduling appointments, sometimes processing expense reports. My co-workers were absolutely wonderful. Many long time employees as they worked for the Gleason Agency before we were purchased by Arthur J. Gallagher. The most enjoyable part of my job was the wonderful people I got to work with."
good,great flex hours and workplace. loved what I was doing-Office closed.
good,"Learned a lot throughout my years there.  "
good,"You were busy from the time you walked in until the time you left at the end of day. Receiving new assignments, investigation of the claims, returning phone calls, emails, paying the bills, servicing the client and the claimant.Co-workers were pleasant and helpful."
good,"Average place to work.  In the Benefit Advocate Center, you are on the phones all day answering benefit questions from employees primarily; but also client HR."
good,"Great starting salary, benefits were ok but changed over time, great coworkers and supportive supervisors, room to grow and work on other projects. Good play to get experience in the IT industry."
good,If your interested in Insurance and tons of paperwork for policies this isn't a bad place to start.  You can learn allot from the people since the majority of them have been in the business for 20+ years.
good,I work from home and enjoy this benefit that Gallagher allows.  I am able to plan  my day accordingly without many interruptions and would consider any position that would allow a work from home option.  The hardest part of my job is having to seek authority from numerous parties in order to handle my claims.  It is frustrating having to wait and follow up multiple times to resolve my claim.
good,"A typical day is working the diary for that specific time-period,  Then,  working the new claims, up to the point that I will need to await all requested documentation, for consideration of a claim payment.  What I have learned is working with the self insured client as well as their insurance company, in order to facilitate the full protocol of the insurance policy. The hardest part of job is explaining policy details that the policy holder does not understand, upon review,  In some cases the insurance agent is requested to review the policy with the appropriate insured representative.   The most enjoyable part is being able to satisfy the insured client and make them happy, if at all possible..."
good,"Provided with up to date technical support, beautiful office and good colleagues. Poor training, and no real onboarding process. Need to teach yourself how to access applications."
good,"Great experience and opportunity to grow as a claims representative. I have learned so much about insurance, policies and claims because of the time spent at AJG. Days vary as it relates to our workload. On a average day I report between 11-16 claims; if we are short staffed that number can move to 20 claims reported in a day. My motto is to take it one claim at a time in order not to stress and that helps me get the job done. The atmospere is usually relaxed and steady; I noticed stress from those above me but I make it my intention to not let it affect how I feel or work."
good,"If you want something steady and consistent, this a great place to be. You will usually work a lot of hours but the workflow is strong thus providing a sense of job security."
good,"Typical workday consists of logging into the network, sifting through e-mails, prioritizing work load, checking in with status of reports from internal consultants and progressing with client needs."
good,"The days at work would be good, some days I would be in the office and some days I would be out in the van doing viewings. I learned how to be a good employee and how to be determined to work. my co workers were good to me they helped me a lot because I was only doing work experience."
good,Working with some of the most experienced project managers in the Agile world. True learning and sharing experience.
good,"The management team are extremely knowledgeable in their field and are more than happy to impart knowledge into anyone willing enough to learn."
good,"I was hired to help with cat claims and started handling new claims in Florida. Received claims, made first contact within a couple of hours and determined if the claim could be fully handled by myself or would need the            RGA's assistance or hire an I/A. I learned about the way a third party administrator handles claims. My supervisor was great but he didn't work in the office. Culture was low key, everyone wore jeans except when a member came in or someone higher up on the food chain came in. "
good,"My time there was an overall positive experience. Too bad my disability reared its ugly head, I could have gone far in this company. If I have to criticize something, I would say that the micromanaging needed to stop."
good,Gallagher offers excellent work environment. Good learning. At time i felt that it offers limited growth opportunity. Management has been good so far. Learned lots of different technologies that I have never had opportunity to learn before.
good,"On the whole my experience has been average. Opportunities for advancement are limited, and company resources to further education are minimal. Compensation is sub-par but reasonable for the amount of work. Lax work environment as long as your deadlines are met (which can be loose at times). They are also very flexible with time off as well allowing for more vacation time than accrued without consequence."
good,Gallagher is a large firm with offices worldwide. The office in whippany nj is comprised of two of their benefit divisions. Culture is great- atmosphere laid back but everyone works very hard.
good,This office was able to provide constant training for the ever changing insurance world. Weekly team meetings are held to ensure the production is streamlined.
good,"The only con working at this company was there was little job security. There was only one account that the company handled. Also, I left the company in order to pursue handling General Liability claims."
good,"Gallagher is an overall great company.  There is a lack of communication and training.  I enjoyed sharing best practices with other teams.  Insurance is a forever growing, knowledge filled industry."
good,I enjoyed working for them. I loved the people I work with. It was a steady pace job always busy. We knew when to work and when to make our jobs less stressful.
good,My overall experience has been good as a first job out of college. I think there is a lack of communication from the management down to other positions. A large majority of the workforce has been extremely helpful and willing to help train and provide advice when asked.
good,"Room to grow"
good,"The workplace is relaxed and people are friendly. Managers are accomodating."
good,"•	Assist with planning, developing and implementing new and revised systems and procedures to improve work procedures, forms and methods."
good,"Industry leader in benefits."
good,"Positive work environment, team players. Good attorney support. Treated well as an employee."
good,"Responsible for large group book of business up to 300 lives, Utilization Reports for clients on a monthly basis with HB 2915 RFP process to carriers, Proposal Spreadsheets for producers and client meetings, enrollment meetings out of town and in town, Eligibility Implementation after group meetings."
good,He did not listen to complaints for the 2 workers compensation adjuster that had to benefit from her work. She was able to what she wanted to do. Adjusters where on their own. Both adjuster quit on same month.
good,"Handled all functions of houses - directing staff for housekeeping duties, class and training duties, all aspects of care for the individuals - food, meds, day programs, doc appts, outings.  On manager's level, took classes, managers meetings, interacted with state and county depts regulating group homes.  Hardest part of job is maintaining interest on staffing side due to the intensity of the work and lack of public recognition and respect for the terrific job staff does."
good,"Creating reports,finding the errors,doing quality checking,doing processing work."
good,"Although, I was always busy and never bored while working at AJG, my position was not as challenging I would've liked. Fellow employees at all levels of the organization were pleasant and professional."
good,"I think my overall experience working there was great and I would have made great strides there. However, there was managerial staff in place at the time that allowed micromanaging and other poor traits of a person in a supervisory role to be the team downfall."
good,"Great management, training and culture. if you need to work from home because of an emergency that are good about being flexible. People are friendly and often find it easy to approach someone with any questions or getting help,"
good,Local management needed to be focussed on the successful integration and support future growth and avoid some of the politics inevitable through such a process. This probably held the business back a couple of years which is a pity as there are some great people there.
good,"I liked working at Arthur J Gallagher, in the department, and with most of the colleagues. I would like to work there again but with a different supervisor."
good,I started on the service desk and then moved up to T2 service desk. I worked T2 service desk for a month and then was added to the Request Fullfillment team where I configure Cisco phones and do purchase orders.  I would recommend Gallagher as a good entry level position to get your feet wet in the world of IT
good,Gallagher Bassett is a place where you are able to meet new people during meetings and events and learn new skills to continue your career advancement however it may be. Opportunity to seek tuition reimbursement and schooling.
good,"You always remember the great people, even if you don't want to remember the over abundance of work and the regimen.  Management tried to distribute work evenly, but experienced people were leaving and it is difficult to not be deluged with responsibilities."
good,"Salary is very low but more things to learn."
good,Gallagher can be either very rewarding or very difficult depending on which team and office you are in.   Overall benefits are somewhat underwhelming with high contribution to benefits and lack of any paid leave for parents. Promotion and salary increase are an overly protracted process with many layers of excess management to navigate.
good,The Tucker office is a very relaxed with great supervisors. Duluth office is more erratic and too many chiefs. High turnover only because of low pay and too many entry level employees.
good,"Typical work day is busy in the office, setting up claims, lots of company supplied training which sometimes led you to have to work late.  Management was good, but that depends on who you are working for.  Sometimes your supervisor is always in and sometimes they work from home and don't return calls and emails go hours without response.  The culture in the office is diversified; it depends on the branch, but most people keep their heads down and just plow through the day."
good,"Overall, excellent experience.  Workload distribution was not always distributed equally on a consistent basis but was fair greater than 90% of the time.  There is a generous amount of time off (PTO), however, inadequate back-up to workload which caused an increased amount of stress upon return.  This in turn was a deterrent in taking time off.  Excellent teamwork among co-workers on a day to day basis."
good,"Small health insurance branch for a large corporation. Small office currently employees eight people. Nice office facility."
good,"Experienced and friendly staff, good work place culture, supportive team and management, flexible, down to earth CEO/President who inspires and encourage"
good,This is corporate driven environment that tries to promote within. They help you grow at the entry level and then attempt to let you grow within the company in different levels. Poor training hinders this though.
good,"Flexible work schedules. However, for a Fortune 500 company, the benefits have been dwindling, expensive for minimal care. Their wellness program also doesn't give good incentives compared to other companies."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting customers objectives as well as working alongside and collaborating my colleagues to form an efficient team.
good,A typical work day is what you make of it - your presence is required especially without an established book.  Showing your personality is what sets you apart from the rest. Hardest part of the job is focusing on a business plan that you create that will meet your goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is earning the sale.  Gallagher has many offices with over 10K employees.  What sets you apart is how well you execute and communicate with others.
good,Great work life balance. Good CEO. Good team to work with. Enjoyed working at the organization. The executive team has good vision for the company but execution could be done better.
good,Gallagher does a great job to try and foster work life balance and is moving in the right direction promoting and providing work from home opportunities.  this gives them the upper hand in recruiting and retaining employees who would otherwise not be viable candidates for employment solely based on demographics. They also try really hard to keep claim counts to a manageable level for the adjusters.
good,"Good company to work, but very large - if you cannot deal with a large corporate structure, not for you.  Management very focused on branch production but still treat you like a valuable person."
good,"Gallagher Bassett Services handled self insured entities such as municipalities, school boards, religious organizations, etc. The claims handled encompassed commercial claims as well as general liability claims.  It was a great platform to learn about commercial and general liability losses, excess carrier and develop relationships with your clients."
good,"A progressive, innovative company which is expanding globally. A great team of quality people who are generally dedicated to their jobs"
good,"Typical claims desk.  Lots of learing and challanges, enjoyable work."
good,I previously worked for Giles Insurance Brokers who were bought over by AJG.  Approximately after 10 months they closed our office.  I did not get a real chance to work with AJG as they were still in the change over process.
good,"Personnel are wonderful to work with, but Corporate America mindset makes it difficult to do your job....customer service.  Increased my computer skills and knowledge of Microsoft while employed.  Management is good and tries to keep morale high by doing office events, lunches., etc.   Co-workers were great to work with and work as a team.  This is a very stressful work environment and the staff is overworked...lots of overtime trying to keep up to date on paperwork required by Professional Standards."
good,"Demanding, but rewarding. Several tools available to succeed."
good,-Busy and fast-paced environment
good,The case load can be a bit high and hard to manage at times. There is a lot of deadlines that have to be met at a specific time frame but once you get the hang of it it becomes a lot easier to manage.
good,Gallagher is a great company but very sales and marketing driven and can be very demanding.
good,Relaxed and friendly environment.  Can work remotely . People  are friendly. Management is flexible if you need time off. The Co is a good stable Co been around a long time
good,Some of the leadership in particular departments could use some training and development in communication and people skills but Gallagher is a great place to work.
good,"Great Culture, and amazing group of colleagues.  The group cares about the clients and continues to perform excellent work.  All of the individuals working here show a sense of customer service"
good,This is a massive international company so each office will have its own feel but overall this a strong growing brokerage with lots of room to move up. They look after their employees and reward performance.
good,Great company to work for. Really ethic driven. Enjoyed working there and learning about the industry. Has great opportunity to grow within. The only thing I did not like was the raises were not very good.
good,"Gallagher Bassett was a very good company to work for.  "
good,"It is a very friendly environment, and the management are deeply concerned with the progression and overall happiness of the working staff. The workload, however, doesn't allow for a huge amount of free time, but if you can handle the pressure of that, as well as constant customer communication, then this job would be perfect for you."
good,"We had access to a gym onsite. A lot of people were negative because of the business being so stressful, they would let it all out to where all could hear and it was discouraging to morale. The management was good. And they were pretty good at solving the problems between employees."
good,Great culture. Very competitive and plenty of room for advancement. Lots of opportunity for travel as well. Senior management is very supportive and wants you to succeed.
good,Gallagher is a great place to work but it is extremely stressful.  The work loads require assistance from other team members who are not knowledgeable and as a result they need routie assistance.
good,"Management is pretty laid back, no micromanaging, flexible work from home options. Not specific to this employer, but handling claims can burn people out."
good,"Learn importance of Team work and having fun while working"
good,"Commercial, Auto and GL claims. Very busy desk, no down time. They allow teleworking. Hardest part is keeping up with the load. Best part is the friends I've made."
good,"AJG has been very accomodating to my work schedule and I am able to work from home."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"This company has given me everything, which includes, timely promotions, and travelling opportunities and freedom and flexibility in work which helps you to grow faster and faster."
good,"If you have a good manager and supervisor, all will run smoothly.  If you have a dysfunctional manager or supervisor, things can fall apart easily. It can be fun going to conferences and dealing with different personalities nationwide."
good,"Great communication with co-worker.  "
good,"A typical day at work includes constant communication with my team, insurance carriers, and clients in order to meet and exceed their desires for their employee benefit plans. "
good,"Sit all day doing policy checks, lots of paperwork, lots of research and figuring out where discrepancies came from."
good,Great Environment and work life balance. you have to adopt to learn on your own. getting access to system quickly is an issue.
good,"Handling claims on behalf of a third-party administrator was both rewarding and challenging. It wasn't uncommon for us to take work home with us, but that's just the nature of claims. Management was encouraging and I truly enjoyed my clients!"
good,"Getting started review emails to see if there are any new losses prepare for, interviews with the employer, make your contacts."
good,"I was a claims adjuster doing claims for a large trucking company.  Once a month I was on call 7-24 and would have to take reports at any hour of the day or night.  I would have to assign reconstruction crews and attorneys to go to the scene of the accidents.  I would get statements from all parties including any witnesses, write reports on the accidents, determine liability, negotiate settlements."
good,"•	Responsible for Quality control audit on a daily basis."
good,"Timings is very good where i had worked, and it learned so much new things as this is my first MNC company, if i get a change to work there i am ready to work but salary should be high...only salary will be the issue"
good,"Maintain direct communication channels with multiple clients"
good,"Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. is a nice company to work for.  Its employees are friendly and team-oriented.  The management is insightful and caring."
good,The folks working here were great.  We also had a good manager.  Very positive leader.  She appreciated you work and had your back.  Limited opportunities for promotion.  High work volume.  Limited training provided.  The staff was the best group of people I have ever worked with.  I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"I had worked there for years and thought I had found a place to finally settle in on. Then a new CFO came through and axed a bunch of jobs including my own. They've gotten into young interns as a means of trying to keep the place moving on and a lot of the work has been going to ""off shore"" development. They're not quite what they sell as far as ""caring"" about their people. In the end, its all about money and where they can cut a corner here and there. I worked with some great people, but this place is VERY unstable. You have to go into work like its your last day, EVERY day."
good,My time with Gallagher was good.  It provided strong learning opportunities and a chance to move forward with my career.  I feel well prepared for my next employment opportunity because of Gallagher's strong training program.
good,"I loved working as a Corporate Accountant at Gallagher. Its a great company with good work environment. I managed the month-end close process, reviewed and analysed the work of offshore team."
good,"participated in 2 programs; one was very interesting doing premise liability and a second handled a desk with 12 lines of coverage including garagekeeper's liability, premise liability, commercial auto"
good,"Overall, a good place to work for the right person. Career advancement available for the right fit.  Great people to work with.  There is some flexibility as well."
good,Typical day consists of wearing multiple hats. I work for a manager who most said was hard to work for. Not true! My boss is a great communicator and really cares about his team.
good,This is a very large agency that believes in the open door policy. There are plenty of training options and advancement. The staff is always friendly and they really care about their employees.
good,Good company to work for.  Management are nice. They are very supportive. It is a fast pace place.  People there are nice.  Great benefits. Office is located in a nice area.
good,Happy and friendly office.  Managment was attentive to employee concerns and made accomodations to keep the office a stress free environment. Good work-life balance
good,Overall very good place to work as I was there for almost 15 years and appreciate the experience.  Worked with a lot of great employees and very professional company.
good,Would continue to work at my current location but i intend on moving down south. Shame they dont have offices there. I really loved the overall welcoming atmosphere of the company. They really try their best to take care of there workers.
good,"you need to be self motivated and at time learn by yourself.  There is no official training done, besides what you speak to your coworkers about.  If you know health insurance and are strong in your accounting skills, this job is perfect.  Excel knowledge is a must"
good,"Gallagher is a very well structure company to work for, self discipline and high standards of professionalism which made me the person that I am today with handling claims."
good,"I worked an 800 line and was on the phone at all times throughout the day, aside from breaks and lunch. We would answer benefit and claims questions with the aid of a paper binder. It was sometime difficult to find the information needed - we could have been more efficient if the information was computerized. I enjoyed the management, co-workers and the customers. The hardest part of the job was meeting a quota of calls. I wanted to be thorough with my answers rather than fast."
good,Company is progressive and fast paced. 4th largest insurance brokerage globally. Room for advancement if talented. The people are both ambitious an professional and the even hold classes in their home offices in Illinois for interns. Great culture!
good,"If you have a supportive supervisor, it is an enjoyable place to work. They are constantly growing, so if you are not good with change, it will be hard to adjust."
good,"I loved the culture and enjoyed the work.  Unfortunately, I had to resign due to a serious health issue with my husband.  "
good,Its a great place to work - lots of options to progress. I feel there are lots of benefits to working for a big insurance broker. The people I work alongside are very professional and I am very keen to progress myself.
good,Great work environment with generally great co-workers.  For a professional role as a design engineer in an R&D environment the pay is on the low side.
good,"I get along with all my workmates very well, therefore it makes my job a lot easier. A typical day would involve me coming into the office at 9am, and sitting down at my desk to begin calling all the businesses in my area to advise them on the possible costs they could be saving if they were to choose us as their healthcare specialist. We do not sell any products, we simply just gather information and ask if they would be interested in the future, for example, when their healthcare comes up for renewal."
good,"Gallagher Benefit Services is a fast paced benefit servicing company."
good,"My Co-workers were very helpful and they gave me help when I needed it, such as in situations where I was un-clear on what to do or un-sure on what was asked of me. The most difficult part of the job was initially learning what I had to do and how I was supposed to do it. I found it difficult to do certain tasks when it involved copying text that was written as sometimes it was hard to read."
good,"AJG is a good company.  Just be cautious with which job you apply for vs. what direction you want your career to go.  Producers are everything.  They do all travel, do all client facing while account managers are back in the office doing all the paperwork.  If you don't see yourself in a sales role but still want to be able to get out and meet people, you may not be able to do that at AJG because you're either a Producer or Account Manager.  Account Managers do the paperwork then hand it over to the Producers to present to the client.  Account Managers don't typically get to attend the meetings.  Make sure you're ok with that?  This is a good place to work if you just want to work in an office all day with no travel."
good,"It was a good experience interms of the culture, work atmosphere, seniors and peers that i worked with. i will definitely like to work again with you if any opportunity strikes."
good,"My daily duties consist of running BACS reports, maintaining account ledgers & policies, verify all transactions and reconcile when appropriate, refund any monies owed to Building Societies/Clients using the RBS Bank-line, manage the weekly cheque run & record all cheques."
good,"Managing national clients, Autozone, Whole Foods, and several other retail outlets."
good,"Worked near Park Avenue, usually worked on a mass project that required going through SEC filings for many companies. Seniority sometimes gave us other responsibilities depending on workload."
good,"Loved the staff and the work. This is a TPA with many types of clients. Each unique.  Enjoyed the experience.  Great location, Old Town Scottsdale."
good,"The greatest part of working here is the ability to assist those who suffered an occupational injury. At a time when injured workers feel most vulnerable, we can assist them through the process to return them back to health and their employment to support themselves and/or their families.  We can define ourselves by what we do and the ability to provide for ourselves and for others is our most essential function."
good,"Typical 9-5. Good company and opportunities for those interested in insurance, sales or other corporate type positions. Good positions for those that do not have degrees, I have a degree for nothing that the company offers which is why I left."
good,"It's good work and good pay, not for someone trying to commute by bus other than that it is good work.Every morning you are expected to get there and start sorting the faxes while answering every phone call and write letters to send out to new clients. when mail comes you are expected to drop everything to help the specifically hired mail sorter to help her sort/stamp/deliver mail. after that you can go back to your piling faxes and letters. your phone calls are many.You are supposed to answer every phone call but you can't put any on hold and if the go through the bounce to your co-worker then your superior. Basically you are in trouble no matter what because the person it bounces to, never answers their phone."
good,"Customer service based, answering emails and calls in a timely fashion. Progressing policies along at their renewals. "
good,I recommend this company as one to build a career. There are many knowledgably co-workers in each of their specialized trade. The advancement opportunities are hard to come by but the salary certainly makes up for it.
good,"Answering multiple phone line ad with clerical functions."
good,"I have recently finished working for Arthur J Gallagher as an Underwriting support claims technician. This has given me an excellent grounding and invaluable experience in working with different types of claims and confidence in communicating with various types of people whether internal or external, sometimes in a pressurised working environment. My daily duties were to record the latest bordereaux that we receive on to the spreadsheet and chasing third party administrators on any files we have not received. Then completing a review and prioritising the bordereaux we need to agree, data cleansing, maintain and to respond with any formatting queries."
good,"Excellent place to work, with management and team members."
good,"Multiple accounts and office, lend to ever changing work experiences"
good,I enjoyed this job because i was bringing a great product with the highness of quality.It felt good to know that at the end of the day i was bringing a product the the customers enjoyed.
good,Good atmosphere.  Strong Management.  Very clear goals and good communication on all levels.  They take pride in their employees and compensate them well.  Community involvement is a plus.
good,Handled claims from sun up to sun down.  It was a very busy office.  Transferred from Illinois to Missouri so gained the knowledge of an additional state's Workers' Compensation laws.
good,GB was a great opportunity. I learned valuable aspects within the insurance industry.  I'm Inspired for what the future may hold.
good,Great place to work but compensation could be better for the amount of work/sales.
good,"The typical work day usually includes tasks such as answering phones, paying bills in-house, completing assignments, opening, sorting, looking up, then e-faxing in-coming mail, sorting through faxes, requesting medical records, sending out itemized bills to the providers that sent them, and digitally attaching images to claims files. All in all, there are many tasks that need to be completed and because of that, the work day tends to fly by."
good,I was very happy working for Gallagher Bassett. My managers were very knowledgeable and available when needed.  The only problem I had here was that Human Resources was in another state and communication was always via email.  I like being able to speak with a person over the telephone to explain my situation.
good,I think the most notable thing that I have found about working at Gallagher is that I truly enjoy my coworkers and the culture that Gallagher has created.  I feel as though my opinion is valued and I enjoy working closely with people that I consider my friends.
good,I am challenged at work. I am provided support in my work activities and can count on fellow workers for help and information. I learned how to work with our clients and service their accounts.
good,Provides continuing education classes to further develop employee skills.  Provides opportunities for advancement.  Also provides opportunities for volunteering and team bonding.
good,"Gallagher was a great place to work. The culture is not like any other company. There is room for advancement although the push to be in Sales is a little over the top at times. The pay was great coming in however, obtaining a raise is nearly impossible. If someone comes in an entry level position, advancement with appropriate pay is very hard to come by. It is a wonderful place to grow your career and learn so many different aspects of the insurance industry."
good,"Ghallager Bassett is a great company to work for. However it is a stressful place and can sometimes take time off your workday for the simplest task which can in itself be stressful as the day seems to be short and you are left to wonder what you did. Ghallager does compensate well and there is room for improvement, I can honestly say they care about their employees and try to do right by them."
good,"Review mail"
good,Daily life would consist of the computer and phones. Customer service is very important. There is a lot of paperwork that you need to keep up.
good,"It has a good vibe and the other workers are friendly, the hours are long and the work is simple, after a while it becomes second nature and it is easy to fit in"
good,"The typical work day is only 7 hours long and you have a strong support team helping you. Management is very knowledgable and supportive. A lot of claims come in, but you are able to handle them."
good,Everyday I learn something new working in this environment with these great co workers. I am always busy and open to expanding my knowledge.  There is a great vibe in this workplace due to the happy individuals working here and the management.  The management cares a lot about their employees and helps them achieve what they want in their career.   The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy claimants.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help and satisfy the clients and our members on a daily basis.
good,The day starts with sending reports on the outstanding tickets to the top management. Daily discussion on the progress on the improvement areas. Flexible in work timings.
good,"You could always learn something new everyday whether it's a new process, a new procedure added.  Manager was always open to expanding your role in the team, allowing you to expand your role."
good,"Employees make you feel like family. Flexible schedules. Pay is pretty good. The department I worked in is still growing, so it present a lot of opportunity."
good,"as a foreigner my experience there was good,don't expect people jumping helping you ..but as long as you are a good worker nothing is impossible,I recommand to all people who want to work here, make sure you leave not too far from the factory and always be opened to learn new things soo far it was a good time spending here"
good,"Good stable company to work for with benefits. The management team is great. Need to be organized, disciplined, and have good work ethics. Need to be able to manage a caseload of approximately 150 files and multiple clients for multiple jurisdictions."
good,You got to put in the hard work to be noticed. Can take up to a year to get permanent less if you can shine brighter than the others. Have many temps come and go but over all people are nice site wide the big man himself William and John Gallagher like to come into factory just to say hello and see how we are. Always growing not just in numbers but innovative as well.
good,The work-life balance is quintessential. You have the necessary flexibility as long as work is being delivered. It's rare to have such a work culture.
good,"Enjoyed the work, was a simple job to get started in, learn how to navigate there particular computer programs as well as Microsoft Word. Consistent day in day out office work. Paid Vacation, Sick Time, Benefits were very good and matched 401k. Overall a great company to work for, just not for me, I prefer to work with my hands."
good,Older staff
good,"My work schedule is 8-3:30 M-F with a 30 minute lunch break and weekends off. Most days consist of sorting through and distributing incoming mail, handling checks, scanning/filing, sending medical information letters to injured workers, working with faxes, and sending bill objections to attorney offices/language interpreting services. This job has taught me the extreme basics of claim handling, and how to pull information on any given injured worker in our network's system just based on a name. I've become more independent in my work style, more relaxed with work, and happier to take on more tasks that come my way. I don't believe I could have found a better management team to work with; my supervisor is incredibly kind and understanding, and my branch manager is very kind. Everyone in the office appears very relaxed, and our dress code policy is only business casual when we have meeting with clients, otherwise jeans and tee shirt attire are acceptable. My job is incredibly easy for me, so the hardest thing I've found myself stuck with is being done with work too early and not having anything else to do for the day, as I don't like sitting around and doing nothing when I can be working, but some days there just simply aren't any additional tasks to take on. I love my job, I didn't know how much I would come to enjoy it. I don't really have a negative thing to say about the company, but the best part about my job is being able to listen to music (if I want to) while I'm working."
good,"I have worked here for over 12 years and have been very pleased with training opportunities, flexible work hours, and encouraging staff."
good,"I liked working with the company- they seem to have a good amount of teleworkers; management was supportive, the learning curve was steep as there was alot of off site management, but large settlement authority and reserving was commonplace."
good,Productive and fun work place with Ping pong Table. A good place with nice management and culture. It does get very busy at quarter ends but it is an amazing experience to work at Gallagher.
good,I loved working for Gallagher.   The staff and management were awesome. I would still be with them If I did not have move to Florida. The workplace culture was wonderful. taking calls from multiple clients employees and helping them with their benefits and enrollments was great.
good,"If you like to work at home, they offer it."
good,"Good company to work,work life balance ,job security, Customer oriented company,management is not good but work enviornment is good and love to work..."
good,Limited work life balance; long hours. Independence in completing work assignments and managing caseloads.  Processes change and often are not communicated until you've completed a task.
good,Fine for transition but ready for move.  Local management was terrible and lead to over 60 percent turnover. Very unprofessional and Human Resources involvemnent.
good,I really enjoy being part of a big organisation and in this company although its a big one you are thought of at a person not number.
good,"•	The key objective here was to acquire new business cases and service a book through the implementation of various methods, which differentiates me from my competitors."
good,"Gallagher is growing company, that cares for their employees. You work closely with other companies and their injured workers on the phone and computer."
good,"I enjoyed my job however the work was a bit stressful, however working with the people I worked with helped make it more bearable. I had a great manager, good clients, great rapport with them."
good,I enjoyed working at GBA. I still work with a lot of the same people today. GBS is not longer with us since AJG sold it but it was a fantastic working environment.
good,AJG's culture is sold and ethical. Working at home a few days a week has been a bonus. I have seen first hand how AJG has grown into one of the largest brokerage firms in the Country.
good,"Great company, with great people. Strives to give their employees a nice work life balance while focusing on a career path tailored to the individual employee."
good,AJG is a great place to work.  They have the tools needed to do a good job.  They are innovative and try to take everything to the next level.  They continue to be an industry leader.
good,"Gallagher, Harnett & Lagalante is a small litigation firm with a large firm practice.  For example, my work has ranged from first-party defense of large disability insurers to employment contract disputes, including confidentiality and noncompetition agreements, involving newly-hired brokers at national financial services and insurance firms. I was also heavily involved in a lawsuit involving a contract to develop a NATO ally’s version of the Patriot missile system, and an errors & omissions coverage case in which we successfully represented an insured school district against a multi-national commercial insurance company. We also represented a venture capital firm and private investors in litigation involving the acquisition, development and management of retail and mixed-use real estate."
good,"Arthur J. Gallagher gave me many opportunities to grow and expand my I.T knowledge. A typical day at work was either good or fast paced with lots of tasks to complete. I learned how to properly manage time, how to troubleshoot many user issues properly and much more. My management was a dream, both of my bosses were very pleasant and professional. The hardest part of the job was learning new technologies and overcoming the obstacles that they might bring, however it was also the most enjoyable part."
good,The company provided me a challenging opportunity and let me grow personally and professionally. I would recommend this company to someone who is up for a challenge.
good,Great learning experience from the loss control perspective. All team members bring a different skill set where ideas can be bounced back and forth.
good,Great people to work with. Workload divided upon a manageble basis.
good,"Great co-workers"
good,Management really cares about their employees.  I really enjoyed the client contact.
good,"Pros – They allow telecommuting, which is the only perk."
good,"Typical Day - High intensity, fast moving, strategy based problem solving. Handle book of accounts and service every aspect of the insurance side of their business."
good,a normal working day consists of being payed fair for a fair days work
good,Nice company to work for with pleasant co workers.  Long drive but the offices were nice and in a good area.  Work levels were stressful however the management would provide helpful feedback.
good,"GB has no training, give you the ball and expect you run not walk. Middle man between carrier, named insured,and GB. Low settlement authority for commercial claims. Difficult dynamic"
good,"Recruited by Gallagher for the marketing of middle market to large commercial accounts with specialty expertise in higher education and construction.  "
good,"A typical day  included signing on checkin and responding to emails, allocating cash receipts from all over the world. In addition, raising and resolving queries and liaison with colleagues from other technical departments."
good,"Self-starter, motivated, was able to complete my work with efficiency and in a timely manner."
good,"Great place to work. Good benefits and advancement opportunities."
good,Its a good place to work if u have no family i did plumbing drywall painting alot of painting i learned alot there but it was taking days n days away from my kids n i didnt have no parents there for me and i started to feel like my kids feel like i did when i was there age
good,Good place to start your career in insurance . Work life balance is good . Salaries are a bit low but opportunity to earn variable pay is great . Management is supportive
good,"Gallagher offers a great sense of security as long as you perform your duties to the best of your ability. The company does their best to operate with ethical means. Unfortunately, sometimes the individual is lost in the greater goal of the company."
good,"They aspire for you to be successfully at what you do. The managers are great and they teach you a great deal. They work with your needs and the benefits are not to bad at all. "
good,"Working alongside Property and Casualty professionals on prospecting, customer relationship, account management, and risk management."
good,A great ethical company that has a throwback seller's mentality at bringing in new business.  Management seems to truly care about a person's success in the company but at the end of the day only really cares about one thing: money.
good,Arthur J Gallagher Co. culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive environment. I quickly learned how to adapt in a results-driven environment.
good,I have worked for this company for 17 years. They are very willing to work with you and help you with your career. I learned so much from this company and it's management and my co-workers. Great work Ethic. I am now ready to move on to another adventure.
good,Provides very good training for new employees; great opportunity to work from home; opportunities to work with minimal to no supervision from home; decent compensation package.
good,"GB Services provides a variety of insurances for your company.  I personally took care of the workers comp claims (small dollar amount, usually $5,000 or less) and the property damage claims that could have been caused by weather, burglaries, etc.  The company works hard for their customers, and you can tell by the way the customers call with questions, and they don't feel intimidated to ask what's on their mind.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for my former boss to do her work.  When she wouldn't, I would get the phone calls and complains directed at me, as if I could make her do her files.  But overall, I absolutely loved the company, and the customers of the Archdiocese that I assisted."
good,"A typical day at work is a busy day, each case is different, employees are different injuries are different. Every walk of life will heal differently as well as treat their injury differently. The hardest part of the job is figuring out which duty is priority, everyone and everything is number. So Everything and everyone is handled in that manner. I enjoy my co workers most. "
good,"I filled in for a Digital Account Manager on vacation. I received excellent training, and support in the role. The Creative team I worked with, and other digital account managers were wonderful and supportive to me. My assignment lasted three (3) weeks."
good,"Gallagher Bassett was a great place to work in regards to money and the people. The people you will work at it makes it great. It is a stressful job but they do their best to help out even with most branches having a party committee, work parties, holiday parties, etc. I moved up through the ranks and so did many peers of mine, they do promote from within most of the time. Excellent training. They really do try because they know each day starts with a injury or more and people are unhappy because you ARE THE BIG BAD INSURANCE COMPANY so outside the employer 99% they dislike you and the fraud begins......"
good,I learned a great deal of skills that I was able to use and contribute to other companies. Management worked with me well on personal life when problems came up.
good,"I could never replace the amount of skills I learned within my 14 years at Gallagher. The staff, the management, the training sessions. They are an A+ company and it shows. My clients and I had amazing relationships and I learned all my skills from within this organization. I became the manager and leader I am because of Gallagher Bassett. I enjoyed every minute of work I did with this company mainly because of the clients I worked with. Their ethics and connections were some of the best in the business. The only issue I had was that because I had strong connections with my clients, it was difficult to move forward in my career."
good,"Gallagher Bassett has a friendly work environment.  Continued education opportunities, management staff approachable. Very demanding position. Growth opportunities."
good,My job was temporary.  Therefore I do not know what benefits are available.  Management was easy going.  Job was fun.  Employers were very nice.  Technology was stilted
good,"Good atmosphere. Good co workers, office promotes a proactive work environment and encourages new ideas. The benefits are not the greatest and the compensation lacks in some departments, but over all good company to work for."
good,Everyone I met there was very nice and helped me out a lot. It is a great environment and very laid back. The people are great.
good,A great company to work for and when the job was over I was very disappointed and I missed the overall work and friends that I had made.  The co-workers were great to work with.  This job was always busy which I enjoyed.  Nothing bad can I say about this.  All of the clients for the most part were easy to work with.  We tried to keep and retain all clients every year and also prospect new clients twice a year at renewal time.
good,"I worked here as a temp it was a great place to work, people are very friendly and supportive."
good,Sifted through prospects and updated the CRM software.  Involved heavily in the lead generation process.  Attended sales meetings and sales calls while I learned and added value.
good,"I help assist ten remote adjusters who work from out of state that handles work comp claims."
good,"I love the people and the management. Unfortunately, the ""higher-ups"" have made it very difficult to manage your daily tasks in the allotted time frames."
good,TYPICAL DAY AT WORK
good,Supervisors and office managers and assistants always helpful and made fair decisions at all times. Fellowworkers personable and helpful.
good,"This company has been good to work for I have learned a lot and I am currently managing several accounts which is what I requested to be able to do when I initially interviewed with this company in fact within 6 months I was given a couple of accounts to handle. "
good,"GB was about the best place I ever worked and that was due largely to the branch manager who has since left the company.  I had to leave because our branch started losing business and my dedicated account.  I was left with run off claims.  The account management department is totally incompetent and that was the reason my account left.  At GB, I had the freedom to handle claims the way my client wanted and I was not chained to a bunch of substandard, corporate partners as vendors.  The compensation was very fair.  It's a man's world though as far as moving up."
good,"I love working here but its 6 month temp , so keeping my options open. I like the states I have been working on for taxes."
good,Gallagher has a laid back work environment however you are expected to perform at a very high level. The management is embracing ways to create more benefits to the employees.
good,"learnt how to handle people and new culture,work pressure. Had lots of fun in monthly outings, Zcube, on floor fun activities. Best place to work for any new beginners."
good,"Normal multi-task claims duty. Always new skills to learn when assisted claims adjusters.  Daily workflow is prioritizing and organizing to meeting all deadlines in an efficient and timely manner. "
good,Supportive approach to developing staff. GB always tried to promote internally first for any positions. GB considers their staff are their greatest asset.
good,I loved the Supervisors and Managemebt. There were plenty of people willing to assist you with any problems that occurred.  Room for advanced with training was encouraged.
good,"My day begins with reading and responding to emails. Once to clinics are open I make my calls to obtain work status and medical records, update diaries, plan of actions and pay bills. I truly enjoy having such great team to work with."
good,"I find that working for Gallagher so far, has taught me many things.  My management will back me up and trusts my work ethics.  I Love the mission statement of the company and the teams that i work with."
good,"This company provided excellent training, maintained professional in all areas and was always interesting on a daily basis. "
good,Everyone works very hard and puts their clients best interests first.  There is a great culture at Arthur J. Gallagher and it feels like a second family.  I had a great experience working there for the last few years and learned so much about the industry.
good,Lot's of opportunity. Hard work recognized and rewarded. Good benefits. Able to tele-commute. Good and supportive co-workers.
good,"One of the best companies to work with, a good learning environment, an equal opportunity employer and an employee friendly company"
good,"AJG great place to work. Management is great and very supportive as well as co-workers. The benefits are great, alot of perks working for AJG."
good,I enjoy working at AJG. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the insureds and assisting them on a daily basis with their insurance coverage questions.
good,"A day in the life of a Benefit Advocate consists of arriving on time at 8am and eager to start the day. Once at the location where the customer service magic happens, my daily agenda was tediously planned out and documented, any voicemails or unread email messages received while away would be recorded as well, and then I began multitasking, handling all things related to health insurance and customer relations. I gained a thorough knowledge of federal and state health laws, policy tutorials, privacy restrictions and implementation, customer retention and satisfaction, HR duties, orderly and timely data recording and problem solving, claim resolution, and became an expert in oral and written communications. Management could be described as the people you  are consistently using as  the highest standard of judgment for the ideal boss(es). A professional environment was always enforced along with a fun and friendly atmosphere employees are magnetically   drawn towards. This allowed for professional and timely work-flow amongst co-workers and promoted a team-oriented workplace. Everyone at A.J.G. was a pleasure to work with, and possessed an enormous amount of knowledge. This minimized the amount of time an employee would typically spend researching and learning related documents/material and how to utilize the skills being taught while on their own because learning first-hand, or hands-on learning is the most effective form. The most challenging aspect of the job was informing clients of negative news and/or outcomes. I strive to be the best. Some might call me a perfectionist."
good,"A typical day at work consists of the follow: "
good,"Adjusted a large volume of workers comp claims, making 24 hour contact with the injured worker, alot of my case load were Spanish speaking claimants."
good,I enjoyed working with for this employer very much. A very professional environment with many opportunities to learn each day. My direct report was very experienced and I learned a lot from them. I dealt with customers on a daily basis and felt a great sense of accomplishment each day.
good,Gallagher Bassett is an amazing team of people who understand teamwork. Supervisory and management teams are reasonable and easy to work with.
good,"The particular department I work for has provided me with a great amount of flexibility that has been wonderful for my family. My only complaint was with how my maternity leave was handled with me being a part-time employee. However, if I had been a full time employee their maternity leave is great. I have no bad things to say about this company."
good,"A typical day at work for a developer may involve a daily stand-up, as most teams are following Agile processes to some extent. Most, maybe all, managers do weekly one-on-one meetings with their direct reports to check in and answer any questions or handle issues that may arise. Everyone is pretty respectful and professional, but friendly and down-to-earth, too. It's easy to feel at home fairly quickly. Some days may have a lot of meetings, and it's difficult to feel very productive on those days, but solving problems on other days makes up for that (like in any dev job)."
good,Great job atmosphere with great management. Always want to give your best!  All employees are treated with respect and you know that they will always have your back.
good,"Gallagher Bassett Services is a great company and a wonderful place to work.  As I  mentioned above, if I could go back in time, I would have never left."
good,"Hace mucho tiempo que no estaba en una empresa donde desde el día 1 de trabajo el ambiente y los compañeros fueran tan agradables, excelente disposición para enseñar las labores a efectuar."
good,"Company provides opportunities to gain knowledge and for growth.  Management was fair and supportive.  One can gain experience by working with various clients and have opportunities for learning.  The work requires one to be organized, focused and have strong negotiation skills."
good,Management is extremely supportive.  Very ethical and professional organization.  Tremendous resources available for personal and professional development.  I would highly recommend the organization to others.
good,"Loads of fun, loads of work. Each day comes with a new learning."
good,work with good people. always have support from team leader and manager. get job satisfaction when you can help a client who may be distressed
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Not all about the numbers but how I can personally grown and bring in my own expertise into the office

good,"my day cosisted of directing phone calls to different agents, filing ."
good,intimate setting. management easy to work with. Great working environment and easy flow of work needed. Great hands on training. Small group of people
good,"I liked working there and the only reason I left was because there was a new manager who had personal issues against me and fired me. It was interesting that he also got fired. I would love to go back there, but that is not an option"
good,"i worked very hard for Mr. Gallagher and have so much respect for him and all of his employees, there was a team at  atmosphere and i worked everyday to meet the goels of Gallagher buick/gmc , customer service was the biggest priority at all times and i never let them down , dealering with the public day in and day out , always making sure customer satisfaction was the biggest priority , what i loved at the end of the day was the customer loyalty and the relationships builded on trusted ."
good,I was employed there for 15 years and wouldn’t have left except we retired to move to Palm Coast and now realize I would like a part time job to give me mental stimulation
good,Good mentoring organisation for freshers to build Proffesional ethics and corporate culture. Made me Proficient in underwiritng Services and team. Building.
good,"I love working in our Liverpool office, it's fun and friendly, its a great place to work. I've settled in well and I'm proud to say I work for Gallagher."
good,"Excellent employee benefits "
good,people at gallagher are nice friendly polite they are easy to work with I perfer to work on Mondays Tuesdays Thursdays and Fridays at 9:00AM to 1:30pm I prefer to work part time at Gallagher in Charlotte North Carolina area
