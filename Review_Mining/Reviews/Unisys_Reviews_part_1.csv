rating,review
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked with. No healthcard, low salary, unpaid overtime and toxic environment/team leaders. Employees are treated like highschool students, with their very strict rules/policies."
bad,"Manager never talk to the employees. It was very difficult to get in and going with the work. It was very difficult to get work ID, login and pwd to get going and without that they want employee to go field and serve the customers."
bad,"Poor management, asked you to do something but next week mangers warn and blame you by doing it. They forgot their words and blame others. Let you go without let you know in advance, like they take you to office and tell you blblblb and today is your last day. Break family peace. Not recommended at all"
bad,"Boring place to work, zero atmosphere of fun, the managers are not supportive or encouraging."
bad,The work was ok and my immediate manager was good. Upper Manager was not good they made changes and did not keep you informed. They didn't talk to you about anything and the benefits were not good.
bad,"Unisys is THE WORST place to work!! Over 25 years experience and only wanted to pay 85,000.  The raises are pennies.  The management care only about being promoted.  The cyber Security field is a joke there.  They worry about getting more work over anything else.  Their SIEM sucks so don't purchase it!! Recommend work anywhere else but here!! If you are in Cyber field stay far far far away from this company!! No progress and not going to learn a dang thing."
bad,I was so looking forward to working here. But ….Not as great as I hoped. I was completely disappointed in the management and contracted companies for Unisys.
bad,Management did not understand the level of expertise they inherited and did not give us the benefit of 30+years of customer Service experience. They did not handle the situation with HPE with any professionalism at all. No help from HR or management transitioning over. They do not know how to move resources to different areas for support to other CEs. They just Lay you off. No security.
bad,"A vezetőség  és sok team leader sajnos egyenlő a nullával emberileg. Arrogancia, rosszindulat, 0 megbecsülés."
bad,"Management does not care about you. No training to perform the basic function of the job. QA's department is there to ensure you do not get a raise, promoted, or ability to move to a different project. "
bad,I wasn't impressed. This company makes so much money but nickel and dimes its employees. They follow the 'butt-in-seat' approach to contracting with the government.
bad,"I'm going to be talking about my experience working in Unisys Malaysia (Damansara Heights Branch). I came in through an employment agency. I worked as a part-time data entry clerk. This is my entire experience."
bad,they only hire for what they can get out of employee. Training and communication is very poor. When they acquire contract they expect new hires to know all to know how a location works no clear instructions or direction.
bad,"management likes to hide issues under the rug and find other ways to bill the customer for work that should already be included in their contracts.  bringing up issues and lack of best practices is looked down upon and results in scolding emails."
bad,"They pick people who are non deserving for higher authorities , and ZERO people management skills ."
bad,"The was a government contractor and the contract was always being renewed , but every October you didn't know if they were getting dropped.  Our HR was our supervisor so if you had a complaint about your supervisor you had to go to your supervisor to complain.  When we finally got an HR rep they just went to the supervisor to handle the complaint."
bad,"I was brought in after the company I was working for transitioned IT functions to unisys. We were offered jobs and it has literally been the worst experience since the transition.  Everything we were told about salary, shifts and scope of work were complete lies. Not only that but all of our communications with users are delayed if we ever get the email at all."
bad,While I was there I was told to take two drug tests and two back ground checks. I was told that I would be working on a certain account and when I started I was put on a totally different account. The so called manager was horrible and the training was awful. We were trained to past an assessment test but not trained for much else. They would randomly assign people to accounts regardless of their skillset.
bad,"Empresa global com excelente atuação na area de TI, excelente cultura colaborativa entre seus colaboradores, dinâmica."
bad,"The company's management is clueless. I've seen so many good people driven from that company due to incompetent managerial decisions.  No focus, no goal, no mission.  I'm surprised their stock hasn't been de-listed by now."
bad,"The job it self isnt bad. Whats bad is when you show that youre competent enough to do youre job, instead of hiring more people. Theyre going to push more accounts onto you."
bad,"I will give them a poor rate bcuz i worked as a contractor and they never gave me a raise and neither do any management responds to my complain for that. They will offer new hired person a good rate and i will be the very person to train them before they start the job and even clean their mess with every job they do."
bad,"Bad leadership,bad Management,bad for morale,no sense or being a team,zero compliments for doing a good job.Unbalanced and unfair assessments of workers.This is just another stepping stone company and people are just numbers that don't matter."
bad,"I was fired for ""extended medical leave"" and was denied rehire eligibility by my previous manager, who claimed it was poor work performance. "
bad,"The only word that comes to mind regarding Unisys, anyway that I can say here is LAME!"
bad,"The work environment was not that great. Working hours is too much."
bad,The management for the desk I was assigned was awful. There was very little support for employees and there seemed to be resentment for any question asked. The rampant favoritism was apparent very early on.
bad,Unisys was constantly downsizing and losing contracts. It did get new contracts but found ways to screw them up. I don't recommend working for them. You wont flourish under them.
bad,"fue una excelente empresa, hasta que hubo unos cambios de en la parte de IT y ahora estan despidiendo a todo el mundo,  Ame esa empresa hasta que me despidieron sin justa causa, no he sido el unico, muchos compañeros, son botados a la calle sin una explicacion digna."
bad,"Bad Leadership"
bad,Would not recommend that you join this company. The worst ever management I've ever worked under. Please do your research before you join this company.
bad,If you work for Unisys you better have some money already. You'll be waiting fro over  a month to get paid. They hire through various contractors. You'll be owed more money than you can calculate and might get some of it eventually.
bad,"Management didn't care about their people. Numbers were strictly enforced, to a unattainable level. Some good people worked there, but management had favorites."
bad,Very nice staff to work with and for.  Very helpful and pleasant with excellent room for growth.  Long way to travel from home  and improving my career was the reason for career move.
bad,I held this job for two and a half years.  I was hired to work with two other technicians but in my final six months two of my coworkers retired and I was advised that there would be no replacements and that there was a moratorium on salary raises.  I found myself on-call 24/7 covering half of Alabama. and on several occasions I worked over 60 hours strait with no input from management or assistance.  This is dangers to the public and dangerous to the employ.  Unisys does not care.
bad,They had me driving all over Georgia but still had to get all my tickets completed . They didn't even give the full amount that your supposed get for the mileage rate. Had to go to different customers locations.
bad,"Unisys Corporation is an American global information technology company based in USA that provides a portfolio of IT services, software, and technology."
bad,"Pessima empresa, sem chances de crescimento muitos palpites em sua area e funcionarios contratando marido para prestarem servico, falta de etica"
bad,"A typical day is to work 8 hours during core hours.  In addition to completing your main job each day, you are also required on a daily basis to work with 500 employees/subcontractors resolving basic issues such as time sheets, internet connectivity, HR issues, company/government training, recruiting, on boarding new hires, and issues with company laptops.  "
bad,"Low pay, looooong hours.  Amount of overtime was incredibly stupid and they still expected you to work your normal 8 hours after working all night.  No advancement, no raises."
bad,"Terrible will start you as a temp worker with promises of getting hired and after they are done with you, they will fired you and never hire you in the end. Terrible & overworked STAY AWAY!!"
bad,Good Company for Freshers . Working as a functional consultant is good experience. Its a 24*7 Project .Working in night shifts and weekends.
bad,"Keep you as a contractor for years and years no way you will get fired because or the rate they pay you almost minimum wages."
bad,"Unisys Technical Services teats its employees like cattle. None of the individuals at the company are important, and high-performing employees are fired over nonsensical things so Unisys does not have to worry about them trying to advance through the company."
bad,"I did not enjoy my experience working at Unisys.  To begin they say that they offer competitive compensation however the compensation only becomes competitive when you qualify for a bonus.  "
bad,"No extensive training is given to new employees.  To sum things up, you show up and for about a week you shadow another employee to observe operations.  Then, you get 90 minutes of training followed by being ""thrown to the Wolves"" if you will."
bad,"Management will push it to get it done in a day..."
bad,Unisys has flexable hours and the managers I work with in past where very help when I decided to uptain my degreel. Currently I am not pleased with Unisys training employees is limited due to funding.
bad,Not impressed with this company. There lack of respect and Micromanagement. I would not work for them again or sugest them to anyone else.
bad,"Fun place to work with bowling parties,Christmas parties,pot-lucks,"
bad,The company is made up of many little empires that refuse to cooperate or share with each other.  Feedback from the ranks was not encouraged in my organization.
bad,"One of the worst experiences in my technician life. Sure, the break-fix calls aren't hard, but it's who you report to who will stop at NOTHING to make you feel uncomfortable and afraid of being fired. First you show up at FEDEX to pick up your parts, then you manage you parts. And on Monday morning you call into a conference call to be yelled at by Felipe,  The NY/CT Service Delivery Manager was the most unprofessional man I've worked for in my entire career. His conference calls consist of him berating everyone and screaming at everyone for 45 minutes to an hour. He was like a drill Sargent. He isn't afraid to use profanity and embarrass you in front of all the techs on the call. When he goes over ""fusions"" (dell complaints) He makes sure to let everyone on the call know who the fusion was closed against and describe it to make tech look like an idiot (and would sometimes call tech an idiot) in front of all other technicians. He would sometimes unmute you to make you ""GIVE ME A REASON I SHOULDN'T FIRE YOU RIGHT NOW!"" on the call with every other technician. So they can laugh at you when you sound like you're about to cry. (This happened to another tech on one of these calls, and he was fired because he ""sounded weak"") All his notifications consist of him using ALL CAPS. So he's not only screaming at you on the phone, HE'S SCREAMING AT YOU THROUGH EMAIL AND TEXT. After that you go about your day and complete service calls he schedules you through a dumb app called ClickSchedule, which would give you the most illogical route possible. There's a reason that the 25 Free Dell Certification"
bad,no pay rises no thankyou for good work only interested in profits for the company no good work life balances and no job security.
bad,"I was a field technician for almost a year doing repairs for Dell. In short, I'd be scheduled either a ridiculous amount of work that impossible to keep up with or no work at all. On top of that, the pay was atrocious and I often had to keep half or more of my paycheck just to be able to afford to work the next week. It was awful."
bad,"If you got placed in UNISYS ...better to select another option for your job. If you rely on this company it will give you a big iron hand.Same thing happened to me. I got selected and waited for joining wasting my 1 year time. Upto now i didn't got any call. They are saying me to wait for some more days. I still don't know why they took me when they don't have any requirement. Plzzz don't become an worst example like me due to this company,...."
bad,"I worked their for two years, very minimal training( Training is considered listening on the phone for a couple of days). Bad management, they do not practice what they preach. Benefits are non-existent practically."
bad,"I would not let my worst enemy work at Unisys. 7 years without a raise . No advancement posabilities, cut my salery 15% moved me to a subsidiary company lost all my company benefits, lost my sick days and my vacation time. New hires worked for 10.50 an hour which are now contract employees with no benefits. Drive 150 miles in every direction to service Dell computers and laptops daily 5 days per week. Mileage was paid but not at the state allowance levels, it was paid at a 33% level and was told to put the rest of your allowable mileage on your taxesat the end of the year. No office , had to work out of my car even when it rained or snowed I had to call all my customers when I was in my car. We had no local regions and had to travel site to site traveling in access of over 200 miles per day."
bad,This was one of the worst jobs I had they under pay you want you to work long hours and give you an impossible schedule. the manager has no understanding or any care for his employees and always threating to fire people thats why their is high turn around rate at the job.
bad,"Unisys used to be a good place to work, but no more. I was there for 18 years. Management tries to copy the competition instead of making its own niche and forcing the competition to copy it. There is zero job security, with uninformed management laying off at random. The company continually loses lots of money. Their marketing department and strategy is the worst, and I doubt Unisys will be around much longer. If you hire on, don't quit searching or burn any bridges."
bad,"The worst experience I have had in any position I have worked. Not ONE management leader I was engaged with did not LIE to me, others, customers on a consistent/regular basis."
bad,This job sucks! Worked for fannie mae and had 3 different managers within 9 months who knew nothing about the job at all! Had to get help remotely from L2’s in another state. HIGH TURNOVER DUE TO THIS
bad,"I had terrible experience in my first day working here.The team leader that conduct my training is very rude  to newcomer like me as i did some mistake in my training.She underestimate my capability to work here and said some rude things to me personally. I get called to work here at Unysis by my agency and I already pass the typing test by my agency company before this, but she blame my agency for sending people like me working at Unysis as she tought that i'm not qualified at all for this job position (data entry)."
bad,"Unisys is not a good company to work for.  Within 3 months after they hired me at a certain compensation rate they cut my pay by over $1,300 per month.  This is unacceptable and was the first of many disappointments and pay cuts with the company.  They do not value their employees.  We are little more than renewable commodities to them; we have no value.  If you want to work for a company that is dishonest and not transparent to its employees, then sign up for Unisys.  If you value yourself and your worth then find another job if you can."
bad,"The manager loves to tell employees they're worthless, just numbers on a spreadsheet. We had weekly meetings to belittle employees."
bad,"Was very unorganized, and because of this, they worked people to the point of no return, causing a huge burn out of the quality people there.  I left the first opportunity that arose."
bad,"IT going downhill fast.  IT has created an environment of extreme uncertainty and stress.  There is no trust in IT management.  The solution to everything is to cut bodies / outsource.  They have thrown away decades of experienced, dedicated staff in a short sighted efforts to save themselves."
bad,A Typical day here would need you to work for 10 hours as opposed to industry standard of 9 hours. There will be cab delays and you will end up spending 13~14 hours in office. No Work/Life balance can be achieved here. You will be begging for leaves and not get it.
bad,I was hired to fulfill a one year contract and was laid off along with 50+ other employees during a work slowdown. While I worked at Unisys I saw many employees that did not do very good work.
bad,"Long Hours. "
bad,"I thought this would be more of a tech support position than a customer support position. Most of what I do is considered customer support, with little technical support. They require you to know a lot about computers but you don't use much of what you know about troubleshooting them here. The place has a revolving door in which employees constantly get hired, stay for a short while and then leave because they hate working here. I have only heard of a few people out of dozens that actually like to work here. The pay is decent but the benefits are horrible. There is advancement but it's something that is not always sought after because of the stress involved compared to the benefits. Most people on my team have left or are leaving because they hate it here. I'm actually considering going back to Wal-Mart after not working there for years because they treated us better than Unisys. If you can find another place to work, any other place, pick that over this place."
bad,Multi layers of management some new technology is utilized. There is a culture of teams spread over domestic and international places.
bad,"I worked for them for a short while. I was made to work overtime by manager and told not to put extra time on my timesheet or ""the company would have to cut staff: ie;me"". The manager had a weekly conference which everyone referred to as the weekly tongue lashing."
bad,The workplace is very dry and not funny. Everyone is a bad mood and one of the supervisor and some of the team resources act like they dont want to be bothered when you ask them a question. Also the client which is capital one is very unprofessional. For a billion dollar company they have alot of kinks in the software that cause problems and it makes it impossible for me to do my job. Other than that this place sucks.
bad,Unisys main revenue is not building computers.
bad,"Unisys has lost their vision along the way.  Due to financial reasons, lay offs are a frequent event under the FUD cloud.  Majority of the employees  (and managers) are worried about their job and hence are working from pay check to pay check.  There is no such thing as loyalty and dedication and wanting to do what is best for the company, only about themselves. "
bad,"It was a job.."
bad,"No work life balance, To Stressful. 3000 - 4000 miles per month on own vehicle. Very Poor mileage reimbursement. No company raises, Case Quota, Poor stand-by pay."
bad,Beware of this company - they hire in Jan/Feb and Lay Off in September. They will promise long term retention and all the good things when they negotiate your salary! but NONE will be delivered and you will be laid off once youve been used and abused enough for the season! I would not recommend trusting this company or ots employees.
bad,"From the start it was clear the contract I had been rolled into wasn't ready."
bad,"A revolving door is worth more than any individual employee regardless of skill, life, ethics, or health. If somehow you slip up even a tiny bit, it will count against you heavily unless you are a good brown noser."
bad,Get dispatched out for jobs on a daily basis.  Do not want to pay for our travel time or at home time when ordering parts and contacting clients to schedule service.
bad,"Advancement, Salary increases, scheduling, special days off are based on your religion, management discrimination, and this for that favoritism.  There is no potential for advancement, only reductions in force and letting those go who they need based on managment who believes they are elevated above others and do not care about employees."
bad,"First off, realize this is a company that only gave 2 raises in my 4 year tenure, but raised the starting wage every quarter. This causes a toxic work environment between employees with years of seniority and new hires. The management hierarchy is not clearly defined which makes getting clear direction/support incredibly challenging. They over hire for accounts which causes layoffs and also has the side affect of making it impossible for them to retain employees when they lose an account. They also do not offer a severance package for those laid off. Instead they offer a few weeks of supplemented unemployment."
bad,"Salary is decent for a call center job, but you are expendable at Unisys. You'll troubleshoot issues that are technical and gain a bit of knowledge, but it will soon become very routine. Unisys doesn't train their employees. They hire people with basic background knowledge and throw them in to start taking calls. this can be very stressful as the help file you are given rarely gives you the answer to your callers problem."
bad,Do not work here at Edwards AFB. Management is terrible. A lot of staff are quitting this job and even taking pay cuts just to get out of there. They will tell you that you will be a Network Design Engineer but you will actually be fixing printer issues. Hardest part of the job is trying to find something to do so you wont get fired.
bad,"Worst mistake I made in my career. I have always been an outstanding performer and leader. Yet, Unisys has a way of putting an end to your ambition. The management is terrible and the products are not selling.  It is a matter of time before this company fails. Its not if it will fail but when it will fail. They build products and then later try to figure out who to sell them to.  No new innovation or ideas. They try to put out products in already crowded spaces and think they can take on the companies who have done this for years. The truth is that most of their technology products are not selling. They constantly push their people to put out new software products thinking that will drive new sales instead of taking the time to do it right the first time and understand the market. Its a development led organization which means that engineers are blindly leading the way.  This company is in serious trouble and the morale is terrible. Everyone is a day away from being laid off if they decide they don't like you. However, they won't empower you to do your actual job.    New CEO does not know what he is doing in my opinion."
bad,"The Dell Warranty contract part of UTS is only good if you are living in your mother's basement where you don't have to pay any bills. If you are trying to support a family, you will need another full-time job to make up for the loss of this one."
bad,"Unisys is a bad place to work, though good to get general trouble shooting experience. The company has limited growth opportunities and bad management on most of the accounts and treat most people as a number rather then a person. The job is demanding requiring to have issues fixed with in 10 minutes or routed to resolver groups with little training provided. Upside to all this is the pay being the best locally in the area for incoming tech support."
bad,a empresa possui potencial pois trata se de uma multinacional porem no Brasil a empresa perdeu muito mercado por falta de investimentos em tecnologia e gestao de pessoas. a filial Brasil fica amarrada as decisoes da sede no exterior e nao investe em talentos.
bad,"If you like pain, no authority and miserable co-workers and terrible management then you will like Unisys  where so much time is wasted in long meetings with no leadership or defined meeting outcomes."
bad,"Performed quality assurance functions such as"
bad,"Their ticketing system is so far beyond confusing it is insulting. Nothing is straightforward, everything is a mess of tangled menus and drop-down boxes."
bad,I was a shift lead computer upgrade and roll out. Branch install of printer and scanners also upgraded software.
bad,"As the DBA I was responsible the integrity of all  business data at NASA Hampton facility. The included backup and recovery and vendor software upgrades. Performance and tuning of code and database. I learned the customer is always right. The hardest part of the job was implementing new database software upgrades to be transparent to the user community."
bad,"I found it quite alarming that a organization who's sole reason for existence..IT outsourcing, couldn't even handle there own. There wasn't a day went by that one of our own systems were down. Customers always got a kick outta the fact that my tools to help them were malfunctioning. Although management meant well they lacked basic interpersonal skills. Walk past them in the hall & wouldn't or couldn't say hello - not even eye contact. Managing processes & situations was always reactive & rarely proactive. Never witnessed any type of root cause analysis but more of ""let's see if this will work"" approach. As for advancement I saw very little - more lateral moves than anything else. This was probably due to the fact that this office is only a small satellite location."
bad,"Sorry if you want to know more about Unisys they look online I am sure there are plenty of info out there, but all I will say is I will not go back to Unisys for any job at all."
bad,Most disorganized environment I ever worked in. I interviewed over the phone twice and was hired - did not meet anyone face to face from the company for 6 months! I met all my objectives and received annual pay increases at the top of the scale and then 2 years later was laid off by my bosses boss. Horrible run company and there is a specific reason Unisys has not been purchased by other companies (i.e EDS and Perot Systems).
bad,"Vezetés. Rosszul szervezett csoportok összessége. Inkorrekt, sunyi vezetőség, igazi multis gerinctelenség és arcoskosdás."
bad,"Very poor training, it consisted of you listening to various reps on the phone and so you had to learn how to use the knowledge bases too be able to help someone at all.  Benefits were terrible, People with families couldn't do it because it was half their paycheck."
bad,"Worked in many positions and worked to be the best at each assignment.  I was recognized for my hard work by many managers, but it was negated by dishonest and unethical managers."
bad,"I was part of a transition for the company Amgen where I was hired to support the Field Agents who sold Amgen's drugs to the clinics and doctors. Overtime, we were loaded up with more work and eventually it became too stressful doing the job of 3 people."
bad,"Enjoyed doing the work, under a government contract. Working for Unisys is another story. Management was good old boy network, would cover for the dead weight and not fire them. Worked for Unisys for 6 years and 2 pay raises. Worked shift work and no shift differential for compensation. So bad, If I wanted to go the company Christmas party I had to pay for my meals and everything. Not a nice culture to work in. Felt extremely under appreciated."
bad,"Company seems to be good. However, the managers are too biased. No matter how talented you are and how hard you work,they only promote people whom they like and people of their religion and caste."
bad,Typical workday is being very overworked as the company demanded to do the most work they could with limited staff. Management often played favoritism making any advancement nearly impossible unless you where their close friends. Workplace was often dirty (not even going to speak on the bathrooms) and they continued to cut back on cleaning staff. Hardest part of the job is knowing what you were supposed to do as the rules would change on the fly depending on who the manager spoke to. The people I worked with are awesome but there is no advancement opportunity or fair pay for your work. Stay way
bad,Surprised they are still in business.  At the time they were not paying reps on new accounts because the strategy called for cross selling into install base only.
bad,In a short detail. This company never kept one promise. That was made when i was hired on. they said special training and a laptop. i never received any of it. then the management was very poor when you ask or need help. they move people from contracts left and right and never bat an eye for someone constantly showing good work. i could go on but that is the just of it.
bad,"Manager treats employees like they are all stupid, likes to remind them they aren't people - just ""numbers on a speadsheet"". "
bad,"This Company has no work ethic, is dedicated to the bottom line of its client base, and completely destroys the desire to be productive."
bad,Company lacks culture.  There is little to no training for your position.  You are left to figure it out.   No one was willing to help.  Most days no one even spoke to me.  Too much Management movement and unsure about which direction to take.
bad,"The people are great, but upper management is only interested in cutting costs and shifting work offshore.  There has been a constant cycle of layoffs for the last 4 years."
bad,"loved working from home, but was very difficult to get assistance from management and supervisors"
bad,"I've been w a lot of gov't contractors, both vig and small.  Unisys has proven to myself and 99% of my coworkers to be the worst.  They'll promise u tge world in the beginning and then let u down time and time again.  Raises, if u get one, are minimal, if any, and if u don't act completely grateful, you'll never get one again.  You only get to ""choose"" from one high deductible heath plan or you're out of luck.  There is NO advancement, and the few whom took on more duties to try, have become burned out with nothing to show for it.  Morale has TANKED bc employees have realized that their own mgmt really don't care.  Unisys has always had the rep of being bottom feeders, and that's the only thing they've delivered on.  Just look at their track records and lack of profits for the last 10+ years.  Very sad bc they're losing good, smart employees left and right, abd don't even try to act like they care!!"
bad,Never again. Nope. Never again. This is kind of a repository for people who don't have much of a future in any industry. Honestly the job only existed because of inefficiency in the service process. It was a nightmare.
bad,"the typical day is when i joined Unisys"
bad,answered calls from titlemax employees with I.T. issues.  Also worked in remote sessions while on the phone with users.  Learned a lot about customer service and being able to juggle multiple things at once.  Management is not the greatest due to high turn over rate.  The hard part is trying to keep 6-10 things moving toward resolution then regurgitating it into the incident ticket later.  Best part of the job was the view from the second floor overlooking the river.
bad,"I can't say anything about the company in general as I only worked in their call center, but as for the Unisys call center, it's like all the other ones."
bad,"Company is on a downward spiral. Is known for going on hiring sprees then laying off everyone. Management thinks it can leverage layoffs on its way to profitability, instead of innovating."
bad,"This is not an enjoyable place to work. You feel like you sit at a desk inside a prison, you are treated as a number, and you literally can't take a bathroom break without being scrutinized (seriously). This is a good place to get some experience and then GET OUT."
bad,"Lack of advancement opportunities at this company are indicative of its' poor middle management strategies. Best co-workers I have ever had, within the worst company culture I have ever experienced."
bad,"Tough place to work, management had little experience. Not a team environment, every man/woman for himself."
bad,gezellige collega's. De werkzaamheden werden steeds gevarieerder. Helaas liet de leiding zeer te wensen over. Werkte voor uitzendburo bij dit bedrijf.
bad,"I was sent by an agency and was told to arrive 15 minutes earlier which I did arrive but the lady who was training me delayed the time even more which portrays her not being punctual towards what was stated the time to begin the training. During the training session, the lady's approach towards me was rude and had a witty sarcasm. (not amusing way)"
bad,"This is a place that accepted me with no IT experience to get my foot in the door to be able to have experience.  Other than that your average day consisted of high stress.  Managers liked to breathe down your neck when a call was going on too long and some L2's would flat out yell at you for being on a call too long.  They never like to actually get problems fixed and are more worried about how long the calls take.  At first I felt the manager I had was on my side and actually trying to help me.  I should have known better.  I was let go because of some conversations that took place over lync or group chat.  Everybody had conversations that were just like the one I got let go for.  It seems like they pick and chose who they want to ignore for exhibiting unacceptable behavior in a work environment and then let the rest go that they don't like.  In that case, the reason I was let go, everyone on my team should have been let go as well as they were all having the same conversations on group chat if not worse.  You also get bathroom breaks which time was taken from your regular breaks.  Being on a water pill for blood pressure they wouldn't work with me on that at all.  Bathrooms are also disgracefully disgusting.  When you're wife literally turns to you in the morning and says ""You were having nightmares about being on a call at work last night"", it's time to reconsider the job anyway.  That's beyond too stressful."
bad,"The culture is heads down , don't see me.  This is from years of layoffs.  This is not a culture that is open to new ideas.  They 'Unisyze' you.  People backstab and are out for themselves."
bad,Company is so old school and stuck in their ways that there was no change for a new product that was released into the corp space from the DOD... no spending on marketing and management was a lawsuit waiting to happen...
bad,The company does not give raises and training on new products and services is horrible. The company tends to work you very hard and does not recognize you for your hard work. Management is horrible and really only talks to you when you are not doing something that they feel that you should. No incentives and no perks to working at this place at all. All the top executives get all the raises and leave the front line to continue working hard with little to no recognition.
bad,when i first started it was very good and right for what i needed however when i had applied for other Jobs it was like they didnt really look at the apps they moved the ones they had already chosen to move
bad,Major layoffs occurred during my time at Unisys.  Leadership is stressed and challenged with thin and shrinking budgets.  Workforce is partly in house and virtual throughout the world.
bad,Management did not meet employee needs on a day to day basis.  Poor compensation for amount of work.  Terrible working conditions for employees.
bad,"Great company to work for"
bad,"useless workplace"
bad,Don't count on any job security. This place is shipping most of their jobs out of the country.
bad,This job pays low and expects high performance. Hardly any training and cannot get any answers from the team. Have to eat lunch while working and has mis-leading information on what your tasks are. Poorly organized managers and not much in getting support.
bad,No Pay advancment No Paid Training. When calling anyone @ HQ you are pulled up by Employee Number not your Name. Company will drop you in a heartbeat
bad,"Although like any job there's always plenty to lean if given the opportunity and have enough time after completing the company required tasks which places the tick in boxes for management. Management at Unisys are no longer concerned about there staff or teams, there only concerned is themselves and nothing more. "
bad,"Aktuell fährt Unisys in Wiesbaden ein Projekt gegen die Wand."
bad,I had a nightmare working in this company. It made us work for almost 12-13 hours a day. It gives lot of work pressure and the management of the company is pothetic.
bad,"learnt how to mind people at my workplace.Just like any other IT Organisation, nothing special.People are ok..do not expect too much.You are what you are and dont try to change that."
bad,"The job itself is NOT BAD..but LOOK!!!!!!! Just know how to repair a computer and what's what when you take the cover off. I had trainees who couldn't tell a network card from a video card. If you don't know how to take a computer apart and put it back with EVERYTHING THE WAY IT WAS do yourself a favor and go somewhere, do something else..WAYYY too many ""techs"" that don't know what they're doing and cause repeat trips for stupid reasons like forgetting to plug in a cable....Management is the real issue...NO raises, NO growth opportunities, Customers were GREAT ( and thankfully understanding). IF management would take care of their good techs, turnover wouldn't be as bad as it is..."
bad,"Enjoy field work and interacting with people and solve their problems"
bad,"The Dell Break Fix technician job offers a low pay high stressful/hostile work environment from your management. It is rare you will ever work an actual 40 hour week and even rarer to get overtime.   "
bad,"Unisys is concerned with their bottom line.  That's it.  They do not care about employees.  Having entered the IT field at an older age (I was over 30), I was shocked to find a company that treated its employees as if they were in high school."
bad,create tickets using emails and by phone calls. Create user accounts via active directory.
bad,"In most regards when you get hired at a job and they tell you "" there is opportunity for advancement"" That usually translates to working hard consistently will get you rewarded. However here at ""Unisys technical services UTS"" there is a Glass ceiling, Let me break this down, there is SSR 1 through 3. 3 being the lowest. 3 is customer service level 1 agent, 2 is technical level 1 agent, and 1 is a level 2 technical agent. Then above that there is supervisor. Once you have reached supervisor level in order to become a REAL Unisys employee ""UIS"" is where the it becomes worth while from a career standpoint. The catch is however you cannot move from UTS to UIS unless you are doing everything short of bribing upper management. Plus the cap of around 12 or less transfers PER YEAR. Do yourself a favor, ask if you are being hired on for UTS or UIS. if its UIS it'll be worth it, if its UTS you might as well just keep looking for another job. average employee lifespan here is 6months or less, the treatment of the employees and the mindset of management reflects this. IE ""this persons problems will only be my problem for 6 months"" It's just plain sad really."
bad,"At first site by 8AM and home by 6PM if lucky. I was able to learn all Dell products which will open doors in you want to move on in the future. You are thrown into the ""fire"" with limited or no help at all and often look ""stupid"" in front of clients if you get the wrong person on the wrong day."
bad,"*There is no job progression or salary increase in Unisys. "
bad,very stressful with high number of rules that did not make sense.  management made job much more difficult than it needed to be.  No give or take in what was to be done.  My way or the highway
bad,Gerência muito arcaica e péssimo salário. ................
bad,"working in different shifts though out the month"
bad,"my experience was with nicole tippett. she was very unprofessional, when in a car accident she was more concerned with her metrics then employees health. she purposely terminated the contract early and violated the terms of the contract early due to a work accident"
bad,I thought that i would be working for great technical company but that did not happen. Back to back calls and the work environment was tense. did not feel valued as a employee.
bad,"Fast paced work environment, friend co-workers and military, alot of classified information handling, and working with the Air Force, what you do makes a difference."
bad,"Managers lost touch with the reality of the task at hand, and seem to  enjoys making the  job harder than necessary by inventing new irrelevant rules on a weekly basis. Co-workers try to help each other  cope with the new ideas until it falls flat and everyone have to revert back to previous way of doing things.  The hardest part of the job is hearing co-workers vent their frustrations and realize they are right and nothing will change."
bad,"Poor, Always understaffed. Never listen to their employees. Constant negative feed back from their vendors."
bad,"I'm looking for a place to grow and advance. Right now I'm in a place where no one has ever received a raise and few have been promoted. It is a very political environment and if you aren't great personal friends outside of work with upper management you don't stand a chance at being anything more than a level 1 service desk agent. I'm so hungry and so eager to be a major asset to any company who is willing to give me a shot. Customers, clients, users, any one I pick up the phone to talk to immediately takes a deep breath when they realize they have a top-tier agent. I wish I was in a place that noticed what they have in me. If I don't make a move I'll be stuck here looking up at the ceiling I hit as soon as I started my first day. On my first day I was pested and hounded to tell how much I make per hour. When I finally broke and disclosed the information, my peers around me jaws hit the floor. Folks who were hired 2 or 3 years ago make either 2 or 3 dollars less than me per hour. A true crying shame. The hardest part of working here is adjusting to the feeling of not having anyone around you can grow close with. Most enjoyable part of the job is exiting the building every day. Oh and employees steal your lunch or just plain throw it away if you place it in their ""place"". Fridge is rarely cleaned and stinks so really there is no sanitary place to store the food you want to eat. Microwaves and sinks are disgusting. Employees here don't care and have many personal hygiene issues. Benefit offerings are absolutely atrocious."
bad,Took too long to bring employees on board.  Lost track of process multiple times.  Kept employees in the dark about direction of company.  Were inconsistent in how they treated employees in same positions.
bad,"Worked here as an entry level IT helpdesk position. Proved myself and got promoted to a level 2 position, but with no increase in salary. It did give me access to tools and experience to land my next job. The biggest failure with Unisys is they keep all their teir 2 positions overseas, leaving no room for career growth with them. Highly recommend starting somewhere else with room for advancement."
bad,If you were not in the Defense Contracting Division it was very long hours and no recognition. There was NO feed back on your work until the yearly review and those were based on your time with the company. Managerial culture was to wring all the hours you could out of the employees and move them out when they noticed.
bad,I mostly just sat at the computer and surfed the internet all day because the stuff I had to work on would only take me about 15 or fewer minutes out of an 8 hour shift.
bad,"Unisys is currently going through a lot of pain (mostly on front line and middle management) because the company is ""streamlining in order to become more nimble."""
bad,I worked remote. Calls come from dispatch. I have a large area to cover. I can be in on side of my area and a call comes in on the other side opposite and they wonder why i can not get there in a short time. May be 3 hrs away and they want me there in an hour.i work as much as 16-22 hrs in some days. Way to many hours in a day.
bad,This job was call center type work. It was very strict and management was held to standards that clearly trickled down employees. We had to keep numbers up regardless if we helped the end customer or not.
bad,"There are good business reasons for out sourcing.  But at the cost of business continuity is folly.  This company has out sourced so far as to have lost its business continuity at many levels.  Day to day operations suffer.  Orders get lost, or ordered incorrectly.  Projects are delayed and project staff are made scape goats.  There are several very hard working people that have laced up their shoes every day to fight the good fight, but their days are numbered.  Unisys sends their people off into retirement with little, or no fan fare for what they say are the lack of funds.  35 years of hard work done by a true professional to be cast out without much more than a card.  A vendor and staff paid for the send off ourselves.  The facilities have not been changed since the late 80s.  The hardware and software is very dated.  Middle management is so deep that most decisions take far too long for review.  The folks in the trenches need real help, but the message gets diluted in transmission."
bad,I really don't have much to say other then I have outgrown Unisys and I am ready for a change!
bad,"Job culture at client side is very good,Latest systems and peripherals are available.Good knowledgeable persons are available.Dot knowledge about EMC  storage and Mainframes.Co-workers are very cooperative."
bad,"I would come in and get turn-over from the earlier shift, have and issues or special runs discussed. I would follow the scheduled processing, check equipment, and run programs."
bad,"I have made many friends here, but none of us have a good experience with the management. This place is always changing things around with poor communication, poor support (L2's BS'in instead of responding to questions in chat) etc. Gotten to the point when something is pretty bad, we call it TUW, ""The Unisys Way"""
bad,"UNISYS has plenty of room for improvement in the space of Account Management, training, promoting and management."
bad,Unisys got rid of nearly all employees over 50. I was recognized for performance and received bonus pay and got additional Over Time. The environment was very high stress and high pressure. Nothing you could do was ever good enough. There was never any compassion or understanding. Everything is micromanaged.
bad,"This job started out like a dream, but shortly after being promoted it became a nightmare. Once I moved to my current position, I began to learn what was needed without training. Once I excelled at my normal duties, more duties were added. This all fell on me, as my only co-worker refused and quit shortly after. Since then, all work has been going thru me. Although, there are 2 onsite managers that refuse to assist."
bad,"Acabe  las practicas de DAM este año  y  muy mal, estuve en el call center hablando con clientes en ingles y algunas veces en francés.. y bueno poco mas , 8 horas asi y 300 euros.. No dan opción a quedarte ya que quieren a ingenieros..."
bad,"Poor pay for the work. Very poor management that doesn't care for their people, only their stats. You will be a number here, not a person. They are losing many accounts and this facility looks to be closing soon. Be warned."
bad,Challenging financial performance and has increased stress on the working environment.  Numerous reductions in force have limited ability to solve business problems and recommend solutions.
bad,The mailing department was poorly run. There was constant drama due to managements refusal to bring employees together positively. The machines were old which made it hard to keep them running and get the mail out on time.
bad,"Unisys is a mismanaged and without a strategic vision company. They do not have clear direction what they want to be, hardware, software or services company! Ever since the merger of Burroughs Corporation and Sperry Corporation, the management in place at that time and ones that followed in succession drove the company into the ground."
bad,Unisys did not pay fair salary and ended up my contact unexpectedly and prematurely. I was working as a field tech and barely visited main office. My overall experience with them was very poor.
bad,"Empresa problemática, pois a cultura da empresa era fortemente individualista entre as pessoas"
bad,"Low pay, minimal advancement, poor management, lack of job security. You can be moved to entirely different work on a days notice with no real options (example: Technical support to customer support)"
bad,Unisys has a lot to learn as far as Professionalism & Management. The 4+ years I worked for Unisys was at best challenging.
bad,"Was all around a good work environment."
bad,"The work day was usually just travelling to end user's locations throughout MD and repairing there equipment.  The problem was I was only sent the parts that the help desk sent based on a phone call, which didn't always cover all of the issues.  Hanging out with my fellow techs in the morning getting ready for the day was the best part of it."
bad,"I worked for Unisys on and off for 40 years.  I gained great knowledge of their 2200 mainframe environment, especially in the earlier years (Univac and Sperry Corps.).  The later management off shored our jobs and their was no longer any job security.  My co-workers have always been great and some of the most technically proficient people I have ever worked with.  I wouldn't really say any part of the job was hard.  I was able to learn and perform most any project given to me.  The most enjoyable part was probably my co-workers.  Although I did enjoy writing code and problem solving."
bad,"Stretched waaaaay beyond a person's ability to function."
bad,Productive Place to learn basics and excel in the role whichever you apply. There is a perfect teams which will help new hires to get adjusted and train them with daily job competencies
bad,"If your interested in office politics, managerial patiesum, and corporate cronyism all while trying to polity correct someone else's technical error, this might be the place for you. Otherwise I would only recommend if your desperate."
bad,"A lot of issues when it comes to the company. First, HMO was not renewed in time, there was an instance that some people are about to use their HMO but then had to contact maxicare. There are so many bad things about this company that I had to leave for the betterment."
bad,"I was fired by my immediate supervisor two days after a good job review. I filed for unjustified termination and Unisys didn't even try to dispute that. Fortunately, I'd kept records of my work. I imagine they knew that I'd be able to defend myself in a hearing."
bad,Too long ago. I was there for only 1 year. The unit I was at was dissolved. I do not have much knowledge of how company is doing. Limited presence in bay area.
bad,"I was a contract employee.  the permanent employees were very dishonest with their expense reports (grossly exaggerated mileage, inflated onsite times, etc).  Myself and another contract employee were let go because we we honest on our expense reports and made the permanent guys look bad."
bad,Ok place to work. Flexible hours and ok benefits. Learned a lot from my position in the payroll department about state laws with terminations and with short term disability
bad,Good Salary but poor management. Resources were not directly reporting to Manager. Management structure was not proper. Poor Vendor handling at top  management level.
bad,"I would not recommend it because it lacks communication, and does not foster collaboration.  Lack of vision and mission.  Goals are set in random and unattainable."
bad,Management usually was very hands off. Working there was usually a good experience. Worked there for 5.5 years on various accounts. Vendors on account were very helpful
bad,"The company is a dinosaur trying to find its way in a new fast paced IT world.  It can't seem to make the necessary adjustments to compete for its share of the federal space. As its portfolio grows smaller due to losses in bids and recompetes, it places pressure on the management/workes below the leadership to make up for the work previously done by employees that were laid off to make the books look good for its share holders.  At this point, the company has stripped away the fat, muscles, and now carving at the bone.  Not a great environment at this time to work in."
bad,"Strict place to work. No tolerance for lateness or absenteeism. "
bad,"O ambiente de trabalho e bom, porem seus gestores não valorizam os funcionarios"
bad,"Unisys was a great place to work when I started, but over the years, the changes in management, changes in structure and the attrition caught up to it. There is no real sense of clarity of the company direction and most people are just going through the motions since there is no real road-map or direction. After many, many years, Unisys still can't figure out what it wants to be when it grows up. I hope they can figure it out at some point. Unisys has a great history and story to tell and I hope they succeed."
bad,"working in an environment that is understaffed is incredibly draining, Taking time off is ridiculous due to short staff so that you feel guilty when you do take it."
bad,"Even though the job was located on Microsoft Campus, the expectations were extremely high because we were vendor,but the pay was horrible, hard to get time off, no career advancement, Dead end job, high turn over. great team of techs I worked with though."
bad,The company is in extreme turmoil right now. Make sure to perform your operational and financial due diligence carefully before going to work there.  Comment is TOI.
bad,It's good company and the company management is not responsible for the employees issues. It's good to get good packages and work is good but it's lacking with management and transport facility.
bad,"As a contract company, Unisys cares about the employer - NOT the employee.  Once the contract is over - your'e gone.  There will be no assistance placing you somewhere else within the company."
bad,This place sucks for someone who likes to really do quality customer service. They except u off the phone in 10 mins no matter what call it in. Their in it for the quantity not the caring quality believe me.
bad,"My site alone went through 3 different site managers in 3 years and it eventually leaded up to the closure of the site. very poor leadership, lack of direction, next to no training offered. The culture was different from most calls centers I have worked at. there seemed to be less drama then most. The best part of the job is working with some of the most talented Level ones and twos offered in Rochester. They offer Aetna as a healthcare provider with a high deductible. for the longest time, they didn't even offer a 401k option. HR is off site and not part of the equation. This makes it very hard to report team managers for their unethical behaviors."
bad,Se aprendió en esta empresa el manejo y reparación de partes para computadora el trabajo en equipo era muy importante para tener un bien común los compañeros eran muy amables. En si fue una excelente escuela de como ingresar a la parte electrónica aplicarla y como mantener unos estándares de calidad y un grupo muy unido.
bad,"There are two types of project."
bad,"A typical day in the life of a unisys employee  is stressful and unproductive. The call center has almost impossible Call Metric's for Agents to meet in the tech support field. "
bad,a typical day was very stressfu. I looked forward to not working there.
bad,This company is struggling during this volatile economic market.
bad,"Travel between buildings, setting up new users with laptops or desktops."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was working to fix complicated desktop issues under strict time constraints. But with every problem that I experienced, I grew in more technical know how and confidence for the next challenge."
bad,"Get up early to see if you will receive any work, if you do you go to FedEx and pick up your Dell packages. You then call all of your contacts for the day to see if any of them are available. Then drive anywhere from a 25 mile radius to 250-300 miles from one job site to the next."
bad,"Unisys is no longer in business in Austin, but was very boring and had very little if any advancement. The company hired a lot of very rude and unhelpful people."
bad,a bunch of unprofessional under dressed management heads that recite racist remarks and unprofessional demeanor while working.
bad,"Compensation was good here. Everything starts out good but once you are no longer needed, then its time to be replaced by a lower paid person in another country. I feel bad for those guys in the other county, getting paid not enough and having too much work to do."
bad,This company is so detached it's amazing.  Not sure how they manage... not well respected in the IT world.  Losing to newer companies is their situation.
bad,Werkte bij een klant via unisys. Leiding is echt gewoon 10x niets. Regelen van zaken gaan ook zeer langzaam waardoor je onnodig kosten maakt om bij je werk te komen. Men was wel aardig. Helaas ook een aantal ratten.
bad,Doing the same work but Have a lot less information about the service call than we did at HPE. Less pay less vacation. definitely a step down from HPE
bad,"I received a fair deal of time off, but only due to the fact I survived to the third band of time (10 years), other than that poor health insurance, and until very recently, a very static salary (very few raises in salary, including  4 or 5 years without a raise).  "
bad,Had no confidence at length of time at job. Was given a raise and bonus when first hired on from HPE. After one full year of service would then receive second half of bonus. Do to business conditions was told I was going to be released at the end of Feb. 2019.
bad,Employees are overworked and underpaid. The climate is very stressful and employees are being required to continuously work overtime through oncall work without additional compensation. There is no work-life balance.
bad,"I think the management should change a lot to 'secure our tomorrow' at Unisys. There is a quite high fluctation within the company. They should understand that the demand for Dutch and German speaking agents is higher then ever, so their slalaries should be updated and more competitive as soon as possible, or Unisys can pay very huge penalty fees and lose clients. This associates are the most overloaded. The so called insentive program in this form is not fair and motivating at all with its nonsense targets. Instead of this,  more agent-friendly solution should be created to be the real 'happy workplace',  as they call themselves in promotions."
bad,"learning was good except for the management in India, it is too adamant. No 360 degree approval or the higher management is least bother to rate the next level manager. low level Employee will do suffer here severely"
bad,"As a technician for the AESD account, the majority of the work that is done is creating a ticket to send to other facilities to actually work. The position is very repetitive. The environment is very reclusive, people there are very introverted and keep to themselves. It is to the point where they look at you funny if you try to say hello while passing by in the halls."
bad,Should have changed name eons ago.  Out of the mainframe business and mostly consulting.  Outsourced all of recruiting and staffing.  Hold on to old-school thinkers and kiss butts.
bad,"Good compensation and benefits. "
bad,"Unisys hurts itself by putting low priorities on their employees.  They would be well served to add better Medical.   Vision is decent. Dental is bad but I have never seen a great Dental plan so can't hold it against them. Just barely started a 401k which is a good step forward, but still for a company of this size to be barely offering this option is bad. Decent pay though with a bonus program that isn't extremely hard to get to. They desperately need to upgrade their training model it is almost nonexistent"
bad,"Good for startup career, learn a lot about IT services and support , Management is good and team of engineers is excellent"
bad,"My day to day work life involves answering the telephone in a timely fashion, with full commitment to excellent customer service. In a short time, I have learned how to work with multiple systems that many companies work with. Microsoft Office Pro, Windows xp, 7, 8 & 10. The management has greatly changed over the course of the four years I have been with the company. Unfortunately, due to many changes in the work model of this company, management changes & favoritism shown by them, and shift changes made every six months, it is time to part ways. My fellow co-workers are great. The team I have been working with for the last few years have become family. We all help each other whenever it is needed. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is having to deal with shift bids. It gets tough to flip your life upside-down every six months. You never know what hours you will work in a few months. It tends to have a negative effect on life outside of the office. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people every day. Speaking to customers from all over the world makes my day, each and ever day!"
bad,"I liked the people I directed and managed at Unisys, but the leadership team was out of touch. They made decisions that negatively impacted the business and its overall employee base, including low wages at he agent level which resulted in employee dissatisfaction and high turnover"
bad,Struggling company trying to save money on the backs of their employees.  No raises in nearly three years and health costs up significantly.
bad,Military IT Group was kind of a quiet non social environment.
bad,Dungeon Like Workplace...  Limited Advancement.  Mandatory Unpaid Overtime.
bad,"Need lot of exposure for the employees working here."
bad,Many co-workers were wonderful and gained many new friends. Used to be a good place to work but things have changed with the outsourcing to foreign countries and job security is weak
bad,La filiale française de Unisys Corp. se défait de ses techniciens mobiles au profit de sous-traitant.
bad,"Management is your typical twenty-something millennials, very unorganized, arrogant bunch. The workload is very often a ridiculous amount, you are not only expected to receive calls as they promised during the interview (maximum 15 a day they said), but handle other requests and incidents from user coming in the form of emails, chat interactions, different queues. If the call volume is low, they will make sure to keep you very busy working on any of the offline tasks. Preliminary training has little to do with the actual client specific tasks. Client specific training is substantial but short and if you are not IT minded it will be of very little use. They like to put people on different accounts which is a mess. Payment for people who speak English + another support language is quite low. The internal systems agents are supposed to use freeze up often, but you are still expected to receive calls. In many instances you are supposed to work with a useless collection of help material, the different support groups you have to assign tickets to send tickets back to you with ridiculous reasons, so you often end up having to receive calls with irritated users, update your tickets, try to fight with the dumbbass support groups, work on incoming emails, request queue, interaction queue and chat. The incentive program is laughable, the company has such service level agreements that can only be reached if you break your back day in day out. I never before seen a place where people randomly start crying or snap and go home from work. In the Budapest office fluctuation is massive, the other"
bad,"As a former Employee It wasn't the best place to work.  I worked 70-90 hours weekly on call 2 weeks out of month.  My family life collapsed due to work and management did not seem to care.  Paychecks were good, but the pay was not when you get 40-50 hours of OT weekly makes for a good check.  Fatigue factor was there many times 12 hours+ onsite depending on issue the most I spent onsite was 22 hours.  Do not treat employees fairly they are just a number to pad there bottomline."
bad,Working in a call center can be a good experience but never a long time career
bad,"Workforce is largely remote, but mature and able to balance the freedom of working from home with work responsibilities."
bad,"Agile"
bad,"Unisys is currently undergoing massive layoffs and account loss. Used to be a great place to work, but the environment is uncertain and people are scared. The call center is losing accounts left and right, long time loyal employees are being let go of with no attempt to relocate or retain them. Unisys feels like it's being stripped down to be sold off."
bad,"It was a good experience just starting out in IT career. Wearing out vehicle was less than ideal. Challenged in delivering service, selling supplies, and making collections all at the same customer site, at times."
bad,"on-site position, everything about the company's practices can be read in the summary, pros, and cons. I provided desktop support for a fortune 500 company,"
bad,This company is laying off many people. I was laid off and my aunt who worked there for 17 years was also laid off. If your looking for a secure job this is not the company for you.
bad,"Great co workers but horrible compensation. You use your own car which is horrible. They reimburse horribly also, I think 15 cents a mile. Make sure you have plenty of money before you start here."
bad,"Due to Security Clearance requirements I can not discuss this in any further detail, without breaking Data Protection. The Job Culture was not suited to me."
bad,I enjoyed my work and enjoyed supporting the Program Management Group.  I did learn a lot during my tenure.  Unisys no longer cares about work life balance or there employees. This lack of care is do constantly trying to improve poor margins. Would never recommend a friend to apply.
bad,UNISYS could have been great; but there was a lot of managerial micro-management and very little upper management appreciation of the job that was performed by the tape clerks I supervised. The entire department was outsourced to a contract firm - OAO.
bad,"I worked for Unisys as a Customer Infrastructure representative. I started out repairing Dell laptops and desktops, then moving on to servers, and eventually EMC SAN/NAS storage systems. Near the end my on-call schedule had me clocking upwards of 75 hours per week. The in 2008 they saw the writing on the wall (albeit a bit late to prepare) and were having money troubles. I was laid off in Feb 2009. I worked my butt off and sacrificed every time I was asked to, then when times were tough they kicked me to the curb."
bad,"My manager was infamous for throwing people under the bus, her boss was nice and told me I really didn't fit in, BUT I had made a great friend out of the deal so I have no complaints. I didn't work for them long but I found myself supremely bored and wandered around the building a lot smh lol. My security admin was the BEST ever and that's about it. I wouldn't work for them again or will I?"
bad,The Work place was an ok place to work at. Just not enough there to help me advance in the career that i was looking for. Working conditions could have been better.
bad,"What can I say about this job that hasn't already been said on shows like ""The IT Crowd"" or in cheesy stand-up bits? The work wasn't glamorous or thrilling, but it was honest."
bad,"Empresa com grande desejo de ser a líder em tecnologia da informação."
bad,"When I first started was a great place to work, many employee engagement activities. But it changed the last few years I worked there. No internal HR group and advancement decisions were handled externally. I worked really hard, trained new employees for about a year and a half and never was compensated or advanced in  the company. I enjoyed my work and would still be there as I had committed myself to learning all I could, company moved"
bad,"I was a remote worker and I found out how much more I can accomplish when I am not distracted by other employees. "
bad,"Good place to learn Business Operations again having said that it is more of self learning and absolutely no mentoring."
bad,"Average company in terms of offerings. Leadership below the senior executives lacks vision and risk taking ability. Too scared to speak up and make their case. No trust and space for people to grow especially in marketing team (shared services) in Bangalore. The company is not considered a competitive threat in any Gartner, Forrester magic quadrant report."
bad,"Not much Technical to learn."
bad,"Unisys at the time I joined was a merger between Burroughs and Sperry Univac - two major players in the early years of computing. It was a great place to be to start my career in business systems. "
bad,"A empresa me proporcionou experiência em negócios internacionais de diferentes culturas, aprendi como funciona a gestão de grandes projetos e como lidar com as dificuldades do dia-a-dia."
bad,"I spent 7 years there working my butt off for a federal agency. The government director recognized my hard work and gave Unisys a $22 per hour billing rate increase so I could get a good raise. I got 87 cents. During my review I was rated as ""average"" in keeping the customer happy. I quit right after my ""raise"", and still am a very bitter former employee. ""We reward hard work"" is not true."
bad,Laid back sometimes depending on the client you are dealing with.Work place culture is great but management just don't care about the Field Support Engineers meanwhile they are the ones doing most of the job. You're pouring your heart out and giving your best to the client but don't get recognized or get paid accordingly despite the company making mad profit every year.
bad,"Unisys is good stepping stone for someone whose brand new to the IT and customer service field. But as working for them long term, it's a big no go. The manager that I worked for was good, but the others, let's just say, it's their way or the highway."
bad,"Good for a first stepping stone into IT, or to begin a career in middle-management."
bad,Not worth reviewing..Nothing to say about it..It's pathetic in terms of place and work and salary and growth and all the good things you can ever imagine in life..
bad,I wnjoyed working there for the most part
bad,Unisys used to be a dream company 7-8 years ago. It's not the same anymore. The policies are changing everyday and there is no consideration. The only good thing left now is that they allow work from home but the day is not far off when that is also taken away from employees
bad,"I was lied to in the interviews about the work.  Then I had to sign a statement that I would always put down hours worked, but no one did that for fear of losing their jobs."
bad,"Good learning as an intern and the open culture policy is good"
bad,Contract job growth not possible it is a relaxed environment for the most part Management doesn't care for employees. Shifts are decent
bad,It is a good place to start if you do not have a lot of technical background. Not the type of environment you would like to make a career.
bad,"Unisys Data Systems is very fast paced and during peak season, the call queue will always be filled and performance is based on call volumes."
bad,"It is a good starting point for new graduates but the lack of new technologies hinders your learning curve and future skills development. I would not recommend working here for long since the heavy usage of legacy tools and languages would take you back to the 80's. (Nobody writes code in Cobol, Algol and Newp these days)"
bad,Was working Graveyard shift but being paid for day shift. I was treated like I was doing something wrong by finding out why.
bad,"Great entry level opportunity but you will feel like a number. If you're wanting to get started in IT and Help Desk Support this is a good first landing spot, however you won't feel much personalized attention and most likelywill be stressed to the max"
bad,under paid and overworked no chance for upward mobility in this organization
bad,"The company is a great place to start, but as soon as you've been here for 2 years leave as soon as you can. No growth opportunities, and the pay is terrible for what you do. The company is also very cheap. I learned the basice but anything beyond that you're stuck. Co-workers are cool, some play into politics though, but that's everywhere. Greta place for an 18 to 22 year old looking for an in into IT."
bad,"last manager wasn't very informative, they acquired a contract from HPE to service HPE equipment. after a year laid a lot of people off. felt i was baited to stay on for a year by giving a bonus, half up front and half after a year. they made it ""feel"" they had a high retention rate but was not the case as i was laid off a year to the date of my transition from HPE"
bad,Not at all good for the freshers as rarely they work in latest technologies. OK for the experienced guys if and only if they want a good pay and not some challenging work.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of answering phone calls, emails, and questions that come through IM from other agents."
bad,I like working for Unisys. But Unisys does not pay very well for my years of experience and certifications. I made a better income working for my previous employer. I am working at my previous employers location now though Unisys. For 15 an jour less than I used to make from my past employer
bad,"Over all had a good experience in this compan. Unisys gave me foundation for career. Which helped to grow individually with in the company. Work environment was good, there was no bias between the employees all were treated equally."
good,"Marketing & PR are the hardest working Wonks in the biz. Senior leadership comprised of dinosaurs.  High turn over of rank and file and customer facing managers, while HQ leadership remains in their Ivory Towers."
good,"This again you is Not for me, no  advancement & or structure. Getting work was more work. This agency isn’t a good agency. And they are not based in New York City."
good,This was the first job i got when i got out of the Army.Its was weird doing work at a slower pace and have your boss there it every moment. The jobs was moving to another state.
good,"This was my first job after college.  It was a great place to get acquainted with the ups and downs of the corporate world, and to get some experience under my belt.  I don't think that they do much innovation anymore, the company is much smaller than it used to be."
good,"Only one supervisor there cares about morale, or the people who work for them. Don't bother going to upper management or HR with your concerns- they will tell you that you have a bad attitude. You literally have no recourse to resolve problems. You will never be asked to do anything, you will be TOLD what to do. Training and mandatory meetings will be scheduled outside of your shift, and you will have to attend. Co-workers were great, but this is definitely a dead-end job."
good,"not impressed "
good,A big learning experience. Great co-workers. No room to grow. Compeny doesn't care about employees.
good,The management in the department I worked for provided no training.  They continually kept staff in the dark.  The processes are outdated and they rely on paper files.  Very much not the place to work.
good,"Gerência Regional em Goiânia - Goiás com vícios da empresa anterior. Salários defasados com o mercado e funcionários com o mesmo cargo e salários totalmente diferentes, chegando a uma diferença de mais de R$ 1.000,00 (Mil reais) para o mesmo cargo exercido. Alguns funcionários melhor remunerados nem tem a experiência, cursos ou certificações necessárias para exercer o cargo, mas por ser amigo da chefia imediata , são favorecidos e muito bem protegidos pela mesma."
good,"not a technology based company, they are mainly concentrate on end user services. at the time of interview they wont tell you as you are working with call center type. unfortunately managers are not having any managerial skills and technical skills. they have only excel maths."
good,"No complaints on my part. Really liked working for the company. Its location in reston was perfect  for my commute, lots of shops and restaurants nearby to visit for lunch."
good,"This is yet another cube farm, full of germs. You can easily just fall into a hole and be lost in the machine. Producing OK metrics and to just keep showing up will allow you to work steadily in a lame economy. Management is unfair and there is a VERY limited advancement potential, management is hand picked and the middle-aged lay-about manager who struggles to do less to just remain working at a decent rate rules the roost, so to speak. Raises are few and far between and fought over like a sports event. "
good,"sou dinamico e tenho facilidade em aprender coisas novas, a unisys e uma empresa que te posibilita muita experiencia e contato com tecnologia de ponta porem deixa o lado humano de lado, e com isso criando um conflito entre trabalho e vida social."
good,"Working at Unisys was a great experience for me just coming out of college. I got to have Hands-on experience working with different tools especially windows hardware and software. I had a little problem thought with management because of the way they ran operation. Such as the lock of structure and organization in workplace. Poor communication and employee management. Inability to provide employee with necessary tools to do their job extensively and effectively. Even thought there were limited tools available, it only limites the employee. Overall it was a good experience because it allows me to see first hand how there can be limites and obstacles and at the same time skills development to handle the frustrations that come with technology."
good,Fun environmet in the outlets. But it Lacks Training and opportunities for employees. No job security. Only give training thru online videos and exams.
good,The company seemed to be a good working environment when I started but as the weeks continued it was determined the the management was very misdirected and disorganized.
good,"The salary is very low. They put you on other accounts quite often, but no pay rise for 4 years. call and chat on same time.(multi tasking is just a fairy tale) they want to save money but going to loose associates. Not the best management.."
good,"Good old boys network.  Many times there are not raises given annually.  I have not had a raise in six years.  We are told they give out raises on a bell curve based on ratings, so almost always someone doesn't get a raise."
good,"Empresa Multinacional, que proporcionou enriquecimentos pessoais e profissionais, tais como controle de Processos de TI , SLA, Níveis de Serviço, Prazo de Respostas."
good,I dint like the company work culture and management. People are not approachable. Managers are partial. Too much of partiality and biasing. Poor services.
good,"Their insurance options aren't good, the management is lacking, if existent at all, and being friendly and personable is looked down on from management, as though all it does is waste company time. Capital one is a particularly horrible queue to be on at UTS, as the calls are pretty much non-stop with only scripted solutions."
good,"There’s two sides to Unisys.  Unisys Technical Services or UTS and Unisys Information Services or UIS.  If you’re a UTS employee like I was, you’ll never make more than a certain amount.  Period.  So once you hit that pay cap, there’s really no motivation to do anything more.  Also, UTS/UIS both have non-compete clauses in their contracts.  So if you want to make more, or move to another department.  You literally have to quit first."
good,"Leadership doesn’t listen, makes poor decisions and subsequently lays people off to make up for budget shortfalls — this seems to happen annually. Constant reorganizations upend teams. Lots of politics. Won’t invest in ongoing support and adoption of tools once deployed. Always behind the curb when it comes to hiring, raises and promotions. Oh and don’t expect a raise with that promotion — you’ll get the promise that it will come when reviews come around and then of course there’s always an excuse when it gets diluted by any COLA you receive. As someone else summed up in a review, they will suck the life out of you with very much a “What have you done for me today mgt mentality?”"
good,"learned alot, used my own car to travel from customer site to customer site. met tons of great people. worked along in the field but always had help and could reach out to team members."
good,Atualmente está demitindo os funcionários para subcontratar terceiros
good,"Unisys environment is very challenging at the same time very hectic , once it comes to delivering service to client.You would be warned by your managers and leads if you are late to work even by a minute due to this employees are not satisfied with the work culture."
good,"not a great place to balance work and family.  salary is borderline.  mostly only a call center,  if you can stand to be in a chair for eight hours a day.  you may like it."
good,A company that hires at mid-level to low wages for the industry and burns through agents by giving them minimal training and utilizing the high turnover for a fresh set of workers on a constant basis. Not a long-term position.
good,Mixed experience as my previous manager was a person to whom you cannot deny anything and the one I have now is no where close. Sudden management change sucks and should not happen unless the existing manager is well within the company. Its like reinventing the wheel as the new one hardly knows you and your work potential.
good,"no chance to advance financially undermanned and overworked, expected to produce miracles with no compensation enhancement and little to no cudos or thank you"
good,"Usual day, driving to location to pickup parts packages and learning routes to regular customer homes or business.  The hardest part of the job is finding the next location to visit. Meeting new people at all times is a great part of the job."
good,"Unisys seems to have little interesting in growing it's employees, making it difficult to see this as a career opportunity, rather than just a job. When seeing the constant lack of work/life balance in my managers life, I find it even more difficult to work up the enthusiasm to fall in love with the company and advance."
good,"Typical day, answering calls to assist users with company equipment malfunctions, company applications and ordering equipment."
good,"While Unisys certainly isn't the worst place to work, it certainly isn't the best. It is very much a cubicle farm, and management doesn't seem to care about making it a very inviting place to work. I did get some good technical and customer service though."
good,"Many of the mid-level leaders here were great, but the previous senior managers had no clue about how to lead and motivate technical people. "
good,"Unisys is a good place to start a career."
good,Unisys is a call center type technical support environment. My experience there was not a good one. When I first went to work there their hiring requirements included MCP and A+ certification plus experience in the Microsoft Office Suite but over time Unisys relaxed their hiring requirements to the point where no certifications were required and so the technical staff did not have the knowledge or experience to support the customer. Unisys failed to staff enough people to cover call load and this resulted in staff being required to work through lunches and a lot of overtime.
good,"It's a job.  I work and get paid for it.  I am thankful for that.  Time are still not what they used to be and unfortunately our salaries are what they used to be also.  Unchanged.  Benefits are down, cost to employee is up."
good,"Ailing management style. Needs updating."
good,On the move to different locations of DPSS offices while we wait for our team leader to give us intructions of settting and ghosting the PC terminals into a new operating system Windows 7
good,"Gestão rotativa"
good,This is a great place for a young professional to get their feet wet. There is unfortunately not a great deal of upward mobility. The benefits are expensive and professionalism is dubiously absent at Unisys.
good,A good company. Management was poor. No guidance. It had its moments of being a fun enviroment.
good,nice place to work but the company does not treat contract workers to well as to being hired by the company itself. also the pay is not a base other employees got better pay and treatment
good,"My best time in Unisys was that the staff members were amazing, they made it a good place to work...I made some very lasting friendships whilst working there."
good,The team was strong and the software product was well written. Latest technologies were used. Productive yet flexible office culture.  Management was supportive.
good,Unisys was still in need of a better work environment for its employees. At the time the pay was not competitive nor was management adequate to provide a satisfactory work experience.
good,a empresa ate que é ótima mais não me enquadrei nos parâmetro não era exatamente minha área desejada
good,"I was a Certified Dell Tech. I was responsible for the repair of Dell laptops, desktops, and servers. I was expected to complete 5-8 service calls a day"
good,"Very poor management went more and more down the toilet the 4 years I was there, they stopped giving incentives, losing accounts due to poor management, half the work force was laid off."
good,"Pick parts for orders or put away, dismantling computers , shipping and receiving , forklift and picker training and certification. Build massive shelving ."
good,"I overall just had a terrible experience working with this company and the 3rd party company who recruited me. "
good,Relaxed environment . Working on old technologies. To switch from one company to other would be difficult if one stays here for long. The management is cooperative.
good,"Empresa que segue muito bem seu patrão americano, limitando o crescimento interno dos recursos."
good,"Unisys has been listed as one of the most unethical companies globally. The history has far too many incidents of corruption and/or gross negligence, at least when I was there in 2011. Hopefully today's leadership has a firm grip on the ethical issues that can destroy or grow business."
good,"Log in and look up my calls for the day"
good,"past 10 years have been constant reorg -every year and 100,000+ layoffs.  This takes its toll as axe is constantly falling.  New managment team is fighting over any successes- this can lead to conflict.  Sales lead is nowresponsible for keeping support hours  off projects balanced sheet in order to retain margin. and everyone in support wants/needs billable hours"
good,"If you are looking for somewhere to gain a few new skills and increase your technical knowledge then work for Unisys, but if you value family time and a somewhat steady schedule or a company that strives to provide opportunity to grow, this is not the place for you!"
good,"good quality of people.  helpful.  No real advancement.   Job was interesting.   Had helpful team leads."
good,"	System administration, worked on incident management. "
good,"The experience with the Unisys Corporation itself was disorganized and cold. The experience with co workers and clients we supported was great. I rarely needed to interact with the overall company itself. The management was for the most part non existent, or transparent to us except for a few very capable individuals. The less of higher management having to managed, the better things went. I cannot rate the company as a whole, as my experience is more closely tied to 3rd party clients we supported which were overall very positive. Unisys benefits and policies have been changing for the worse, and little to no pay increases ever materialize."
good,"Good local support from team. Friendly and competent co-workers. "
good,"Unisys is a big company and I could only see a portion of it.  I worked there a lot of years and worked with some great people.  But Unisys has been struggling for the last 30 years and continues to shrink.  Recent new CEO 1/2015 is shaking things up and it is not clear it is for the better.  While many companies complain they can't find enough qualified software engineers, Unisys just laid off 30% of its engineers in the group where I worked (myself included).  These were top quality, experienced people.  There is still interesting work and good people, but it is a shrinking company which struggles to make any money.  This is no big secret.  Just look at their financials."
good,"- nice environment"
good,"Long hours, so-so pay, awful benefits. Employees crammed into offices like sardines."
good,"Work day was to review and co-ordinate the replacement of old IT equipment for new ( PC's, Laptops and monitors)"
good,"Fixing customers computer by replacing hardware components.  "
good,"Empresa de grande porte, com excelente imagem no mercado, mas seu nível salarial é baixo e oferece poucas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"poca vida social ,muchas horas de trabajo y trabajos muy pesados"
good,"The call center environment is one that, if you are not careful, can leave you feeling hollow. For this, I can't really fault the management at the company, but rather the nature of the call center industry. I love the IT field, but have lost all enjoyment for the helpdesk/call center environment. In retrospect, I suppose there is a right person for each job, and vice versa. If you have a more outgoing personality, the call center environment is fine. Otherwise, you might be better suited for a behind-the-scenes job such as in a depot."
good,"This a good place to work if you are aged and want to retire with no work pressure, however for youngeters who want to grow this is not the right place."
good,Many applications to learn in a very short period. great learning experience
good,"I was on a brand new project that was starting up at the time doing help desk for a big financial firm in New York. The days started early (6am) or earlier because we had to be open when they opened. Lots of ""waves"" of calls when come crashing in when something on the network broke, and the client blamed us for not staffing up enough. Received quite a few questions that had nothing to do with computers, more along the lines of company policy, procedures, etc. (how the heck should I know?, check with your manager), management timed the length of our breaks and would jump down our throughts if we were 30 seconds late, but all in all it was nice to work for a well known, international technology firm and would like to do so again."
good,It was who you knew to get ahead was not based on job performace
good,"Constantly adding to job functions,  but no mention of compensation for the additional responsibilities. Some technicians have been with Unisy for 5+ years without as much as a mention of a pay raise"
good,"Oftentimes, L1 agents are left in the dark about changes that management fails to disclose, and you are left responsible.  They are standoffish and hard to approach; they rarely interact with the team.  You are given more work and not compensated for it as you demonstrate your proficiency and ability to handle your work."
good,Very high stress 12 -18 hours a day 7 days a week..did not have much life outside of work asked me to make a 5 year commitment i got offered a better job but stsyed out of loyalty...
good,Unisys to this day is struggling to make a large enough profit. Keeping that in mind both benefits and pay are on the lighter side for all positions. Turn over the company is regular but presents a good opportunity for anyone wanting to advance their careers. Work hard and expand beyond your current job role and you will be able to advance. Once you have learned all you can don't be afraid to move on. Staying to long in this high pressure environment with less than ideal pay and last rate health benefits will burn you out.
good,Leadership is off shoring resources. It started with software development and testing and has now moved to project an program management.  U.S.  jobs being eliminated in favor of lower cost off shore resources.  I was expected to manage up to 7 project at a time.  The sales reps often sold products or services that were not yet developed and made delivery promises that were unrealistic.14 - 16 hours days were the norm
good,"Nothing but change and lay-offs. Whomever it was who signed the HPE deal should have serious thoughts regarding their decision making skills. "
good,"I very much enjoyed assisting users with computer issues. OCT 2018 – PRESENT"
good,Enjoyed working for Unisys but the constant work structure changes were stressful. Often undertake projects without the base knowledge of the subject.
good,"The veteran employees of Unisys are a very talented and capable bunch who are easy to work with.  Over the years of cost cutting, many of the best people were laid off and replaced with lower cost resources, moving major parts of the business off shore, and outsourcing to third party vendors."
good,Work life balance cant be expected while working here. You need to extend to make your work needs fulfilled. Management decisions are so lame that makes no sense!
good,"Management ""misunderstood"" requirements for major works and had to disengage. Attempts to use 'outsourced' international subsidiaries went woefully wrong and had to be replaced."
good,"- Unsecured in recent times"
good,I have worked at Unisys for about 8 years and did enjoy some of the time.
good,"Au sein d'Unisys, j'ai installé et gérer des parcs informatiques notamment pour TOTAL à la défense et la maison mère d'EUROPCAR à Saint Quentin en Yvelines."
good,"The physical environment you enter is very appealing and modern with lots of pop art and just cool areas to take time to yourself. The dress code is typically very casual but you may be required to dress business casual a few times a week depending on whos visiting (client) or (potential client). Socially culture is a little tricky. you never know where you stand with someone as a contractor because you're not really appreciated or viewed as a ""real person"" that contributes to the  clients needs and success. So don't look for any recognition. Leadership wont really acknowledge you or speak to you in passing. You will often see the security guard and janitor(s) gossiping on the floor with management level employees about other employees or contractors I often did not know if the security guard was the janitor or vice versa. So they're are a few negatives in the experience. On the positive side the team member are extremely helpful, smart, and knowledgeable depending on how long they've been around. Unisys has a high turn over because employees generally leave to find better paying jobs, as you're not being compensated very much for the work you do. Training is virtually ineffective or a lot of times inadequate. You're literally thrown next to someone who may have started just a month or so before you and expected to learn/ know a wealth of information in a matter of 3 weeks before you're put on phones to deal with rude, arrogant, foreign corporate employees who you work very hard to satisfy. information updates and emails are sent but not effectively introduced or implemented."
good,Unisys was a great place start in the IT field.  I had my first real introduction to technology and a huge amount of hands-on experience.  It is the job that got me into the field.
good,"Good work place with work-life balance, but no transparency in management. No career development. Good only for who wants a laid back profile and no risks involved."
good,"laid off during recession in May 2009."
good,"That company management should check on how they portray themselves to the IT industry."
good,"Worked inside a team for unisys.  However with a contracting company, you are at the mercy of he contract.  When the contract ends or the customer no longer needs the support from your company, then you are out of a job."
good,The people are great to work with. I could go on and on with how cool the people at the MSC are. Because people at the MSC really make it great. Love the people.
good,Does not have good process in any area. Transportation / cab facility is pathetic. Not managing the resources properly. No much scope of internal jobs and scope for learning new technologies
good,"This place is a call center.  Job title was ""Army Enterprise Service Desk Agent"" but its still a call center.  If you like this kind of work, then go for it, but it was not for me.  Management was pushy and generally uncaring of personal issues.  Company issues ""demerits"" called points for arriving late.  Professional development is lacking.  If you do not request a performance review, it most likely will not happen unless you make a mistake."
good,decent entry level tech position. Currently experiencing flux in company staffing. company has only one direction to go and that's up management is decent.
good,"The company is good. but there are few things  which needs to be , You would never know when would your process dissolves."
good,"Good in working hrs & also safty traning will be provide to all employees and pickup & dropping facility to all employees."
good,"I began working at Unisys in 2010 expecting to stay for a couple of years to get some needed experience in the IT field. I was there for nearly 7 years mostly because i really liked the company / account that i supported. For many of the years that i was there you were unable to transition from the Helpdesk role to a more technical role such as server administration or access and identity management due to being Unisys Technical Support as opposed to Unisys. This greatly limited the room for advancement in the company as a whole. Once hired if they want or need to change your work hours there is little consideration as to whether those changes work for the employee it's more of a take it or find another job kind of deal. In my opinion this could be done in a better way. Attrition rate is high. Management has little concern for the employee's and see things based on statistics and could do better by listening to employee needs and ideas which over the last couple of years has gotten better. Overall it's a call center job with a focus on Technical Helpdesk roles which is good for entry level iT experience. I did learn a lot in my time there in terms of troubleshooting techniques and troubleshooting a vast array of hardware , software, and network problems. At the end of the day the thing that i liked the most was fixing a complex problem for the end user that even I wasn't sure that I could fix."
good,The work is very fast paced sometimes but there are leaders who try to help create a cohesive Team environment that is good for all workers very good.
good,"Typical day at work include supporting Citrix, Exchange task, closing up a project and creating CR to decommission server(s) "
good,In my opinion this is a decent place to work.  They work with your schedule if you are going to school.  The pay is good and the training  and resources provided are adequate for the tasks conducted day to day.
good,"It's Telecom vendor company,i had work in that company as Project Engineer at Ameraavti location for survey,installation for different different companys software installation."
good,"A nice place to start off as a trainee doing break/fix work on computers and printers, but there's no room For advance my thus no pay raise or pay incentives for the employees."
good,"I would typically program most of the day and occasionally run the simulators for demos, data collection, and troubleshooting code."
good,"I worked here when the FAA contract was 60% of their business. We had a lot of freedom but other then that the employees on my team and at client site were not impressive. Condescending management, zero opportunity to advance, and no one would tell you where we stood with contract bids. "
good,"Generous computer use policy. Nice facilities. Generally convivial group of people. Thankfully diverse. Overall average as for benefits, work/life balance, ruled by software to which you must adhere: support granted not as important as generating and eliminating tickets."
good,Nothing bad to say about the company overall.  They really need to streamline processes and eliminate bottlenecks so customers gain the best service and solutions are consistently delivered on time.
good,"Customer service for a Internet service provider in California, would take inbound calls for dsl lines, kept average handle time low, and first call resolution up,"
good,"Many workers came and went, those who really worked hard were often overlooked by team managers in leiu of friends.. Workers seemed always fearful of losing their job no matter what they did. Saturdays were a blessing, fewer leads to harass workers to work harder."
good,"For an entry level IT job that doesn't require any significant experience, this is a great place to get your foot in the door, learn, and grow. There are opportunities to learn how many different companies operate from an IT standpoint, opportunities for advancement, and opportunities for growth, all while providing a steady paycheck. However, this is not somewhere you want to be the rest of your life."
good,"A good organisation to learn and grow. nice work culture, however the management lacks in hadling the resouce management where resource were not utilized up to skills they have"
good,"Unisys is a company struggling with its identity - as a Systems Integrator, Outsourcer, or high end computers."
good,"Love the people that I worked with. However the cutlutre had a bit to be desired."
good,"I worked at Burroughs Corporation before it became Unisys. I loved this job for the first 15 years. After that things went down hill continually. When I was laid off, I had become I was working from home and had no real relationship with my boss. The company only paid for the phone line I used for conference calls; they didn't even pay for my internet service."
good,"I was with the company for a little over 6 months and then suddenly I was laid off due to budget restraints. While I was there it was a decent place to work. My co-workers were great and my immediate manger was great. Unfortunately, I never meant anyone about my immediate manager."
good,Spent a majority of the time troubleshooting user's computer issues over the phone and by remoting into their computer.  I've learned a bit more about troubleshooting than I knew coming into the job.  Management is generally good.  Coworkers are friendly though the hardest part of the job for me was watching people slack off and their not being admonished for it.  The current morale has gone downhill over the last two years.  The best part is whenever I've solved someone's problem and their thanks at the end of a phone call and when the day ends.
good,"It was working for Microsoft Project and was your typical call center.  The SMEs were very helpful, training was good and the job itself wasn't that difficult."
good,"It was really a very good learning experience in Unisys."
good,Unisys corporation is employee centric company with focus on training and learning. Unisys spends lot of money on tools which makes delivery of high quality in time. Work environment is very conducive less invasive.
good,"Uma boa empresa para trabalhar, atuei na empresa por aproximadamente 4 anos e meio. "
good,"A typical day at work is not at ease. You may need to beg for breaks from your TLs. Management is highly focused on client's appreciation for which they are ready to forget the value system they have with their own employees. In other words, you will fell like you have been less valued at as an internal employee when it comes to job satisfaction. No problem with transport systems or food coupons. You will feel like you are working with great friendly colleagues but at the same time you will be surprised to see the dirty politics(this of-course is every where). The hardest part of life here is the break management and NO transparency in IJPs. The most enjoyable part ......I'm sure everyone will be thing about : ""What this can be?"""
good,"Good learning environment. I learnt and did retructuring with respect to stakeholders, clients and colleagues."
good,Sent to a lot of company schools and labs to learn new products.  Traveled from key west to west palm beach working at a lot of different companies. Stayed in field most of the time. Many new employees work from home
good,"Los compañeros de trabajo son muy agradables el ambiente genera es muy bueno, de hecho es excelente, sin embargo los cargos mas elevados suelen ser un poco déspotas o hipócritas con sus empleados, por lo que con ellos la relación suele ser tensa"
good,"Was a great company till they decided to take on HP support in the early part of 2019. Hours plummeted, seniority became a major factor to the better jobs. Mileage was dramatically reduced. Numerous jobs were laid off with short or no notice. Chaos ensued quickly."
good,"People here are honest with themselves and with you, They aren't lieing to you they are telling you as it is with no holding back. They only know what they are told by the higher ups who tend to be covered in secrecy about upcoming changes."
good,"Even being a nice place to work, salaries are low, and unless you only want a comfortable job where you only have to be a slow dwarf-mining stone, people are nice, and that's good, but don't expect to learn much or having self-growth there"
good,"Unisys is a fairly good place to work. There is lot of focus on working on legacy technologies. However, you can be part of various Technolgy Focus groups where you can work  on latest technologies."
good,"Worked in the support environment for 1.5 years, a typical day at work is getting roasted by tasks for 10 working hours straight (obviously excluding the 1 hour + break). Now of course the nature of tasks I performed on the daily basis were repetitive, which is not company's fault but what the job role required."
good,"A typical day at work is a stressful fast pace environment with you resolving client issues using complex knowledge base KB,and routing cases to appropriate resolver groups. At the same time  receiving informative emails about consistent changes to user, products, & applications at various global locations. Communication is the key to success. While some supervisors work diligently with their subordinates, there are others that delegate their responsibilities, leaving the subordinate to rectify serious situations in a timely manner, and if it is not handle correctly you stand to be blamed  or counseled."
good,"Empresa muito boa no geral para aprender. Muito serviço, porém muitas vezes pouco reconhecimento."
good,Good if you want training to help advance your career.  PM level managers and above are often lost and only want to push sales of new technologies over meeting the actual requirements of the customer.  They do offer many work-from-home positions.
good,"I enjoy working for Unisys. I work as a contractor therefore, not many benefits are provided. The job is fun and you learn a lot because it is quick paced. Overall I have a good time working here."
good,"I was contracted out to another company, so the work environment was different. Not much to say about my last employer, it was ok."
good,Lot of night shifts. Work life balance is not a priority. Pay is almost same as CTC. Lot of Lay offs happening and job may not be secure. Management is not efficient.
good,"This company presented itself as the place to work.  Great work/life balance, support from management, and advancement.  I started off working 80 hour weeks and tapered to over 50.  Currently not getting the support i need and requested additional support.  Never recieved.  Client expectations were not communicated and contract is suffering"
good,"Fast paced, team oriented environment focused on service delivery for a client with multi faceted structure. Primary duty is to ensure the successful project outcome."
good,"Its good company, You need to be productive in terms of working in this company. You will hjave rotational shifts and you should have good bonding with the manager and co workers"
good,I was told many times how much less I made then my co-workers even though I did three times the calls and I trained them. Now I am in a different location/job lower pay but better manager and no stress level.
good,Empresa Multinacional de grande porte com grande volume de contratações e grande diversidade de atividades voltadas principalmente na área de  Service Desk e Automação Bancária
good,"you have a large territory to cover, the time frame you have to work with in is very tight to go from one job to another. You get very little compensation for gas and use of your car. However,most of the clients you work with can make the job feel very rewording."
good,"Taking numerous phone calls from mostly Army soldiers and the civilian workers. "
good,"Empresa de grande porte com ausência de conhecimento em processos e metodologia de Gestão em Projetos, com ausência técnica de recursos qualificados na Gestão e Comercialização de Projetos de Grande Porte."
good,New management has reduced the workforce to a minimum. Good team of people that work hard but the number of resources available is minimal. Very difficult to determine the direction of the ship.
good,"When I was hired I was told I would have a lot of work with not-infrequent overtime. The truth was completely the opposite - I barely managed to get 20 hours a week most weeks, hardly even enough to cover my own commute and job-related expenses."
good,A empresa possui um bom ambiente de trabalho e bons beneficios
good,"Management was not caring about the employees."
good,Very good experience. A lot to learn. Sometime engineers made mistakes but you have to follow instructions... Nice place to start.
good,"The company gives very good environment to perform. You will be getting higher opportunity to work if you are performing very well."
good,The job is decent and so is the pay. Convenient location and friendly people. A lot of opportunities to learn. Good 40 hours a week
good,"I answered phone from customers to set up tech service."
good,"empresa de pequeno porte com ambiente dinamico, boas oportunidades de inicio de carreira, porem uma empresa com poucos recursos, mas bem divertida ao longo do dia sem grandes estresses e com boas oportunidades de aprendizado."
good,"Empresa em sua parte de benefícios e salários muito boa."
good,"Global IT Providing Remote Support to Internal/Federal employees and contractors worldwide. Support included identification and resolution of issues ranging from Network secure connections, VPN, Antivirus and Computer and compliance related issue. Delegating unresolved tasks and Queries to various resolver  teams depending on the issue."
good,Constant threat of lay-offs and downsizing made for an uneasiness that prohibited positive workflow. Continuous change of Executive Committee and marketing strategy left unaccountability run rampant.
good,"Unisys has been a good experience in terms of learning and growth.  I have had the opportunity to work on a new projects every year through my tenure with the company. As a company it offers very good work-life balance."
good,"As i have worked from home since 2008, I was responsible for ensuring that I kept a proper work schedule. My direct manager was very good, he allowed me to work through any issues and stepped in only when he felt it was absolutely necessary"
good,"Every Monday has to be seen , It  looked great ,everybody with full of energy . Employees over there are very kind and dedicated."
good,Computer Mainframe Products; Defense Computers; Hardware/Software
good,ENjoyed the variety of support / sales roles during my tenure and working with the best of the best in the family entertainment business.
good,"My team is great and we work well together but the company does not provide training on anything. We have been handed several new projects by our clients and instead of sending us for some formal training, we are left to figure out on our own. This is the hardest part of my day. "
good,"I work for Unisys, and it seems to me that it's alright for the managers to give 2-3 people about 50% of all of the work needed to keep the queue running. "
good,I am on a  contract and enjoy working with the team  I have grace under pressure and I love my job
good,On an average day my work starts at about 9AM. Start with first checking my mails and identifying and prioritising the mails. Then reply to the mails based on urgency and availablelity of requested information. The open the calander - start working based on the tasks identified for today.
good,"It is a good experience working with unisys,learned many managerial skills,learned how to think in a typical situations.learned how to react with typical people and lot more experiences..."
good,Management coming from different organizations fail to understand Unisys Corp set values in the market place which results in bad financial growth.
good,Its a good company to work with and best suited for female employees to balance work and life
good,"Uma grande empresa, um bom lugar para se trabalhar."
good,"Interesting work; however, there was little to no involvement directly from the company.  Day to day, we worked for our government client and so perhaps this was just the nature of the job.  Unisys did pay fairly and had good benefits.   Overall was good expeience up to the sudden and very short Reduction in Force terms of separation.   No sour grapes, just would have appreciated 2 weeks minimum notice."
good,"I felt they low ball on pay and will not give a raise after being there many years."
good,"Es un día de constante aprendizaje, invierte mucho en la gente, tiene muchos procesos automatizados, otros no"
good,"Local management is fantastic, corporate management is lousy and expect way too much for the pay provided! They will run you ragged for not much pay and will eventually try to take pay away from you instead of giving you a raise!"
good,"I worked for Unisys in 2 states in field support and desktop support of IT contracts. The company is fairly good for getting exposure to IT field and how career growth to a certain level. But one would have to look elsewhere for decent pay, the jobs I had tend to pay low for less tenured employees and average for experienced employees. Good company to learn at, Bad company for competitive wages."
good,"Alot of favoritism. They will literally fire someone because their favorite employee doesn't like them. ALOT of drama, Management does not know how to communicate they would rather chat and gossip about employee then approach and correct behavior to the actual employee. Don't go there expecting to make friends,do your work and GO HOME."
good,"Reasonable organization. That is what I have to say. Culture is alright. Work-life balance is fine. Job security is good. However, there is no rewards for performance."
good,"If you like working independently and traveling within your home area the job is good.  The people you work with (if you ever get a chance to) are usually great.  Had an amazing manager but they let him go to hire a cheaper manager who knows nothing. "
good,You will be productive because of the non stop clients coming over to your office. But they are too strict and only listen to only one person with regards to your opinion or concerns.
good,"Fresh beginning was fun, exciting, and interesting. The daily grind of sitting in traffic and rude customers on occasion brings damage to the person in the long run. Day begins with going to get the packages/parts for you repair jobs. Not too difficult but is the the constant changes to the schedule afterwards to meet up with client usually at a predefined locations and doing a good job worthwhile. A feeling to challenge being overcome. To simply a glorified delivery man with the ability to troubleshoot and replace problem causing component in computers on location without it being shipped into a repair center or taking into a shop. It is a stressful job to meet extreme schedules due to the fact that we do no know how the schedule will turn out because we don't get them until the day of repair. Which is fresh and exciting until it is not."
good,"good work life balance, not much work in company. higher management is friendly , they do not pressurize anyone. they have legacy products only , not much new development."
good,Good place to learn and enhance skill. Work life balance depends upon the project & team you working in. Professional environment to work and good team.
good,"No annual Pay raises maybe 3 or 4 years apart."
good,Management is not good. Made the process streamline and made huge savings till the management is not able to notice the efforts and never recognize. The Third Party is dominating the client.
good,"I worked in the call center which left my city.  The work is repetitious and mostly by script.  Whether the day was software, hardware or a mix, depended on which clients you supported"
good,"Working for this company is a long term commitment. Many of the technicians have been here for decades. The work requires an attention to detail and constant online training to keep current.  "
good,work on network securities at various location. passed to different managers based on new contract positions. ........................................
good,"While I was at Unisys, I found good success.  Unfortunately the company was in a rebuilding phase and there was a lot change and uncertainty.  The CEO had a good idea of what would work though."
good,"Rules sent down from upper management had a negative impact on succesfull accounts due to rules for employee evaluations, raises, titles and opportunites for advancement."
good,"You are told when to take a break, each 15 minutes. Although lunch breaks are only 30 minutes there is no cafeteria on site, so you must bring your lunch or take a chance on returning late."
good,"Ao chegar em Campo Grande, a empresa tinha uma cultura muito boa, beneficios e salários em dia, treinamento, Global English e carga horaria flexivel. Porém começou deixar a desejar quando entrou um ex coordenador de Call center que impôs a politica do terror e da boa vizinhança em detrimento da competência dos funcionários. Muitos bons profissionais saíram por não ter mais perspectivas de crescimento  ou o crescimento foi minado, por não ter camaradagem com coordenadores e chefes. E para piorar mudou o sindicato transformando o Service Desk em um mero call center."
good,"good work life balance with not much long hours"
good,"Unisys is a good company to start out in, but does not advance its employees very quickly.  There is not a large learning environment and employees guard knowledge."
good,Job was good. Relaxing. But 10 hours shift. Which is too long. And number of annual leave is very low. Which is not sufficient for out station employee.
good,The company and benefits are on par with other defense contractors. Advancement seemed difficult because the government has to increase their fee if you increase in title and responsibility.
good,Little or no training to learn new clients systems and it can only be described as a young persons role these days and not really suited to long serving employees
good,"Good opportunity for growth. travel opportunity, very diverse employees, paid holidays, paid vacation, global company"
good,"I first started working full time at this company. I learned how to assemble electrical chips and place them on electrical board according to Manual."
good,"A typical day of work at Unisys consisted of answering phone calls, typically with very little time in between. On the Mon - Fri 9 - 5 schedule, we were frequently behind schedule which created customer dissatisfaction and a dread of answering your next call. I learned that call center work, even when the customers are corporate employees, is not for me. "
good,"A day at Unisys is very intense, but can also be very rewarding.  Do not expect a lot of help from management.  This environment is more suited for those that are very self-disciplined and confident in what they are doing, and can adapt and work under pressure.  The process is a little over the top and ever changing, which is typical of a management team that evolved in the engineering and technology space."
good,Working hours are flexible as long as putting in 40 hours per week. Work from home is also permitted. Can play Ping Pong after 5:00 PM. Work is somewhat challenging. Recently lack of new projects/products.
good,Not very secure due to lack of federal funding. Management is disconnected from employees. Health Insurance benefits are the worst I have had in 25 years.
good,"Normal work day - start @ 8am finish  @5pm. Resolve all clients computer issues as quickly as possible."
good,Company is going through a massive downsize resulting in knowledgeable talent leaving the company.  Poor communication from upper management to middle management level resulting in confusion.
good,"accounting work being outsource to USA or India, so everyday have to talk to various group of people (in different time zone) to co-ordinate the work to make sure everything being input and process properly."
good,"Pay was market. Good benefits. "
good,"It is a good company if you have 15 years of experience and you are looking for a relaxed profile.Management is not supportive."
good,"Nice Place to work. many things to learn"
good,"Nice place to start to work with, but as time goes by, personal life is killed. Might have to work extra some times."
good,"Empresa de médio porte, com pouco mais de 10 anos de existência, demonstrou ter crescido muito pouco. Ainda tem que melhorar em alguns pontos. No entanto, possui profissionais de qualidade, possibilitando boas oportunidades para os futuros profissionais."
good,"I work here as a Resource Manager past couple of years and have learnt what resource management is all about, apart from that I have also learnt about dashboards, reporting, analysis, Key performance indicators, Service Level Agreements, metrics used in dashboards, etc..."
good,Overall a good place to work. Management changes complicated things.
good,Spent almost 10 years with Unisys and enjoyed most of them. The company changed quite a bit and felt it was time to move on. I learned so much but the atmosphere changed and I was not as happy in later years with them.
good,"I am always interest to learn new thing every day in my life like technology, new tasks"
good,I was an Sr. IT tech. I help close a $6 million deal for a new IT division to open up.
good,large world wide company. excellent well trained co-workers. good out of town training at new jersey or florida.
good,"“Very good place to start"" A very cushy support structure. You have all the time in the world to come up to speed."
good,Unisys was a great stepping stone for me as an individual trying to get his first opportunity in IT. Overall great experience. Remember this is a Help Desk position a lot of answering phone calls.
good,"* Key-in check slip scan to system"
good,"I am sure other sections were a lot better, but I worked in the customer service call center contract. Felt like I was chained to my desk. Having to log in and out on my desk phone was very hard. The people were good. I had a great manager."
good,I was outsourced to Unisys by another company I worked. I did same job for less money. My manager was great. We did not get paid fairly for mileage. that's it
good,I have learned on how to enter data into system. Need fast move and multitask. Need good computer skills and fast typing skills. I have learned how to multitask
good,"If I could change anything, it would be the management keeping the employees updated on changes and development. Overall its a good company if you prefer to work alone and travel. They are not ones to pay much for mileage and will deduct mileage based on where you live and where the parts are located. Personally I get 45 miles deducted every day as they feel as though that is commute mileage to a from the house. Even if you get called out at night and go directly to a site, you will still be deducted for the commute mileage."
good,This is a small 8 employee workforce in Wisconsin. Standby calls and overtime are always needed.The local teams work great together and collaborate as needed.
good,I was able to get promoted from L1 to L2 rather quickly and again to a Supervisor role. I enjoyed my opportunity and time as a manager at Unisys and still miss my agents.
good,Tive a oportunidade de me aprimor mais os meus conhecimentos no setor de DP.
good,They had overtime options to make up being late or missing work with or without a doctors note. Unless you were friends with the floor manager. But I learned a lot from working here.
good,"lots of hours and always on the road for more than 10hrs straight daily no chance for advancement and no raises it really offered no security and poor management very ignorant to the geographical area that I cover they have no idea to what is going on in real-world after 20 years of this and trying as I was the best technician that they had I knew my stuff and then some but simply had no more patience for this job so I left, as this was not going anywhere and I was learning anything new it just became no brainer for me"
good,"Aunque trabajé más de 17 años en la compañía, hace muchos años que dejé Unisys y sería injusto dar una opinión actual de una empresa que ha cambiado mucho en el tiempo, con mucha gente y soluciones nuevas que no conozco y por eso mi evaluación no es ni positiva ni negativa. Igualmente creo que sigue siendo un actor importante en el mercado y que su transformación ha sido buena, ya que después de su debacle aún compite y subsiste e incluso ha repuntado en una industria tremendamente competitiva. Espero no comenta los mismos errores del pasado, que deje de lado su arrogancia, que elija a sus colaboradores por competencias y no por compadrazgos, que valore a sus empleados actuales y potenciales por su experiencia y que no exija productividad a sus empleados sin la merecida recompensa. Sólo valorando y recompensando adecuadamente a sus empleados las empresas lograrán la fidelidad y motivación necesaria para incentivar y mantener la innovación y la productividad."
good,"Shift timings are rotational"
good,i hate writing reviews but this company was not the best as the work place environment goes and the people and the bosses are not the best in the business
good,"Unisys is an ok company it has its pros and cons just like every company, overall the company has been a pleasure to work for and there is room for advancement if you desire."
good,Atypical day at work would be to learn with the process.There are loads to learn and deliver to the client.Trouble shoot the process and aligned with the process.
good,I cannot comment as this was so long ago I cannot accurately comment on the environment there and the working conditions.  manufacturing was shut down some time ago
good,"When I was with Unisys I took my calls form an office on Wall Street."
good,"pay is lousy"
good,"wasn't the best place to work but definitely isn't the worst. One major down fall, I would say for the company is the training, the pretty much push you on the floor and you just learn as you go along but, the learning curve isn't that large so It wouldn't take that long of getting use to."
good,"Good company to work. you can learn a lot of things while working and get a nice experience."
good,Overall I would have to say it w as a job that would allow you to advance based on how much work you put in. The changing hands in Leadership hurt he organization.
good,"Decent unit, somewhat productive. Good leadership.Up tempo environment. Close net employees. Monday is typically the most hectic day of the week. Interacting with customers is the best part about the job."
good,Once a great leader in the world of mainframe and systems integration. Now a technological advanced company with great ideas drive and willingness to achieve.
good,The contract employees are treated well there.  The managers really try to make sure everyone is doing well and feels a sense of culture.  It's not a very secure position.
good,Not organize company. still need improvement with the process for the people job description. Not consistent with the pay day at the same time it really depends on the applicant whether to stay or not.
good,Unisys is a combo of several companies all of which were successful. The integration of the companies plus the trying to bring new talent to the company-at the time I was there-failed miserably.
good,"Sajnos az elismerés gyakran, ha nem mindig elmaradt, így a motiváció is gyakorlatilag lecsökkent, kvázi a nullára."
good,"The pay was average, the hours were great.  I enjoyed driving from place to place doing the jobs assigned to me. The customers that I dealt with at the time were nice."
good,"Good company, but very bureaucratic at the time that I've used to work for them. Actually they have gone through several reorganizations and it is a complete different company now."
good,"management was very supportive of it's employees"
good,My typical day at work would be busy from the time I got there barely could get a teamleader to assist with anything. I did learn how to work in fast paced environment
good,Unisys had flexible working environment and great benefits. It had unlimited sick leave initially which was helpful to employees. Besides the work location at Reston was very convenient.
good,"Greate company when I worked there. Company product and services changed over the years. I worked on BNA Integration testing, Protocols validation and Consultancy services to BNA network implementation"
good,"IT calls can be stressful, to manage to troubleshoot over the phone instead of in person. a lot of training and meetings, early hours, not very flexible at all."
good,"Unisys has undergone a massive tectonic shift and is no longer synonymous with ""Job Security"", although as an individual I have a fair share of growth and opportunities."
good,"Great growth opportunities and internal job postings available."
good,"Sorting of mail, dealing with outside Vendor. Handling for copiers, fax Machines and Post meter machine. Handling Fed ex, Ups and Post Office Mail. Receptionist."
good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar. Ambiente muito agradável.
good,"This was my first job in the IT field. I did not stay long as it was not  a job I enjoyed.  The friends I made there were great, but the environment was not for me."
good,I would update the OS and make sure all programs worked and they still had their data. I learned how to backup their data to the network for retrieval if needed. I enjoyed working with all the different end users at the different locations
good,"Contracted by Unisys to respond to tickets for computer support generated by a help center from calls on the Fox Studios location in West LA, on Pico. The tickets could be software repair, install or update along with hardware migrations, repairs or upgrades.   "
good,The job was extremely stressful because of workload. Especially during winter time with traveling it could be dangerous and time-consuming. Time was very limit.
good,I was so proud to be a computer technician. And I was extremely proud of the people whom I worked beside. Unisys techs are the best in the world. It's a shame that I couldn't be proud of the company.
good,"The people in my group were fantastic and we accomplished as much as we could in the constrained government setting where we were assigned. Unfortunately, the higher level leadership wasn't able to keep the contract running."
good,"Como toda multinacional tem seus pontos fortes e fracos."
good,"Company at the moment has no direction as a hardware or software manufacturer.  Software development has been key, but appears to always lose money.  Company management doesn't seem to recognize faults and how to turn company around into something consumers recognize as for Information Technology support and sales."
good,Senior management focused only on cutting bottom line resulting in an extremely lean staff working with mentality of either do it at any cost or lose job. View of company's declining financial condition and future ratings coincide with cutting key personnel.
good,"key in all cheque details into system."
good,Typical work environment and production. The management are typical and taking care of the employee. Good place to work and learn. The most enjoyable part of the job got to cross train at other area
good,I have not been an employee here for almost 30 years. Any input I could provide would not reflect on this company as they exist today. I do;t see how my input would be helpful to anyone.
good,Manager could not pay me over 9.15 hour.  I was married with 2 children and this would not enough to survive. went repeatedly and began at 8.75 and only made 9.15 at my highest pay.
good,"Day to day work fairly fast paced and constantly re-organizing as it tries to find ways to control costs. Direct management usually very good while executive management out of touch.  Culture is cut-throat due to constant threat of outsourcing jobs to off-shore."
good,Worked for few months but culture and environment was good. Good balance between work and personal life. India management is good but need to be aggressive in market.
good,The work life balance in this company is great. Also the Managers are usually very supportive. Just need to make sure that you are in a productive role.
good,"I only worked there for only a year and it was it was very enjoyable."
good,"Decent place to work, have acquired a multitude of skills pertaining to the tech industry. Work demand is high, stressful, and currently understaffed and under-payed."
good,"Unisys has been in decline since the board let the previous CEO go.  It can't seem to evaluate whether or not its a mainframe company with newer technology, or a technology company that still supports its mainframe customers."
good,I only worked here one year but I met some new friends and learned a lot about janitorial work. The company and people seemed nice to work for.  I would recommend this place for a job.
good,Fast paced environment. Expected to be on the phone to take customer calls  for most of the day. Handled  and met the hardware and software troubleshooting needs of multiple accounts.
good,"I just worked for Unisys about 6 months with developer roll. It was enjoyable to work with team. Great environment to work with. "
good,"Typical day at work is usually driving 42 miles to Pasadena, Tx. one way and providing desk side support for any and all IT issues. I have learned how to disassemble and reassemble laptops. I have learned how to configure Windows 7 and Windows 10 laptops. I have learned how to use Altiris 8.5. Workplace culture is good. Everyone is super nice and professional acting. Hardest part of this job is the driving, followed by getting parts delivered to the correct site. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have fixed a problem for someone and they appreciate the work that I do with a Thank you. I always say ""I am happy I could fix the problem"" because that's what I enjoy doing. Solving IT problems for people!"
good,Unisys provides its employees best experience @ its work place. Work life and personal life balance is perfect. Overall a very good place to work. Fun activities are held every Friday to boost up employees moral.
good,Okay place to work as a contractor. No complaints. Most of the time it was enjoyable.  Just was blindsided when contract ended...didn't know my end date was coming so soon and found out on my way to work....somewhat disappointed and shocked at the same time.
good,I was assigned to client location that service was provided for. In this role i was the sole technician on site therefore i'm unable to comment on the daily work culture of the company.
good,"its a multinational company which i worked service now and it service management."
good,This place processed checks from all of Socal. I didn't work here long enough to give an accurate depiction of the company. The company has now closed or relocated.
good,"Good and positive management were the top priority at the beginning of my career, but over time that changed drastically. Bottom line was that the employees were not considered as a critical component as the years went on"
good,Standardized approach to providing client needs. The company has the ability to leverage delivery of service using it's associated vendors and reputation.
good,They are a ok place to work. I learn a lot about Being a Service Desk Rep. Management was very easy to work with and was able to help me learn a lot about troubleshooting and working.
good,A typical work place. Well management. Good atmosphere to work. Prompt salaries and friendly nature but managers attidue is not good. Work pressure is more than increments
good,Enjoyable work place and fast paced environment. management are extremely helpful. Very friendly environment and very friendly staff.Fortune 500 company
good,"They paid on time.  I worked pretty much alone, my work environment was basically my car and the different location I had to drive to throughout the day.  Never really got a significant raise, never any opportunities for advancement in 5 years."
good,"Work to given targets daily, good communications between staff. Enjoyable social side as many staff have worked together along time. Management leaders encourage prompt work settlement"
good,"Best company for freshers as it offers good platform to know knowledge of industry and help everyone in future aspects."
good,"It is my first company nothing much to say abount the company."
good,"Good place to work have fun and learn"
good,Too much focus on short term business lacking long term strategies. Too much financial control and reporting taking up time to do real business. Realize the value of people but downsizing created insecured feelings
good,A gerência cobrava de seus funcionários o crescimento e produtividade mas não oferecia oportunidades para estas.
good,"The project involved the development and maintainance of mortgage applications for UK Banks. My work involved development of certain requirements by the clients in the best possible way to fit in to the already existing UFSS application. A lot of things to learn as to how things are actually implemented and sent to the clients in the form of internal and external releases. The code was maintained in the Team Foundation Server and usage of WCF,MVC and other controls provided an opportunity to learn a lot about .NET framework. Management gave us an opportunity for an all round development as an indiviual.  The workplace was quite serious with experienced people but they were quite helpful which helped us learn a lot of things throughout our tenure. The company was time bound where we had to stay at office even if we did not have work. But still I utilized my time discussing something or the other with experienced people which made our day. That was the most enjoyable part of our job where a blend of experience helped us to evolve as better human beings."
good,"Good place to work. Parking is bad. Company is cheap. Chairs are very old and worn along with the cubicle walls and they won't replace them. Bathrooms don't have toilet paper a lot. Manager was great. Not much room for improvement. Bonus's based on stats and very hard to reach the highest bonus level and in some accounts, there aren't enough metrics to make achieving the highest even possible. Don't feel like they really care about the employees. Have to work holidays if not enough people volunteer. Forced to work Holidays Unisys will have off, but if the account you work on doesn't, too bad, you have to work. PTO is nice and you start getting it on your first day. PTO was shaved down from 4.63 to 3.5 hours bi-weekly."

good,"Up until 2005, Unisys was one of the great company to work. Share holders decided that earnings were more important that employees and began reducing benefits and perks. Vested pensions were halted and replaced with 401k's. Benefits shrunk and increased in costs to employees.  Many large volume layoffs in the US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand replacing workforce with lower cost / lower skilled Indian and Taiwanese candidates."

good,Good company.  They look out for their valuable contract employees.  I believe that they support DHS in a very valuable service.  Co-workers are nice but you see them come and go because it is a contract company.
good,"Unisys has been around for a long time and has some very experienced people working as L2's, L1's, and Managers. They have great pay but their benefits aren't enticing to new hires or existing employees."

good,"The people are great and have a lot of experience but the average age is over 50 and the future is cloudy.  Unisys has had flat revenue for about a decade and is slowly eating itself from the inside while trying to remain profitable with no growth.  There has been layoffs about every other year which is bad for moral.  They do what they do really well, but are leaders in a fixed non-growing market."

good,"A typical day at work starts at 6am with international conference calls to the USA. This normally lasts until about 11am, I then get to address critical emails and/or staffing matters. At around 3pm my resources in India get to work and I start talking to them, this normally slows down at approximately 9pm which gives me an hour or so to have dinner before my US resources come back online.

good,The employees of Unisys were great people to work with. There appeared to be a lack of vision from the top that created uncertainty and doubt within the ranks.
good,"A ton of good training for entry level but, it's very difficult to move up here. Very flexible in work life/balance but pay was marginal. Get everything you can when you walk in the door because raises are very tough to come by. Your job is never safe no matter how safe you think it is."

good,"I was employed in the Recruiting department for several years. I was very fortunate to work with many outstanding Unisys employees and vendors. The role kept me challenged and I enjoyed the work. I worked for 4 different leaders during my tenure. All but 1 were competent, valued work/life balance, and outright wonderful to work with over the years. Unfortunately, management changed and my role became an administrative instead of strategic."

good,"Unisys offers great benefits, and decent pay. The only issue is that in a time when the economy is booming, they are looking for ways to cut cost to the company, and doing so buy hurting their employees. What i was promised in the beginning is not what i am getting now all most 3 years later. I am making less money per month. And my salary is maxed for my area, so i have no hope for a raise. This is not a way to keep employees happy."
good,The company has undergone extensive transformation over the past decade. Business units perform inconsistently. The company management is very hierarchical and the culture stifled collaboration.
good,"They were good people to work with. The only issue I saw was the culture, but there was no formal office to build anything. I think that was just the nature of the job,"
good,"Typical work day: Managing customer expectation"
good,"There is a good work life balance but growth opportunities and salary not that great."
good,"Every one of my executives and leaders have been great people to work with and for; however, due to shifting organizational imperatives, my direct management/leadership changed 6 times in just 3 years.  I have now been reporting to my current executive for 3 years.  She is a wonderful leader, but is beginning to talk about retirement.  Overall,Unisys is an incredibly collaborative environment.  Drawback is that, with all the organization changes in executive and leadership layer, there is a great deal of uncertainty and downsizing."

good,"As a fresher i joined Unisys Global services, it was great working in this IT firm, could  able to learn about technology and IT process related stuffs."
good,"When it comes to scheduling, with the account I'm on,  they say your given your schedule based on your performance.  I have found this to not be true.  I have some of the best stats on our account.  I worked the same schedule, killed myself to prove my worth.  I got the schedule I wanted after 18 months. Our account changed again and my schedule got changed to a much less desirable schedule. The people that got the schedule I bid for received the more preferred schedule had the lowest stats on the account.  Also after 2 years there a few people whos schedules have never changed. I don't feel like there is any fairness. They have to force people to work weekends. There is no incentive.  It doesn't matter how hard you work, how much extra work you do, or how much over-time you work, there is very little and most times, no recognition."
good,"While in Unisys Federal there was a feeling of being like family and working with a team."
good,I am having a pretty good journey with UNISYS with a relaxed working environment. I have learned a lot being an individual contributor. Unlike my previous jobs where I had to be part of a team. Its been a challenging profile that I had to handle.
good,The Engineering team has dedicated and extremely talented people who I enjoyed working with.  The company's financial challenges make the overall environment difficult.
good,The project I was on started off very disorganized and took longer than expected to progress. Management of the project seemed to be going in different directions according to following set goals. I was able to pick up a few new ideas and skills while working with certain co-workers but everyone never seemed to be in-sync as a group. Getting to work overtime was the perk on the contract while it lasted and working with certain machines was good to experience.

good,"Adquirí una buena experiencia laboral, ampliando mis conocimientos y creciendo profesionalmente."
good,"That’s an interesting question. I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option"
good,The work culture is not so interesting . There is no fun and people are not friendly. There are no any initiatives driven. The focus is to just manage our work.
good,Job Security has always been a problem. every 4 years we change CEO and Unisys changes direction. It has struggled to identify and stick with a path forward
good,"Pros:"
good,Nice place to work with great team members.  Transitioning in the marketplace and new management.  Sales have been difficult in the past 2 years.  Hopeful that new management will do a great job with product launches.
good,"started my IT career here. Several years later no significant pay raise to speak of. Opportunities to work on new equipment depends on what new contracts we pick up. Great culture. Work from home, good work life balance."
good,"Queues here seem to be mostly self-sufficient. Everyone here treats each other like family. Hardest part of the job is juggling additional tasks while still being available for calls. Most enjoyable part is talking to everyone. All the people here are friends, don't see each other as just co-workers."
good,"Trabalhava com atendimento a empresas como petrobas, GE, Unilever."
good,bit high work pressure and no much of returns in terms of money.

good,The company I work for is a great company but unfortunately I am a contractor and do not work at the actual company site.
good,"As a review, I recommend Unisys for people who want to start their career as a service desk or helpdesk specialist. I am looking for more challenge that can help me enhance my technical background, to able to showcase and contribute my knowledge to other companies that can benefit me and them as well"

good,"Working at Unisys started out great and the management was good at providing criticism that encouraged growth rather then berating or belittling the worker."
good,"Great place to start your career and a good work life balance.Though pay is not as per market standards and career advancement is very slow, one can learn a lot here."
good,"At the client and peer level, we are pretty thinly staffed, and yet these are the first roles looked at when cost-cutting is needed.  Instead of hitting the management level that deals directly with the clients, maybe take a look at the number of levels above. Does the CEO really need 9 or 10 layers of VPs/Directors/etc. between himself and the people who are actually taking care of the client?"
good,"1)Good Work culture"
good,"A great place to learn many technologies while working."
good,"Good to begin with."
good,"Good contracting job. Paid me to travel and service computers when they needed me. I was able to pick up many jobs frequently the more I work. Furthermore, the more I worked, the more I was rewarded; therefore, it was good because I worked hard."

good,"personal learning is good, but lack of proper work, work/life balance is really good, pay scale is also good but work is not much well planned"
good,15 years of employment and career growth. Coworkers and management create a strong team environment. Service and support can provide challenges but very rewardable when the repair or project completes. Unisys has a global footprint and a diversified workforce that delivers.
good,I've enjoyed my time working with Unisys. The people are great to to work with and they give you time to learn all you can before exposing you to Technical Calls. Most of the day's are spent responding to end users issues. Unisys is contracted as a technical support branch for some major company's. Assisting multiple cultural and varied technical skill sets with computer and connectivity issues.
good,Unisys is a great career starter in the ICT industry.  The team I work with are great and they are all team players.
good,I handle important part in sales cycle and maintain data in order to enable sale cycle. Its a email based process. I handle 4 different teams which are involved in providing various data inputs. I have learned new aspects in sale cycle and importance of data accuracy. Management is supportive to an extent but are very inflexible at times. Co workers follow a typical cycle of transaction processing. The hardest part of the job is to bring in innovation as people at management levels resist change. I enjoy working with my team as they bring out the leadership in me.
good,"Lot of Actitivities and new initiatives."
good,It really isn't a bad place to work but it seems that they do not allow people to advance or expand in the fields that they are in.
good,It is very energrtic to work on a day to day basis with collegues competing to be innovatiive and delivery daya to day work. The Management is so responsive to new ideas and eager to impkement changes to Operations to ensure quicker turnaround.

good,Good place to work but shady when it comes to reorganizations and reduction in workforce tactics.
good,"From almost day one, I expressed my desire to move up in their company. Empty promises, unfulfilled guarantees, etc., I eventually just gave up. If you need a job, it's okay. If you need health insurance, you're better off buying it and paying for it yourself. Their insurance SUCKS!! It's worse than no insurance at all."
good,falta ucho soporte local y el tema de crecimiento es muy bajo en mexico
good,Perform break/fix and end-user instruction/education on applications and/or devices. Projects are rare and far between. Overtime has to be approved months in advance.
good,I worked there for 10 years the politics were rough and brown nosing and favoritism was strong. If you stuck to yourself and worked hard it was noticed and paid off.
good,It is a relaxed environment but unfortunately there is no career advancement opportunities.There is rarely interaction with Unisys management on daily basis. There is no employee performance evaluation culture.

good,"Typical day was to come in and sign into systems watch job flow and fill out reports for morning send off.  As jobs died during the night, fix and if needed a programmer, give oncall a call to have them fix the job.  Instructions listed in job to which step needed to be run unless directed otherwise by programmer. This was for Molina and SMS800."
good,I love working with Fortune 500 clients.  Autonomous work environment.  Great place to learn new things and take on new responsibilities.  Can be challenging at times because role is not well defined.
good,I worked on the A Series line of mainframe computers.  They were great hardware that could have been well positioned during the dot.com boom if a web server would have been developed that ran on them.

good,"This is a stress-free job, that is very simple, compared to most other call center jobs. They are relaxed on performance and the customers calling in are at work so they are professional most of the time. Truly the best call center job in Augusta. However, upon entering management, you will find that there is not much support from upper leadership and the company cares more for their cost savings than their actual employees."

good,"Good Place to Work and Learn new things in startup where i learned something new in Unisys. Recommended , Even Work culture is Good to work. Good Management"
good,"Organisation de la journée. Contact clients."

good,"A typical day will bring with it as usual , loads of challenges, each day was different and you keep learning, I was able to improve my resolve, management never pressurizes as long as the deliverables are in place, co -workers  bring a lot of fun , co-operation and are from diverse backgrounds.responding to multitude of e-mails,monitoring the SLA, communicating and managing the techs , their schedules, being with your colleagues."

Updates to these requests for monitoring as new technologies are added and changes to required monitoring is needed.  Also supported the company-wide DSView (KVM Management) System.
good,"Essentially you would receive your schedule for the day around 7:00 AM. You could have anywhere between 0-10 calls a day, all varying degrees of difficulty. After you pick up your parts from the FedEx depot, you run the day's calls. You would pick up a lot of skills and new techniques as you run the job, it's a great way to expand your skill set. Down side were the benefits. The company provides, but it is expensive if you have a family. Our call volume had dropped (where i was only getting a couple of hours a day) and any money I brought in went to paying for the benefits. I was getting paychecks of 0.00 and owing the company for medical insurance. Management was great, they worked with you and held your needs first, but if you're not bringing home any money, this job will tear you up."
good,"This job comes with lots of work and it is great!  The days go by so fast because there is always stuff to do and it is great!"

good,Unisys did what they could to promote your career. They offered all types of training to their employees. The work environment was friendly and laid back. You worked together to try and meet the daily requirements. There were good managers and bad managers but your fellow employees were friendly and helpful.

good,"Productive and Fun Workplace."
good,"Decent place to work. Work can be stressful due to multitasking and strict quality guidelines. Probably pays slightly more than your average service desk. There was not enough training before being thrown onto phones. Most people take 3 to 6 months to get acclimated and comfortable with the work. If you can get passed the 3 to 6 month stress window, the job is decent for being a call center."

The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.

good,"I have enjoyed working at UNISYS for my entire career as a senior operator and trainer. The people and the environment made it a pleasant place to work. I would monitor numerous Mainframe and Open systems during my shift. This would include both hardware and software, with some adjustments made with each as needed. Due to some out sourcing and relocating of the workload, I find myself looking for a new location to use my skills."
good,"Overall my time at Unisys was a benefit to me, but I wouldn't go back there anytime soon. I had a manager who wouldn't approve paid time off for me to be there for my wife when my first son was born, so I was forced to take leave-without pay. That was the just one of the strikes I made before I decided to leave. The first was that I did not get a raise at the end of my first year there because I had not worked a full fiscal year; however, I had worked there for most of that year. The last straw was how I was mistreated by my insurance and I was forced to pay for the medical expenses of my son's birth all out of pocket."
good,"Great bones for a company, culture is great for flexibility and breadth of staff that we work with daily = great people/ great location."
good,Provided good benefits and was a decent company to work for. Pay was average to below average which you accept as long as you are receiving good benefits.

good,At the time this was one of the best jobs.  Good pay and job security were all there.  Management was supportive and gave assistance when necessary.
good,I started in the position having never worked on laptops and within six months I was rather proficient with them. I really did enjoy the position as I dealt with issues at the ground level.
good,Met veel plezier circa 39 jaar bij Unisys gewerkt in circa 10 verschillende functies

good,"Unisys offers lot of additional responsibilities to an above average employee, so that he can learn and master new skills and technologies. I was primarily tasked to provide administrative support to Sales Reps of Unisys. However, later I learned more about ERP's and EAI and this helped me to become a software test lead of an application which was used to import Orders to ERP system."
good,"Unisys was the result of the merge between Sperry-Univac and Burroughs in 1987. It was perhaps the best place I worked to learn and understand the IT business and work as a cohesive team."

good,Unisys sold the division off to a private equity company so the review is the same as stated in the most recent job listing
good,Unisys is an overall good company. The pay and benefits are good and most people are good to work with. Their processes are lacking and there seems to be a disconnect between senior leadership and the workforce. .
good,"It is a very good company to start your career. The management encourages you to learn technologies and the hard work is always noted."
good,"benefits, work expectations, support are all strong areas for the company. Experiencing typical ups and downs for an IT Company. Not many opportunities to advance,but management is beginning to address after an internal survey."

good,"Unisys is best place to work and it provides IT services, software, and technology "
good,"Unisys is working hard to grow in diversity, it is a friendly and productive work environment. Compared to what I hear from people in various industries, the benefits and time-off/holidays are generous."
good,"Worked for Unisys on two occasions and both have been contractual. I'd rather keep my work contractual because it is less stress. The managers are very laid back and do NOT micro manage you. Get the job done and no questions are asked. They pay for all your expenses and pay is always on time. I'd recommend the company; however with my experience and combined education (e.g., degree and certifications)--demanding more per hour is NOT unreasonable."
good,"Super working environment "
good,I would recommend unisys the pay just needs to be better...they made me feel confident about going on maternity leave they made the paperwork process easy
good,Nice Company to work with for freshers especially but very slow movements and very slow promotions . BUt work culture and job is good for employees . .
good,Working with Unisys is great due to the flexibility. Management was great as well. The hardest part of the job was being on call when it's really busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people on a daily basis.

good,I've been with the company for 4 months so jury is still out. That being said I have no complaints. They seem to care about their employees. My manager seems to be great at handling any issues that we bring up to him during our meetings.
good,Was not a bad place to work. Allowed to be independent and not micromanaged. Somewhat tough call time standards since you are working with some people and systems that are bit slower than others.
good,Unisys believes in employee welfare along with strong focus on technology. There is a strong focus on process improvement too. Remuneration was average and bit more relaxing environment than usual.
good,"I couldnt wait to leave this company, no help no help no help at all no hlp no help no help a all,, why am i still tyoing here, I dont want to give a revoew"
good,"A typical day involved working on developing and maintaining network management/monitoring tools.  These tools combined commercially available tools from Digital Equipment and ones I developed for the customer.  I learned how to develop extensions to complex network monitoring tools to meet the customer's requirements.   Also learned many low level aspects of network communication layers. I learned how do develop scripts that would port across various flavors of Unix. The workplace culture required a lot of ad hoc adaptation to a quickly changing environment where several of the components of the systems were managed by different divisions of the customer. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the complexities of interdepartmental relations at a government agency.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was delivering solutions that clearly met the requirements of the customer at a time when network management/monitoring tools were in their infancy, being part of cutting edge work."
good,Great people to work with. Learning depends completely on how proactive an individual is. The Work-Life balance is what was missing. Cab facility provided helps a lot.

good,Some of the projects are really good to work in and would be great for career advancement. The teams are well organised and work efficiently without much management which is why work-life balance is good.
good,"Unisys was a great company to work for , as I was there for over eight years. Great work ethic and team players in the organization.. Really enjoyed my time there."
good,Logística de entrega de peças e suporte deveria ser mais ágil.
good,"The job was enjoyable and friends were able to be made that lasted past employment. There was always something else to learn, some new process that required knowledge. Updates and revisions for ticketing system was provided. It was very nice to have a company believe in me and great to work for them as long as I did."
good,"good place to learn help desk skills, "
good,"The people were great, the management was quite good in spite of having been laid off after net even a full year due to supposed call volume being consistently low when it had been consistent for years prior.  I enjoyed it, they paid for instructor led training for a few things which was great.  Had to be on call, which it was quite often I would have to get up at three in the morning to go do a call, but it wasn't too bad."
good,Good company to work for. Especially when starting your IT career. All engineers and management is knowledgable. There's room for advancement as well.
good,"I was a contractor for Unisys, Still I got many things to learn and Working was relaxed,Stressed at times but depends on Volume. Managers were understanding and Motivates to learn more. "
good,"A good company for freshers. The ambiance is good, co-workers are friendly and helpful. I learnt a lot about knowledge and incident management being part of the IT team of their client AutoNation. Fridays are colorful with fun activities and icebreakers to ensure proper work/life balance. Salary and growth aren't up to the market standards at least for regular employees. Contractors get paid better but don't have job security. Overall I would give 3.5/5 stars."
good,"Company emphasizes consistent quality work, certifications, and service to clients. Job security is practically guranteed if employed to work in the Federal Systems group. Managers are dedicated and very helpful especially when a health and/or family crisis arises."
good,"A new learning every day ,with lots of motivational people around who helps with the work .Learnt how a corporate work culture would be since it was my first workplace.Management which highly focussed on employees growth.A great place to work in."

good,"Typical day included project management activities such as maintaining a project plan and issues list, communicating with stakeholders, vendors, developers and IT management."
good,"This was a job with the Department of Defense.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job and made many friends there.  My skills were in very high demand, and I was a valued member of the team.  I worked on a couple of additional projects, and received an award for one of my projects."
good,A lot of repairs to do in this field so something to always keep you busy. Not a lot of room for advancement in career though. Good job to go from day to day though.
good,"It a good place to work at. They can surely improve the benefits package provided to the employees."
good,"My overall experience with Unisys was great! I learnt a lot and got an understanding of the Learning and Development / Training field. My job roles were dynamic and exposed me to various responsibilities that helped me explore my potential. "

good,"Fun at work place, Professional environment and work culture,more opportunities to learn,long shifts(10hrs) where you have to adjust and manage your personal/family time(12hrs for work ,12 hours with family).Politics as usual present everywhere which can be ignored."
good,This was my first job coming out of college and the people I worked with taught me most of what I use today in my work ethic and knowledge. It has been awhile and I am not sure what type of work the company does anymore.
good,"A very organized work methodology is adopted across all domains."
good,The job is very interesting and a nice way to improve your skills on the job. Your area of travel is from Waupon  to Pleaseant Prarie.

good,"I work at a government job site so my opinion is probably not going to be much use to anyone outside of my particular office.  Work/life balance is good, management is friendly and engaging."
good,"Excellent company, nice work .environment, except for the staffing problem,"
good,Management is wonderful here and they are very flexible with scheduling. I learned a great deal of technical work. The culture here is very relaxed and stress free. The hardest part of the job is servicing offshore parties. The most enjoyable part is that it is challenging. Everyday can be something different. The only negative is the health benefits are not good.
good,Good company for those who want a good work life balance.A company which considers its Employees first. Career growth here is slow and no onsite opportunities.

good,"Handling IT request, customer request handling, calls and tickets handling, Resolver chasing, Call taking, Trainings"
good,"Unisys provided me with work experience dealing with multinational cultures and responsibilities. Our in-house Data Center support staff was technically savvy and fun to work with.  The very top level of management had constant turnover so a consistent, loyal, hierarchy of top-down product and services philosophy was difficult to maintain."
good,"A Unisys é uma empresa Global de tecnologia da informação. Trabalhando muitos anos na empresa tive a oportunidade de vivenciar diversos movimentos de transição em resposta a exigências do mercado, sejam elas de origem tecnológica ou de caráter político / econômico / legais / em busca de melhores resultados. Com estes movimentos vêm as reestruturações que exigem adaptações em curtos períodos. As mudanças sempre requerem flexibilidade e rápida adaptação aos novos processos.

good,"Learned the End User Computing"
good,"A day to day work with fun and encouragement"
good,"The last few years have been a ""performance-based contract"". This was hard. You have to prove your performance on every task, met or exceeded the Service Level Agreement, or why it did not. (ie: it could have been due to the customer or us.) Eventually the contract came to an end, in spite of outstanding performance ratings and did not get renewed. This is contracting.
