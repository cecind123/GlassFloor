rating,review
good,relaxed work place. I liked that I was interacting with people majority of the day. not working many hours gave me time for school work. I didn't like being called in.
good,"Helped customers with their purchases, made appointments, called customers to confirm appointments, kept my department clean, managers were fine, coworkers were very friendly and helpful when it came to cleaning the store and making sales."
good,In the salon it was really fun and the needed me all the time so I made a lot of money on my checks especial it being my first job.  When the stop the receptionist position I had to work as a sales associate on the floor which still wasn't bad but I had less hours then when I worked at the salon. But you get 25% off of everything in the store.
good,"I did enjoy my time at work because of my co-workers. They were amazing. Management wasnt too horrible and i loved my immediate supervisor. But, they changed a lot as soon as I left."
good,"its ok when i am there, but i have worked at two locations. loved my first one, second was a bit of a let down in comparison, Company is good, just my current store isn't like my last store. also, trying to move up in the company is a super slow and dragged out process."
good,"Employees and employers are nice people."
good,this was a good first job for me.  I learned a lot about working retail and I realized that working late nights and weekends was not the best thing for me at the time.
good,"There is something about the love in their eyes."
good,"Working at JCPenney's, you never know what you are going to get. Everyday at work is different, it can be really slow one day and the next it is packed. While I worked and currently are still working at JCPenney's taught me that no matter how hard you work, the only person that will really thank you is yourself and your other employee in that department. Another that JCPenney's taught me was that I'm able to open up and have a conversation with anyone and not being the shy person I used to be. The management of JCPenney's is okay you could say. Some of the managers are really dedicated and want the best for employees but others are just worried about there department only and not others. To be honest the hardest part of the job would be having to keep up on the floor and making sure every customer is helped. The floor and the fitting rooms can get crazy all at once. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help the customers find what they need and being able to talk to them and getting to know them."
good,"I enjoyed the work, it was somewhat challenging but rather enjoyable. When I first started we worked 40 hours a week Monday through Friday. We were required to inktag boxes everyday and at the end of the day maintain 1,000 pieces."
good,I haven't worked there in years but it was a classy place to work around the holidays and they were good at training new people. I enjoyed having to dress nice.
good,This is a company that stresses great customer service and that includes a day of training employees on how to approach customers in a friendly and positive way to improve sales and productivity.
good,"This particular job had a lot of flexibility. I was in charge of making appointments for the hair salon , maintenance of the salon, and stocking inventory. I loved this job but during the time I was there our department of Jcpenney didn't have a manager therefore at times we didn't have the guidance that we needed,"
good,"Great work environment, friendly and caring associates and management, flexible hours,  can be challenging at times, It is an all around great work environment"
good,"Department Supervisor. Responsible for 9 employees in my department. Focus was about customer service thru out the entire store. Great people to work with. Management staff was very easy to deal with and speak openly with as well. Being able to coach and train employees was great, because of the interaction with them."
good,I worked here as a holiday seasonal employee which meant the hours were awful. The starting pay wasn't as good as I would have hoped but overall I work work for this company again.
good,a typical work day was standing in the quad and cashiering for me all day. I never got to switch positions like everyone else. I was always stuck in the quad. I learned some more people skills while i was working there. The management was okay. The people were so fun to work with.
good,"liked working there, except the long nights. overall what you'd expect from a big retail store. always gave raises that were earned. good communication between staff and management"
good,Work as sales associate in lingerie department during Christmas Holiday. High pace job and very busy during the holiday.  Once holiday season ended I was offered to stay on as permanent part-time but turned the opportunity down due to small daughter.
good,"Okay place to work for a teenage job, but not much room for advancement. Low compensation for amount of activity required to do job. Employees always coming and going."
good,"Formulate and manage financial plans, sales, markdowns, receipts, unit and cost turn to maximize profit and GPROI.  Team with buying staff to edit assortments."
good,It was great to deal with the customers and get to know them.  There is a great deal to learn about the sales workforce.  This position helped me do that.
good,"An okay place to work at. Especially, for those in school. The only retail store that actually works around your schedule. Thumbs up to that. Not bad though."
good,"I learned that employee personalities can make you want to stay or want to leave."
good,Only worked for a few weeks and then they let me go for no reason. Also I feel they took advantage of me being a minor and they had me doing everything while they will sit at the quad
good,"I worked for JCPenney for almost a year and I really enjoyed my job for most of that year. The workplace was engaging, since it's ""luxury"" retail the customers were generally kind, and, depending on your position, you could learn a lot. However, the workplace itself (coworkers, management) was pretty hostile.. JCPenney just didn't have that ""professional family"" like most workplaces do. As a jewelry specialist I interacted only with jewelry customers and managed the jewelry itself. My responsibilities included bookkeeping, customer service, and sale/event management."
good,A typical day is filled with fun and laughter and while working there I learned to handle situation without management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
good,Jc penney is a good company to work for but in 2008 the hole Francis went part time so they do not have to give benefit and that is why i had to quit i needed a bfull tim job to pay my bills or else i would of stayed there.all the people working there. Was nice all you did was help the customers of what they need ed
good,Very busy worked around Christmas some of the registers did work have the time. Management left you alone until they needed you to do something or go to another area of the store to work a break or fill a shift.
good,"Fellow employees are fun, but there are many unfair rules and unstable hours. Open environment for discussion but not much changes, can be rough days, mostly because it is customer service."
good,"i liked working there seasonal although they didnt even say good bye or anything ,i worked for one last time and never heard from there."
good,"All JCP employees are encouraged and required to engage and interact with the customers, to provide the best possible customer service and build customer loyalty to the company. That was the most enjoyable aspect of the job, and one that caused me much personal growth. I loved working with the customers, having conversations with them, helping them shop, encouraging people, and even building relationships with them. That was very rewarding."
good,As a trainer I conducted classes explaining the systems and assisting with questions. Was always enjoyable to see people catching on to the system and eager to work
good,JCPenney's was a nice place to work. The management is fair. They work with school schedules very openly. Generally positive environment.
good,This was my first actual job. I think I learn a lot about dealing with people in this job. I personally liked it but it was not something that I wanted to do long term. It was just an opportunity.
good,Everyone was nice and the environment was clean and my co-workers were helpful when I needed help and other than that it was fun.
good,"JCPenney's was truly like a family to me.  I enjoyed my time there and loved everyone. It was a great first job, as well i learned so much."
good,"The job is easy. Customers aren't too bad to deal with. It can be boring when it's slow and holidays can be stressful, but overall it's great"
good,Store environment is great with managers who care about their employees and reward them for their efforts.  In-Home Custom Window is a division that has a separate management team that recently realigned districts and managers in an attempt to grow sales.  Daily contact with customers and assigned decorators to assist with orders and resolve issues.  Communication with past customers for repairs.  Interacting with installation dept. daily.  Participation in store meetings to speak to employees about current sales promotions and the referral program to drive sales.  Strong customer service skills and problem resolution; while ensuring that promise dates are met.
good,always enjoyed going to work. every time I had a bad day the employees here would make it good for me. they made me forget about everything. we had so much fun at work all the time.
good,I had originally left this job because of the manager who does the scheduling was very unprofessional . Loved working here when i didn't have to deal with the scheduling manager.
good,JCPenney has been a company that has provided its patrons with quality merchandise for decades.  They provide incentives that motivate the workers to provide high quality customer service.
good,"Working here it was very boring, but easy money. Just help people and stand at the cash register the shift. I couldn't stand the job."
good,"Check results. Plan for the day. Ability to manage through challenges that may arise.  Proactive in taking action to deliver positive results.  Engage associates to model a positive work environment.  Most importantly, I learned how to manage high level and be more productive by managing through my associates.  Train and develop associates to promote and grow as leaders with the company."
good,I loved how my fellow associates were always willing to help and realized that if one doesn't finish we all look bad. Overall great working environment.
good,It was so long ago so I really do not remember much. I was in high school at the time so it worked well for me as a high school-er. I feel that must people who has worked there may feel the same.
good,"a great place to work, the only bad thing about working here is the hours, everything else is great, people are trained well. the management is nice and treat everyone the same"
good,Very nice working team! Got to know a lot of friends and learned a lot about sales skills and how to deal with different customers.
good,"It was the same as working at bealls except slightly smaller work environment "
good,At my location i work with many wonderful people except for some of our top leadership. They dont have very good people skills and dont know how to handle employee situations very well. They focus too much on geting ICAPS (instant credit applications) and not enough on our customers experience.
good,It was great while it lasted. I was only seasonal but the training is great and if you ever need help someone is always right there to help.
good,"Very nice place to work, friendly employees, good managers, neat and clean store, quiet and calm store. Great place just needs better pay. Can sometimes be boring"
good,A typical day in the drapery department was busy and very fulfilling. I learned how to measure for drapes and also learned to cut shades. helped customers order made to measure drapes and blinds. I had very good co-workers that help me a lot and we all just worked really good together. Our manager was good to work with and for. the hardest part was being sure that all measurements were correct. The most enjoyable part was helping customers choose drapery and other items for their homes.
good,"I worked seasonal so there wasnt much to it but seemed like a respectable company and team. Standard rules and youre some-what free, no one down your back."
good,"I worked in the portrait studio as a photographer. It is a job that requires enthusiasm and for you to be upbeat all the time. It can get stressful during the weekends and holidays. The most stressful sessions were with adults, because they are so picky. Kids move fast & frequently so you have to hurry in an attempt to get a good shot."
good,"Definitely get a lot of hours, but very hard to manage working long hours and getting off an hours or 2 later than what your scheduled for. Generally a good place to work and very diverse. Not enough managers though to cover in the stores."
good,If you enjoy people and clothing this is the job for you. Its a great job to work when in school because they can work with your schedule. Pleasant people sometimes.
good,"I always loved going to work at Jcpenny it was a very good job, it was always clean, my co workers were very pleasant, and the managers were nice as well."
good,At jcpenny's It wasn't bad working there. but they need their budgeting and hiring together. I left because they did not give me enough hours because of something that was going on with the company
good,I worked for the company for a span of 6 years through high school and college. I highly recommend to any anyone looking for their first job or looking for something part time.
good,"I work on the loss prevention side of this company, so as far as the retail side, I do not really have an opinion because I have not worked it. However, I will say that the health care could be better. Limited options and I don't really feel like I have any good options to choose from in terms of health care. However, I do love my job through and through. Protecting the employees and merchandise of the store brings me great joy, and makes me feel like I am making a difference. The employees and managers of the store work with us and are sooo unbelievably cooperative in terms of shrinkage, internals and externals. I'm happy to be here. I do however, wish I was paid just a little bit more. I am a full time college student, with a car payment, and trying to make something of myself in the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community, and I will not make it where I want to be in life if I don't have the funds"
good,"During my employment, I was constantly on my feet as well as being productive. Throughout the day on a normal day, I will always be doing something or taking care of a customer. I did love to be employed here."
good,It was a wonderful place to work. Everyone there was fantastic.i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a job. the only bad part about JCPenney is i didn't feel as if there was enough opportunity to grow in the company
good,"This was a great place to work, I wish I could have stayed at this company, but scheduling conflicted with my schooling and it was difficult to correct the issue."
good,They are great working with your school schedule and if you have other jobs.  Great being able to switch shifts with people.  Great place to work if you have kids.
good,"Loved interacting with customers."
good,"It was a great place to work at. I enjoyed getting to know my customers while I was ringing up their purchases, and helping them find their products. The only reason I left is because it was a seasonal job, and I was looking for something full time."
good,nice job gives great 1st job experience employees are great pay was too low. i would recommend this job to others. great work enviroment nice managers and floor leaders great hands on customer service experience
good,"It is a very quiet and mellow environment . Managers really get to know their staff and reward those hard working ones. The schedule was flexible, but not as reliable as you would want."
good,It's a great place to start getting work experience in. The people are great and the manager care about you. Lots of different area you can work in and the discount is good as well.
good,They could do better on pay. Also it would be great if a member or corporate would come down and work in a retail store then they would understand that the store needs more hours to handle the load that they are passing down to them.
good,Working at jcpenney was somewhat good because of the fact that the employees over there are very hardworking people. The store is sometimes organized depending on who's in charge. But overall it was okay working there.
good,This was an amazing company to work for. I loved my managers and coworkers. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for retail work or even customer service work.

good,Learnt new things while working with JCpenny during beginning of the carrer. Co-workers and management are helpful and knowlegable who are always ready to support .
good,"Working here wasn't that bad, just the pay was low. And every "
good,worked as part time seasonal associate in the fine jewelry department. I had previous experience in jewelry sales but other seasonal staff seemed to be uninformed or properly instructed in merchandise. Customers were often not attended to due to the layout of the sales floor being spread out over three sections. It was hard to transition from one item to another with one customer.
good,"GOod work life balance. Strong salary and time off. Below par benefits. Unstable future for apparel side of business as retail industry struggles. Great new CEO trying to undertake major culture change. Was laid off due to major upheavals in structure and team goals. Would not recommend for apparel production, sourcing, pre production careers due to instability in retail."
good,It's a cool place to work with the same time as well as well as well as the other hand I was just asking for a few of them are in town and we can go there are
good,"Typical day at work would be just helping customers and working on the computers. This was my first job so i learned how to handle money, close and open the store, handle a cash register and computer. the management was good, always a manager around to help out and they were all nice. Co-workers were great to work with since you had your own department to work in. There really was not a hard part about the job unless you did not feel good and you had to smile and greet customers. Most enjoyable part was working with the co-workers because it gave you something to do when there was not anything to do."
good,"•	Duties included loading and unloading product in a timely basis, and make sure pallets are stacked correctly. Ensure inbound and outbound shipments are accurate and free of damage, pull and prepare product for shipments efficiently. I used radio frequency equipment for picking, receiving put away and load functions"

good,Worked here during high school years. Not to much to complain about. Decent hours. I did just about everything. Enjoyed my job very much. Enjoyed the people and i loved helping people everyday.
good,"A typical day at work was scanning all display shoes and printing out the report first thing in the morning. Then, I would display any missing shoes and price them with the help of my coworkers. Once the store opened, all display shoes would be organized and we would be ready to focus on all customers. The hardest part of the job was to keep track of all different shoes and sizes customers would ask during the holidays because there are too many customers asking all at once and only a few employees."
good,Good place to gain work experiance and new skills. Lots of hours during the holidays and discounts are a plus. .......................................
good,"JCPenney is a great way to start gaining some experience in customer service. JCPeeney is student friendly and is willing to work with your schedule and produce flexible hours. This is great if you are attending high school or college. The work environment was very friendly, I had great co-workers that I was able to create and build friendships with, over the course of my time here at JCPenney. Most of my managers were very friendly and understanding, with the exception of a few passive aggressive managers that would almost harass you about getting icaps (Credit cards). The problem with the credit cards where that most people either already had one or just did not want one. I hope JCPenney learns to understand that pestering the customer and basically begging them to sign up is not a good look. I was definitely not the ""pushy"" associate that INSISTED you sign up for a card. If a customer said no, than that was the end of it. Another thing about JCPeney is the work load you are expected to do, with the low pay (minimum wage) because JCPenney is so big, keeping the store up and presentable can often be a struggle. Many nights the managers would become stressed when we closed with a messy store. Expect to stay a couple minutes after your original time you are expected to leave. JCPenney is a good first Job, but as far as a career, definitely not. I would use JCPenney as a stepping stone to the real goal you would like to proceed into."
good,"On a typical day you greet customers, help stock the store and clean it up if needed, you ring in customers items and handle their transactions. Co-workers are great. Management is good! Good place to work."
good,"I was a cashier, promoted guests getting a credit card, and put items in order on the table. Most guests were very difficult to work with. I learned some patience but was horrified how people would treat us."
good,"worked stock, and back stock, hard work"
good,"The salon at JCP is a good starting point for new stylist. If you steer clear of the gossip and favorites, you will do just fine."
good,"What made this job amazing was in fact the people I worked with. I learned a lot about running a store and department and also the associates under me with tact and great care. Half of management were either nonexistant or nonresponsive. As part of the management team, I led my crew,  not abandon them. The hardest part of working there was the lack of support and communication. All in all, I truly loved my job and would do it again."
good,A very busy workplace. Customer service was the most important aspect of the job. I learned how to stay structured. It was an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Active busy mostly we worked as a team work, enjoined the company it was a family atmosphere,helpful team work,updated information on services and products, organized plan to succeed in your job and billed Experience,plus a good employee discount"
good,I enjoy helping people find what they need and to bring smiles to their faces. And a pleasant shopping experience. I fell JCPenney really cares about employees and customers equally.
good,A typical day of work emphasizes a focus on physical security. I have learned the importance of teamwork and that morale has a great effect on the impact of our work.
good,Store I was located in was a great building stone for mused however the ladder to climb through their corporate structure was extremely difficult and unless you know the right people you'll be stuck.
good,"I made friends quickly here, management works with your personal life schedule, requests for time off if given in advance are usually approved, company offers competitive pay from beginning of employment, lots of team work."
good,Felt like the manager sometimes used her position to her advantage. Was sometimes reprimanded for things that were beyond my control and I could do nothing about. Overall fun job though.
good,"working for JCP.com was a lot of fun. I got to talk to a lot of people from different walks of life and while i helped them to place an order, they shared stories and experiences that helped my day go by a bit more smoothly."
good,"I enjoyed my time at JC Penney. I had many responsibilities including stocking the shelves, unloading the truck, entering the truck load into the system, taking inventory, running a cash register, answering the phone and tidying up the store. I was very involved in this job and I only wish they had more hours to offer me. I started on holiday staffing and was kept but only getting 10 hours a week after the holiday ended. It's a great job for the holiday but outside of that it's really only worth it to be full time."
good,Management is really helpful especially with working around your school hours.  They are good accommodating you.  It is a fast paced job and your busy all day.  Co-workers are great and help you out a lot especially if you're a new employee.  They welcome you with open arms.  The best part of the job is how fast the day goes by because you actually enjoy what you do.
good,"Overall it was a great job. The atmosphere was also great. The managers were very smart and nice. I learned valuable retail skills, customer service skills, and sales skills."
good,"•	Annual Information Technology Projects, Network Research, Developed, tested, and implemented on-line helpdesk software to track distribution trouble calls and solutions "
good,was always fun and learned alot and had extra training that helps educate me more... loved the environment and people i worked with
good,"Above anything else, this position has taught me to be patient. I enjoy working days and having my nights to myself. I'm not really sure what else to say. Associate discount is great."
good,"Training was good need more but different"
good,I have dedicated over 30 years in a company I have believed in and worked hard to help improve by doing my best job everyday. I feel that I can not longer effectively add value because of consistent changes that do not value the associates which effects the customer experience. (i.e. Consistent cuts to staffing levels w/ increased workload for all remaining associates without adequate compensation or help for them.)
good,"JCPenney was a great place to 'get your feet wet' if you didn't have retail experience. A typical day at work includes assisting customers, operating a Point of Sales system, signing people up for credit applications, returning and/or exchanging items, and straightening the store as the day goes on. I learned a lot about customer relations. The hardest part of my job was ordering things online for people, but the best part were my co-workers; they were funny people who were very welcoming and nice."
good,"I had awesome co-workers here. It was my first job I had ever had and learned how to talk to customers, create rapport, develop the skills I would need for greater job experiences. Learned how to mange time to get things done and efficiently. Learned how to competitively sell JCP Credit Cards due to a daily quota each individual had to meet."

good,"I learned to be very people oriented and how to deal with difficult situations. "
good,I learned a lot about retail accounting and performing data analysis on a large companies general ledger.  It was a great learning experience.
good,I love working with people. I worked in Jewelry dept. mainly but did work every dept. I became part of the management team as far as being a lead of the day. I was not compensated for this position however. It is a nice place to work can be hectic and takes a lot of weekends and holidays away from family. I would have stayed but there really are very few opportunities for growth within a store.
good,"a typical day was maintaining the floor ( folding, fixing clothes)"
good,This is a great job to start out in. MANY opportunities to advance. It was a very enjoyable workplace. This job taught me a lot of customer handling skills that I still use.

good,JC Penney was one of my favorite places to work.  The environment was friendly and there was always something to do.  I never got bored!
good,i will always remember my time at JCP. Not because it was my first job but because they gave me a chance to learn what it means to be responsible. it was a fun place to work and there was always something to do.
good,A typical day was making sure everything was in its place and the customers were having a nice relaxed experience shopping there. I learned how to work a cashier and how to interact with customers. Very nice people to work with and be around. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers and when it would get really busy.
good,I would stock the shelved and do a lot of cleaning. We would sometimes answer the phone or assist a customer with an online purchase.
good,Meeting and interacting with different Customers on a daily basis. Any thing from helping someone pick out an Outfit for a wedding to Camping-Redecorating their home or just to change something around for show.
good,"her i learn stocking , cash register duties these were ver import skills that i learned .......... i think this is all thsat i experienced at this company"
good,Over all was a good job just worked during the seasonal time so was just a temporary job. Hardest part was dealing with all the people during such a busy season.
good,"So much has changed at JCPenney in last 4 years, its hard to compare, but it would be an exciting company to work for. In the 10 years I was there I found the people to be very responsive and diligent at their job. Company was fair in all its dealings."
good,I worked independently however still on a time frame.  I enjoyed the open door access to managers and working at a highly noted hotel.

good,"meeting in the morning , setup your product presentation for customers easy access "
good,"Lots of fun at times unless working with a low amount of help which made it hard.  I went through 3 managers, which made it hard getting used of new managers with different ideas but became accustomed.  Changing to different people, we did have quite the turnover. Meeting new people was awesome.  Dealing with different problems on a weekly or daily basis.  Getting to the knowledge of what needed to be done by contacting help on the other side of the country."
good,It was typically a relaxed environment where interaction and customer service were top priorities. I learned that the customer always comes first. The management was very easy going and fun but knew how to give out duties and get the job done. My co-workers were very team oriented and willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job was staying late at night to fold clothes.The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting and helping people.
good,"fun work place"

good,I really liked working here. I did have trouble with the new store manager though. He was liking certain people and firing the ones he didn't like.
good,Company is very good while I was employed. Manger talks to staff instead of talking at them like most companies. Company has very good insurance even for part time employees
good,To many changes for customers to keep track of. Coupons some days other days a percent.  It can be hard to remember which is which on what day!
good,"Company offers flexibility in scheduling and advancement opportunities. The company is well established and meets the needs of associates, whether they are looking to establish a career in retail or would  like to develop customer service skills that will serve them in other careers outside of the retail environment."
good,"Good job for students or part time employees. Very customer oriented and fast paced environment, but fun and energetic atmosphere."
good,"Had a wonderful time assisting people with suggesting decorations for their home, helping decide what cloths or colors for member's and their grand children."
good,"Lots of potential at JCPenney.   "
good,"JCP was always busy, but we barely had enough workers to suffice. There were only two workers assigned to each department that had to be in charge of everything from register to sizing jeans to checking fitting rooms. My fellow employees were nice though, and I made some lifelong friends there."
good,I worked as a cashier in the children's department and was responsible for the departments recovery. I was also responsible for the day to day stock of the department
good,"I learned to put my personal issues aside and be pleasant and professional with customers.  I really enjoyed working with my co-workers, they were creative people.  The hardest part of my job was organizing the store at closing time.  The most enjoyable was assisting customers to get what they needed and wanted, leaving with a smile always made me feel good."
good,"I enjoyed working at this location. The coworkers were amazing ladies. The customers never got angry, they were very understandable. My boss was a good person. She always made sure all her workers were okay."
good,Great company to wok for. A lot of the time they have challenges for employees that always kept team members on there feet.
good,Laid back place to work really easy going. Not too stressful and teamwork was a big thing working here. Easy to work with other employees.
good,This job is what you make of it. If you are a people person and like to do different tasks through out the day then you will like this.
good,"I only worked there seasonally so there isn't much I can really say. The time I did work there was cool. Training was short. Your job was really to fold clothes, ring up merchandise correctly. Change the displays according to the brand model."
good,I enjoyed helping customers achieve the look that would give them the confidence to conquer the world.   JcPenny and the customer new that your appearance makes the first impression before a word is spoken.  They understood the importance of looking good and being comfortable in your clothes.
good,"The upper management team and the Corporate management have zero care for associates and lower management. They are driven only by the prospect of sales and numbers. Speaking of numbers, as an associate that is all you are treated as; being given no respect. Associates are compensated extremely poorly and are told that their pay is ""competitive for the local job market"". Which is bogus. I don't know why anyone has stayed employed there."
good,"A fun work environment with great people, the work schedule was fitting and management was good. As I worked for JC Penny I got positive experience that I take with me."
good,"Put the the merchandise on the floor"
good,jcpennyes can be a really fun job but you really need to know how to fold and how to sell your product the pay isn't great and the benefits are really bad but what can you expect its a retail store
good,I really enjoyed working at this place of business. It was very fast paced and productive. We were required to keep the store organized and make sure that all items were kept where they belonged. The staff there were all very friendly and make working there so much easier.
good,This is a great place to work. Its a fast paced environment. The only downside is not a lot of room for growth or advancement.
good,"Relaxed place to work"
good,"I had many different job positions. I worked in the Men's department, cash registers, visual department and replenish department. I learned time management skills, worked well with co workers and improved customer service skills. I enjoyed finishing my work in a timely manner. I also enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,"Key skills include: Telephone and front desk reception, customer service, filing, database, and records, making appointments, and handling stressful situations with the clients/ customers. "
good,"It's a fun place to work.  Love my coworkers and the customers.  Flexible hours and overall just a good place to work.  It's always very busy, which makes the days go by faster.  The hardest part is just keeping up with how busy it can be, but to me, that's the most fun part."
good,"JCP is a good place to work. As of right now we have a wonderful boss at store 2436. He makes the job a lot easier knowing that we can go to him absolutely anything."
good,"a typical day at work requires you to restock shelves when needed, assist customers as well as performing great customer service and greeting."
good,"Typical always busy, there was always something to be worked on. Hard part about this job was staying for late shifts, what I enjoyed about this job was gaining new experiences in working with people and helping customers."
good,We had daily morning meetings and exercises before we start our shift. Orders were sent out for me to pull to get ready to be packaged and sent out.
good,The overall work ethic is encouraging. The management at JC Penney needs some work. There are very few chances for advancement in the company. Co-workers are nice and you feel part of a team.
good,I was a sells rep and in anderson sc i started there in 2011 and left in 2013. I really loved being a sell associate working for the company was funny and a wonderful learning experiance for me .
good,The one thing I can say about the job is that they are very considerate and take care of their employees. A typical day on the job is very fast paced. I love how everyone knows their job and is left to do their job. Nobody is being baby sat and told every minute what to do. My co workers and I help each other out to run the store as smoothly as possible.
good,"I love my job but it is very difficult to build my clientel with the store not really promoting salon. we start at minimum wage which is extremely hard to live off of as a parent. "
good,"A day at work consists of cleaning fitting rooms, helping customers check out, or find an item, and constantly putting clothing away. I never find myself just standing around which I love. I enjoy staying busy, and it keeps me on my feet."
good,I was working for the company when the company changed CEO's.  The new CEO was  taking the company in a direction that I was not comfortable with. They phased out a lot of jobs and associates that had worked for long amounts of time were forced to resign.
good,Nice people. Easy training. Get to see clothes. Employee discount a big plus. Customers were a bit rude. Consistent breaks. Lots of pressure to get customers to sign up for the store credit card.
good,A typical day at work was greeting customers and helping them to choose and locate merchandise. Working as a sales associate I learned how to be patient and value the different demeanors that individuals has. The co-workers that I worked with were team players everyone was willing to work together to accomplish the goal that was set or duties that need to be completed. The hardest part of my job was to keep the attitude of every customer is right even when they are clearly wrong and also dealing with the different personalities of customers was also a challenge. The most enjoyable part of my job was being allowed to be involved behind the scenes far as organizing and mapping out displays for the store.
good,Offers the opportunity to be creative and innovative and work with front-line employees to executive leadership.  Continuous improvement and change management to drive lean cultural change.
good,"I loved going to work here even though the pay was not that great. I also had to deal with the outcomes of previous supervisors ethical and poor hiring decisions. My schedule varied but there was always something to do to make your day go fast. Report analysis, daily/weekly/monthly audits for safety hazards and shrinkage control. Daily and weekly store meetings. Offer support and training to your staff when needed including apprehending shoplifters. Investigate all losses, surveillance employees suspected of unethical activities, interview employees who caused a shrinkage and complete case files for future litigation process. Responsible to open/close all entry ways for daily store opening and closing. There is a long list of responsibilities, but this is the main part of the job."
good,I learned a lot and developed great skills working at JC Penny. I was certified to operate multiple types of forklifts and learned everything about working in a warehouse.
good,"JCPenney really is a great place to work in Terre Haute.  The salon is especially fun, as it is an interesting group of people who love making people happy and look good.  My manager is one of the nicest people I've ever met, as well as the store manager.  And I really do enjoy taking appointments, making clients feel special and helping them leave feeling wonderful.  I also enjoy the merchandising side of it and the general managing of the front desk.  I'm glad I've had an opportunity to work in a salon setting."
good,"Interacting with customers and providing support to other sale associates."
good,"A typical day at work will be just making lots of collection calls throughout the day and taking payments."
good,I worked as temporary sales support. I stocked items in stores and back as well. (see work exerience) I also worked various hours when needed because of the holiday season. Job was seasonal only but it sure was a great experience.
good,I was in the back room stocking all the shelves to get them ready to be put on the sales floor. The co-workers were real nice if i had a questions they did there best to answer them.
good,"Walking around. Apprehension, district mgr was awesome. Management helped Loss prevention when suspicious ppl were in the store"
good,Very happy I got into loss prevention. It's a pretty exciting job dealing with the situations and people that you come across almost daily.
good,"JC Penney inspired you to perform your best every day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, assisting them with understanding everything from the layout of the store to product information."
good,"The customer service center in Pittsburgh is no longer there, but I enjoyed my time there.  They provided flexible schedules and rewards and incentives to improve performance."
good,Wish I would have been able to stay with the company. There was a little confusion about promotions and relocation. If your into the good group you'll be taken care of. Training for this company is failry lacking unless you developed in that company.
good,"JCPenny was a okay place to work for. I worked in the children's department for the holiday season I only stayed there for the month of December. The mangers are nice people, its nice staying on the floor fixing up stuff and helping out costumers and ringing them up. You get a 15 to 30minute break depending how long you work which is not too bad. If you work hard, are organized and know how to ring up people with ease; then this job should not be too much trouble for you."
good,Managers are very motivating and show appreciation for their associates. They are always pushing us to do our best in customer service and making the store look perfect.
good,"JCP is a great place to gain experience my job is pretty simple. I organize and fold clothes, i operate a register, deal with money, and do projects. I also deal with some complicated customers on a day to day basis but my coworkers make the job more enjoyable. Working at JCP has been good thus far so if you're looking for a job i would definitely recommend to become a JCP associate."
good,"I work at two different stores. The first one is now closed because of financial struggles within the company and the rent that was paid to the facility, but the people and management were wonderful. The other store was the opposite. They did well financially because they were bigger, but the people (other associates and managers) were not friendly or courteous to customers or other employees. I am not saying that all stores are this way, I am just saying that I was not prepared for the difference in attitudes going from one store to another."
good,"I absolutely loved work at JCPenney even though there were tough days it was a great job. In a typical day I'm interacting with a 100 customers or more depending on the call volume. When I worked there I learned that I like the call center environment. I also learned different ways to handle customer problems, so that at the end of the call both the customer and myself would be happy with the solution. While working at JCPenney the management team was very helpful; they were definitely willing to work with their employees in all aspects, whether it was something with the company or if you needed time off the something they were willing to accommodate. I had amazing relationship with my co-workers we all helped each other; if someone had an issue they couldn't handle and we couldn't find a supervisor we were always willing to take over a call and figure out a solution. In the beginning the hardest part of the job was trying to solve issues because you had to be quick, but as time went on that became easy. The most enjoyable part was having an amazing team behind me."
good,At JCPenney I have grown throughout my years as an associate here. I have become a better merchant as well as a more responsible individual. The skills I have learned here will carry on throughout my life.
good,I loved my job as an area manager but the compensation was poor for industry standards.  The management was great and everyone worked well together.
good,"Interview, train and coach store loss prevention personnel "
good,"Working at JCPenney was a lot of fun, lots of interaction with customers and coworkers. The pay was not great, but pretty even with other retail positions."
good,"JC Penney, for me, was a normal functioning, easy to understand department store. The company's mission was very important to management and associates all the same. I felt that we were all on the same page and worked as a unit to fulfill the needs of our customers. The job came with great consistant incentives and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Nice place to work, good training, worked with good people. Not far away from my home, enjoyable work place. Variety of work hours and nice pay."
good,Loved working with all of the different people. Each day was different from the other. Loved making people happy when they left.
good,"Managing the cashier, and customer service. Management is great, and co-workers are very friendly. Enjoyable part is meeting new customers, and learning new things while on the job."
good,The penny's I worked at was an older store so the layout was not as customer flow friendly as it could be and management was not organized.
good,"unload product an relabel the product then package an then palletizing for shipping an receiving,co-workers was fun an energetic."
good,"Provide exceptional customer service and satisfaction, keep store looking up to the core standards of JcPenney, experience the value of a retail job."
good,"The management will tell you everything you wanna hear them tell you, but then a month later take it all back. They will lie to get what they want."
good,Great starting job to learn how to interact with people and how to read people for sales. Not a career job but a starting place.
good,"The work environment is enjoyable. I was able to learn multiple and various areas of how a retail store is run, from working with the public to how the merchandise and signing is done behind the scenes."
good,"A typical day at work includes straightening up anything that's folded or has fallen off the hangers, checking out customers, cleaning out the dressing rooms and putting everything back."
good,my experience working here was fairly present. there was always something for me to do and I was always excited to go to work and take on any new tasks they had in store for me.
good,"A typical day at work is slow during the morning shift. I usually come in thirty minutes early to put away my belongings and have a cup of coffee. Ten minutes before the store opens all morning sales specialist and management come together for our morning meetings which are always fun. Management goes over daily sales goals and acknowledge sale specialists that opened credit applications the day prior.  After morning meeting all sale specialists prepare the store for opening and greet customers with a smile. Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was competing for credit applications. With encouragement from management I was opening 5 - 6 credit applications daily. Which is really good, that is 25 - 30 credit applications weekly. Eight months after being hired, I was awarded employee of the month!"
good,For anyone who has not had a job before and needs to learn the fundamentals of working at a job this is a great company. They work with school and life schedules.

good,Taking Maternity infant and children couples families and etc sailing other store products keeping store organized and clean
good,Easy work flow as well as enjoy the work environment helpful team members. when understaffed accomplishing tasks on time.
good,"I had the unique ability to do whatever I wanted really, I had about 6 managers that I reported to infrequently. Main duties included managing the changing room and putting clothes away. By far my best job experience due to lack of supervision and lots of leeway. Team Members were friendly and enjoyable, only one manager stood out as being uncomfortably superior to everyone. All in all a good work experience."
good,"Cashier, took care of the costumers, worked very well with others, I enjoyed helping the costumers find the things they needed."
good,"JC Penney is a great company to start with. They value hard workers and reward great work. Co-workers are easy to get along with and every day is enjoyable. Management is on top of their staff, helping the store run smoothly.Since I have been with JC Penney, they have trained me in many areas; I started as a Shoe Associate and worked my way up to Visual Team Leader, with the guidance and training of my managers and supervisors."
good,Learned patience in dealing with customers. Learned info on new styles and how to arrange merchandise  for new stock.
good,I had a good experience while working at JC Penney. I had steady work hours and the people were pleasant to work around.
good,Never a day when we were not buisy filling orders my co-workers were freiendly my boss was a good boss gave us a hard time sometimes but we always got our work done and had good numbers the next day
good,A typical day at JCPenney was productive. I always had something to do. I learned how to interact better with customers and assist them with anything they needed. My co-workers were very helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and making new friends.
good,"Provided customer service, assisted customer with any/all questions, organized department, operated cash register. "
good,I found it really enjoyable to work there. The atmosphere at the store was one of friendship and family. There were customers that came in daily to shop so that was nice as well
good,"a typical day at work starts at 5:30 am. receive the daily assignment "
good,A typical day is to help the client to the best of your ability and make them feel comfortable and welcome. I learned that getting to know the clients on a personal level made the job more fun because you were able to have conversations with them on a personal level. Management worked hard to make sure everything ran smothly at all times. The stylists were great to work with. They all had different personalities and it made for a very universal atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by customers. Just being there was enjoyable. Everyday was different than the day before. New and exciting adventures everyday.
good,Jc Penney Optical is a wonderful place to work.  It is very rewarding because you get to help people feel better about themselves and they get a chance to see better too.
good,"My experience at JCPenney was a pretty good experience.  A typical day at work was usually productive assisting customers with questions and selling quality products to them.  I learned how to build character and learned the value of earning money.  The management was very well organized, they were always there whenever you had questions or needed assistance.  My co-workers were great, we worked together as a team and helped each other out.  To me the hardest part of the job was sometimes dealing with the some of the customers.  Sometimes customers would make things complicated whenever you were trying to check them out and they would they would try to use expired coupons.  Or the times that you would have to go search for shoes that would sometimes have a missing mate.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and earning some extra money."
good,"it is a fast paced environment, especially in the holidays. Takes a lot of energy and dedication. You need to be on your A game and work hard."
good,everyone is so friendly and welcoming of the new employees. the store manager always has her door open and the whole management team is prompt to help with any issues you may have. the customers are always friendly. the company is overall great to work for.
good,"I worked in Arcadia California for this company , it started off as seasonal after my first week the company hired me full time."
good,Assisted clients and maintain clientele while styling their hair with all of the latest trends. Sold products to the consumers and attended booking clients for future appointments.
good,"A typical day at work I provide hair and nail series to out guests. I have learned many people skills, and how to handle difficult situations. Management could use some help and guidance, in my opinion due to a lack of knowledge. The hardest part of the job is recruiting guests to come in and receive services. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing what I love and doing what I know I was born to do. See the smiles on my guests faces after their service is someplace is the highlight of my day."
good,i worked at jc penney's when i was younger and not only was the company a bit different in a better way the management i was lucky to work with was awesome. i still like working at penneys its just the store i work at in panama city on the beach not only has a store manager that is a horrible people person he also concentrates so hard on getting icaps (credit card applications) that he dosn't realize the rest of the management team dosn't know what they are doing due to his inability to lead properly and when your leaders don't know how to lead or being held back from leading it causes major upheaval within a store.. i hope indeed alerts corporate to these problems
good,"The team I'm on is the first team to open the store. We would get to work right away. Some days I would have to unload the truck and sort the items. But most of the time I would have to look at an ad in the paper, scan the item, and display what sale is beginning. Sometimes it would get stressful because I would have to cover so many departments is five hours. But I loved it because it gave me a change to learn the store better so when it was time to open, I could easily help the customers."
good,"I am very happy with all the people I work with, the atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing for the clients and the stylists.It is very easy to get clients to come in and sit in your chair and for you to make them very happy with themselves when they walk out!"
good,Very busy store especially during the holiday seasons. Management made sure we had fun while working but also made sure we completed our job the best way possible. I learn that customers are rude and should realize that the employees are working to pay bills just like themselves.
good,"I liked the job itself, however because of management, I am choosing to leave. I also did not like the fact I needed to work on holidays. But everything else about the job was great!"
good,Nice place to work but overall not a place to build an career. Co-workers can be disappointed by management. A typical day at work would be slow pace. The hardest part about this job was being let go do to a budget in sales.
good,"A day a Jcp is good like talking to customer.  What i learned  is that jcpenney deals  all across the nation and learning how many people love there product.  Management was a great team will do anything to help the employees.  My co workers, we were like family.  The hardest part of the job is  telling  a customer that there credit card was declined when they are trying to purchase and item.  The most enjoyable  part of the job is when i started  working from home."
good,"My day is either busy or slow.  I am in a very different department where traffic patterns vary.  I will either be busy or no customer traffic for days.  I have learned a great deal regarding different window treatment options for all kind of applications. Management is okay, we do not receive a lot of support as there is only two of us and when one is sick and the other is unavailable, we have no back up. My co-workers are great people who truly care about the customer and their experience. I am ready for a change because the nature of the business is so varied and we work on commission so it is difficult to manage your finances."
good,"- I have found that there is never a typical day at work; there are some days with back to back meetings, some days that are filled with writing orders and monitoring shipments, and some days where I assort collections by reviewing sales and implementing strategies. "
good,"Everyone, I met there and worked with are awesome. The pay is average. However, you gain a lot of knowledge about optical."
good,"Provided friendly and courteous customer service, Cash handling with cash register, stock and inventory control, retail sales associate"
good,I like working for JCPenney because there is always something to keep you busy. There is a pretty good flow of people shopping and you can recruit them to come in the salon and get their hair done.
good,I looked forward to going to work my dept manager was very supportive with my decisions.
good,i learned to lead and promote a productive work place. its a great place to get connected.
good,"The management system is a little one sided when it comes to certain aspects or employees. But overall, pretty good company."
good,"When it was busy, it was extremely busy, no time to hardly even think. When it was dead, it was dead. Typical retail store, soliciting credit is expected. Recovering the store when it isn't busy is also required. The environment was okay, managers were inconsistent, some were more friendly and laid back, others were really strict"
good,was a awesome place until they made changes and got all new management
good,"Very clean, professional neat place. Very organized and well maintenance"
good,"JC Penney was a great place for me. I experienced several life changes which prompted me to re-arrange my priorities. That being said, I enjoyed having a special skill, but my professional responsibilities began to have a negative affect on my quality of life."
good,"A typical day included ringing up merchandise & engaging with each customer. We had a good management team. I cared for all my co-workers, I consider them really good friends now. The only hard part of this job was the feeling that your best wasn't enough. I learned that everyone makes mistakes & everyone deserves a second chance when they have had time to grow & learn from their mistakes."

good,"Greeted customers, answered any question about product and merchandise, stocked and inventoried SKU's, assisted with the display of the store, setting up displays, dressing mannequins."
good,I really enjoyed working for the company which has great team players and much ability to advance in skills. I mostly enjoy listening to my clients while i am doing their hair and making them feel like royalty when they are in my chair.  The hardest part of this job is the reality that the company is losing business due to the economy which in my opinion doesn't make me feel like the job is secure.
good,"The day would start off with going to a station where the merchandise was located.  I've learned the different types of diamonds, gemstones.  The hardest part of the job was acheiving commission, a person has to sell a lot of jewelry in order to make decent pay.  The most enjoyable was showing different types of jewelry to customers, and letting them try on the jewelry and discussing jewelry as a birthday gift or a Christmas gift for example."
good,"typical work day starts with me clocking in and on Mon, wed, fri I unload our shoe shipment and stock them in the stockroom. while I do this throughout the day I may be called to another department for help as I am cross trained in nearly all departments. when I do not have the truck to unload I help keep the stockroom organized and assist with customers. I have learned how to effectively multitask, cashier duties including opening store credit cards, self management and effective team communication. the management is very good and keeps up team spirit very well as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the physical demands and occasional hectic days during big sales and holidays.

Folding clothes, putting merchandise from fitting rooms away, and greeting customers was a typical and enjoyable day for me. I learned great customer service skills as well as multi-tasking quickly while being efficient. Management was always around and dependable when it came to customer service. However, as an employee I did not always feel that management listened to or valued my (or coworkers') opinions. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that I did not fall behind in the fitting rooms while maintaining a close relationship with the customers and their needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was, by far, making sure that every customer was happy with my service and found exactly what they were looking for."
good,Loved the people that I worked with and the job itself was excellent
good,I worked in customer service before the company got rid of it.

I learned a great deal about how to deal with irate people and how to maintain myself, how to train and coach others, how to be a mentor. The best and most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers, we were like a family and that made work a great place. The hardest part was dealing with people who treat retail and service workers as if they were less valuable than them."
good,• Catering to the public
good,"This is your typical retail store with some high tech tools. We have ipods and ipads that we can check customers out with. Most everyone that works here are fun and easy-going. Sometimes customers are difficult, but that is just part of the job. Making the store look perfect at the end of the day is a must, but I actually don't mind. Its nice to see the before and after."
good,The job was ok. A lot to do for little pay. Co-workers weren't very helpful. Management sucked.
good,"Although I am blessed that I had the opportunity to work here, it was really a temporary position til something else was found. However, during my employment here, I got the chance to meet many new people. Its a great work place for someone who is just starting out or for someone who wants to retire. You have to work hard but that goes for any company you work for. The company offers different opportunity for those who inquire. The product is good as well, you are not selling products that are poor in quality. I'd recommend this company to anyone who is just starting out to get a job."
good,While working at Jc Penny I was a customer service rep. I was responsible for helping customers with their everyday needs such as assisting them with help in the fitting rooms and cashier.
good,No two days are the same and the environment under the new leadership is very dynamic
good,Door to Floor team is a really fun easy-going group that gets the work done. I learned a lot of about JCP and retail through this job since you stock all the inventory. The Most enjoyable part of this job is having so much of the day left after work.
good,I like working at jcp. its always something to do and problems to solve.
good,"There is never a dull moment when being a sales associate at JCPenney. As soon as you arrive to start your day you have many tasks to complete, but still making the customer your number one priority. Attending to customers, restocking, and fixing merchandise. Co-workers are easy going and helpful, as are the supervisors and managers. Hardest part of this job would be keeping composure when faced with a very unsatisfied customer, and the holiday season is hectic and draining."
good,"Performed basic bookkeeping, inventory, and promotional sales setup"
good,The people were fun to work with. Most of them knew their job well.
good,I really have loved the new changes JCP is making and how colorful and fun the store has become. I think we have a much more relaxed atmosphere than that of other stores. I love being able to go out onto the selling floor and do whatever I can to make sure the customer has the best experience they can recieve. I think that treating a customer like a person and not a sale is one of the most important things we can do in sales.
good,Fun place to work but difficult due to the emphasis on getting credit applications
good,"JCPenney employees really loved the Company and I met careerlong loyalists in whose eyes the Company could do no wrong. People worked hard, were down to earth, and -- with the exception of the occasional snotty manager -- very supportive of each other's professional development. December ""holiday"" parties were amazing. Employee discounts were 15%, which is so-so, but twice a year employee shopping nights easily got you 40% off. People either loved the industry or they didn't. Lots of attrition at the entry level, but those who stayed tended to stay for a long time."
good,suggested hours and the hours you get may differ. Some management was nice and others were cranky. Most co-workers were willing to help - older employees wouldnt help you. Most enjoyable was meeting new guests and obtaining friendships from the ones that came in regularly.
good,"Had promise of promotion to supervisor and management, but resigned to pursue a career in my field of study."
good,"Overall this was a good place to work, everyone was friendly and seemed to enjoy their jobs."
good,Tagging and re-tagging of products. Hardest part of the job was lifting 90 lb boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a co-worker working directly across from me.
good,"I've learned so much about business and retail while working at jcp. I've been fortunate to work in Marketing, Finance and IT which has made me a well-rounded professional. Additionally, I've been blessed to learn from many smart people from a variety of backgrounds."
good,great work environment
good,fun work enviroment.
good,"My time at JC Penny I enjoyed it. To know that when I came to work it was always a good environment and positive. I've learned how to handle cash more and better knowledge about fashion, like what's the new trends, what colors what's best for you, how to piece outfits together. My Manager and Assistant Manager were completely nice. As them being older and having more Experience in the retail/fashion field I learned from them. My co-workers I loved because we were around the same age and enjoyed the same activities, plus some I already knew prior to working there. Hardest part of the job was dressing the displays."
good,an overall good experience and good co workers. work with a diverse group of people that makes you grow professionally and personally
good,"management was horrible, never helped when i needed them instead of helping you push toward goals they would call you out about it at the daily store meeting."
good,"Learned to provide excellent customer service, the use of cash register, and visual presentation for the store."
good,"great place to work, but want to get back to a bit smaller setting and wish to relocate to the Charlotte, NC area."
good,"Great co-workers to work with, just not busy enough to maintain full-time hours."
good,"I worked at Penneys through both my undergraduate and graduate career. For the most part, the managers were flexible with my hours and understanding that I was a student and could only work a certain amount. The discount was a perk as well."
good,"Start the workday with our morning meeting to let us know how sales was from the following day was and customers surveys. I return to my department to complete my daily task which is greeting and helping customers, ringing up their sales, informing them about the rewards and benefits JCP has to offer. Oversee the department when not at the register."
good,"They recently made a lot of changes at this company. Dispite all of the changes, it is still a fun and great place to work."

good,Managers and supervisors were very cooperative. Hours were flexible.
good,"Always busy, able to learn new things. Very friendly associates"

good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers. They teach me something new everyday. There is no hard part of this job, everything is simple to learn."
good,Sold clothing and managed specialized customer sales. Best part of the job was putting together outfits for the customers to accent their best features. This was part of the specialized customer sales that I provided.
good,"My day always started with a bang and always ended with a bang. I would come into work and complete the payroll report then answer demanding emails, check the staffing needs and staff as needed, get an orientation together that was weekly and compose walkthrough. I would say the hardest part is not being able to take some personal time because the day was non stop. I dealt with very easy going coworkers which made the job a little more enjoyable. I learned a plethora of patience and endurance. At the end of it all I enjoyed meeting different people from every different walk of life."
good,"Cashiering and working in customer service was a great job. It helped me more with my communicating skills and being more hands on with people I interact with, because I would deal with different people through out the day."
good,fun work environment easy to get along with co workers but it was a sesonal job
good,Typical Day- Keeping customers happy and department clean.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is makimg sure the customers have a pleasant shopping experience and want to come back.

I was responsible for hiring and training over 250 employees for the grand opening and then the retention of 120 after grand opening. Daily I was an assistant to the store and Operations manager. I provided customer service and was overseeing the front end.
good,"People that work at J C Penney are like family. After working there for 11 years, I have learned almost every department in the store. The hard part of working at J C Penney is working on holidays but the best part is that you are surrounded by good people every day you work. This helps to provide even better Customer Service."
good,learned the value of customer service learned to fold clothes to JCPenney standard. you will meet a variety of different people also management can be at time annoying but it comes with the territory hardest thing about job dealing with problem customers and doing so with a smile
good,"worked for JCPenney on and off for 8 years. They had a family type work inviornment, but unfortunately I was under a supervisor that made it very hard for you to do your job to the best of your abilities."
good,"I transferred from the women's department to the windows/home department over the course of 4 years. I have enjoyed working with the employees as well as the leader staff. The hardest job about the job is satisfying the customer, but once you do, it is satisfying to yourself as well."
good,"Interesting and a non-boring work place because every single day in every single hour I'm always meeting new people. It is a relaxing job environment with great co-workers. I have learned and growth a lot in customer service and about the company's need, purpose, and brands."
good,"A typical day at work included straightening and folding merchandise, hourly checks of fitting rooms to assure cleanliness, assisted customers, and ran cash register."
good,I do not recommend persons with disabilities to work for this company. I didn't get treated with respect. many complaints were made to me on my zoning but I wan't trained for zoning as others were in a group. There were conflicts with my job coach and superviser on how much was to be expected to be done in the time frames of work. List goes on
good,"Typical day while working at JCPenney's was very exciting. I learned so much while working for this company, I was trained to operate a cash register and my communication skills became very good. The management was very friendly. The hardest part of working here was dealing with rude customers and the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people all day long."
good,"The employees were very friendly. The pay was really low, and the work was very hard almost slave labor wages. This is not good consideriing this store was designed to service and support middle class. the hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day and hauling heavy christmas package boxes."
good,Overall a positive working experience. Over the years I have had multiple promotional opportunities and options for career change.
good,"This was my first corporate experience. I have grown in experience by learning to be a team player, and a loyal co-worker. I proved that I am willing to jump in and learn new roles as well as excel in roles that I was already involved in."
good,"Flexible schedule, only four days a week. I got a good experience working with different kind of customers selling the store products. Managers were always supervising our job and performance. Co-workers were very difficult. The hardest part of the job was to complete every day the amount on sales. The most enjoyable part was the schedule flexibility we had at work."
good,"Seasonal employment so no job security, learned excellent phone skills"
good,great place to work nice environment wonderful immediate boss
good,Most days I will open the registers at my work station. I put clothing away and straighten when I'm not busy with customers.
good,"JCPenny's was a great place to work. Most of the people that worked there was extremely nice and most of the customers were also. I would make sure all of the clothes were sized, folded, and properly placed on the hanger. I would also take clothes from the dressing room and place them were they belong and ring up customer's purchases. I loved my co-workers, they were very helpful. A lot of times there would be confusion on sale items, coupons, and other perks the store offered and they had no problem with helping me with questions I had trouble answering. The hardest part of the job were the co-workers who did not want to participate, although there were few and they did not last very long. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, is when a department goes a whole month without a safety hazard. Then there's a safety drawing for a $50.00 company gift card. Co-workers are helpful when assistance is needed in other areas. Management is somewhat still in training, due to procedures changing quite regularly. The hardest part of the job is, trying to cool certain areas of the warehouse off in the Summer. I learned how to log on the system to start the garment counter/sorter, and, to make certain that the count is correct, and the sku's match up, as to what the system is displaying on the monitor. A typical day at work would be, when the counter has 4 too many garments per slot, or the sku's don't quite match up, and the system has to be stopped, in order to manually remove the counted garments from the sort line."
good,Days working at JCPenney go by really quick when they are busy. Working there I have learned how to work with customers and it's helped me become more social and talkative. I got a long with all my co-workers everyone was very enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is that they can't give many hours and wished they could have better pay. I enjoyed helping the customers and making sure they left the store satisfied and had the best shopping experience.
good,"Great variety of work, merchandising, customer service,store recovery,signing, marketing, interaction with associates and customers."
good,"Work performed included working cashier station, surveying the floor for problems or customers with questions, helping customers find what they are looking for, and folding and stocking clothing items."
good,Unload merchandise off truck every morning. after we unloaded materials we stocked the warehouse and then the store
good,JCP is a great company to work for. A typical day at work is coming in and checking the floor because the merchendise changes daily. You help customers find what they are looking for. Ringing the customers up and making sure that their experience was a great one. Management is there to answer any questions and they are always willing to help when needed. Co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is the customers and pleasing them the best part of the job is the customers.
good,The company strives to be Americas shopping destination. The employees work as a team to achieve goals.
good,"Analyzing sales, identifying opportunities, creating business/financial/merchandising/marketing strategies to improve business and create a more engaging environment for the customer."
good,I was putting out new shoes and selling shoes as well. Also we had to get people to sign up for credit cards.
good,I'm working harder than ever in a climate that is more ambiguous than ever. Our leadership believes the best thinkers and leaders come from the outside. This is a sad revelation for me. I'm too young in my merchandising career to get sidelined and I've demonstrated that I'm more than capable.
good,I liked meeting the people and enjoyed the work hours. My duties allowed me to open and closed the dept I worked.. I was in the shoe apparell dept.
good,"Results driven organization with room for upward mobility. A typical day at work involves review of the store's long and short cash for the previous day, associate discount and gift card transactions and the shrinkage report. Also asset protection which includes the surveillance of merchandise is done by direct observation and CCTV. I learned a lot about retail especially profit and loss concepts.my co-workers in loss prevention are mainly holders of bachelors degrees in criminology, security management and criminal justice and are driven and dedicated to shrinkage reduction. The hardest part of the job would be apprehending shoplifters as the risk of injury to oneself is unknown. I enjoy most the gratification felt from executing a safe but affective apprehension and seeing the appreciation of my team for my efforts."
good,"Systamatic program ,wonderful co workers.Very fast paced work enviorment. time schudule on the recieving and merchandise can be stressfull. Love doing the visual part of the job dressing the forms with the new garments also enjoyed making the sales floor look it's very best by changing fixtures ."
good,"Worked for this company for 5 years, and every time a new manager came in (3) things had to change to his or her specifications. This meant the associates had to change positions, often leaving areas they worked best in, to areas they did not know. If they failed in those ares they were let go, even if they were with the company 5 plus years. There was no loyalty to jobs well done, or commitment by upper management. I once loved and was honored to work for a company that stood for it's costumers needs, and had top line values. But over the past 3 years the company has gone through major changes that many of the customers seemed to not be considered number one anymore, or a priority."
good,JCP as I knew it was a family away from home.
good,"JcPenney is always busy, and it it not a hard job. If you love people this is the job for you.Around the holidays is my favorite time working."

good,Loved working with staff in my department and the mamager was terrific. Customers were sometimes demanding but usually very nice.
good,"Great benefits, great reward system, decent working hours 9:45 to latest 11"
good,On weekdays one can get very bored if working as an associate but you are more productive on the weekends
good,I enjoyed everyone I worked with. It was always a changing environment which was a positive.
good,"You are surrounded with beautiful clothing, shoes, accessories, and much more!! The staff is friendly and helpful and make you feel welcomed. You are always informed on information, promotions, and advertisings around the store which makes it very easy to assist customers. Everyone has a pleasant attitude...no wonder some people have been there for many great years!!!"
good,I really enjoy my job a visual merchandiser. Its fun and creative.
good,"A great many things are in flux right now with a new CEO and essential game plan on approaching business. Unfortunately, the staff is nearly all temporary making it difficult to make it the most reliable location to start a career,"
good,-Cleaned and made sure my section was neat.
good,"A typical day for me is just walking the sales floor and provide great customer service. I recovery the store for the next business day. what i learned from working here so far is patience with people. Management on my job is pretty good, they help us with what we don't know and gives us feedback on our work productivity. I get along well with my co workers and usually team together to get major store projects done in a timely matter. The hardest part about the job is just learning and getting a understanding of what customer are looking for when they come into the store."
good,"This is a job where you have to be very creative. I work in the Jrs. and Srcub dept, I also do the register when needed. I put out clothing, also keep my area clean."

Tagging all samples that entered our area.
good,"J.C.Penny was my first job, it taught me the proper skills I needed to work in the public with everyday people."
good,"With the recent updates to the company, many opportunities have opend up. The stores have become much more organized. however, because new oppotunities opened up, pay cuts have affected many current employees."
good,"In my time at this location I have become known as a very reliable and very had working employee. My typical day consists of either working on a cash register, folding clothes and maintaining the stores appearance or unloading delivery trucks in the delivery dock. I have learned how to deal with customers, how to operate certain machinery, and how to represent a company well. The most difficult part of this job I have encountered is not knowing what I will be doing from day to day and having a schedule that changes from week to week. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with interesting people."
good,Overall a very good place to work on Customer Service and Sales Skills.
good,"It was very productive, and enjoyed working there. Flexible scheduling, and great benefits."
good,one of the best jobs i had back in 2006 love jcpenny's and i had the most great experience at this job then anywhere else
good,its good i rweally like it... the work is easy a nd uyou catch on reeallly fast
good,Working for a company like JCPenney provides the opportunity to learn valuable skills or enhance your very own. The skills acquired allowed me to successfully compete in the business world and has given me the opportunity to deliver great customer service.
good,Was an awesome place to work and most of the people who work there were super nice and helpful.
good,"The work is ok, not many hours are in sight only around the christmas season. Working for this company is cool because the manager is nice but by other supervisors it is easily seen who they favotite. The pay is a regular retail pay but the raise is not much or often given. I like my work because I get to work by what I have to do not by the hours that are given. Jcp in general is a nice company work for."
good,i really appreciated how they trained new hires because you didn't go out on the floor not knowing how to do your job. system of earning pins for great customer service created a productive environment.
good,I worked in the kids department and every one was nice. Had good working relationships with co-workers
good,JCPenney is a customer-focused environment that provides excellent customer service. The sales associates are knowledgeable about JCPenney's products and services. Customers are treated with respect and they are provided with great service.
good,This is a steady pace job with outstanding employees and supervisors. They are a equal opprotunity employer whom i enjoyed working with.
good,"I have enjoyed working for penneys, I wish the advancement and the benefits would be better. Company is family oriented and works with individual schedules."
good,The managers and supervisors are always there to help.  They are understanding and with help with whatever question you may need.  They try to make everyday work as enjoyable as possible.
good,"JCPenney is a decent place to work. It gets hectic around the holidays, but you do get the time and a half for working big holidays. They hire pretty quickly."
good,Not much negative or positive to say. Job advancement may not be plentiful but the are plenty of other areas to train and specialize in. Definitely a relaxed but productive environment.
good,"Easy to get a job there depending on the season.  Schedule is variable and somewhat unpredictable.  Christmas season is high demand for employees, but few hours after December 31st."
good,I had a great time working for JC Penney. The only days i had a bad day it was because of rude customers and never because of the people i worked with or management.
good,Overall not a bad first job or one to work during college. The coworkers are nice. Most managers are not trained very well and can be pretty new to the company themselves. No one really knows what they’re doing and store rules and policies keep changing. Turnover rate is very high. Low wages considering everything you have to do and for putting up with customers. Flexible schedules.
good,JCPenney is focused on the customer and credit card application. Great discounts. Ability for internal advancement. Flexible hours. Cross training for all the departments.
good,"The job is great for students who live with their parents. Dont expect to get enough to pay for living if you're part time, they schedule everyone at least 13 hours every 2 weeks."
good,My work experience there the first couple months were really good and it is still good I make sells I had to sell credit cards to customers and I did pretty good
good,I really enjoyed working in the retail setting. My customers and managers always appreciated how much I had done for the store and the customers. The only downsides were a few scheduling errors and some of the people that were your co-workers seemed to have bad attitudes towards customers or left most of the work for other people to do. Some really had taken advantage of my kindness but all in all it was a great place to work.  I excelled greatly at this job and would have really loved it if the people I worked with were as kind hearted and “customer satisfaction” driven as me.
good,"It's retail. You work the register, assist customers (which I enjoy), non stop folding and picking up after people...and the one thing I don't care for to the extreme... Pushing credit cards on people. Yes you get a little compensation for doing so but I personally hate it and sometimes it upsets people."
good,Don't forget to ask every customer if they would like to apply for a JCP card. The time will go by fast. And it's alright to take a 15 minute break. There are rushes especially after 5pm but closing is the most relieving time. Getting to know the locations in the store and the overall styles if each brands allow you to assist customers in their shopping efficiently.
good,"* Customer service is a main priority in sales."
good,"Fun place to work, good  paying job but folding clothes gets tiresome. I enjoy the time I've worked there as well but a change of pace is required for someone who likes to work with their hands and watch something come of it."
good,management are helpful and very supportive. They help the sales associates and always tries their best. The other sales associate are also helpful and works so hard to improve their performance.
good,"It was okay. No hours in the system had to ask for them. Manager was rude, we’ll just department manager. Never was flexible about having to deal with your children. Overall he was rude."
good,"The people are great and you gain customer service skills. Although, there are a lack of hours during the holidays for employees who are not seasonal."
good,"Make friends cause it makes your time go by quicker and easier. Management is okay when they’re not under pressure, sometimes we got free food thanks to one of the managers. Back to school and Christmas was always stressful but it was fun cause it went by quick. The down part is always emptying the fitting rooms and putting clothes back and constantly folding clothes. Sucks. But everything else was okay. Oh and most of the customers there are VERY RUDE."
good,"Jc penneys was my first job as a licensed Cosmetologist. It was a wonderful environment to work. Experienced cosmetologists working along side me as i continued to learn more each day while being employed through jc penneys. Had i been paid more than minimum wage for the hard work and great results per client, id still be working their. I deserved a better pay."
good,I left and was rehired 4x. I was very pleased that they did and I would come back again...my experience..In the saline was awesome getting to know the clients
good,"The stockroom was fast paced and fun to work in, I only left because they wanted is to start showing up at 5am and it didn't work with my babysitter at the time."
good,"Payed good money, got along with all the customers and co workers. Always was on time for work . Learned how to be responsible and take care of myself ."
good,Great experience. Employees were very nice and manager were nice as well. Organized and clean everyday. Gave me a good amount of hours and paid decent.
good,I loved working in JCPenney salon. You could receive all the hours that you needed but the pay wasn't that great. You don't get to work on commission in the salon you can only work by salary in which you start off at minimum wage.
good,"Not a bad job, but far from my best. I can't fault the company for much, though the pay could be more competitive and the benefits could be better. The offer of ""flexible scheduling"" does not exist."
good,The department I worked in blended together well. Staff was professional and prompt. Promotions and changes were in movement which kept the department exciting.
good,"I enjoy working at JCPenney because of my co-workers.  It's nice to work with different people and I love the teamwork involved at work.  "
good,Very stressful environment and not the nicest management. I learned about how to speak with customers and help out. The hardest part of the job was actually selling products and meeting high and unattainable goals. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my coworkers and having a mutual and professional relationship.
good,I love working there I just wished it paid more. I had no problems with other management and love talking with the customers.  No other problems except the pay
good,"Good people a positive peer environment enjoyed the majority of coworkers, and the activities set fourth by management to promote synergy in the store."
good,Had nice managers that provided advice and located crew members around the store so that work was evenly distributed. providing an overall relaxed environment.
good,"I loved this job! If you enjoy customer service then I recommend working here. Very easygoing job, pay is low but that’s just how a lot of clothing stores are lol. Other than that I loved it. Plus the discount is very nice"
good,Everyone is willing to help each other out. If your alone at a sachet register you can call for help and there is always 1 or 2 more people to run over and help you with your line of customers. Some customers have attitudes over little things but that doesn't ruin the experience of working there. But they only pay 11.50 an hour.
good,"connect with customers when they need help, make sure the store is in a visibly pleasing state, and know the deals and sales that customers can get. Easy, fun work!"
good,This job is good if you're just starting off but unless you want to go career or you enjoy folding clothes for a living then I DON'T recommend you stay long as the job will get very repetitive and slow and soon you'll start clocking in rolling your eyes just waiting and praying to clock out again so you can repeat the whole process all over again the next shift. This is retail so honestly what did you expect.
good,"I enjoyed working here, though it wasnt for long. Not long after I got the job, I became homeless. The day I went in to quit, because I fel like I wasnt able to do what needed to be done (come in on time, ect) because of the homelessness, I was fired"
good,Loved the policies even though the company only cared about getting customers to sign up for a JCPenney card. Celebrating holidays was fun too. Love the decorations and how sales were set up.
good,"fast pace, needs improvement on training new hires, hardest part of the job is being understaffed do to a lack of applicants which in turn causes turn over. Has a family atmosphere at times."
good,I'm going back to school and my position doesn't have hours flexible with that. I would like to stay on as a supervisor of operations. JCPenney benefits are amazing.
good,I liked working there & I loved working with my fellow co-workers. If someone needed help we would help them right away. Customers would ask about our opinions on the things that they wanted to buy or thought about buying.
good,It gives you a great way to learn how to handle different customer service experiences along with retail. The workplace culture is very helpful in assisting good structure in training to help getting goals set for good quality customer service.
good,JCPenney is a great team environment to be a part of.  The management gave a lot of autonomy to its team members to take care of the customers.  The ultimate goal was to take care of the customers and help them have a positive experience.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers and I liked my job. The hours were not good as to having work weekends and holidays and the pay was not competitive. I stayed longer that I thought I would, because I liked my co-workers so much"
good,"Good place to start work or get extra income.We still need brick and mortar stores as a society.  On-line sales is paramount at JC Penney.  "
good,I would refer people to work there good workplace. Management needed to keep manager things to managers only regular associates shouldn't know whats going on in upper management. I fee like it should be a little harder to get on at jcp b/c they hire alot of teenagers who are lazy and who dont like to show up to work and not help clean up at night .
good,I loved my job and meeting new people. I would sometimes have a different task each day. Some days Im a cashier some days I picked and packed online orders. There were also times were I had to deliver packages out and enter data in the computer. I worked around in J.C pennys and I loved that. The harderst part would be managment there was some rudeness but I managed. I loved my job and it was a great experience.
good,"Job schedule was consistent, although it's hard to find workarounds with any schedule conflicts. Pay rate is slightly above the MI minimum wage. The store may be a little understaffed but all the managers are good people, and friendly enough."
good,Every day at work was usually the same as before. I would greet customers and ask them if they needed help finding anything. The managers there were adequate. I enjoyed my job at JCPenney the only thing that I struggled with was that my schedule wouldn't fit with theirs and it was always difficult finding somebody who would work for me. The thing I enjoyed most at this job was pretty much everything. I enjoy retail quite a bit and I would enjoy working in it again. My schedule has actually opened up quite a bit since I've got to college.
good,"Started working at jc Penney after a long time when I decided to go back to work it was a wonderful experience and really enjoyed working there .The management was nice and understanding I really liked working there,but due to some personal reasons I had to leave ."
good,I loved working here . The hours weren’t to harsh pay was decent . There is no particular dress code . It was in a great neighborhood and the discount were nice .
good,"A typical day working at JcPenney's was just checking out customers all day while going back and forth cleaning the floors/fitting rooms when we got a chance. I learned how to manage the money and handle customers, also how to open and close registers. The management was okay when I worked there, they weren't very understanding on things and some of them didn't really do their job. The workplace is a nice store to work at, there is nice employees for the most part and always the same customers. The hardest part of the job is being busy with customers all day trying to clean the store before we get out on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is cleaning the store."
good,Working at this specific location was fun. It would definitely be my suggestion for college students/seniors who need some extra cash and enjoy using their 25% discount! The management was a little high strung and annoying but the actual staff were pretty cool. If you’re looking for an actual career I’d say to choose a different department or look elsewhere.
good,"I enjoyed dealing with the customers, the product, and learning about fine jewelry, the different diamonds and settings, I very much enjoyed the sales end of the job"
good,Jcpenneys is an overall good place to work if your young and need a job. The managers are great people and care about your well being as most places do not. The envroment is comforatable and if you like talking to people and helping people find what they need its a good job for you.
good,I liked working there because I got along with everyone who I met and who I already been friends with. We really helped each other out a lot when we had long lines of customers or when we had costumers with attitude. We kept each other on check and I really liked that.
good,Challenging facility to work in especially during peak holiday seasons. I had a few good managers who were willing to share their knowledge and experience. I was also trained in Lean Six Sigma during my employment. Excellent paid time off.  I had 5 weeks of MTO after 10 years. I would have stayed if the pay was better and/or there were advancement opportunities.
good,"Can be a fun environment to work with, friendly staff and customers mostly. Not hard work at all and overall I had a positive experience working here."
good,Overall there is a good environment and the pay is decent depending on your position.  There was a recent change in management for the better.  Good recognition.
good,"its a cool job get in do your work get out you will have not problems, easy job and cool management that is there to help you with your needs, long training classes so you understand what your doing."
good,Working here was fun not to mention the employe discount that you get on top of the coupons.  A normal day was as follows folding clothes restocking and working the register. Helping guest with online orders and the returns after the christmas rush was the only thing that took a bit of time. they had a program for every credit application you signed up you got a extra 2 dollars on your paycheck which was nice.
good,The job was ok Its started out with sorting which was fast paced then sometimes you would help other departments like picking returns and finally when hired on i was moved to shipping where  packed the trucks
good,"Management was ok "
good,"Loved my coworkers and had a very efficient but kind boss, customers were a little harsh during the holidays, but I overall had a great experience. Would and have recommended."
good,"Hard working staff, less floor coverage, not much customer service on floors, removed credit department and customer service area., good place to get items for the whole family. "
good,Some managers would just sit in the office and not have a clue as to what was going on in the store and didn't care. They need to have more interaction with employees and customers.
good,I enjoyed working at several different JCP all over the US. They were always laid back and easy to work for. 
good,"I enjoyed my 9+ years of employment with JCPenney. Though worked for three different locations, I got a wide variety of diversity that helped make the work experience quite interesting."
good,JC Penney was a great place to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting customers throughout the store.  I was assigned to the Jewelry Department and loved assisting customers with their jewelry selections.
good,"Aside from pay the job was fun in itself, I enjoy helping a person look and feel better about themselves. Management was good, always there if you needed anything, the pay and goals were a little unachievable probably due to location of salon"
good,"My position there was to prevent the loss the of the store internally and externally. Via closed circuit television, checking receipts, walking the store for any suspicious activity."
good,"The  work environment was good,The management was good they were understanding if you had to call out and if you needed you time changed they most likely change the time that you need."
good,This is a very good part-time permanent position. Employees are notified of their work schedule two-weeks in advance and you can work with the other employees in your position to modify or switch schedules.
good,Great management at JCP and I learn a lot there.I had the chance to work in multiple leaders roles.It was great company to work for until the company began to struggle.
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work, past faced and you need to be able to answer questions from diversity group and direct customers to where they can find merchandise as required when they ask the location of such products."
good,"Typical days at JC Penney were spent behind the cash register or throughout the store fixing and restocking merchandise. It was fun working here because of the people I worked with, but sometimes the timing of my schedule conflicted with other things. It was not easy to get the hours you wanted or get out on time."
good,"This was a relatively fun place to work, but sometimes the hours were too unpredictable especially when hours would increase for whatever reasons. Overall, it was okay."
good,When working at JC Penny you have to be good at working with other. There will be times that we will have to stop what you are doing and help out the team or a customer. When doing this you need to make sure that you keep a smile on your face and at like you love being there whenever you are on the floor. You need to make sure that you know how to use the cash register and that you password works. Make sure to try your hardest to get people to open up credit card accounts but that will be the main determining factor of if you stay or get let go after the season is over. Overall if you are a people person and good at talking people into opening accounts you will do great and they do have pretty good food that they get for the employees during the holiday season.
good,Jcpenney is an okay place to work. Would be better if there were more people for the recovery team. Also im not very fond of the fact that some holidays are a completly mandatory to work.
good,"Hours were fine, management was questionable at times while it seemed to be always under staffed at the busier days and times. Lunch room had food there."
good,It's a very warm environment. Associates have good relationships which is good for the customers. There is always something to do so you're never bored.
good,"briefing in the morning, the manager arranged what task we would be responsible for the day, Tasks would very from unloading and loading trucks and scanning for misdirects."
good,JCPenney was my first job. As a consultant i learned a lot with customer skills giving by JCPenney management. I also developed skils in train and develop new hires and working in commission i also leaned hands on one on one customer service. The management team was good helpful with my growth and leadership. The hardest part of the job was the wages i was making. The most enjoyable part of the job is team i had made it so enjoyable and fun.
good,The corporation still has not moved forward to adjust to the new garment industry's trends. They have still have not adjusted the buying volume and choices that would best serve their customers and the company itself. They waste vast amounts of money with poor fashion buys and steep clearance events. A cycle that repeats itself.
good,"Good job when you're starting out. It helps build your customer service knowledge, and management experience. Pay is average, but the work culture is good."
good,Jcpenny was a good job for the holiday times with excellent scheduling but after the holiday season it offered very little to no hours at all which resulted in little pay.
good,"I loved working here! But there was no way to move up without having a degree or going to school. There was no way to become a full time associate because JC Penney, or at least the location I worked at, was getting rid of full time positions. You could of course end up working 40 hours a week, but it was all based on company needs or if someone called out."
good,I genuinely enjoyed working with the people I had the pleasure of working with. My managers pulled me aside to tell me I was doing good as well as told me when I needed to bring my numbers up.
good,You will work on Thanksgiving and all holidays. Horrible work life balance Holiday season is awful. Employee discount is good for all the sales constantly going on.
good,"Still my current employer I would say that I enjoy my workdays, I feel that the management team helps make my days enjoyable. I am the only Asset Protection in the building so most of the associates look to me for guidance and safety."
good,"my day at JCPENNEY  Customer Service Associate.    Processed customer’s transactions.  Submit credit cards application for customers.  Help customers find what they want at jcpenny.com and submit their orders online"
good,"A typical day at Jcp is relaxing not much difficulty, straight forward instruction and goals, only thing that gets hard is when theirs no manager on the floor"
good,"I enjoy my time for the most there, I do feel the management team could do for a make over when I worked there.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"The integrity and culture of JCPenney was outstanding! We all worked well as a team, communicating great with one another. The management for this company was very well decided and all of my former coworkers agreed!"
good,"Excellent employees- some of the best people I ever worked with. Fast-paced environment, sometimes long hours, but we had a lot of fun and traveled to NY market monthly. I only left because of the financial position the company was in, due to poor leadership and management in the C-suite area. It's too bad because otherwise, it was a great place to work with awesome vacation benefits. (4 weeks at 5 years)"
good,"Management did their best to work with my school schedule every semester."
good,"I was an Operations Associate, I got the opportunity to work 5 hours a week, due to budget and time of year. I stocked the items and unloaded the truck, for the week. I felt as if I was being pushed out and I tried to keep the job. However they continued to cut my hours or take days away. Which sucked!"
good,"Typical retail atmosphere. "
good,i really love working witg the people do my job sales stocks if needing a day off they will work with you just had troule getting the hours and moving up in the business
good,"jcp is a good place to work - the atmosphere is very diverse.  The workforce is young and energetic.  "
good,"If you can show up, fold clothes, and run a cash register you'll do fine. I enjoyed running the shoe department because you dont have to fold them and online orders were fun."
good,This is a warehouse and it is huge.  You will walk a lot and stand long times.  This is not on a bus route and not too many places to eat close by seeing that you only get 30 min lunch.  You cannot be a minute late.  They have different shifts.
good,"I was appreciate working at Jcpenney . such a good company very flexible for single parents, it works with your schedules, good retirement benfit. the only not appreciate they cut hours so much."
good,"Enjoyed while i was there, got to experiance new things and always up to date on everything. Enjoyed people i worked with as well as the flexibility of hours"
good,I investigated possible shoplifter and would apprehend and process them to appear in court. Check for store fraud and review receipts for possible theft at the register. The hardest part of my job was trying to blend in as a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was catching shoplifters.
good,A good place to begin your career in customer service. There is room for advancement if you are interested in pursuing a career in retail management. Overall not a bad place to work.
good,A typical day in the salon very slow.  Your literally begging customers to come in .  Customers would only come in for samples and as far as building a cliental that's out.
good,"Nice place to work, even though you end up spending the money you make back at the store with your employee discount! The customers were the worst part, the employees got along great"
good,My job was great and the people I worked with was great! I never had a problem with anyone that I worked with. My manager was totally awesome. As long as you did your work she left you alone.
good,Time passes fast because there is always something to do. Open pallets and take merchandise to the floor. Mark downs for clearance. Sometimes cleaning floor to make shoppable
good,"I worked in the shoe department, team was fun, but they always made us stay later than scheduled which wasn't great. Managers were nice and the little awards they would give us for getting people to sign up for the jcp card were a good touch."
good,"Working for The Salon By Instyle inside JCPenney is by far the best part-time job I’ve ever had! The stylists are so talented and so fun to work with, the manager is always willing to work with me and my schedule and not to mention very easy to talk to about any situation. The discounts you get for the salon and the store are amazing! Never want to leave!"
good,J.C.Penney was overall a good company to work for. They work with your availability to make your schedule and offer good benefits. They also give their employees a 25% discount with a J.C.Penney credit card or 20% discount with any other form of payment.
good,"Benefits accrued over many years are substantial, the trick is to stay that long.  Your enjoyment of your job will have a great deal to do with what department you work in."
good,JC Penny was a very enjoyable job and the workers were very friendly and easy to work with. Everyone is nice and that makes the job better. Management wants to see you succeed and it was a great experience.
good,"Enjoyed the widespread inclusion. They allowed for colored hair, jewelry and piercings, which was very refreshing. They did not discriminate when they hired me. When the girls at Sephora hired me they were very kind and open."
good,"Unfortunately I was not able to work long for health reasons, but I enjoyed my time there. Very fast paced, with the ability to work closely with good people and customers. Everyone was nice and I got to meet some great people! Dress code was very relaxed and comfortable."
good,"JC Penny was a company I enjoyed working for about two years and it was my very first job, in my time working for the company my duties included unloading pallets from the shipment trucks, organizing and stocking merchandise from clothes, furniture, and home accessories, I learned a large amount about working retail and it was a job I really enjoyed being a part of."
good,"I had nothing but good experiences working for JCPenney.  I was extremely taken off guard when at the end of the fiscal year I was informed my position of Salon Leader was being eliminated at the store I worked and no other position was offered."
good,Enjoyed working with this company. The staff seemed like a family.  Advancement was frequent and training was 80%.  When I started with JCP I had just relocated from out-of-state and was given a meaningful experience.
good,I mostly rung up customers and helped get things they needed that were not on the store floor. I also cleaned the fitting rooms and the clothing area.
good,I enjoyed working at JC Penney and would recommend anyone who would like to work there. You gain a lot of customer service experience and meet many different people.
good,The hardest part of this job is handling difficult customers. I learned how to communicate well with both coworkers and customers in an efficient and effective way.
good,"This was honestly the best retail job i've had. Great coworkers, great customers, and great benefits. If one department is too overwhelming, you can be asked to be switched to one to better suit your pace."
good,i've been working at jcp for years and i love it. its truly a family friendly workplace. i enjoy my manger and my wage. only bad thing about jcp is they are slow moving company when it comes to technology
good,The managers are very  lenient  On your time coming in and if they have slow days you might be able to leave early beacause I got off 2 hours early one day without pay but it was still good to get off early
good,"Was assigned to Loss Prevention--great unit in a busy environment"
good,JcPenney is a good place to work and offers a place where you can have flexible hours as well as maintain a full time job. It also offers employee discounts as well.
good,"relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers, get to meet new people everyday, fun, lots of customer service, organizing, making appointments for the stylists and taking care of the front desk."
good,"A typical day at work would be me walking in and instantly getting into a project. I learned more about products I already had knowledge on and some I never knew. Mangement is cordial and quick to respond. The hardest part of the job used to be hiding my personal life from work, but I am now since capable. The most enjoyable thing about work were the different people you would meet, socializing and building rapport are important for retail."
good,"Working at JCP, you are encouraged to sell as many credit applications as you possibly can. There are weekly competitions in which you can receive prizes for. The hardest art was trying to sell credit cards because most people do not need them and sometimes if you don't sell any, they'll sit you down and make sure you are actualy trying. The most enjoyable part was talking with my co workers and customers."
good,"A typical day at work was to clock in and go to the floor and start helping customers. I learned a lot more about customer service working here. The management was amazing, constantly driving sales but still supportive. The culture was upbeat and constantly thriving to serve the customers. The hardest part about working there is getting credit apps out, which they are partial to when scheduling. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and positivity."
good,"When I first started I was surprised to find a second family at the workplace but with new management the friendliness has left and work is not fun anymore but stressful. Advancement is very possible if you honestly work hard but I would not be sure the compensation is worth the stress. However, overall, I really enjoyed working here."
good,Working with JCPenney has been an experience of growth and cross training. I enjoyed learning the ins and outs of different areas of the store. I enjoyed building new relationships and working on different skills that would help me further my career.
good,"Most of the time a fun place to work, compensation and benefits are poor unless you're management. I made a lot of close friends while working here. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers."
good,Fast paced. Alright money. Very low minimum. Not many advancements. Hours are okay. Not many opportunities to advance within the company. Management is not always thoughtful
good,"It was a friendly place to work, not always organized, people were nice to work with. Not a hard job. Busy work always something do, if there were no customers, there were go backs, things customers did not want or returned that needed to be put back. Keeping the work areas clean."
good,"working at the jcpenney salon was extremely stressful at times but totally worth the money. you would get paid an hourly wage in addition to 10% of whatever you sold....benefits were great, awesome atmosphere..work hours were set and were nice!"
good,"I enjoyed working there although at times it can get a bit frustrating due to the customers or jcpenney.com mixing up the orders, etc. at the end of the day not only are you working with great people but you're gaining skills from customer service to dealing with cash to many other skills. It's a great way to get an inside look at how a retail store works."
good,overall challenging but a great experience. I was fortunate to meet many amazing customers who became a regular client. Was taught of many new products and able to focus on building my customer services skills.
good,"Was hired as a Seasonal Sales Associate at first, was offered to work as an associate after the season was over.  I learned a lot from this company, one thing I learned is a great work ethic goes a long way.  Working at JcPenney was a very rewarding experience that taught me many communication and problem solving skills . There were a few challenges here and there regarding the technology that they use (it could definitely be improved). Promoted product warranty and increased sales. Maintained area and counter clean and presentable.Other than that it was a nice experience. The coworkers and team environment is what makes you feel so welcomed and eager to work with such great employees."
good,New associates are trained prior to floor assignments. Duties vary daily based on departmental needs. Floor managers are willing to help you and the customers with questions/resolving problems. Job perks/commissions are available.
good,"JCPenney is a great company to work for although they don't have the best communication with their associates. Nice, Friendly, out going associates as well as management. fun place to shop."
good,it was fast pace and difficult to keep up with.  Morning hours are perfect and working definitely wakes you up.  The people there were great to work with and knowledgeable.
good,Enjoyed working for this company and coworkers. Some of the management were great to work for while others stood over you no matter how hard it worked.
good,Fun environment to work in. Great management staff but can be more focus on the bottom line than the ideas for improvements from the employees. But I guess that's their job.
good,"I learned alot from all those years i worked for JCP, I started a replenisher,did visual, pricing payroll,later on became a team leader,than got promoted to the jewelry dept, catalog and then i worked the whole floor. It was fun and motivated."
good,"Work load is expressed and expected to be done. Great managers that are understanding and work to fix the issue at hand. Try to make the best time out of a bad time (e.g. working on thanksgiving, Christmas eve)."
good,"I like working at jcpenney, if they had more hours and a better way of moving up in the store I would love to stay. It's not a place I would try to make a career at but for just getting out of school and for a first time job it helps."
good,"I worked in the shoe department so my duties were to put the customers first, provide online help with ordering if need be. Stock shelves with product in the back with as many sizes as we can put on the shelf, I also measured feet for customers that weren't sure if they were getting the right size of shoes. At the end of the day I faced the entire department, I checked to make sure all boxes had two shoes inside except the shoe on display. I learned how to maintain a department and controlled stress during stressful times as black Friday was. Management wasn't the best at keeping up with their employees. The culture in the store was customers come first always and keeping a steady pace to keep them happy. The hardest part of the job was getting let go the day after Christmas when I had 3 days before I would be jobless. Best part of the job was the environment and discounts."
good,"Although the job was demanding and could be stressful, my coworker's were amazing. We worked hard but had fun! J C Penney as a company has great benefits but salaries could be higher and there a limited career advancement opportunities. Cuts on companies department supervisors and having to oversee 3 departments was challenging and underpaid."
good,What the company says it is all about is not the same as what the current store manager complies with. I originally went with JCP to grow and I liked the store level involvement with the Associates and community. This has changed with the new Store manager
good,"A typical day depends on which department you are working in, but for the most part your job is to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job is when you can't please everyone despite doing all you can. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly making a difference in many peoples lives, even though it seems small to you, to them, it's exactly everything they wanted or needed."
good,"A typical day at work started at 10am and ended at 4pm, I would clean out fitting rooms and straighten up the floor. I would also work the registers, Management was okay. Th hardest part of the job was keeping everything in order on busy days."
good,i like it there. it was a fun and great place. like the co workers . mangers was cool as well. the stuff they have there is great and i will continued to buy from there.
good,"This is a good place to work if you to build experience in customer service or retail. Easy job to do, pay is good, job duties are good. Busy time during peak days."
good,"I was happy working here, but the job was temporary and I was not assigned enough hours. The management was good and I did no find any aspect of the job to be too difficult."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there, employees were friendly and you get to interact with many people everyday. Which can also be hectic during busy seasons. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Logistics/distribution center with 2 shifts. Work consisted of picking, packing, shipping, and receiving. Typically M-F with some weekend shifts required during peak season."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and set your register up for sales. Meet and greet customers as they entered the department. I learned how to place out of store merchandise orders.
good,My first job right out of cosmetology school. I really enjoyed working with more experienced sytlists. They were great about offering advice on techniques and tips.
good,Just your typical retail job. You have your stressful days your easy days. All the cleaning and folding clothes. Working long Black Friday and all of the Christmas music
good,"Typical day at work at Jcpenney was mostly working on the registers and advertising the clothes in the establishment. Selling credit cards and  providing the  best customer service to customers buying from the establishment."
good,"Great job to do, loved working here a typical day at work was good actually. The part I enjoyed when working here is keeping the customers satisfied, at all times."
good,I enjoyed working at J.C. Penney's.  I worked there a couple of years. and then they began decreasing hours. They had decent benfits and clean stores and bathrooms.
good,"Our store shut down, poor management, paid new hires way more than old hires, almost no advancement, did not receive yearly raises, the associates were amazing, the managers were friendly, but not paid fairly for experience or loyalty."
good,Working at JC Pennney can be rewarding and lots of fun. Working with a team of people with the same goal in mind of giving outstanding customer service is rewarding.
good,"It was fun and fast pace inbound calls when I worked for JC Penney website and catalog books a long time ago. I enjoyed the rewards & discounts, I researched orders - tracking, arranging deliveries.I especially enjoyed calls from elderly customers placing orders,"
good,"Good place to work if you are single and have no responsibilities. Fast paced, get to meet a lot of new people, employees worked well together, had fun, enjoyable"
good,"Typical day at work was come to work and give the best customer service possible."
good,I was able to learn did account adjustments talked with diverse customer base the company encouraged us to learn new systems. Was able to travel so that I could train others in new systems I liked training people and the company was supportive of that. Progress happens and the catalog division no longer was a part f the company. I was able to leave with my discount and appreciate what I learned
good,"JCPenney was a decent place to work, but the company does not have longevity. If you are looking for a place to build a career, this would not be my choice, but there is a lot to be learned here."
good,"JCPenney was a fun place to work. Most of the other associates were nice and easy to work with. Some managers were not. They would throw you under the bus in front of customers who they knew were wrong (i.e. trying to return obviously used items) The pay was a little more than minimum wage, but the discount makes up for it."
good,Managers are pretty friendly. Working retail can be rough because of the way some customers treat you but I found that most of the managers at JC Penney will back you up if you stick to the policies and not blame you if customers are unreasonable. They do expect you to cater to customers requests within reason. Clean up is a big portion of this job as well as cashier work.
good,"Loved my co-workers, salon was super busy, great customer service experience, retail experience also. Clients could be demanding, but that's to be expected in the beauty business. Management were almost always absent & disconnected from the salon associates, therefore didn't know how to manage associate concerns/requests efficiently."
good,"Maintain the location's orderliness and appearance"
good,"I have been at JCPenney for over 10 years. I have enjoyed working there, but I have not been able to move up towards a higher level of management. That is why I am looking elsewhere for more experience and challenges."
good,"JC Penney at the time I was there had great a management team. Very laid back job, great for a college student with little to no stress. I enjoyed the 3 years I was there."
good,Its a great place to work with a nice people around them i was a high school student and it was the oerfect job for me.only in the seasons its very packed and you have to stay until 3-4 am
good,"Working here was very slow paced, and repetitive. Manager taught the importance of appearance.  Management was professional, and consistent.  The company itself was very diverse.  The hardest part of the job was morning shift duties.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job was their recognition program."
good,I liked to help the public with their customer needs. The constant changing of the seasons and the floor changes you never new what you were going to be working on. Always something new and interesting.
good,I love this company but I have always been in management and this manager that I have now at JCPenney salon will not allow me to advance into management level.  I am ready to move up but I am being blocked so I need to look elsewhere
good,I have been a sales associate with JCP for a little over a year now in the women's department. It has been a great experience with awesome coworkers and managers.
good,"Responsibilities of a JCPenney sales associate include greeting customers, assisting guests with finding merchandise, stocking and organizing product on the sales floor, ringing up purchases, and handling returns and other discrepancies."
good,i do not have any complaints about the company as much. i do not mind working but i want to work as an IT guy. that is why i am trying to get out of retail.
good,"You never knew what dept you would be in. Had no notice of my layoff, they told me the morning of. The lifetime discount I obtained is appreciated. I have made some good friends. The work was easy but you have to be busy every minute and sometimes deal with irate customers."
good,I worked at J.C.Penney while attending school it allowed me the flexibility to have income for my family and complete college. I enjoyed the discounts are awesome.
good,"Good company, for a short term career. They do not value tenure - they have been turning tenured managers in favor of cheaper alternatives. The company stresses greet scores and credit applications."
good,"All they care about is credit applications, loyalty for working there long means nothing if you cant get apps. No matter that you work hard and do a great job at customer service they literally told me no apps no hours!. "
good,"Typical day starts with a morning meeting. Management gives us our credit goal, and customer service score for the store. Either  congratulations on a job well done, or a reminder that we have to do better.  The home department is the most hands-on area of the store. A lot of problem solving. Overall, I enjoy my job. I love working with most of the customers, and most of my coworkers. I don't like the mandatory weekends. The hardest part of the job is the holiday season. Mean, grumpy people come in at the holiday season."
good,This job requires you to keep busy all the day. I liked how there was always customers to help. The coworkers and customers were very nice to work with.
good,"People were great and team building was a positive experience. The hardest part of my job was the schedule, they gave us so much time for a job but that did not include the driving time across town to get there."
good,Working at Jcp creates a family within co workers you dont know you have. The benefits and discounts are great however the pay is low for supervisors and floor associates.
good,Decent job nothing hard about it. Hours were spurattic so it was hard to keep a balanced home schedule. No benefits for part time employee. 20% employee discount.
good,"A typical day at Jcpenney is fast paced and smooth"
good,"JCPenney I would say is pretty cool job, with good benefits that come with the job. Nothing to challenging besides being a manager. I would go back if I could."
good,"I would get ready for my job.  Drive about 25 min to get to my job.  Once I get to my job I found out what I am doing.  I say hello to my bosses,  Since I have two year in warehouse experience figuring wear I need to be to do my job."
good,"A typical day working at JCPennys involve lots of folding and refolding the same tables and fixing the same 25-30 racks of clothes repeadetly. I did enjoy working there, met a lot of great people and learned lots of new trades."
good,A typical day at work would obviously be dealing with customers. It can be stressful but also fun. The most enjoyable part about working customer service would have to be interacting with customers and learning something new every day.
good,"This is the longest retail job I've had, and they're very flexible with scheduling. The only issues I have are it's hard to get days off during ""blackout periods"" (busy periods). But weekdays are pretty slow and even for weekends, it's busy but it goes by fast. They'll hire anyone who seems to be nice, so I was just lucky to get somewhat of a higher start pay since I was in retail previously. Coupons are the worst when it comes for the workers, but you learn to deal with it. If you want AC, flexible hours (you can work just weekends if needed), and more flexible uniforms, it's great! You get one 15 minute break if you work less than 7 hours, and two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch if you work 7 hours or more. It's hard to move up in pay unless you sell a lot of credit cards."
good,It was always fun to work here. Even though during the holidays it was stressful and you have to work on Thanksgiving the months went by pretty fast. You get discounts off of clothes and salon merch. I really enjoyed being here and using my customer service skills at this place.
good,This job is a great job. Just don't like that it have been mandatory ot for the last year and the rules change almost everyday but i love the management. They will work with about anything dealing with the job.
good,"Some of the positives of working at this store would be several of the managers were really nice, knowledgeable and helpful. The discount was pretty good. The store was often very neat and clean. Some negatives would be that some of the employees were less than pleasant to work with. The pay wasn't very good and sometimes hours were scarce."
good,If you like jewelry and like to work with people this job is a perfect job. You get to meet so many different people. You get challenged and you for sure need to be very responsible.
good,It's your average retail store! Management is always changing. Minimum wage. The job is always something different you never know what will walk through the door!
good,Its a fun environment the cowokers there get along very well but management needs to work on the tone they use when talking to the employees. also not showing favoritism and they do that often. The job made me work on my customer service I help people with a better attitude as well as better word choices when helping them. I loved working catalog and childrens
good,"JC Penney is ok somewhat, is that you get very little hours and low salary . the managers and supervisors are very helpful and supportive . you get to learn multiple things at a time and that i consider very helpful in learning to multitask."
good,"I learned a lot working at JC Penney. I started out driving a stand up fork lift in a production setting. Then applied for a maintenance position, serving all the lifts, as wello as the overall maintaining of all the equipment on the grounds. Grew to working as the only maintenance tech on third shift. Later had opportunity to train thre or four employees to help me."
good,"Work is steady, management is good the work place is cheerful.  The hardest thing about the Job is not meeting your deadline on time. Working with the Vendors in different Countries was great."
good,"Good place to work. Depending on what department/position you work in, can get overwhelming at times. Just gotta keep yourself busy and on top of your responsibilities."
good,"The people I worked with were awesome for the most part with the exception of the department manager.  It was a fun place to work otherwise,  Working in toddler/baby i learned kids are fun."
good,It's not a hard job but there are many tasks to complete in a very little amount of time. Sometimes it feels like you are pulled in different directions and there needs to be more of you.
good,"JC Penney was fine when I started working for them, but the only problem I had was I was in high school and they had no regard for my work hours.  I was going in directly after school and not getting off until midnight or so and I still had to come home and get my homework done.  Therefore I went to school a lot of mornings early to try and catch up on my homework and studies."
good,"Management was terrible about promoting within the company. Employees were lazy and disrespectful occasionally. other times worked hard and were decent people to be around. Management doesnt care about your well being, as long as the job gets done. Pay could be better if raises were done better and/or more frequent. 7/hr in highchool isnt terrible at all. 8/hr as a college student and more(an actual adult) is NOT ok."
good,"taking catalog orders"
good,"If you're a student looking to balance both a part time and school, this is an okay place to work at. The thing I liked most about it was how flexible they are to fit your school schedule."
good,jcpenny call center was a very cool place to work at. They are very laid back. You are able to take your time with customer. But you do the same thing over and over.
good,"They had at the time the best variety of window treatments in this area.  I did enjoy helping customers choose the appropriate window treatments for their homes.  I was very pleased with the products, however it was a commission based salary and there just was enough sales to support my salary."
good,"As a seasonal Christmas hire, I was trained quickly and I learned quickly jumping into black Friday sales and commission bonuses. It was an overall easy going work place with the fast paced environment that I excel in."
good,Fun place to work with career opportunities.   Good customer service experience.  Great earning potential.  Team oriented work culture.  Supportive management team.
good,"cashier and floor work, working night shifts or closings mean you wont clock out until the WHOLE store is done. Management is ok. Coworkers and departments are different from on another but build easy relationships"
good,"JC Penney is very fast paced work environment. We muat be able to keep up with the constant changes in department sets and core standards. I am fortunate enough to have an excellent, supportive management team."
good,People are nice a friendly there. Mike is a really good store manager. He will work with what ever you need. It's a very bright and welcoming place to walk in to.
good,"fantastic workplace, fun associates, and best team leaders, for me I was very happy working there and I've learned more customer service. The store has the easiest duties and some customers at the time are very friendly."
good,"On a typical work day, you provide customers service while maintaining a clean workplace. Overall, the atmosphere is calm and the store is quiet. The pay is great for the work."
good,"JCPenney is just like any other sales store. It wasn't hard work at all. Enjoyable if you make it enjoyable. If you go to work dreaded your work day, it'll be lame. The worst part of the job was the pay."
good,"been with company for many years, each person becomes like family, hardest part will be lack of communication , management is great, laid back, love it"
good,"My coworkers were amazing! We always had so much fun together. I learned a lot here about how to deal with people in the correct manner. The hardest part of this job was sometimes dealing with difficult customers, but a friendly smile will usually win them over!"
good,"fast  paced, required to perform many tasks. "
good,"i was only working seasonal, they let the pe0ople that were seasonal go, and the people that already worked there were lazy and rude to customers . ..they let me go because they couldn't afford 8.50 an hour ."
good,"For whatever reason when I was working there there was"
good,"It was a fantastic job. I loved working there. It was great, fun, and friendly place to be at. Everyone there was cool and everyone there got along. People where great to talk to. I always looked forward to working. But it did not have the best pay. The managers where miserable working there while my peers made the job great."
good,"if you don't have any experience this is a great place to start at"
good,"Assisting customers with their purchases, opening charges, straightening department"
good,"I worked there during my Christmas break, and two summers. The overall experience was decent. It was really busy during the times I was employed there. Very fast paced."
good,I work in the men's department. I enjoy meeting people. We get a lot of foreign visitors. I also meet a lot of people from my neighborhood. I have  refined my customer service.
good,"I loved working here and with this being my first job it showe me alot of things, my team we're a bunch of help probs ine of my favorite jobs thus far, if i didn't need more money i would still be working there, it's a fun place, however f you don't agree with the saying the customers are always right then this is not the job for ya."
good,"If you can relocate and have great cultural leadership, you can provide great leadership to this company. Typical day is to review workload and manage workforce based on daily/weekly volume."
good,Great job just not able to get enough hours due to lack of business. Hours continually cut with little notice. Would like to find another job and be able to stay on as part time.
good,"I'd never worked a ""Box"" store before, and enjoyed the experience. Management was friendly and consistent with training. Work environment was overall enjoyable."
good,"JcPenneys was an okay job for me. I had a few issues with mean management which caused me to leave. I enjoyed the job itself, assisting customers and running a register but I did not feel like I could extend my skills there."
good,"Take calls and make calls regarding customer's orders.  Work with multiple vendors from various manufacturers and delivery companies, and also work escalated issue cases.  The most difficult part of my job is resolving problems for the customers when they get upset about not receiving their order on time from the manufacturer.  I enjoy what I do and the people I work with.  I also like working with anywhere between eight and 10 different programs on a daily basis."
good,I had a lot of fun working with the people at JCP. We had good laughs and got our jobs done. I was sad that they let most of my team go (including me).
good,"lack of management in the salon, I was there for 5 years with little advancement. Worked for the company during the transition of CEOs , which was a challenge. Moved on in order to grow."
good,I liked the people I worked with and most of the customers that came in to shop. I was able to solve problems that came my way in whatever means necessary. (handling it myself or getting a manager).
good,"Transferred to this location due to store closing at another location. There was a fair amount of turn over within the management team. No store support for salon, lack of training, guidance,and unrealistic goals."
good,"I sold suits in the men's Dept.  Responsible to taking measurements of customers and helping customers select ties, shirts and shoes.  I particularly enjoyed making recommending what type of suit to wear."
good,"This position included cashiering, as well as customer service. A typical day would include tending to the neatness of the store, waiting on customers, and cashiering. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it allowed me to stay close to home and work part time while my children were very young."
good,"running cash register and organizing shelves"
good,It was a great place to work with good people and a great environment to learn and build.  I learned a lot on the job through training and just everyday.  The hardest part was learning to interact with managers and supervisors but once I figured it out it got better.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the store save money through prevention's/apprehensions/internal investigations.
good,"Great company to work for. Fast paced environment to keep you busy. Overtime always offered. Advancement possible. Constant training. Hours are flexible, just dont be late."
good,Great company to work for. I enjoyed going to work everyday. My managers were awesome to work for. The people I worked with were top notch. I am not sure what direction the company will be going in. i hope thestock price will improve with time
good,"I was a photographer so a typical day would be wait for a customer and then take there pictures, they would either hate the pictures or love them but it had nothing to do with the quality of the pictures if they hated them it was because they didn't appreciate how they looked and expected me to some how fix there appearance."
good,it was an experience for me to be able to serve customers one on one and also to work in a store like JCPenney it was ok to work there in that store
good,"Typically self paced. Learned a lot operationally. Culture is great amongst associates. Nothing is too hard, all resources are available. Most enoyable is the environment."
good,It was a decent job to be working at some really good people to be working with and a terrific Manager. I've learned a lot from the co-workers working at JcPenney's. I enjoyed my job
good,"Very fast paced but was a pretty good job. Learned a lot very quickly, a lot of work with the community. The team to work with was really good, and friendly."
good,"It was a great place to work at customers were nice and friendly, The job isn't hard to catch up to it does get busu during the holidays great sales overall a nice place to work at if your going to school. its hard to become full time thats for sure"
good,The schedule was flexible enough but the product availability was limited. The consultant had to use her own vehicle for each appointment with little compensation. Better fabric selection would have made more sales.
good,"Working out on the floor, helping customers with their needs and wants. I learned to meet weekly credit quota. We work together to fulfil each customer needs."
good,"A typical day at work was to ring up customer transactions, assist customers on the sales floor, and fold clothes when there were no customers. I learned that there is truly a way to deal with the wide variety of customers that exist. You just have to figure out which method best suits specific customers. The management was pretty good but I feel that at times they did not do an adequate job at communicating.The hardest part of the position was the expectations that arose during holiday season. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers who I formed relationships with."
good,"I worked in the asset protection department which was a unique way to gain experience in the criminal justice field and make some money on the side while going to school. However the job was very dangerous, stressful, and complicated. There is also not a lot of room for growth and the management team and sales associates often times don't have a clue what they're doing."
good,"At JCPenny Distribution I was the assistant of the sorter machine. I learn how to build pallets, use a pallet jack, operate a rf scanner, and general warehouse duties. I'll fix issues on the line, sort boxes, and use computer software."
good,"Restrictive dress code, places too much emphasis on recruiting new clients and not enough of creativity. Bottom line is that they are a corporate based business, and struggling to meet high profit/return schedules."
good,"The day will include a certain number of credit cards that you have to open, the managers will push you to make the goals, and will scorn you if you do not. Management tends to get too carried away and they will push you to meet the goals set forth by the company. The hardest part of the job is working with the rude customers, and the rude coworkers. The best part of the job is when you make a customers day."
good,Great company culture and really good discounts. If they paid better I probably would still be there. They do have good benefits if you are considered a full time employee. Job security really depends on your position.
good,JC Penney was a fun workplace but stressful and busy during holidays. I really enjoyed working with my co workers. Management was professional and fair.
good,I did enjoy working for J.C. Penney Telemarketing Center.  It was a fun place to work with good people. There was advancement opportunities from entry level to call center management.
good,penny is a great place to start your career . Your are able to build your clients and they tend to hire students right out of school. The way is ok to start.
good,"Working their they expect to much for a store like that. "
good,"It was a fun environment to work out there on the floor with other employees whom you get along with. but, stressful when it's get busy with limited help"
good,"JCPenny was a good job for me to have while I was in high school. They worked around my busy schedule and there was always opportunities to pick up more hours. The managers and coworkers were very supportive as we worked together to meet the goals of the company. However , I wasn't allowed to grow in the company as I would've hoped and the hours were not consistent."
good,Even though I was only seasonal I had a great learning experience from the co workers up to the managers dome days were good and some wasn't days you had free lunch depending on the department did good or even the whole store
good,"I enjoyed working there very much, "
good,"Start with walking my areas of responsibility pulling sales results and credit results. I also always checked out attendance log."
good,"To Whom It May Concern,"
good,Worked at JC Penney for many years.  Enjoyed meeting people and assisting them with their purchases.  Then the opened a furniture department which I enjoyed even more.  On commission so that usually meant a better paycheck.
good,A typical day at work would include going into Jcpenney and advertising the salon with coupons and promotions going on within the salon. The hardest part of the job is to prospect clients from the mall and into the salon to your chair. The most enjoyable part of the day was when you finish a client and their incredibly happy with their service. There was always opportunity for education with almost monthly paid classes and training.
good,"Help customers find exactly what they look for. I go over the book of what the store goal for the day, coupons, and sales. Hard working Co workers. Hardest part is re-ticketing. Most enjoyable part of the job is the regular customers."
good,"A typical work day includes many different task involving helping customers out finding a specific item or just pointing them into the right direction, or it could be processing a return."
good,"nice people and chill workplace, but management expects you to smile 24/7. which i think its not a realistic think to do all the time."
good,Change in Mgmt style was difficult to endure. Micro mgmt. was insulting after having been there 8 years. Short staffing had me many times watching shoes as well as fine jewelry.
good,"Very repetitive no new sales to excite people,managers were unhelpful in helping me transfer from Maumee to Findlay JCPenney, stretch of days between shifts"
good,"A typical day on support consists of moving fixtures and moving a full wall of cloths just to put them back up on the same wall. The Management could be more organized with tasks, when working on the floor when the store is open. The Co-workers their are extremely friendly and are their to help. The hardest part of the job is showing up and having too many people on staff and a slow day."
good,I liked working at Penney's because it was busy work. I loved talking to the customers and helping them find what fits their personality the most. The management was great. All of them were welcoming and warm. The hardest part of the job was the hours. I needed more and they were only able to give me 20 hours weekly. They soon closed after I started and was sad to see it leave Marion.
good,"Primary responsibility is accurate processing of charge/cash.Also responsible for maintaining a clean wrap desk and for putting all merchandise /returns away on their shelves.  Also responsible for straightening the clothes in each dept. Restocking as necessary.  Then we also were recruited for dressing room duty which involved hanging all clothes and putting them back on their perspective racks, re-tagging if necessary.   The co-workers varied.  Some of them were very pleasant and we worked together as a team, while others didn't  do their job at all or worked at an exaggeratedly  slow pace.  The most difficult part of the job was staying busy when it was very slow and you  had already cleaned the department you were assigned to twice in 10 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management.  They were friendly and supportive to the employees."
good,Was hired for holidays and worked hard. Was told right before Christmas that they didn't have the hours to keep any seasonal people but to reapply for back to school season. Later found out that they hired at least two seasonal people that were hired after me.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers, completing transactions, keeping the workplace clean. Management is good, they are always willing to help. Some co-workers are friendly, and easy to get along with, others not so much. Most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying customers!"
good,"Fun people, but they only give hours to high credit apps collectors, you can meet a lot of nice customers and employees. One of the great things I learned was customer service skills. Great place for part-time but not for a family based individual."
good,"Overall, JCPenney is a great company caught in the whirlwind of multiple CEOs over the last few years, leading to constant change, uncertainty, and even fear."
good,"The training was not too great. I was just thrown into the job and had to figure out how things worked. Almost everyone is nice and they work well with my hours and my manager is pretty cool and chill. Although, some of the other managers are the opposite. But overall, I am 50/50 when it comes to working there. The hardest part of the job is figuring things out own your own and being thrown in every department but the one I requested. I finally work in it because the person who did work in it was fired. So the most enjoyable is working and making that department look nice."
good,Managers were exceptional at creating competition in the workplace in order to post sales and morals. Only main issue that has presented itself would be the amounts of error seen with scheduling shifts.
good,"Customers came in with good moods and left with the same. management wasn't bad, co-workers wasn't bad either. Good place to be all around"
good,Meet new people everyday. Co-workers are excellent people. Stocking and straightening the floor merchandise. Placing online orders and completing sales transaction. Feels good to see a smile on your customers face when you have assisted them with their shopping needs.
good,"JC Penney Jewelry Department was a great place to work. I particulary enjoyed learning about the products and helping clients to make good choices. I particularly enjoyed the cultivation of the client base and the loyalty they showed."
good,"I didn't mind it for a high school job. I made over minimum wage, people were nice, customers were kind of awful, but besides that, all was fantastic."
good,"This is retail at it's finest. The company itself has changed from time to time. They still have their regular customers that have been cardholders for 30+ years. JCPenney has changed throughout the years. It's a great start for anyone looking for a place to start. They are flexible with your schedule, strict on making sure you take your lunch, and fun when it comes to your associates."
good,"It was a pretty easy job, keeping things neat, being nice to customers, they don't really hassle you on much, just always LOOK busy. Hour lunches, nice discount, cultural atmosphere, kinda family like during the holiday season, everyone cooks n the department feeds people every now and then."
good,Helped pay my way through college. I loved the fast pace competition of being in sales and accomplishment of meeting and exceeding sales goals. I enjoyed getting to know and engage customers in conversation.
good,The hardest part of this job is probably working during the holidays. It can be pretty stressful and very tiring but overall it is a good job that does work with your schedule if you are going to school.
good,"enjoy the busy atmosphere"
good,a day at jcpenney is that you get work really hard for not a lot of money. the only thing I had learned at jcpenney was good customer service and to get things done in a timely matter. the management was okay. the co worker learn how to communicate between each other to get things done in a timely matter.
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work, friendly people to work with, but they don't have enough hours for me. I am looking for a full time job, with a good pay."
good,"I work at the store's mall entrance which allows me to greet and assist various people on a daily basis.  I work the register and restock merchandise; occasionally, I help my supervisor with merchandise placement. I have learned to appreciate and to be more patient when dealing with the public. Smiling goes a long way. Some younger co-workers are not as willing to be team members and lack public experience. The hardest part of the job is accepting that all workers do not appreciate their job like I do. Sometimes there is a shortage of supervisors on a shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to assist the public and to learn new skills."
good,"kind customer assistant worker, helping and assisting other employees, great eam worker, joyful personality, great communication, stocking and truck unloading"
good,Flexible hours and great people. District management tries hard to make Christmas fun. The company is facing challenges that they seem eager to address and are working to solve.
good,"I really enjoyed shopping with the customers. Helping the customers to navigate the site in order to have a great online shopping experience."
good,I loved the discounts I used to get while working there. It is usally really busy on weekends and holidays. It has gotten better throughout the years. Sometimes deal with difficult costumers but it was a bit fun to work there.
good,"Great benefits and job security. "
good,"Working with this company was a great experience, and all the employees valued teamwork. My accomplishments at this company helped me grow as a person and a supervisor."
good,nice everionment if you like retail customer service but no advancement opportunities. they give you a big load of work but they expect you accomplish your task while giving you another pile of work
good,"They are results driven and demand 110%. There is opportunity to move up in the company. The only negative thing is the work life balance. You often go months without having 2 days off in a row and when you do get them they are rarely weekends. Management is very friendly and want to see you improve and move up. The culture is about team and being passionate and winning everyday. It is about going above and beyond standards every single day. Sometimes meaning you work 10 plus days in a row and 50 hours a week. Overall, if you are willing to work hard it is a great place to work."
good,very high paced and active salon. I enjoyed the number of clients that came in and out of the salon due to it being in the mall. enjoyable but overwhelming environment.
good,"fast paced, meet a lot of people, always learning something new, chance for advancement with hard work, and open door policy"
good,"Working in JC Penny's was very nice, generally managers were fair, and coworkers were nice and easy to work with. The atmosphere of JC Penny's is very peaceful and calming because of the style, the music, and cleanliness of the place. At JC Penny's we used modern equipment that made the process of returns, check-outs, exchanges, paying bills, etc..  faster and easier. Managers were fair and caring which is a huge deal in terms of having a good work experience. The hardest part of the job was busy days keeping up with maintaining the store appearance and working with customers, but my coworkers and I would work together and accomplish our goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and seeing them leave happy and well taken care of."
good,It was FUN working with JC Penny especially with my co-workers. It was very challenging when it comes to the customers. Customers comes with a different personalities but I was handled it very well..
good,I had a wonderful experience with this company.  The supervisors are very engaged with their associates. Great benefits as well as meeting many people from different backgrounds.
good,"Good quality products, nice clientele, good benefits, pay okay.  Reduction in workforce made working there difficult for all associates and supervisors"
good,JC Penny was a great place to work so that i can use my customer service skills and provide the best care for the clients. JC Penny also had a since of collaboration in team work.
good,"What my roll was at JCPenney was a Customer Service Associate . I would stock the shelf, I worked at the register , helped customers with what they need to find , order items from our online catalog  , also I have worked in the stock room and when a shipment would come in I would help with organizing and size the items before they went to the shelves"
good,"The people with whom I had the pleasure of working with, made the job and obstacles that much acceptable and manageable on a bad day. It was a good place to work."

The most enjoyable part of my job would definitely be the people I work with. I enjoy helping them grow, and all the different personalities."
good,Productive and flexible work environment. The management was kind and understanding. The work allowed employees to learn and grow within the department.
good,"I was a college student so working there was easy for me. I worked part time in the Women's Department. Everyone working there was in college because of the town so it was fun. Pay never really changed no matter how long you worked there. But every morning we would have a staff meeting to get the day started. Make sure everything is cleaned up and ready to go for all the incoming customers. My main job was to work one on one with customers, make sure they stay happy and are happy when they leave. We have a small quota of sales per JCPenney Credit Cards and my quota was always met but getting the approval rate was the hardest part. I learned howork with other personalility by working at JCpenney"
good,"a typical day would include me looking at the computer and ipad finding the graphics you need and changing the floor set for the month that includes graphics, fixtures, and updating mannequins. and giving the store a nice clean finish."
good,"The younger workers sometimes too noisy for me.  Comments were made by a couple of customers that it sound like a party was going on. When call volume was down, there would not be anything else to do but sit or go home. As a part time employee, there was too much down time. I went home more than staying on the job. Which ultimately led to my resigning.  I liked the phone calls especially the elderly or individuals that did not have computers and no longer had the catalogs to reference.  Most enjoyable part was to help locate  items for customers. Choosing accessories for household or offering suggestions."
good,Taking catalog orders and helping customers over the phone was very enjoyable and my first phone  job so I really started to like that call center environment at the time
good,"While working at JCPenney, the company went through a lot of changes due to new CEOs.  Basic retail work and not really challenged to perform at a higher level.  My co-workers were a pleasure to work with. Working in a bigger store, I had three managers above me, which sometimes the communication wasn’t always there."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Jcpenny Salon for the clients, the furthered education and the other stylist. The only thing I can say I didn't enjoy they did not pay very well and that they didn't keep their products stocked which became an issue."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of setting up merchandise on the sales floor. And ringing people up at the cash register. Helping customers with questions, needs and purchases. Always giving prompt and courteous service. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing you helped someone find the perfect piece."
good,"My day starts with unpacking the merchandise boxes, then organizing the merchandise and putting them on a cart. Then I push the cart to the sales floor and put them on a hanging rack or shelves.If too much merchandise for sales floor we backstock the merchandise in an organized fashion on shelves for specific items."
good,"I enjoy the job and the people I work with. I enjoy the interaction with customers, anticipating their needs and helping to fulfill those needs. Customer service is the number one priority in any business. Without our customers, we have no business. The management team is a coaching team as well, encouraging the team and acknowledging team members for top performances. The team at JCPenney is fun to work with while being professional as well as customer oriented.  A typical day at work would be maintaining the look and feel of my department wile assisting customers with in store purchases as well as online orders. Offering JCP credit card applications to every customer while explaining the great perks of the card. Being customer oriented as I am, the hardest part would be not being able assist customers as quickly as I would like to, do to company cut backs in labor costs. What I enjoy most is seeing someone walk out of our store happy with the purchase they just made."
good,"I  like it the area is really nice, and I enjoy helping my customer and it is nice to be able to make the customer happy, just the benefits not that good need place to give some benefits"
good,"Good upbeat work environment.  Really fun place to work over the holidays.  Otherwise slow, and boring which is the hardest part of this job.  Management is respectful and smart.  Co-workers are for the most part helpful and kind."
good,"A good work environment though would be very upbeat on weekends and holidays. Management was strong and direct in keeping employees steady and focus on the jobs at hand. While here I was trained in some management roles in regard to staging the areas of the store to the wanted set up, along with training new hires on roles and best way to get there jobs done easily and efficiently."
good,"A typical day at JC Penny Inc., was interacting with customers and to let them be satisfied. Part of this job  was to be productive and dealing with solution to problems."
good,"really enjoyed my 4 yrs at JCP it was a interesting experience. Ive learned about about retail. The managers was great people to work with, they really helped me better the person i needed to be."
good,"A typical day at JCPenney's is tending to fitting rooms, rack maintenance, assisting customers on the floor to help find their needs and what suits them best as well as assisting upon checkout, answering calls, placing orders and opening or closing registers at beginning or end of shift. I have learned what it takes to have outstanding customer service, resulting on loyal returning customers. The co workers over time can feel like family, your grow close to them as you work in a team over several months or even years. There isn't necessarily a hard part about working at JCPenney's, but it does become a tiring job due to cleaning and standing all day. The most enjoyable part about the job is pleasing the customers, knowing you were helpful and possibly made a difference in their shopping experience or even boosting their self confidence. I also enjoyed the many friends I have made there through out the years."
good,"I love this job its a great environment with great people, I just don't get enough hours or pay."
good,"no complaints, I love the jobs and people that i've worked with"
good,"A typical day of work at the JCPenney styling salon included booking appointments for the hair stylists, answering the phones, making sure the merchandise displays were up to company standards. I was able to take classes regarding a new hair color line, as well as classes for upcoming popular haircut trends. My co-workers were all friendly and professional. The general management was all right. While I worked at the JCPenney styling salon, we upgraded our appointment booking system which was one of the more difficult systems to learn, as well as teach the other associates to use. The most enjoyable part of working there was seeing the customers faces as they left the salon ecstatic with the results of their trip to the salon."
good,Very Productive work place. Everyday as an employee i felt like i was apart of the bigger picture and was of value to the company.
good,"Moved boxes around to there designated areas. Built arm strength, did 12 hours a day. The hardest part was thre non stop boxes coming. The most enjoyable part was the experience i got, it was my first job."
good,"Greeting customers, assisting and directing training associates"
good,The work place has a system and well organized management team. They are very energetic. Always ready to listen to our concerns. The Hardest part of the job is consistency when it comes to dress codes. it confuses me a lot. Different department heads have different management styles on how to execute the dress code policy. My co-workers are very reliable and very responsible.
good,My team worked to provide the best support with as little expense as possible; Centralized management of diverse systems across multiple geographic locations.
good,my day started at 6am-2:30pm which was great for a single mom.
good,"Being with jcpenney for over a year in 2 different cities has helped me tremendously, I dealt with over 100 different people very day including coworkers which are great people to work with, very helpful and informant my supervisor and store manager were very hands on and they worked with me instead of throwing orders my way. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers learning about them and their everyday lives as well as likes and dislikes. The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone was satisfied"
good,"I was optimistic and optimism followed, customers always gravitated towards me for assistance and advice. I was always willing and eager to provide them with what they needed. I learned a lot about sizing, color palettes, floor displays, appealing to the customer by being myself. I developed a few friendships with a few co-workers that also attended my church so I enjoyed working with them for the most part. The hardest part of working at JcPenney was being on my feet all day and by the time I would get home it would be time to soak them for relieve. I mainly enjoyed the diversity of working there with so many different people and learning from them."
good,"I go into work at around three o'clock am or four o'clock am depending on the amount of merchandise we are getting on the truck that morning. I will either help unpack the boxes or I will start putting the merchandise on the floor. That takes a few hours, but after it is all out I will start restocking items we have sold throughout the week. That also takes a few hours after that is all restocked, I find a supervisor and ask if they have any projects that they need finished if not I will go but if they have a project, then I stay and work on it until its completed. When I go start my day in the morning the store is close, however we work into the store opening so while I complete my work I also am frequently stopped to help customers, after I help them it is back to finishing projects and restocking."
good,Easy job. I worked in the Home dept.  Managers are not on you 24/7 like other jobs. The only complaint I have is the pay. I got paid only $8.75/hour. There is no insurance available for part-timers but you do accumulate vacation time after a year when you work part-time. Also 25% discount on everything including sephora.
good,Worked as a Sales Associate.  Helped Customers with purchases they were seeking
good,"out going atmosphere"
good,"I worked here during seasonal months and learned things relatively quickly. Pretty laid back atmosphere. Always a steady amount of customers. I enjoy busy work so this store (and retail in general) provided that. Good pay and hours for part time. Offered many incentives and commission pay as well. Very clean, well-kept and modern store."
good,"A typical day at work was very simple, I would just go in and help customers that needed assistance and check people out and asked if they wanted to sign up for a JCPenny card. I learned how to fold clothes and handle different kinds of customers. The management was good and was willing to work around your schedule if needed. My co-workers were nice and were willing to trade me shifts when needed. The hardest part of the job was when it got super busy and you got stuck at the register by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people and help them find something that they needed."
good,A team member and investigators. Oversee 3 employees on the job.
good,"A typical day at work for me while I was there was sitting in my office going through training on Window Treatments, Top Treatments, and things like that. I used a basic computer and an iPad to learn this type of detail. I familiarized myself with the basics of window treatments and how to properly cover a window with them. By this I mean, determining the amount of yardage needed to make the custom curtains / draperies for each different customer. I also learned how to determine what type of window treatments each customer would want by taking out sample books for them to look through and determine what they wanted."
good,"On a typical day I would come in and unload the truck early in the morning with the other girls. Organize merchandise onto carts and racks as per area they were going to. "
good,"Working here is great. What we do was price labels with a group of 5-8ppls. I've also do recieving, picking and packing and sometime off loading. What's so great about this is that I've never work alone and we always help each other. We are always a team to complete our duties at the end of the day."
good,Working with Jcpenny's was a really good job to have. I enjoyed working with customers and being able to relate to a lot of them. I learned how to use a register and how to do sales. My co-workers were nice and were very helpful. The hardest part about the job was on holidays when we were packed with costumers we had a time limit to spend with costumers because it was to busy.
good,"A typical day at JCP was varied. You go in to work in business casual, badge in, put your smile on and go to meet the JCP world. "
good,Enjoyed the friendliness and fun of everyone when breaking down pallets.
good,"Doing different projects everyday. Moving merchandise to set Sales Planner, constistant customer service."
good,"I have 14 years in retail experience.  I was hired with JCPenney the day I completed my last credit in high school.  I moved up from the floor to a supervisor position within two years.  I organized and stocked the floor and back stockrooms for several years, keeping my supervisor informed of any merchandise we needed reordered.  I became a supervisor over the Store’s Pricing Accuracy Department.  I assisted in hiring new recruits, prepared all signs and equipment needed for each time we had a new advertisement, and ensured our store was 100% accurately priced and items were marked correctly.  I also assisted in auditing the store, played a vital role in our store’s yearly inventory.  for a year, I handled the stores cashroom on weekends.  I prepared the daily deposits."
good,"A typical day at that job use to consist of everything from customer service, data entry, issue resolution, etc. I learned how to work at a faster speed than before. Management did a nice job with hiring the best well spoken, people with customer service experience, and helping the workers when help was needed. My co-workers were pretty great, they helped the business to grow and succeed which was our overall goal. The hardest part of the job was having to sometimes work double shifts because that would become very tiring after time. The most enjoyable part of the job, I would have to say would have been knowing that at the end of the work shift I helped someone with buying, ordering and/or just helping through customer service."
good,JCPenney's is a good starting job. The company is very team oriented which makes working there easy because the environment is nice. In my particular JCP store it was nearly impossible to advance even with a bachelor's degree. The hardest part of the job is simply feeling as though you will be stuck in the same position no matter how great you perform.
good,I enjoyed working at Penneys. I would have stayed till retirement. I had to leave due to medical reasons. My supervisor was very supportive. She and I are friends today.
good,"I worked thursday through sunday which were the busier days of the week so stylists had receptionist roles as well if they didn't have a client. Restocking was done everyday whether it was the retail shelves, color bar, or back bar. The manager was overall pretty active in the salon and sometimes would get behind the chair if every stylist had a client. The relationship between co-workers and the manager was not the best but drama was kept to a minimum and everyone was still professional."
good,"Working for J.C.Penney was my first job, it was simple and laid back for the most part. I ran the registers and did the stocking and organizing for the women's department. I learned the value of being responsible, and dependable. The management was amazing, they did there jobs and went above and beyond to help those who were newly hired. My co-workers were all very polite and respectful, we had a happy work place and we all worked together. The hardest part of my job was cleaning up the store within an hour after closing a busy day. The customers I came in contact with would be the most enjoyable part of my job. I had to leave because I fell behind in school and had to go to summer school to make up a couple credits. I needed to focus on my high school work to start my senior year."
good,A typical day at work would be to have customers calling in placing orders via phone or internet in search of items ranging from clothes to toys.  In certain situations I would assist the customer with their shopping experience making sure they have found all the products they were in search of and maybe even products that were needed but not brought to my attention or the shoppers attention.  Try and make the customers shopping experience relaxing and accurate.
good,working hard and learning about different merchandise and meeting different people.
good,"Managers were amazing, always there if you had a question"
good,"theres a lot of drama in retail but overall its not a bad job."
good,"A typical day would be operating a cash register, cleaning up the store and greeting along with helping customers."
good,Completed customers needs for procedures performed on my clients hair.
good,"On truck days can be a little stressfull, because there is such a rush to have everything put out by a certian time. Love the upper management. Some of the procedures that are suppose to be used for the truck days are not used and i think that would help things not be so stressfull if they would follow all the procedures. I get a long well with almost all the employees. There is a couple that our personalities are different but we can still manage to work together. Love helping customers and working with great people. Like the lunches that they give for different reasons. All an all I like working there just not enough income to pay bills and provide for my family."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping 10-15 customers on a regular day basis that does not include holidays. I generally assist customers with sizing of their neck, sleeve and chest to determine their exact size for suits and shirts. My coworkers are generally nice and friendly. Hardest part to be honest is the criticism and management from other coworkers. Some feel the need to boss people around to feel a sense of having power although they are ranked the same as everyone else. I really enjoy assisting customers especially when all the sizes are available for them at the store mainly because it generates revenue for the store."
good,It was great place to work. I really enjoyed working there and would recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to work hard for their pay check
good,My tyypical day at work is being active around the store. I learned how to use the cash register. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was organizing the store after closing. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,"I enjoyed working in a different cultural diversity group. It enhance the ability to learn about other culture and to respect their own culture. Without any means taking care of each individual customers whereas making sure they have a smile on their faces and wanted to come back shopping at the store along with bringing someone with them. Having great customer service skills and effectively communication skills is the key in solving any problems. Also honest , is a core standard which everyone should feel comfortable within their own self."
good,"Had a good time working there, sure there's drama and such but all in all it's a really good work environment."
good,work with great people. store didn't have much merchandise . long hours and weak pay . get 30 min lunch break .. closing the store was the worst...
good,"Working in retail, you get to meet different people. The job itself is not hard. Very laid back."
good,I like the environment and being around the costumers. Wish they would have kept me on the team longer but instead was let go after holidays even though I talked multiple times with boss and co-workers about staying. do not expect steady hours because management has their favorites. beside for that good fast pace work nice people and easy for the most part.
good,"JC Penney is fine to work at part time. Schedules are occasionally flexible, but at times, management won't work around things."
good,It was a seasonal job. I enjoyed my job. I also did customer service there.
good,"Your normal retail job - I liked my job, manager, & coworkers - the sales goals were not realistic"
good,"loved working there, and you meet a lot of nice people."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at JCPenney is making very customer smile by helping their needs!
good,"I worked at JCPenney for almost 2 years in both commission and regular payroll. The cashier and floor jobs aren't bad the most difficult part is selling credit. Commission departments are more complicated, The pay and the percentage in commission should be slightly higher for how much time the employees put into their work. Around the time I left was when jcp was starting to change under financial struggles and the changes in the company policies was one of the main reasons I left"
good,"Desk job, lots of paper work, scheduling, proposals, and customer service, team work and worked closely to cso"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at JCPenney because it gave me a lot of customer service experience and my position there taught me how to work under pressure.
good,"assisting customers with finding certain items they are looking for"
good,I enjoyed learning many different things. I worked with several wonderful people.The employees were great and even my supervisor was very easy to get along with. I used the cash register and helped out customers when needed. I loved the interaction with the customers and the people i worked with.
good,when i started working it was great. Met nice people and made friends the first day. Co workers and I developed a method to better get work done at night which was fun. Soon the store changed. The pricing changed; the people working in the same department for months were moved and the store environment was never the same. that part I didnt like. I left before the store had gotten worse.
good,Just like any place there is going to be some bad things and some good. I love how flexible they are with my schedule. They are very laid back and are not too strict about certain things.
good,my typical day at work is working with customers working on the floor organizing merchandise. Putting new merchandise out
good,I only worked as a seasonal employee. The management from what I can remember was fun and easy to work with along with other employees. Working during the holidays was very stressful but the pay was good because they need people to work. I was guaranteed 40+ hours but that's because it was holiday rush. I wish they would have kept me to continue working.
good,the hardest part of the job was learning about the system they used on the computer for their pricing and signing techniques.
good,"Display merchandise on the sales floor and assist customers with the checkout of their items Microsoft Office & Internet Explorer		"
good,I enjoyed working at JC Penny.  I was able to utilize my skills and enjoy working at the same time. It was nice to meet people and I felt satisfied in the job I did there. It's a very fast paced environment and you have to multi task.
good,"Working at Jcpenny's was okay, I like going there because I got to interact with kids while I rung up there parents. I learned at Jcpenny's how to do retail. My co-works was nice, the hardest part of my job was cleaning up the store at the end of the day because costumers would leave the store a mess. And I enjoyed helping people find clothes to wear."
good,worked with my class schedule very well and understanding management about school objectives.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. They had many incentives and cared about their employees. Besides pay, I would recommend this job to any college student, graduate or business professional."
good,Good job security but after holiday season hours slow up greatly
good,Jcpenny is a good place to work if you get enough hrs. you can meet a lot of different people.
good,this was my 1st job ever right after high school and i enjoyed pretty good.. this is were i got all my experienece in customer service and more
good,"I enjoyed the job itself however I felt that 99% of the time we were understaffed. I spent most of my day assisting customers with finding shoes in the shoe department. The hardest part of my job was handling irritated and rude customers. 95% of my customers were awesome people, but we did have about 5% of them who did everything in their power to make your job harder. But I held tight to my professionalism and kept a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part of my job was my fellow co-workers. Almost all of them had a friendly disposition and I really enjoy working with them. As far as management is concerened, I found them to be helpful, but like my co-workers I believe they too were understaffed."
good,"this was a seasonal job , it was a great experience  , fun very clean sales job"
good,Went to work did what I was assigned and the clocked out when it was time
good,They worked great around other's schedule. Management was more than happy to let you work to the best of your ability.
good,"I was in charge of the women's section.  It was the biggest section in the store and I didn't have the help that I needed to succeed.  I was in charge of set plans and the upper management was supposed to help.  They would sit in the back.  Thank goodness for the visual lady, she gave me the help I needed.  They would need help covering in other areas and would never teach you before hand.  So it was an uncomfortable situation when you couldn't answer any questions.  I was a fan of their scheduling system.  They gave us every other weekend off."
good,I learned alot about how retail works. The co-workers were great. there was no hard part about this job.
good,"It was an overall great experience ,that led to great friendships. The company has great values and does a lot with the community ,which is a great aspect."
good,"typical work day was to assist customers."
good,"Worked there while attending college, great part time work to take care of my basic needs."
good,This job was a great learning experience for me.  Quality control was a new position for me and they taught me how to do this job well.  I'm grateful for the learning experience and hope the best for this company
good,"JCP, believes in making customers happy. I am constantly trying ways to make sure our customers are satisfied at the end of the day. I have learned so much from customers, by taking time to hear how they feel and what they want. My co-workers and I work as a team, so we can get the job done efficiently.The hardest part of my job would be, if I couldn't resolve an issue for my customer. My most enjoyable part of my job would have to be, meeting new people daily."
good,This was a seasonal position. This company needed people for the holidays and after the holidays I received a permanent position with a different company.
good,good temp job. great hours and pay. friendly people to work with. easy days job.
good,"A typical day at work would involve customer service such as directing shoppers to various products and departments.  Also, I might be checking out customers at the cash register."
good,"A typical day at work was replenishing products on the floor so there would never be any open spaces.  Also, I would assist customers in bringing large items to their car or truck.  I have learned a few customer service tips, but mostly just how to organize stock in the stock room.  The management does not really know who you are unless you have been there for a while.  My co-workers were very nice and helpful in teaching me how to organize correctly.  The hardest part of my job was lifting an item that was around 80 pounds.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working around the holidays and being busy so the time went by quicker."
good,"this place would be great for anyone to work at. The hours were good, the pay was decent, and the environment was great. I worked a cash register, helped customers, cleaned out dressing rooms, and straightened clothing."
good,Good place to work. The hardest part of the job is to have to stay till 11pm to clean up the store.
good,"Working at JC Penny's was fantastic. The people I worked with, the managers, I loved very well, as though we were like family. THe best part about working there is how I always had something to do to make the store better."
good,"typical retail environment"
good,"My experiences at JC Penney was great i learned so much in a field i was unfamaliar with. And the chance to apply your creative skills was fantastic"
good,"My typical day at work was helping customers with their needs, checking them out at the cash registers, putting away clothes in the fitting room that customers had left in there, fixed the clothes and made sure our product was sized and finger spaced. I learned how to work the cash register, manage money, talk to customers, and made sure my fitting rooms were clean and neat. My co-workers helped me on a busy day. When I was trying to get caught up with my fitting rooms, they came and helped me put stuff away and taught me some things on the register if I didn't know how to do something. The hardest part of the job was when we had a really busy day and customers would leave a mess in the fitting rooms for us to clean. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i work with my co-workers and they're really helpful, which made the job easier and funner."
good,"A typical day starts out by walking onto the floor of your department and only leaving that area if a customer needs assistance elsewhere, or if you are putting an item away for another department. My co-workers were laid back, but got the job done right at the same time. It was a very enjoyable place to work. I only wished they needed someone to stay after the winter rush. The hardest part of the job would have been keeping the stockroom tidy, but everyone worked together so that wasn't even bad."
good,This job was overall a good job but when it comes to flexibility the management is all about their way or no way.
good,"A typical day at work involves receiving multiple projects from several different managers and managing my time to ensure that each one is completed efficiently and in a timely manner. I learned to be a better team leader and to have work done by the given deadline. Management had its ups and downs, but I just learned to work with it and not make it a big deal. The hardest part of my job would be with quite a few of my coworkers who's work ethics were just that they really didn't care. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to create sets on the floor and be as creative as I am there as I am when writing a book. "
good,"Good place to make semi steady income, work with your schedule for the most part. But a lot of night shifts even after a while of working there."
good,"Had a job here during the holidays back in 2009. They bust your butt, but the pay is awesome. I actually enjoyed this retail job, it was seasonal only. I would re apply"
good,"JC Penney has taught me a couple of things since i've been employed there. They have taught me how to strive and continue towards my goals, even if things arent neccessarily going my way. The manangement is somewhat encouraging at times: though they have a tendacy to be unequal, where equality is due. A typical day at work usually consist of the same work flow, never really changing: though decreasing lately. The hardest part of the day is when it gets down to the last stretch of the day (like many jobs); though my co-workers tend to brighten me to an certain extent, with they're jokes and laughter.Overall i'd say JC Penney isnt a horrible place to work, even with the minor flaws they may have."
good,I like working at JCP but I need more hours and I wish the management team was better.
good,J.C. Penney has a relaxing work environment with a customer friendly staff. The management was good with producing schedules and handling difficult customers. 
good,"working for JCpenney I was able to work with a variety of different individuals. I was able to help my customers, make sales. "
good,Flexable hours and relaxed dress code and they have a great work-life balance program. Great discounts at the stores
good,"I personally enjoyed working for Jcpenny. Not only were the work conditions comfortable the enviroment was friendly and very welcoming. In one typical work day my job consisted of many things; assisting customers with selecting a purchase best fit for them, handling the actual purchase which required me to use the POS (cashier) system, and I also had to organize and rearrange clothing sections according to a layout that came from management. My managers were always so kind and understanding, and I'd have to say that working with them and my co workers was probably the best part of the job. I'd have to say the worst part was that you sometimes had to deal with unhappy customers who seemed impossible to please. However, I enjoyed it very much when I could."
good,This is a good place to work for anyone looking for part-time work and students both high school and college because of their willingness to be flexible with hours. However if you are needing full-time hours to support a family it is not recommended unless you are seeking a management position.
good,A regular day at work can sometimes go by very quick but most of the time the days are fullfilling. We have a ton of customers who shop daily.What ive learned working at JCPenny is how to interact with people and deal with different personlities.Co workers make the job so much easier they are very helpful and friendly.I wouldnt say there is a hard part of the job everyday is a diffent challenge and i am able to over come it.The most enjoyable part of working here is making the customer satified and knowing you were able to help someone.
good,"management was ok when it was stable, could compensate employees better. co-workers were some of the best friends i ever made"
good,"Since I was a door to floor associate, I had to be there early in the morning, sometimes at two in the morning,which was the hardest part of this job but I would get off early which is best part. The day started with the unloading of the truck then separation of the merchandise for each department, once it was done, everyone individually would take a z-rack to the corresponding department and got the merchandise on the racks. I loved everyone I worked with, which made this job fun and easier for me."
good,"A day at work is very busy, fast paced and overall fun. Interacting with customers to provide the best service is always a pleasure to do and to able to satisfy their request as to merchandise is great."
good,"A typical work day at JC Penney consisted of stocking the sales floor, setting sales, operating the cash register, and assisting customers. It was a fun atmosphere to work in, all the co-workers were friendly and upbeat at all times. We had a great employee discount system."
good,JC Penney is a company that does not give regular hours you never know what hours you going work .
good,clean and safe environment; the hardest part of the job were the long hours
good,"I learned a great deal from the company. At the time of my employment, they had a decentralized structure. This allowed me to become a store buyer and district category buyer, as well as managing assigned departments with several associates. Being in retail, it was difficult to balance a family life. This was the main reason why I left, but also due to the company going to a centralized structure. This took the fun out of the job. The move back to 100% corporately driven buying removed the ability to control my financial destiny. This move has also caused the company to lose sight of local consumer needs and has placed it in the current financial mess that it is in. I hope that the company turns it around..."
good,"I can only speak of my experiences and I thought it was a pleasant place to work. The management seemed to motivate people to sell the credit plans and sometimes they would gift the employees for doing so. There were also employee meals (lunch/dinner) throughout the holiday’s hosted by the company. The schedule was automated so often an employee who worked the closing shift the night before would end up opening the store the next morning. Full-time employees were helpful and upper management would make you feel at home with the company. Overall, it was a great place to work over the holidays."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of assisting customers and completing transactions. I also worked with the Visual Display team to build displays for clothing and signs. I learned the deep appreciation that customers have for great customer service and efficiency. The higher management was very helpful and understanding, but there weren't very qualified area managers. They talked down to associates and that was discouraging. My fellow employees would do anything for each other at the drop of a hat. We would all band together on a project to get it done in a timely and orderly fashion. The hardest part of the job was pushing and pulling heavy equipment with no assistance. However, the part of work I enjoyed most was interacting with so many great, smiling people throughout the day."
good,"Was hired as a seasonal worker, however the experience of working here furthered my knowledge as an exceptional associate and as a cashier."
good,Working at JCpenneys is a task in its self. I dont feel its worth the time put in of what you get back. It is a job not one where i would want to keep employment. The environment is I would say not the best but you tend to look beyond that. The customers are most of the time nice as long as we treat them well as someone important.
good,"A typical work day started at around 6:30am, although officially I was scheduled at 8am. I would check schedules, my daily planner, and email to make sure that nothing had changed over night. My employees would come in at 7am and I would go over the plan for the day and what tasks were the most important. My boss, the store leader, would come in at 8am and I would be in her office asking for any changes that were going on or were to take place."
good,I loved working for JCP and all the wonderful people that I worked with. I started off as a footwear supervisor at a new store then was asked by dm to go to another jcp and run the shoe department there. It was a mess! I was there about a year and was promoted to a sales manager over shoes at another store then was asked again less then a year later to go back to the store I was before but was promoted again as the MEM. Then the changes started and it just seemed to be alot of uncertain times with everyone wondering if their job was safe.It is a great company to work for and I definatley miss it.
good,"The Store was in a amall town, which made the level of professionalism drop to more of a casual setting."
good,"I made people happy , I was talking with them and give them Ideas for the new hair stile"
good,"Fun atmosphere, high pace environment. Must be ready for everyday changes."
good,"A very calm and quiet work place that allowed for further growth of an individual. Having to answer phones, make phone calls, place orders, locate orders, send emails, making returns, shipping items to different departments, and make store announcements. The customers where very calm patient and many where regulars so names and faces where easy to remember. Occasionally would be sent to other parts of the store if they needed some extra help in any other departments. the other sales associates where courteous and helpful to customers as well as fellow employees."
good,"Pulling reports, sending merchandise to stores, replenishment of company warehouses, forecasting warehouse needs."
good,"Nice job to work for ,but they putting us part time . I need a full time job. I learned how to work in the cash room, And I in customer service. I love my co - workers. working at nite is sometimes hard."

good,Working at Jcpenney was a great place to work at there was never a dull moment and I learned something new everyday. The hardest part of the job was working around the holiday time.
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney. The company invested time and resources to train me
good,"This job, which is one of the only jobs I've held that gives extremely decent hours, has given me an opportunity for self growth. The ability to quickly read the customer's mood and applying the proper communication to keep the customer happy."
good,They didn't offer enough work and was inconsistent on the time in which we had to be there and get off.
good,Nice work place. I loved the people and I love working with the public. My supervisor was very fair. We all got along very well.
good,"I enjoy going to work, I have great coworkers. Typically stay pretty busy and overall we have great customers. We learn the best customer service skills and are held to high standards; we are given the power to make decissions to satisfy our customers without having to get a managers approval and are expected to respond, within reason, with a ""of coarse I can take care of that for you!"""
good,A typical day would be lots of easy work and customers everywhere. The management sucked and tried their best to get you in trouble with the head store director. The managers rarely hit the floor and surfed the web at their desks the entire day while we worked.
good,Great direction from management....fostered great learning opportunities.....nice environment..plush...
good,I worked here threw college and it was an ok place to work. Wouldn't make a career of it because of the pay and the things you have to deal and solve on a daily basis. The bad side to this was that most of the time they are short staffed and you have to keep opening credit cards on a monthly basis to meet your goal otherwise no raise. The co-workers was the only thing keeping me their aside from the discount they offered (30%).
good,"As with most businesses, we were very busy."
good,"A typical day would be to clock in and begin to put up the advertisments around the store. I would change the displays and restock the store floor. I would do price tags and get things in order the for weeks sale. I would work customer service and keep dressing rooms clean. Co-workers there were awesome and super friendly. Management was very understanding and helpful. I enjoyed the work environment and working with people,"

Maintained a group of 28 people during 3rd shift in the FLAT department. Surpassing production goal in FLAT department each day by an increased of 25%."
good,"Working at JC Penney has taught me how to balance work life, with school, and also a personal life. The hardest part of the job was trying to mesh with different personalities in order to complete a common goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I am busy from the moment I punch in on the time clock, until the moment I punch out. There is always something that needs to be done."
good,"Go get info to sort, then enter what was all right. Find answers to questions where ever needed to find correct info to enter. Worked well with co-workers to get all info in correct. The hardest part was finding some of incorrect info. Most enjoyable, interacting with co-workers as we worked to have correct info."
good,"I spent twenty- three years with JCPenney. I found them to be very enjoyable and productive. My work and dedication was always appreciated, and it was a great part of my life. I was let-go, due to downsizing and miss it very much. I would enjoy returning, if an opportunity arose."
good,"Buying, selling merchandise. Training and working with people. Enjoyed my career."
good,Nice coworkers however mot flexible enough with my schedule.
good,"They like to have fun with what they do, they are all friendly, and they act as a family most of the time. The hours can be great, and then sometimes they aren't so great."
good,"good place to work. Good mgrs.easy job,fun people,.clean enviroment"
good,"Team environment, team felt like family. Learned about retail as I'd never done retail work before."
good,I've only been with the company for a few months so I can't say much about it. This company really looks after it's customers by always putting their needs over anything else first.
good,I worked at JC Penney while it was still at the Ohio Valley mall and it was a very good job to have especially for high school students.
good,This was a very hardworking job. I was given long shifts while I was working. It was very good but very hard at the same time because I am still in school.
good,JCPenney has a wonderful culture of caring.  Management takes the time to show that they really care.  It has been refreshing to work for such a company.
good,Coworkers were helpful. Tasks are given all at once. Prepare to be on your feet at all times. Most of the time you will be stuck at the register. meet new peop
good,"Overall enjoy working for JCPENNEY'S the last 9 years! Pay could be better of course! Not happy having to change our dress code to wearing all black with a pop of red starting  in February! We already invested our wardrobes  to wear Red during the weekend! I wish to keep that instead of black all day every day! I sell what I wear, wearing colorful clothing! Black with black sounds so gloomy! wobedoing"
good,It was my first job so they taught me a lot about customer service. It was a fun workplace and very welcoming. Very focused on always bringing new ideas for the company.
good,At both stores I worked at the store management was very good. Corporate management changed so often you never knew what to expect. They are a good company to work for
good,Thought it can be crazy sometimes the team there really make the work place easier to deal with. Like any place out there you will have good days and bad days but when you express your concerns thoroughly you will be heard
good,Great company for discounts. I wish the pay was higher...  I wish the pay was higher.  Work to hard for littl money.. great if you have multi income household.
good,"The job is okay, they are very flexible with hours and they will work with you if you communicate with them. The only thing Is that they should start doing raises and promotions for those who have been loyal to the company"
good,I really believe it depends on management! Management can make your job amazing or a mess.. Jcp was great just a lot of confusion at times but as long as you work and do your work you’ll be fine!
good,JCP is a nice place to work.  I only work part time could use more hrs. & better pay. The people who work there are for the most part easy to work with.
good,A typical day at JCPenny was good and easy. The managers were great! Very friendly and easy going. Everyone around! The hardest part was looking at people mess up the table you just finished folding. The most enjoyable part of the day was break time and also when we clocked out. I made a lot of great friends and also made great communication skills.
good,"JCPenney is a solid company to work for, I felt like my job was valued and most managers cared about helping employees. A job well done is honored and it’s ok to work at your own pace while the project is getting finished."
good,JcPenny was ok it was not the best experience but definitely one to start with to get your feet wet very faso paste job a lot of assistance if you need it it’s was for the most part well organized
good,"Customer service.stocking,fitting rooms..Replenish merchandise. I enjoy being able to help customer find what they need or what.There is always alot to do.Its the best thing having team players."
good,"I liked working at JCPenny for almost a year and a half. I made so many new friends. My co-workers were really nice, and very friendly. We all got along, and I had no troubles with any of them."
good,This company was good for me because I was single and still living at home. It wouldn’t pay enough to support a family. This is a large company and it has changed a lot since my employment.
good,"Great customers. Placing order,  multitask two screens, emails update information. Schedule delivery appointment. Refunds online orders. Replacements."
good,I just didn't like that there was no security. They worked with my school schedule wonderfully. I really appreciate that. I would probably work there if it were still open occasionally because they had a great discount.
good,Most associates are part time  No benefits no bonuses maybe you get a $5.00 gift card if you get a lot of credit applications Leaders can be hard on you
good,"Fast paced always busy. Management often works with you on replenishing merchandise. Always approachable and willing to help. Depending on the season, it can get very cold or very hot on the dock."
good,"I enjoyed my time there and my manager and co-workers were wonderful. Like all other retail jobs however, you can't live on the pay so you have to have some other means."
good,My experience at JC Penney was great met alot of good people and learned alot  of new things.Everyday of work was comfortable and something to look forward to.I loved working there so much I tried to put in as much overtime I could but was penalized for it.Went from 30 hrs a week to 12 hrs a week. I couldn't do it no more.
good,The management is good and you get your questions answered. This job helps riase one's confront of servicing customers and handling problems and potential unsatisfied customers.
good,My experience at JCPENNY has been fairly decent. I have had some minor frustrations dealing with management about my schedule and not getting enough hours put on my schedule but talking to them and compromising we found a way to work around my school schedule.
good,I have been with the company  for over ten years now and I have been satisfied with my time there.  Wages are self driven. The more clients you do the more commission you make.
good,great part time job except when it comes to the holidays  loved being around people and working with fellow workers  fun atmosphere and fun people  quit due to medical reasons
good,"Job wasn’t so bad. My particular position allowed me to be creative as well as use some of my office skills. For these reasons, the work turned out to be more satisfying than I had anticipated."
good,it was time to move on. i felt the company was getting ready to close at some point and want something more stable .Management kept changing and than they kept changing everything all the time became too much.
good,This place was perfect for me starting out. I got to work around my school schedule and the location i worked at was just down the street. Walking distance!
good,JCPenney was a very easy going job. They always worked around my schedule and gave time off when I needed it for school or vacation. I worked at two locations. The Management was terrible at the first location I worked at.
good,On the weekdays the store is pretty quiet but during lunch hours it gets pretty steady so you're always doing something. I love working with my coworkers and love a lot of my managers. Hardest part of the job is being understaffed on a busy day and running around like crazy. Best part of my job is the people I work with.
good,I am a cosmetologist and I think we should be paid more than the associates that are working on the floor. We had to go to school in order to be a licensed cosmetologist we should be paid more
good,"Great team work morale, management could do better at communicating task at hand rather than just telling somebody what to do."
good,"Great co workers, fun and easy training. Good management! Hours are flexible. The sales system was pretty accurate so it was less likely for you to commit a mistake."
good,"Starting off my first job at jcpenney had it’s ups & downs, i loved my coworkers & i loved going into work everyday, but i didn’t trust the management that much."
good,Typical day at work you would look at your emails and see if there are any pirorities and get them done then do you list of things. The culture is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a mean customer.
good,"J C Penney was a wonderful company to work for, however full time positions were reserved for the management staff. Also the rate of pay was not enough to support a single family household."
good,"The company is a good place to work when you need something in the mean time, until you do what you actually want to do. The work load is not hard and it makes time pass faster."
good,I have worked many years for JC Penny and have seen many changes within the company. Some positive and some negative. Management has overall been helpful.
good,would be a great place to work if there was a better manager and better coworks that had respect for the job. The manager would change your schedule all the time .
good,Day of work consisted of checking fitting rooms and running the cash register. I learned how to make a customer's visit satisfactory. The management was understanding.
good,great place to work I've worked and learned every department. Best of my job is training my associates everything I know of my 15 plus years in retail and all I've learned at Jcpenny. Having the customers greet you like family.
good,it was a really great place for a first job and i enjoyed working there very much and i'm glad to have gained experience for there. The discounts were good and everyone was extremely kind i would definitely recommend applying
good,Work there is very fast pase as dealing with customers and other task. Management its a bit frustrating but manageable as well as the customers. A regular day at jcp involves the constant floor support for assistance and restocking of various merchandise.
good,Liked interacting with customers and employees.  It was at the mall so it was a great environment. The staff were friendly and so were the employees. I liked working there.
good,"Overall I liked working at JCP.  The coworkers and management were always friendly and very helpful. A typical day consisted of organizing the department, cleaning the fitting rooms, and organizing the merchandise.  At the opening and closing of the store we counted the money. It was a fast paced job that required you to be on your feet for the entire shift. JCP lived by the Golden Rule of treating everyone with respect.  I enjoyed how fun they made your job.  The management always pointed out the positive."
good,Measure and fit customers with appropriate bras and answer questions. Assist customers with checking merchandise out.  Stocking all shelves.  Straightening of all shelves and merchandise.
good,Working at JCPenney can get frustrating and stressful but they try to be flexible to everyone and try to make sure everyone gets paid for what they work
good,"-greeting customers, ringing them up, folding and organizing clothes"
good,"I would go to my assigned department to make sure clothes were where they were supposed to be, hang stuff up, as well as fold clothes. I made sure the fitting rooms were well maintained. if needed I would help check customers out and ask if they are interested in signing up for a JCPenney credit card"
good,JCP is a great place to start working if you're new to the workforce because the work is easily explained and accomplished as a sales associate. They are flexible with their hours and if I ever needed a day off for any reason they did their best to make that happen for me.
good,The coworkers great to work with. You’d get some bad customers every now and then. The manager there is really sweet and kind and she’s willing to work around hours if you have school or another job. Definitely recommend this place.
good,The company was solely focused on customer care and needs. Employees were allowed a fifteen minute break per shift and a slight discount on merchandise.
good,"I loved working in the salon at JCPENNYS."
good,"I’ve worked for JCPenney for 5 years. Started as a holiday hire at 18 and ended as a Human Resource Supervisor at 23 with little college overseeing 100+ employees. Worked part time to full time. Ive worked in sales floor in all departments including windows and fine jewelry, task team, and merchandise Associate. There are opportunities to advance in the company. However, you yourself needs to want it. Work hard and voice your concerns. Ask questions and do more. The more you know, the more valuable you are. It’s a paid for performance. The benefits are extremely great for full time employees. "
good,I worked for the company twenty years and would still be there if they didn't close great job good benefits and easy work load.management was good and fair.
good,I honestly love working here. The managers are all great. You can't slack off and you'll probably be busy most of the time. The hard part is getting credit card applications and they are a big deal while working here.
good,"I believe that my termination was unfair and wrongful for I did not do nothing wrong but that is the past i have try to get rehire but i am not"
good,"I had worked at JCPenney for three years before I quit. It was amazing when I first started with one of my favorite managers. Soon they had me closing all the time regardless of my open availability most of the time by myself. When a management positioned opened up I applied. I was told that I could not do the management position which was only to be a lead over a department because I did not get enough credit cards. I liked the job enough for a first job, but would not recommend if you plan to advance within a job."
good,"Job entailed interacting with customers, managers, and coworkers. Low pay rate (minimum wage), but included discount on store merchandise. Deals with monetary transactions."
good,If retail is what you're interested JCPenney could be the place for you! It is a fast paced environment that allows for good building on customer service experience.
good,During holiday seasons it can be very eventful and busy but the days go by fast and keep you on your feet and you meet some great people everyday while working you butt off
good,"If your in school, the part time job that JCPenney offers helps. You are expected to work holidays which can get in the way of finals and family time."
good,"I started out as a cashier. It fluctuates between busy and slow, but that mostly depends where management places you."
good,"Help customers find the right pair of jeans, or point them to the shoe department. Fold clothes and ring up thousands of items a shift. Mindless and boring most of the time."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure the entire store is clean, bringing down lines at the register and putting away and clothes in the dressing rooms. I have learned a lot about sales and coupon options, as well as how to help customers save money by applying for a credit card. The most enjoyable part about this job is being able to help customers, while also building a relationship."
good,"I enjoyed working for JCP, the environment was friendly and the co-workers became like family.  It was nice to have regular customers coming in asking for you by name. We had a great general manager that encouraged us to meet our goals.  Typical work days varied according to season, from very busy to extremely slow.  If there was any criticism, it would be that most jobs are part-time with few benefits unless you get into management; and the schedules vary from week to week.  I moved cross country with the intent of transferring, but the cost of living is much higher and so I decided to find something that pays better."
good,"This company sets an example for a true team environment. We all work together and not against each other. If you are new to the industry, this is a great company to work for to start building your clientele."
good,"When I worked for Jcpenney with was a great job.  The only thing that made me leave was the pay, working in a commissioned area was difficult certain times of the year."
good,Enjoyed working with different groups of people and ages. The work place environment is very great and warming. Everyone plays a role and helps each other actives the tasks.
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney because I could pretend shop while still observing possible shoplifters. Learning about different ways a person will attempt to shoplift.
good,"Open and closed department, worked with 5 cash drawers and diamond vault, answered phone and called customers, customer service, knowledge on products a must, in charged of 6 sets of jewelry keys for cases. Checked in merchandise received and sent out orders and checked in orders. Rang on cash registers, used calculators. Did watch and jewelry repairs, trained new associate, did ad signing.

good,Fun place to work always meeting interesting people.  great group of co workers makes the time go by.  helpful when you have an emergence or other issues
good,"If you want to have that type of prodded store vibe you should definitely work here they are flexible, understandle, do a lot of work, but the job overall is chill"
good,"Enjoyed the job, wasn't a big fan of the management team. The pay, location and hours were ideal. Wish the company was in better position to keep everyone employed"
good,Jcpenney is a good company to work for they provide a friendly family environment.they have taught me what it is like to work with public. They have taught me valuable life learning skills to succeed in today’s world. I would recommend jcpenney as a good company in testable too work for.
good,"I was 16 when I got this job, and it was good to start off with. I was expected to do many parts, but was able to be trained in all rather quickly. The only thing I didn't like was my manager. Problems all started when she originally threatened my ability to stay on the job while I was working. Then, problems continued when I was scheduled off, however was scheduled and then got in trouble for her mistake."
good,If you want to learn how to run a business I suggest you work for Lids.  I definitely learned a lot while working there. Management is great they work with as far as availability.
good,"I like this job alot because I was experienced & I worked at my own pace, managers rarely bothered me because I always got my job done before the store opened"
good,"Worked for jcpenney for years great company far as team work, discount, and ok benefits. Pay is not good, position advancement is all about favoritism."
good,The people that I worked with were fun and made the time go by quickly. It was a good place to work for. I just feel like the salary was too low for those to live in the nearby location.
good,My first job I ever worked. I enjoyed working there but I feel I did not learn as much as I could have. I was trained by computers but did not get much chance to work a cash register. I didn't get to learn it hands on.
good,"Jcpenney is a great place to work.  Nice people, great environment.  They work with you on days that you need off.  It was a really great experience for me."
good,Working here is greazt for high schoolers. I believe it suits students because the hours are extremely flexible. I love the fact that management was able to work with my schedule.
good,"JCPenney is a fun place to work, family like environment. With multiple advancement opportunities . If you are looking for a environment where you can grow and create lasting relationships then JCPEnney is the place to be."
good,"My overall experience at JCPenney was pleasant.  I was challenged by talented leaders and grew my career and skill set in result of this experience.  I was promoted within the first 6 months of joining the brand and was in turn, able to develop several of my direct reports.  The work environment was busy and fast paced which gave great variety to the everyday routine, and expanded my ability to be a multi functional leader.  The most enjoyable part of my experience with JCPenney was the direct impact I was able to have on my team to challenge and grow them as I also experienced from upper leadership."
good,"I been there for many years love my job I learned a lot during work , management is good but not good pay . "
good,"Overall, the work is fun, but stressful. I must communicate with customers about their orders or reward obtained while shopping through JC Penney website or through a JC Penney store."
good,Friendly employees/helpful. Working in the stockroom is great talkative employees while still getting our work done. Helping out customers is so rewarding.
good,Good workplace and good management give good discount benefits great co workers who always offer help to you if needed not many hours open around this time of year
good,"I worked in the Men's department and as a cashier. I was in high school when I started working there, and they where very flexible with my schedule (that was the best part)."
good,They were great to work for. I loved what I did there and I learned a lot in management. I would recommend anyone to work there as it has great people and great training.
good,A typical day at work can be crazy with the customers. You need to keep the floor clean and be good with money. I learned how to fold clothes the right way.
good,"Attention detail is a bit required and one of the many things JCP helped me improve in personal and work environments, hours working behind the counter but also helping guest shop or look for desired clothing were tasks I enjoyed doing while on the clock."
good,"As stated above, a typical retail work environment.  Some days a fantastic place to work, other times not so much.  Many times it all depended on the work ethic your peers observe."
good,A typical day at JCP is a great day for training.I had to learn to be direct with direction and keep co workers interested in wanting to be the best at what they do. I learned alot from my peers who have been with the company for years. Learning the ends and out of working for JCP and it has been very helpful to me in the long run.I love seeing the customers who make you smile when having a hard day.The jokes and the kind word of encouragement makes it all worth it. The hardest part of my job is making sure that making sure that no customer leaves unhappy. I try to go above and beyond to ensure a great customer experience for any and everyone. The most enjoyable part of my day is leaving knowing i have motivated and inspired the staff to want to thrive to be better each and everyday no matter what.
good,"A typical day at J.C. Penney includes ringing out customers and reorganizing the merchandise to prevent shrinkage.  The work atmosphere is generally positive and the manager is a reasonable person.  This job is teaching me patience and helping me build confidence as I help customers and speak with my fellow associates. I think the hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer save money when a coupon does not work on particular items in the store.  On the same token, the little happy dance that customers do when they save a whole lot of money on things that would normally be too expensive."
good,Keeps you busy so shifts seem to fly by. Managers and ther co workers are very nice and there is always room to make your way up in the company. Managegers help on registers and on the floor so everyone seems equal.
good,"This job is a decent retail job. Overall the management is kind and encouraging. There are opportunities to work your way up but sometimes I think they need an official application process for it. Raises are also only about once a year. They are very flexible with your schedule with adequate notice, as long as you can work weekends. Sometimes the job is stressful and you have to be good at multitasking. Overall, it's not a bad company to work for."
good,This was my first job and it was ok. It wasn't a hard job but the pay was very low and I didn't get very many hours. Management wasn't the greatest but wasn't terrible either.
good,Very productive  and fast paced environment. Friendly and professional  management. There is always room for growth and advancement  with this company. Great company to work for.
good,lots o deliveries paid off of deliveries made in a day so stocking warehousing packing unpacking and lifting. long hours not a career gainer but experience builder
good,There was always work to be done. You were always moving. The customers were always respectful to us workers and we showed them the same respect back. We worked as a team for everything.
good,serving people. I learned to serve people who need help .management was great team players. workplace culture was great. hardest part of the job was holiday sales but exciting at the same time. seeing the people happy and going about their day when they got what they wanted.
good,"Everyone worked well together. There was always to motivating incentive( pot lucks, employee anniversary celebration, great morning meetings and a staff of management that really cares.)"
good,Training isn’t the best and management will stab you in the back. Called me boss at new job and slandered me. They complain too much and don’t put family first.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney's is slow, but if it's on a Thursday through Sunday were really busy. I've learned how to sell the JCPenney's credit cards. The hardest part about working at JCPenney's is at night because that's the time where the sore has died down on customers. The workplace culture is very diverse and I enjoy it. The most enjoyable part would have to be how social and fun our team was. The management it very sweet and organized and just really uplifting."
good,The workload has never been larger said a 16 year veteran of the company. The company went through a restructure earlier in the year and we lost 2 much needed leadership positions. We are stretched so thin and it has an associate and customer impact.
good,A typical day at work would consist of many different tasks. As a sales associate I would assist in unloading inventory and stocking inventory on the sales floor. Adjusting prices and displaying inventory was done as requested by supervisors. Selling inventory and providing customers with discounts was the main objective.
good,"my job is not very hard just time consuming"
good,"its okay I like the co workers, but the management is not the best. and it poorly structured. if you need time off you can get it but will  get the hours you need if your asking."
good,"Typical workday includes helping  customers while shopping. Offering savings through JCP REWARDS. Management is helpful, depending on who your under. Some let you work independently and others micromanage."
good,It is a all hands on deck type of job. Team works together to deliver great customer service. Workplace built on the golden rule( treat others the way you would want to be treated) that goes for customers as well as your coworker. Hardest part would be schedule and not being able to spend time with the family for holidays as you would like but the best part of the job is also the family you gain at Jcpenney with coworkers and customers. Also great associate discount.
good,They barely care about the people who work there . The managers are shady and they don’t care about you having a life outside of work. Even being young they make sure you don’t have enough hours to get a break and they messy and barely clean .
good,"This is a good job for students while they are attending university. The hours were not much if you wanted more, but if you are looking for a part time position on the night shift or weekends, this might be the one for you."
good,Work load was distributed well in Replenishment.  Work as a cashier was stressful.  Monetary compensation was low.  My last manager was excellent in all areas.
good,Enjoy work with people.  Work at JC Penney is good as I interact with too many persons and with my peers.  Learn about the different departments in the store.
good,"A typical day at JCPenny was for the most part slow. I felt that in order for me to financially make ends meet I had to leave. The incoming business was not very good. They over staffed the floor, which for a stylist it is hard to build a clientele when there isnt enough incoming business to support the staff."
good,This job requires standing on your feet for long periods of time. You have the opportunity to develop customer service skills. Little room for advancement. Part time hours so no company benefits. It is a good starter job or job to earn extra cash for special events. Company offers employee discounts.
good,"A typical day at JCP involved delivering satisfactory customer service, stocking merchandise, and maintaining a tidy store appearance. "
good,"its a productive work , need to do differences things ."
good,if you are a hard worker you will get the hours. very hard to advance too far. They do let the customer walk over them. I understand more honey than vinegar thing but you are rewarding lying.
good,Usually very laid back when not busy. When it was busy like around the holidays and such it got very stressful. Can be tiring too and very repetitive.
good,"JCP was a good place to work because they offered a choice of shifts, I was a work at home agent and I really enjoyed this.Typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls and assisting customers to place orders or resolve conflicts. They offered benefits from day one . Managers were always available and helpful.  The only short fall was their salary range.We were notified in Feb 2018 that the center would be closing Sep. 2018.  They sponsored job fairs and job counselors to assist staff that wanted to leave before the closing."
good,"For a retail store a fairly enjoyable work place, only work part-time so cannot give a complete evaluation. My understanding from other full time employees is that it is somewhat stressful but they receive good support from the supervisors whenever it is needed."
good,A typical day at work consists of troubleshooting processing issues while solving complex strategic problems. I have learned you must be quick on your feet and be able to delegate work load to your team evenly. Management team is strong but needs solid polished leadership that has a vision of sustained improvement. Culture needs change. Hardest part of the day is juggling administrative duties while providing proper focus to the operational goals. Most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with each individual team member.
good,"The work flow is generally smooth, and the tasks are generally very easy. The training process was too simple that it made it confusing for some, but the managers were always around to help us. Even on the busiest days, there was at least one manager available. Hardest part of the job was deterring shoplifters when we are busy during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find simple styles."
good,It was only a temporary job until I was able to get meaningful full time employment with benefits. It was an easy job and engaging actively with the customers was joyful.  Management was fine and supportive.
good,The company its self is a great company but the employees at the site I worked at was a different story. I had one of the worst experiences of my work history working there.
good,The hardest part of the job currently is with the amount of skilled turnover within the IT department. This produces longer lead-time due to the on-boarding of new associates to manage the projects.
good,The typical day was alright. For the most part I was a cashier and working at there was not bad unless you don't have patients. The customers can give you a hard time but all of the coworkers are really nice and helpful.
good,Work was not hard at all here. Not to easy to advance. Holidays were the only times tough would get rough with disrespectful customers but always maintained the up most best customer service. Part time or full time available. No complaints besides the rate per hour these current years and breaks were too short.
good,"Working at JCPenney requires a lot of patience towards customers, team and managers. Willing to do any last minute request and be able to multitask at a fast past."
good,i enjoyed working at the store very much being able to help customer an interact with people from all over. A typical day at work was normally as the main cashier depending on the department or floor i was working on.
good,"Fast paced worked long hours during holidays,  Previous Store Manager was more about  numbers and money instead of the people  who worked for him. Your were just a number"
good,"The company is good. Managers are nice and very genuine. Associates make you feel comfortable, they are kind. You get great discounts and benefits for yourself."
good,"I loved working for the company. Management and staff were very friendly. There were multiple incentives for employees to be better! Hours were flexible, except during the holidays which is completely understandable. Black Friday was my absolute LEAST favorite day to work. Not because of the company itself... but because of the hurricane of people and merchandise flying around the store from sun up to sun down."
good,"JCPenney was great, I learned to be more comfortable with people, I loved talking and helping the customers. I have a lot of memories at JCPenney I love the people who work there."
good,I would come in as a new employee as well as 4 others and we would be given tasks right away. Its very quick and tiring but can be fun if everyone works together.
good,"Team based environment. Will require you to persuade customers to apply for credit cards. Also encourages staff to place a certain number of online orders. Flexible scheduling, very beneficial for high school students. Amazing discount that can be combined with coupons."
good,"it was a good job, it taught me a lot and i loved the associate discount. But they expected a lot from you from time to time. and even though i worked there for 5 years i was never eligible for vacation or maternity leave."
good,I worked at JC Penney all through college and they were very flexible to work around my class schedule and very understanding. They helped me out so much.
good,"Over all, I think the company is great to work for, truly I believe it’s the management team that I now work under, that’s changed my love for the company. I would definitely recommend (and I actually have), people to work here, temporarily and permanently. I believe it’s a great environment to gain experience and to learn about all different sides and roles"
good,Keeps you on your toes and provides a novice start for those seeing something not so difficult. You have to be willing to be patient and work on a flexible schedule
good,"Very laid back and relaxing most of the time.  Christmas time is the busiest, but also the most fun.  If you can fold clothes and work a register, this job will be a good match for you."
good,"Managed employees on a comprehensive level through scheduling, performance, coaching and professional development. "
good,Its an excellent job opportunity for teens looking to gain work experience and a summer job while out of school the only bad things is that you have some managers that don't do their job and some that will take advantage of you if you let them
good,It was overall an okay job. I’m glad I worked there so I could see how much it took to have a job in retail but overall I think it was a really draining experience
good,"I enjoyed my time working at JCP. I was in my early 20's, just had a baby, and they worked with me as far as scheduling. Management was very nice. Unfortunately, the location moved and I did not follow."
good,If you aren't helping at the registers with check outs you have to be on the floor recovering and assisting customers. I learned how to maximize my time and the customer's time while in the checking out process. The coworkers are one of the enjoyable parts of the job. One of the hardest parts is the low amount of hours that they give us.
good,"There aren't many things I didn't like about JCPenny's, the people were nice, guests got what they needed and if they didn't we made sure they would come back for a better deal. We got brakes and lunches depending on how much you worked."
good,"Worked in the Fine Jewelry Dept. Both in Akron and in Columbus. Worked with Diamonds, Fine Jewelry, Fashion Jewelry and Watches. Both stores were in a mall setting so mostly kept busy especially during the holidays. When I returned from living in Columbus the store I had worked at previously was no longer there (Rolling Acres) so I got a job in another field."
good,"The good thing with retail is that it is never the same day twice. The bad thing is you are dealing with the public and a consumer who is increasingly taught that they are ""always right"" - even when they absolutely are not. JC Penney is a great store, with fantastic products at reasonable prices. The Associates are given a lot of leeway to make things right, but always have the back-up of management when they can't. "
good,"I loved working at JCP for almost the whole time I was there. I loved my coworkers- it was a very diverse, fun group of people of many ages and backgrounds, and we all got along pretty well. However, if you don’t get enough credit card applications every month, they will “counsel” you about it. Our highest credit app person and so-called “credit-coach” wanted us to ask every customer 5 times (and get 5 no’s), before we could stop asking. I watched customers walk away several times because of this. That was ultimately the reason why I left."
good,"I personally have learned many things from working at JCPenney, Great customer service is one of them and many other things that will help me in the future."
good,"it was a great company to work for, it could at times be stressful but it was a fun place to work. they took care of their employees. it worked around my schedule for school but it was hard to spend time with family because u do have to work on weekends and holiday, also kept me out of church alot but enjoyed my time working there. we was like family"
good,"Typical retail structure, has new management and company strategies now, I can't say anything about the company now, I have not worked there in over 10 years,"
good,I loved interacting with the customers. It was faced paced. Management was very fair. We all worked together as a family. The only set back was the shifts. Store was open 7 days a week and your shift would vary.
good,"I really enjoyed working at JCPenney and everything that I learned there. From cashiering to packaging a customer's order, I was able to generate many new experiences and skills. I was moved to a lot of different areas of the store so I learned the duties of many different positions which I think has helped me greatly. I really loved the environment and all of my coworkers. It was always fun and friendly and I felt like I belonged."
good,I liked to work there but If you are Latino it will be very difficult to ascend in positon. Some Team leaders pressure you into making sales when the customers we get clearly don't want to buy anything.
good,"I was a customer sales assosciate. I processed customer’s payments by cash, check and credit cards. Assisted customers about purchases needs. Worked on the floor assisting customers with fitting rooms, and etc."
good,Under the right management the stores are great to work for.  Advancement is there for the people who speak up. The associates become almost second family to you.
good,The employers were nice and cooperative. I've learned about cleaning and mostly: Stocking! The only bad side is the breaks. Other than that it's a good place to work at for Entry level with competitive pay.
good,"Although I was here seasonal, the workplace was great. Only complaint I had is they gave me a day notice of them letting me go. More hours could have been nice too but I wasn't expecting it since I was seasonal"
good,"Maintain the checkout lines to ensure all customers were taken care of.  Handled customer complaints, stocked bags, take backs, returns, and over all store flow."
good,You have to have to be able to stand on your feet for periods of time . You also have to be nice n generous to the customers. That makes them want to come back to shop.
good,"Work days are fairly routine, not much of the unexpected happens during a shift. Holiday times are difficult, stressful, but also fun and cheery. The long hours are tough, and the constant influx of customers sometimes grates on the nerves, but it’s still a decent job for the pay."
good,"This is your average department store job. Nothing more, nothing less. The job was very easy besides the odd rude customer. Its something that is best for part time."
good,Working at jcpenney was good. It helped me gain my skills in customer service. The only reason I left was because of management. Everything changed. The management to me got a little bit more rude. overall the manager I had before the one I do have now was the best manager I'll ever have. He was very considerate to everyone any actually cared about us and treated us like family.
good,"The store is almost always in chaos. Clothes always thrown all over by customers, employees can not always keep up. Customers continuously complain that there is not enough staff and the lines are to long. Management is not on the same page. Some managers allow certain things to slide by while others do not which can also confuse customers and employees. It has been a rather interesting experience working here."
good,"Not the place you can use your brain and figure things out. It was mostly folding clothes and cleaning departments. The employees were very ""clique"" like and the hours were never guaranteed."
good,"I enjoy working at JC Penny. I like the work I do, and enjoy my coworkers. My primary concern is the hours are inconsistent. Other than that, I have been happy at my job."
good,"A typical day at work was to meet the daily sale goals of JCPenny and meet the expected number of Jcpenny Credit cards. However, management was unorganized always would post the schedule last minute instead of working on it prior to posting. They also lacked sympathy to employees daily lives such as school academics and activities. Although id say the hardest part of working here was the customers going into the clearance aisle and removing the price sticker onto a non-clearance item and when confronted and caught they would act belligerent. id say the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-worker who was helpful and we a lot more organized than the mangers"
good,The company is great but in some stores the upper management acts like it’s above it’s supervisors m.a.’s and associates. They hardly appreciate the hard work you put in or give credit when it’s due. They ask to strive for results and when you do achieve results they hardly say thank you and move you on to the next task. I also see that in order to advance in one particular store you had to not work hard but instead get in good with the upper management and you get what you want. The results and past you’ve achieved meant nothing because you never got personal at work.
good,This job helped me with communication skills and productivity. There is always something to do so time will go by fast. The hardest part of the job was closing.
good,"Hay que ser atentos, responsables y solicitan cuotas en catálogo y solicitudes de crédito."
good,JC Penney has a way of drawing in and retaining it's customer base and satisfaction...they have a very good handle on what keeps the customer satisfied and coming back.
good,I feel the management team could have been better organized and could have communicated better. Communication is the key to any successful organization or team.
good,"Nice hours; steady flow of customers for the most part; most all associates and managers are welcoming and willing to work with new coworkers; this job taught me how to ""read"" people especially customers in order to maintain the viability of the company;"
good,I advanced quickly I had fun while at work and I was treated like an employee not a slave. I was trained properly and was not shunned for not being ready when training was over. They worked with me!
good,Overall a good company to work for. I was a supervisor there. the assistant manager on down really cared about the employees. The store manager cared about the employees but would toss a supervisor out on a whim.
good,"Definitely a good experience to have is a retail job. Black Friday is probably a retailers positions worst nightmare, but if you know what you're doing when it comes round, then you should have nothing to fear. Great co workers, if you have spoken to any. A little bit of the customers will be having a bad day, but you are the person they speak to so try to make the best of it, even if they are not in a good mood, don't let their bad temper get to you! Overall a good work experience."
good,"It was a nice starting off job, nothing to complain about. I was there for the winter season, Black Friday and a little after that for the returns after Christmas."
good,"Managers work with you when it comes to needing to find a solution, there’s a lot of emphasis on teamwork, and managers seek to empower and inspire you. Some days feels like a second family."
good,"Great place to work, good management and great employees. Small store but still did good business. Black Friday was a night mare but other than that good place to work."
good,"It was a good company to work for, with all thats going on its not a very secure job, wouldn't put my all in it a second job or part time job at best."
good,"Always on the move and available to provide assistance to customers."
good,"While I worked in Georgia, I loved my job. After transferring to Florida, I realized that my store manager made my job so much better. Each store is different. Working as a team seems to be a common priority."
good,"Jc Penney is a good company to work for, especially for students in high school or in college and need a little extra cash in their pockets. They like to promote that team development is something that they are passionate about, but if you don't go to them and make it known that you are interested in advancement then they won't really take the time to develop you. Communication is probably the main thing I would suggest they work on as a company. Communication from corporate to individual stores is not the greatest. As front line employees we are often left in the dark about sales and promotions that the company is running. We never know until a customer asks about it. Other than that it is not a bad company at all to work for, it is still making changes and development to it's core structure to lift the company out of the funk it has been in for the past couple of years."
good,"Very busy work environment. But I got to work with a number of great people. I was given a lot of responsibility, which made it a good learning experience."
good,"As long as you came to work prepared to work everyday and complete the tasks given to you, there are no problems. Co-workers are fantastic. Management is willing to work with you for scheduling & any last minute conflicts that may arise."
good,jcpenny was a good company to work with. scheduling  requested time off  often went ignored. the work environment was great and welcoming. i enjoyed helping customers .
good,The hardest part of the job is that sometimes it was too much and that can be stressful but being busy is always good. JCPenney offers great discounts to the employees. Great people.
good,There was never a dull moment working for JcPenneys. Always had a good time with fellow co-workers and management. Always got out on time and was able to balance school and work.
good,"Overall not too bad, just a regular retail job. I always thought retail workers were overpaid so obviously I think JCP should pay more. No paid time off either, but I worked part-time so I wasn't expecting any."
good,"It was a great place to work for part-time hours.  They were very accommodating for what I needed. I received great discounts and there was always something to keep you busy, so the day went quickly."
good,"Overall a fine place to work.  Although this was a Christmas only position I enjoyed it immensely.  It is a good company to work for, I wish there had been a permanent position available."
good,"Typical day will be you on your feet all day. I learned a lot about shoes and displays. Management was always great, really got your back and very helpful. Culture of the workplace is great. Always good people to work with. But it is long morning and long nights. At the end of the day."
good,"They were a good company to work for and was the first company that offered me work when I evacuated to Jonesboro AR when I fled Hurricane Katrina. The managers were great and patient while learning the ropes of pricing, stocking the floor."
good,"I loved working at JCP. Wonderful team of co workers and managers. Always helpful and supportive. Unfortunately, my hours were reduced and I had to look for a job with more hours."
good,Working at JCpenny is a great place to work for. Learning to multi-task is what it is. I enjoy this but i don't get enough hours to support my family. The hardest part of my job will be not getting paid enough and not enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job will be that i learn something new everyday. Enjoying what i do is what values my work.
good,"I started the Appliance Department from the ground up. It was very challenging, but rewarding. I was responsible for all orders, employees and labor. I trained employees, and made sales over my quota each month."
good,"overall a great place to work how ever bad corp decesions combined with internet pressure is killing the company, in 5 years it probably wont exist at all"
good,"start work at the beginning of your shift my clocking in, checking which section you're working. hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers but that's part of retail and is expected. the most enjoyable part would be meeting new people everyday. management was great. decent job I enjoyed my employment here."
good,"a normal work day would be arriving early in the morning for the meeting and about goals, cleanliness of store. We would do competitions for signing up jcp shoppers for credit cards, $2.00 for each shopper who was accepted, we would win gift cards or coupons, co workers made this job great. It sucks that you HAVE to work christmas eve, thanksgiiving and black friday- but they make sure to feed you well!"
good,"I would say its about average compared to other retail jobs."
good,"Lot's of company support for salon but they really do not understand the culture.  It should be packed but the location was not good in store."
good,"It was not a bad place to work, I was hired on for holiday help. The only complaint that I had was lack of communication. they could use an update on their data base tho."
good,"JcPenneys is created on a team driven environment, that likes to promote from within. They are very supportive and engaging. While working at Penney's, I learned how to drive retail sales in a new industry, while successfully continuing to lead a team that provided superior customer service."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of running a register, and putting clothes away. Didn't learn anything I already didn't know how to do. Management was decent. Not helpful at times. Didn't have a hard part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers."
good,Since the moment you set foot in the store you can feel the friendliness of the associates that work there and it's a fun-loving place to be in. Great space to be in.
good,"In-home consultantion, confirm appointments, communicate with fabricators, assist installers with installation, weak economy affected sales, enjoyed designing window coverings."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Penney's. It was a fun relaxed environment . We were like a big family , and most of all I loved the customers. Also the hours were perfect with my schedule."
good,"The management team was always nice and only some of the co workers were hard to deal with. The main obstacle is dealing with difficult people, and cleaning up the store at close. "
good,I have worked for the JCPenny's salons for a number of years. It's an  excellent place of employment. One of my main reasons for working there so long was the all the benefits that came with the job.
good,"Extra money good discounts fun busy around holidays and lots to do. "
good,"I worked in the Men's shoe department. This department specifically had very minimal customers, making the job easy, but tedious. The most important skill I learned was sales. My managers would always be pressuring the sales associated to sell JCPenney credit cards. There was a monetary incentive, to which I tried to take advantage of. Learning how to properly convince customers to apply for a JCPenney credit card was a great skill to learn."
good,Overall it was okay but the pay was low. I needed something with more hours to maintain myself at the time of starting out college and living on my own. Management was okay as well.
good,"The typical day at work was relieving people to take their lunch or breaks, making sure everyone was enjoying themselves at work and that there was no issue with the customers or our employees."
good,"Merchandising Associate (MA)"
good,Working for JCPenney was a great experience for me.  I loved the atmosphere of the large store I worked in.  The co-workers were awesome and I loved stepping into my role every day.  I would work here for a lifetime if it gave me benefits and the salary needed to afford living somewhere on my own.  I enjoyed making the daily bank deposits and helping guests find the special something that they were looking for or helping to put an outfit together with great style. I loved seeing their excitement with options presented to them.
good,"Great place to work, management to great. Only downfall is that you are only allowed 25 hours a week. That is not enough hours to help pay bills and to live on your own"
good,Good place to work but like any retail store much depends on Management and turn over is high so you could have several new bosses over a few years. They will likely make changes that could that could have negative impact on you
good,I worked in the jewelry dept and enjoyed the interaction w/customers. I had a lot of responsibilities and kept good records to ensure customer satisfaction. The job was supposed to be seasonal but they decided to keep me. I would consider going back only as a 2nd job.
good,My time at JC Penney was a place of learning about the industry. My Co-Workers were very helpful and fun to work with. I did like the Fashionable Atmosphere I worked in.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers that appreciated the hard work of JC Penney associates. The frustrating part was the lack of opportunity for advancement and lack of opportunity for raises and a lack of a dependable schedule.
good,Unfortunately JC Penney chose to close the call center I worked in but it was a great job with adequate training and benefits.Flexible hours where available and worked well with my schedule
good,The management team at JCPenney sustains a work environment that allows for creative thinking and generally supports sales Associates. I was allowed to work independently and was given the freedom to make customer care decisions as required.
good,There is a good mix of work and play within the store. You can become close with your peers in each department and gain knowledge from other seasoned workers.
good,It was a good job with good benefits it just did not pay  as well as I wanted it to but over all I would recommend people to work ther in a relaxed peaceful enviorment
good,"JCPenney is fast paced during the holidays. They offer flexible hours and an employee discount. I would recommend them for part-time employment, especially for teens. Most of the staff was friendly, and there was always something to do. Management did not seem interested in the ideas of regular employees."
good,"same as any other retail job, this particular JCPenny's was in texas, had no sephora dept and let you know were seasonal and the only way you could be hired permanent was if you got a certain about of credit cards, I didn't and still don't like that, it was a smaller store located in a strip mall. our main customers were elderly, very friendly. my manager was amazing the other staff were helpful"
good,"JCPenney is a fun work environment, but very fast pass and can be  stressful especially for a teenager. But JCPenneys can be a great first job, it'll give you great experience in dealing with customers."
good,I enjoyed working there while I was in high school because it was an easy job. It isn’t something I’d go back to now that I have a family. But I do shop there often.
good,"JCPenney was a great place to work, but with most retail companies things are constantly changing. The store had great employee culture, and is a great place for a young college student, or for someone looking for their first job."
good,its an over all great place the customers are fantastic the employees are great to work with and the management are very nice and easy going and very understanding.
good,I was fortunate enough to have a commission position.  It allowed for the most customer interaction and driving of your own paycheck.  We enjoyed a family atmosphere among coworkers even with the addition of commission to the role.
good,jcpennys wasnt a fun place to be very boring and slow didnt get enough hours so my paychecks were really short. i liked that i got disocunts but never really used them anywasy
good,See many opportunities to learn different things about merchandising and business organizing. management will show you a different route to get the job done with multiple ways.
good,"Not the highest paying call center job. But  management works with you, once you are out of training which is thorough. Success keys are easily accessible, company policies are accessible. This place hosts a more urban mature crowd."
good,"I loved working there and were given credit tickets for as many credit apllications we got. And also great employee discount, unfortunately they upgraded the stores and eliminated some managers and renamed and removed some departments and my department was one of them. so I was laid off."
good,"Management was not effective.Team is very understanding and works hard to make sure employees are happy.However, at any given time you could be let go. Job stability here is nonexistent."
good,JCPenney gave plenty of chances for hours and holiday pay. The workers were nice and very willing to help out the newbies. However the boss tended to forget what days you asked off a lot.
good,i would recommend for kids in high school/college; not a permanent job for a living wage since minimum wage is given (9$/hr) starting out. currently working there as a means to pay for some college charges
good,I worked with a great staff.I love people really enjoyed working with the public.The managers worked with me to help when needed.That made it easier.Great group of people to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working there, for the most part. I got frustrated after 2+ years because I had taken on extra responsibilities, but the management would not raise my pay or offer me a higher job title."
good,"I thought JcPenny was an good place to work and yes, I would go back to work for them if I needed to. I liked that they offer training classes as well"
good,"My responsibilities at JCPenny were similar to those at the Nike Store, with the only difference being it was through the store closure. I found it to be a very profitable, because it expanded my responsibility to beyond being an associate. I was working alongside managers in regards to store decisions. On several occasions, I was to assume a manager's role following my leader instics."
good,A typical day at work would be very interesting. You meet all kinds of people with all sorts of different backgrounds. It teaches you alot and you gain alot of experiece in working in the reatil industry.
good,good structure and positive people was what made the job a good one. once they got replaced it was another  story all together and it was not a bad time spent with the company just was not ideal haha.
good,Easy place to work low speed easy to keep up with. They will work around your schedule and are very flexible. Management is going through a lot of changes at the moment and it is difficult to find support when you need it.
good,busy everyday in the shoe department at JC  Penny's...I learned patience with the many requests for shoes...the workplace culture was fun. The hardest part of the job was closing one day and opening the very next morning.The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made at work and my jean passes and $5 everytime I got two credit card apps in the same day on my shift.
good,Was a great company to work for but you only get benefits if you are a fulltime employee. I was only seasonal so I didn't receive any. I believe I was let go because I didn't sell enough credit card  applications
good,I started off as a cashier then within a yr moved into pricing. I had 4 departments to stage. When it became very busy i helped zone and cashier to help elevate the traffic at checkout. I also helped in stocking and visual.
good,"Good place to work, ability to meet and work with people in different departments. Company offers special events and activities for employees as well as a 20% discount, open 7 days a week. Good customer service."
good,The management and other employees were great. I worked there nights and weekends to make extra money. I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed helping the customers find what they needed. It was very hectic during the Christmas season.
good,At JCPenney the work would be fast paced and constant. You'd had to rely on your co-workers to help you get it all done. I was always trying to find ways to make in easier on the people coming in for the next shift. So I would manage my time accordingly and efficiently.
good,Management was good for the most part except there are constant schedule changes without any type of notification to the associates. Hardest part of my job is getting support from the other supervisor to teach the sales associates how to properly process and address certain items that I have to deal with.
good,"Nice place to work, friendly atmosphere. Didn't pay well.  Good people,  boss was good ,left for a better paying job. Minimum wage is not enough to live on."
good,Outstanding group of associates fighting hard to achieve company sales and profit objectives. Very difficult time to be in retail and can be very stressful with long hours. Love the people---workplace culture is excellent.
good,"While the pay is low, the work environment is pleasant.  The team is well blended and it's a pleasure to work there.  If only they paid a better hourly wage and offered full-time!"
good,"To be honest, is really fun to work for JCPenney, the environment is fresh, cool & nice, always much to do. You get to build a lot of relationships & friends along the way!"
good,"an amazing workplace, the people who work there are always lively and look forward to the day at work.The management is amazing from my experience and understanding with life situations."
good,I loved working a Jcpenney I just never would have known what sales associates go through daily with cleaning messes and being worked to make sure the store is cleaned 24/7. Overall it is fun if you are working with people you like.
good,"fair place to work and get the money. good team work and store is in good shape "
good,I think this work place is a very good start to a career in customer service its a great way to start is anybody wants a first job. I like the job actually
good,"Great management, but work dumped onto teams with expectation of working. Communication could be better. Team is very understanding and works hard to make sure employees are happy."
good,"I was there for a short time, it was seasonal but the short time that I was there. The work day was normally un-boxing all the items for the store , and stocking the store and backrooms. Management was fun, and nice. Cant really think of the part that was hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable was the coworkers."
good,"I believe this would be the best retail experience anyone could ever have. The company as a whole is employee-first company. The training really prepared me for the job, and the managers always made sure I was taken care of."
good,"At JCPenney I am a sales associate. I am typically one of the first faces you see when you enter the store. I am responsible for greeting guests and helping them find anything they need. I could be found tidying up around or checking out customers. The work day can be overwhelming at times since so many people come in. The work load can seem a bit much for just $8/$9. I've learned a lot of patience with this job. When something is going wrong for the customers (can't find right size, coupon doesn't work etc.) you must be patient and find the best way to help them. The management has not been the best within my store. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers and getting to interact with so many different types of people."
good,This was my first job ever. I liked it while I was there. It was definitely fast paced and ever changing. The management changed a lot more than it should have which made the environment unstable.
good,Good place to work. Discount is good. Friendly  co workers. They promote  from inside.  Vacation  time and 401k. Good benefit.  Family environment.  Some time you  may get overtime.
good,"Typical warehouse job with long schedules. Lunches are really short and the warehouse facility are huge and A/C."
good,You meet different people not only the customers but your co-workers. You learn each other talents and help each other out. Each supervisor was different but i enjoyed most of them. Also when were you don't really have a uniform is a dress casual and you get to have fun with it.
good,"Great organization to work for, however in the midst of store closings with potentially many more store closing on the horizon this upcoming fall season.  Not stable for current role or career advancement."
good,"During the time that I worked here a few years ago, the manager was terrible. However this was my job when I was in high school and so I made it work."
good,It was a great Job. I got to work with people and help people who came in. I learned more about time management and how to handle difficult situations.
good,If your either young and need a summer job or retired this is a great part time job for you. If your trying to make a lot of money go somewhere else .
good,The managers are super nice and make work very fun.  The coworkers are nice for the most part.  The hardest part about work is standing in one place to fold clothes so I paced while I folded.
good,"Poor communication within the company, largely because it's part of a corporation. Training is unfortunately minimal, (but perhaps that's because I'm only a part-time associate, hired to help with liquidation). You pretty much pick it up as you go, and from your fellow coworkers."
good,"Very laid back job, nothing too strenuous. Management is very friendly and will work with you and your schedule. They also have great hours and pay rate."
good,"Typical work day consists of opening cash registers, putting out merchandise, assisting customer with location of merchandise and purchasing decisions, obtaining credit applications, assisting other departments if needed, making sure department remains tidy throughout the day, cleaning out dressing rooms and gathering items left at registers for distribution throughout department and closing registers. Very competitive with credit applications and promotional sales."
good,"friendly and helpful staff"
good,"I really enjoyed my job, Meeting with clients, Helping them with their project,Put together the product to meet their need and get the best quality for the best price for them."
good,"Great work environment, Horrible Salary and wage. Management fluctuates. Worked here for a year only leaving due to pay and lacking ability to call off."
good,I enjoyed my time at JCPenney's salon. I had a friendly manager and felt that she was fun to be around. I didn't stay because of family scheduling issues and pregnancy.
good,Very good working team. The supervisor had excellent knowledge of the job and in working with her employees. She exhibited great team management. Excellent work relations.
good,Its a nice fit for teenagers looking for a job during the summer but hours can become very limited in other seasons. Overall work place is nice and welcoming.
good,I would have to say the time I spent employed by JC Penney was fantastic due the friendly and caring coworkers I had. It felt like I had been a burden on management when I would bring up a possibility to implement an idea that could help the store.
good,I was lucky enough to have some amazing managers that guided me through my first job experience and always taught me more about the company. After working for a holiday seasons I was trained to specialize in Levi's jeans and managed that section. There were two managers working per shift and they were always willing to help when needed.
good,Enjoyed coming to work and helping customer's.  Loved getting to see what we had in stock that was new. Really enjoyed  staying late and counting the inventory.
good,Management is always in flux and you're busy non stop doing various jobs for anyone. The company has lost it's feeling of family but it was a good job at the time.
good,"Must love talking to people.  Ask for credit applications, and order options.  Try to add on to sales to meet sales goals.  Fun incentives, fun co-workers."
good,it was a good atmosphere with good customers and good people but the amount of work we had to handle and how much we made each paycheck didn't exactly add up.
good,"Working along side many employees, helping customers. I would use the cash register. Open and close with the store. Walk around and fold and straightened clothes and display areas."
good,"A typical day at work was opening or closing work area in cleaning and restocking displays. We would restock shelves with merchandise and go to selling floor. We would help customers with selling, returning used or damaged merchandise. We would set displays and change the whole area for new season quarter."
good,this work environment is very diverse... I am 18 years of age and I am the youngest person here... People and coaches are sweet... calls can be difficult when customers have been pushed around for quite some time...
good,"JCP was good; very high turnover of associates; based on work/life balance. "
good,"J C Penney doesn't offer fulltime employment and no place for advancement.Fun place to work.Merchandise  is great and of quality.Very clean and profile layout.Multiple saving products:coupons,credit cards etc."
good,I had a lot of opportunity to grow and learn. Met great leaders that helped me in any way they could and passed on their great knowledge. Thank you JCP community!
good,I started as a shoe salesman but was given the opportunity to manage the portrait studio. I learned a great deal in this department and was responsible for the operations.
good,"It truly is a legend, one of Americas last company's! Where God is first and respect for family is a must. "
good,"I performed different roles during my time here. I was a supervisor, group lead, associate etc. There was a lot of pressure from management all the time. The people were ok to work with. But a lot of changes"
good,"This is a good job if your into retail and like it easy, it's a good place but not quite my pace. I thought is was a bit to slow for me."
good,"Got tons of hours since I started right before seasonal kicked off, but once January came around we were severely understaffed and hours got cut drastically. Our leaders of departments were so nice and fun to work with, but upper management only cared about you if you got tons of credit apps. Witnessed a fellow coworker get let go because of made up accusations by other management as well even though he had exceptional performance at work. That never sat well with me especially when they tried to act like nothing even happened. Best time to work here is during seasonal, you will have plenty to do. Expect shifts and hours to get cut otherwise."
good,loved the opportunity to help customers find products and clothings to make them feel better about themselves. I had an amazing time learning how to work customer service properly.
good,"I learned about sales and credit applications. "
good,"JC Penney can be an enjoyable place to work for from the nice people to the inviting organizational climate. However, at times expectations can be overwhelming."
good,"While working at JCPenney's I have learned a lot from visual merchandising to customer service to working with the catalog department. On a typical day I would check for notes from the morning person then would go on to my normal routine of making phone calls, processing orders and returns and if time permits helping other departments like kids department. Co-workers for the most part are fun and energetic willing to help each other out. The hardest or more challenging part of my job is coming up with solutions to help the customer since orders can sometimes get a bit complicated. The most enjoyable has been meeting new people and getting to work in the field I am interested"
good,"The management were friendly and understanding, a typical work day would be helping customers and keeping the home department of JCPenney clean"
good,"The company offer great benefits however needs more management education. "
good,"I worked as a seasonal retail associate during Christmas in 2012.  I needed a job BAD and I was grateful JC Penny hired me.  Within two weeks, I was offered a permanent part-time position.  I took it.  I resigned several months later because I was only getting 13 hours a week.  The company was having a difficult time, bleeding cash. The management overall was caring and they worked hard.  They do reward hard work and do things to boost employee morale.  The co-workers overall were good to great to work with.  The more experienced employees would look out for newer employees."
good,"The start of my day, I greet my coworkers, management to advise them I am in my office. Read my emails and check my voice mail. Check my schedule for any training or meetings. "
good,The people make it great there. But the store itself is having a hard time. Lots of shrinkage. The pricing part of the store is probably where they struggle the most because the prices normally never match what the signs actually say.
good,Management was professional and youthful. The other employees gossiped a lot making the environment a little more toxic. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the wealthy people who always tried to haggle to get the items for free.
good,This is a great job for those just out of high school or college. They work with your schedule and you can transfer departments easily. They do not have many full timers though.
good,"Good company with quick room for advancement. This location in Abilene saw my potential and moved me up quickly. As with any retail job, not a lot of time for family though."
good,At JC Penny's I learned a lot about myself. It was a commission sales job and I learned to be aggressive when I had to be in a business setting. Liked working with my co- workers even though it was stressful at times. Management did not always help settle differences and was unfair at time.
good,JCP was a fun job that I really learned to hone my customer service skills with. I interacted with a lot of different kinds of people. The downside is that this is a retail job so sometimes during peak seasons you work long hours late into the night and it is hard to enjoy your holidays.
good,They had me work 5-6 days a week while I'm a high school student still so it was hard at first to maintain everything but it worked out.
good,A typical day consisted of many customers. I learned how to sell a credit card if necessary. Management was really good for the most point. They always took care of things. My co-workers were professional for the most point. The hardest part of the job were the customers who always thought they were right. Enjoyable part? When I would actually sell a credit card.
good,Great first job. Would recommend for gaining experience in retail or even just experience in customer service. Fun enthusiastic coworkers that make you feel involved as a team. A very satisfying feeling being able to help people and make a difference.
good,"It is a good place to work for students, or elderly people. It only get's busy during the holiday time. The pay is minimum wage."
good,Start off as a slow day. Learn how to build a relationship with customers. Management was pretty good. Co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part was working holiday hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was happy customers.
good,Jcpenney is a great corporation to work for. You will meet new people and learn new skills. This job will help to increase your social skills and will also challenge you.
good,"When I first began with company I saw myself working with them until retirement, which would have been 30+ years. Far too many changes in the corporate level decreased the longevity of the company, affecting employment. Since then job stability is a concern for many employees. The company is still great to work for, I miss the family culture, the fast paced environment, and the professional advancement that is offered."
good,"Your standard Retail job, I learned how to better my customer service skills. Management was great, co-workers were amazing and helpful. The hardest part of the job was you would get occasionally rude customer but more good customers than rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers that showed appreciation for what for help and building relationships with customers who came bak to see you for your help."
good,You must have discipline so you want spend most of your pay check back in the store. The management team likes to get in and work along side of you to make sure the store looks good. They also have several contest for you to win extra JC Penney bucks or more of a discount off one item.
good,"loved working there, the employees were wonderful to work with, hardest part of the job was having an angry customer and not knowing what to do, and keeping the store straight. the management was really great to work with, the most enjoyable part of the job was having a lot of happy customers and helping them find what the wanted."
good,Greeted customers entering and leaving. Assisted customers with help on the floor and at check out. Located merchandise for customers. Accepted payments and returns. Handle customers complaints. Monitored inventory on continuous basis.
good,Everyday is an adventure with the most difficult part is  not being able to see everyone on the team as much as needed.  The people are great to work with.
good,The hardest part was fitting rooms. Management was always nice. But they never had enough people on the schedule. The work isn't worth minimum wage. At all.
good,It was my first job and I learned a lot from them. For example I learned how to stock and set up the floor as well as handle the cashier register efficiently.
good,co workers were pretty cool. not all but thats expected. good pay tho and alot of room for advancement of course is good. helped me lose weight as well
good,Very flexible with your schedule and very attentive to personal needs. Management was always there and helpful when you needed them.
good,"This company was great to work for, it help me with my job development, it educated me on my work ethics. working here gave me an opportunity to better my self-esteem ."
good,"Have to have  superior customer service skills. Gained knowledge of Optician duties, and the roll of Worked six days a week months on end. Very hard to find optical associates to wok part time."
good,Friendly and engaging atmosphere.  You feel like a family.  I have learned about coaching and development.  Customer service is what JCPenney stands for and ensuring the customer leaves happy.
good,"It was a day job, but disturbed my school schedule. The co-workers are nice people, I loved the job but it was disturbing my school schedule"
good,I came to JC Penney after having a horrible experience working at Macy's. JCP has a very friendly atmosphere and is very inclusive. They don't care how you look as long as you are professional and productive.
good,"The management team is wonderful to all employees. The employees are usually very happy and full of energy, which creates a very exciting and happy environment."
good,I enjoyed working for Jcpenney i started out as a customer service rep. and got promoted 3 times in the 4 years i was with them my last promotion was a supervisor position over 3 different departments it was great.
good,"Work days were full of undone work, which I like. I like to keep busy. I love the customer service, JCP wants us to give. And we do it!"
good,I worked here a long time ago but it was fun and the company has grown a lot. Offer benefits and management adjusts to personal life scheudle.
good,"A typical day at work included me opening my registers and preparing the floor for customers. My main focus throughout the day was engaging customers and providing them with information and advice on products. I also worked to extend credit lines to eligible clients. Maintaining the tidiness of the stock room, display areas, and other areas of the store, as needed, typically took up any downtime."
good,This job shaped me into the person I want to be as a manager and provider of respect for everyone I come in contact with. I loved my regular and new customers. Helping others is what I love doing.
good,The redesigned layout of the store and the new merchandise has been helpful and looks nice. Prices can be a little too high but nice selections.
good,"I joined this work environment to get the hang of being a sales associate, and they were really flexible with my hours with me being a full time student at Motlow State. They taught me what to expect with sales, how to handle the computer, and the co-workers were really friendly and nice. The most enjoyable part in my job is when I was folding clothes and putting them back where they belonged. The hardest was when I was working on holidays (like Black Friday and Thanksgiving) it was a wreck, but it was an experience I will never forget. It taught me how to handle things and also taught me how to keep calm and collect in a lot of matters."
good,"Got to learn the many ways of receiving,use scannimg guns and conveyors for box movement.My co workers were great in helping to get the merchandise ready to go out to sales floor,and have space for the next day.The hardest part of the job was the lack of space."
good,Fun fast paced work that is not for people who aren't looking to be busy for their entire shift. Management is good and hours are readily available as long as you put in the effort to work. Made a lot of friends during my time there
good,"I enjoyed my job and I got along great with my manager, co-workers and clients. It also let me put my artistic skills to use. But I was let go due to not enough people coming into the studio and I was not informed of my unemployment until I came in a month later just to shop at the store itself."
good,"Would check in large trucks with merchandise and prep merchandise to get out on the floor.  Co-workers were great, management was so-so.  Supervisors were great, but salaried managers were very one-sided."
good,"They are always having sales incentives and bonuses provided to employees who accomplish goals like obtaining credit apps and getting your name mentioned in surveys for good customer service. They provide lunch during holidays and special scheduled store events and sales, along with employees and their spouse receiving a large discount on every day shopping on the store and online. No benefits are offered unless you are a full time employee, which most are not. "
good,"It was hectic some days, but I loved working with the families that came in to get their portraits taken. Perosnally I didn't agree in making them pay more, I wanted them to feel like someone there cared about them. Some of the coworkers were a bit unwilling to work with ethnic families. I was the go-to person for ethnic families."
good,"I deeply enjoyed JCPenney and all the experience I gained from working there.  If the job security/advancement was better, I would have stayed with the company."
good,"I learned a lot working at jcp, like learning different/ specific names and materials used for clothing, shoes, and home merchandise, dealing with and solving problems on the spot and just being able to work so close with the public. Many of my coworkers were very supportive and always fun to work with. The hardest part about the job was constantly working about go-backs while trying to recover, keeping an eye on the register while also keeping an eye on potential shoplifters. ( we were very short staffed)  It wasn't always easy working at jcp, but the most enjoyable part was working with the customers, you always learned something from them."
good,"a typical day at work here is very busy. There is so much to do for example bring products out and scanning, updating prices, inventory, help guest, counting money, checking guest out and etc. I've learned so much from here. I've learned how to communicate with others, being reliable, how to deal with money, friendly customer service."
good,answering calls and not knowing what you would find on the other end. Traing was fun getting to meet and know new people. Managment was always involved and co workers very interesting. The hardest part of the job was talking to an angry customer. The phone part was the funny customers.
good,Some days are really hectic while some days were so slow with no customers or work to do because everything is already put away and everything is clean. We (sales associates) had our department manager plus about twenty other managers so it was hard to keep track of our duties because one manager will say one thing and the very next manager will say something completely different and we had to listen and respect all of them. I also felt like a monkey going up and down the stock room ladders trying to get shoes and then put them back away.
good,Good place to work if you like retail.  Management friendly and helpful.  Most of of the co-workers were young and not bad to work with.
good,"Full-filling work place, yet still stressful, seeing as how it is retail. I learned excellent Customer Service, and attention to detail. Co-workers become a loving family. The hardest part of the job is is the physical demands without enough man power. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems and customer satisfaction."
good,"Very fun, I gained a lot of register experience and my Spanish speaking skills have improved. I would've loved to stay but they sadly let me go...I folded childrens' clothes most of the time, helped customers when needed. Management knew what they were doing and kept it very professional. Hardest part of the job was all of the customers and the cash registers went down sometimes. It was the perfect job for me."
good,JcPeeny's was an ok job. I only received a great amount of hours when the holiday season came around. Other than that I lost at least half the hours I was working.
good,"When you're brand new, they force you to close. Some days you leave at 11 even though they closed at 9. The co-workers are nice though. They force you to get 6 credit card applications every month, which is sometimes hard to achieve,"
good,"I've learned about store management, how to manage the cashier and develop excellent customer service skills thanks to the trainings that the company provide us."
good,I enjoyed my 16yrs at  JC PENNEY. made many new friends and even customers became friends. I loved the promotions and running my department's and working with associates.
good,Depending on your job title your experience working here will be different. It is an okay job for a college student. Management is okay...
good,"Customer satisfaction and excellent customer service was the motto. Greet the customer. Take care of customers needs and ring up transactions. Clean and Stock shelves, Periodically Training classes. Worked with co-workers to leave for breaks and clean up for closing."
good,Great place to work if looking for a place that works around school hours. Employees and Employer are all friendly. Hardest part of the job is simply dealing with all the rush during black friday.
good,"i loved working for JCP very laxed enviroment and  great team leads, they hire anybody tho so some co-workers are very unproffesional"
good,"I did alot of different jobs during my time at JCPenney. I started as sales support which would help customers out on the floor and keep the floor and fitting rooms nice and neat for an easy shopping experience. Then I went to being a sales associate in the Kid's Department which I thoroughly enjoyed. I rang up customers with their transactions and helped with anything they needed on the sales floor. My final position was a combination of door-to-floor, pricing team, and floorset team. We would take daily shipment out to the sales floor, set all promotion that were currently happening throughout the store, and set the entire store for the next month's floorset. The hours were long but the money was good. There were no benefits offered for my positions but we had an hour lunch most of the time. Hours were usually flexible with school because there were multiple associates to cover the schedules. Hardest part of the job would be the long hours and sometimes the hours were working through the night."
good,"Fun work environment, but must always be prepared. Working in my field you must always be on your feet for whatever happens. Nobody is on top of you, showing you how to do every step. I must know my deadlines and meet it. Be aware of all customer and associate activities, maintain a high level of safety."
good,"When an online order comes through I retrieve the item, package them acorrding to their shipping status, and ship them out; or get them ready for the customer to pick up, through a process we call binning. If it is a slow day and I have hardly any ""picks""/orders, I help on the front end ringing out customers or closing registers; I also help on the floor keeping department cleaned up, and fitting rooms empty and ready the next person to use them. The people that I work with are all very good at their jobs, and we all help each other out when we see someone struggling, even the management. The hardest part of my job is trying to figure out how to fix something when things go wrong, but to me that is also the funnest part."
good,"I love working at JCP. The management is wonderful and the coworkers are great. I have only two major complaints: "
good,I worked for J.C. Penney for 10 years and while the people and the culture were inviting working in an accounting environment just wasn't the spice I needed in life. Movement was slow and the pay was not up to par but the benefits and the relaxing flexible schedule were definitely nice the have.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee in the Customer Service Department.  My duties included handling on-line catalog orders and pick-ups, cashiering, and returns/exchanges of purchases.  I enjoyed working for JCPenneys, and was asked to stay on after the holidays.  Unfortunately, seven months after I was hired; the new CEO at the time made many changes and closed the Customer Service Departments in all stores.  I was laid off since I was one of the newer employees."
good,Excellent educational training and product lines available for both back bar and retail. Very prfessionally run business. The hardest part of the job is trying to save your money and not spend it in the store.
good,JC Penney was a good place to shop but I was unable to stand for long periods of time.  The managers were nice and helpful.  Some of the people were very cool to work with.  Most of the managers were very nice.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JC Penney. I'm a 'people person', so I love interacting with customers on a one-to-one level."
good,Overall I have had a pretty decent experience working with JCPenney. Mostly every associate I have worked with I have gotten along with and we were able to accomplish a lot working together. For being shorthanded a lot of the time I experienced great cooperation with my coworkers.
good,Nice place with work just lack of hours. Then if they hire new people they cut the hours you already have. Management is over all good just multiple bosses.
good,I graduated from school and choose working in a high traffic salon and had the ability to learn alot from other stylists and develop my own skills.  This increased my personal confidence to open my own business and have been on my own for 23 years.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at JCPenney. I was able to gain customer service skills as well as get some experience dealing with payments, cash, and credit cards. Overall, I enjoyed my employment here and everyone that I met."
good,Production based warehouse work. You make more if you work hard. Monday thru Friday work schedule with occasional Saturdays as needed.
good,"It is hard to work for a company when your hours get cut and you never know form week to week your hours.  When working evenings you had to stay as late as needed to fold cloths, then being to work opening days."
good,"I worked in many positions at JCPenney. My position in the Office was really a cash room/payroll position."
good,"Working at JC Penny is for the most part pretty enjoyable. I liked getting up morning and looking forward to going to work. I learned everything I could learn there and more. "
good,enjoyed the hours and having weekends off. The pay was decent and the discount was awesome ! They were flexable with hours and when you needed time off.
good,"As with most employers in the present economy, they want more from their employees for less pay. The staff is stretched very thin."
good,"JcPenney is a very organized  company, they make sure that every thing is done in a timely manner and that tasks are complete."
good,"Part time temporary work, fun place to work with great customer service ethics. Their hiring critique needed some work when they came to selection of the ongoing employees, but a decent place of part time employment overall"
good,"supportive management, work well with others."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with JCPenny, my team was Great.  Overall the company does not use all it's people in an efficient way."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee earning money to pay for the birth of our grandson; our daughter was only 17 at the time."
good,"JCPenney is a very well structured company.  You can't go wrong if you follow the rules and do the job according to the description.  If you are an over achiever you get rewarded with more hours."
good,"This company is very high volume, very demanding and very rewarding. Enjoyed the fast pace setting. Changes are normal and very common. Management was good. The hardest part of the job was trying to be everywhere at the same time.  Learned to meet deadlines, follow detailed directions and that was the most enjoyable"
good,The short time that I worked at JcPenney my son was in the NICU in Des Moines and the management team was really great about working with my schedule and was really encouraging. They cared about my family and made sure that it was my number one focus! It is a great place to work!
good,It's and ok place to work for if you are going to school or just looking for something to do but it lacks job security purpose because your schedule moves around constantly and so do your hours.
good,I started my retail journey with JC Penny. Today i am grateful for everything I learned along the way. I exceeded all expectations in growing with the company.
good,"High demand for credit applications.  Customers are very courteous, and loyal to good service providers.  Management willing to work with you for scheduling needs as long as done in advance.  Fun."
good,I enjoyed most of my 26 years with JCPenney. The best part was the people I'ved worked with over the years. From management to the associates lots of good people
good,"This job provided as a great way to learn more about retail businesses; I thoroughly enjoyed being given new tasks and mastering them throughout my time with this company."
good,"I love working with everyone at the store! It can be a bit slow most of the time with little traffic during the weekdays, but overall it is still an enjoyable place to work."
good,Can be a little trying at times but overall a decent place to work.  I did not have any issues while working here.  Management was always helpful.
good,"either not enough hours or over working their associates, Customers are very needy. You must be able to multi-task. Co- workers are great. The best thing about working for JCP is at holiday time when you get a lot more hours,"
good,"I would help customers and make sure that the clothes were put out on time and that they were categorized properly by color, size, and style. I wore all kind of hats and multi-tasked a lot of the times whether it was working the register, putting out clothes, pricing items for mark downs, and trained new employees."
good,"A typical work day would consist of clocking in, going to the replenishment morning meeting, unloading the truck, stocking the store, and greeting the customers as the store proceeded to open. I learned how to properly unload a truck and replenish the store of several different items. Management was wonderful they did a amazing job with keeping the coworkers in tune with their tasks and assistance as needed. The hardest part of the job was organizing the back stock. The most enjoyable part of my job was being apart of a wonderful team."
good,"the people I work with are amazing and make me want to go to work everyday. the pay and hours on the other hand are slightly rediculous. they pay new employees more than the workers that have been there for years and they skimp on raises all the time. unless you trade hours, you get maybe 25 hours aweek, even if your suppost to get 30. they set ridiculous goals of getting credit apps and the customers are hard to please with all the coupons they give out."
good,great place to work; customers and associates are priorities for senior management; ability to move to other positions for continued advancement.
good,"Typical day at work involved making sure the customer service tables were clean. Clothes, shoes, etc. laying around were put away.Making sure customers were greeted and helped as soon as possible. Also, keeping the customers happy and interacting with them to help them find whatever they needed."
good,A good part time job for anyone looking for a little extra cash. Great management team and discounts for associates. Not a job as a main source of income unless you are a manager.
good,I learned how to crop and edit photos.  I enjoyed working for the portrait studio.  I learned several skills here and enjoyed the people I worked with.  It was an easy place to work for and the management and other associates were very friendly.  i would definitely work here again.  The customers can be difficult and its sometimes difficult to reach your sales goals.
good,"Working in a salon environment is one of the most amazing experiences. As far as co-workers and managers go, I could never find another group such as this. I loved my job. I only left because the opportunity to make more money presented itself, and supporting three children on my salary at JCP was difficult."
good,I learned to handle money responsibly as well as please customers and handle situations in a professional manner. The hardest part of working in retail is knowing you will have to please everyone differently. I most enjoyed making customers happy.
good,"JCPenney is a good company. I feel that working here that there is no place for advancement. You pretty much get stuck at the position you start at. Raises are also few and far in between. I worked there for two years before i got a raise. Supervisors, at the particular store I work at have a bad attitude and associates don't want to work there. This is why many of the new hires quit only after a few days of actually working there. My coworker, fortunately, are good people and are hard workers. We work as a team and I like that aspect of my job a lot."
good,"Learned many great skills, it was my first job and was a great eye opener. Got to know the customers and people living in the area heard many great story from elderly customers. People I worked with were great as well, Management team made it fun un like other places I heard of."
good,busy and fun great people  I learned a lot in my 7 yrs wished they payed there employees more to compensate the cost of living
good,Great place for seasonal work. Always had something to do and an order to take. If needed will apply to work here again. The environment was always upbeat.
good,"Typical day at work begins with Walking my section, greeting/helping  customers, and maintaining products. Keep busy and asking managment if any specific tasks need to be done. The most enjoyable part of my day is making and acheiving goals set by managment in a timely manner."
good,"During my time with JC Penney, I was a part of the jewelry department.  There was a higher degree of responsibility as we were responsible for a good amount of diamonds and gold jewelry.  I enjoyed the co-workers I had and the company was very good about letting me go early as I was about to have a baby."
good,"I enjoyed working working at JCP. I had a great group of co-workers.  We had a physically demanding, fast paced job and were able to get our job done in the prescribed time frame. If our store wouldn't have closed I would still be working there."
good,"Never really had a bad day, all the co-workers are nice and helpful. Very fun working at JCPenny. But after holidays it's hard to get a lot of hours."
good,"I work on a team where we all unload merchandise that has been taken off the truck.  I feel that we all have a family type atmosphere due to us being a 12-15 team of employess.  There are others that work at Penneys but with us being a team that unloads the truck, we have that special closeness."
good,"My day at work depends on what position I work for the day.  My jobs include customer support (unloading truck and stock), visual (setting the store for new merchandise, dressing forms), and cash room (taking in cash and making deposits). I enjoy working with co-workers because I continue to learn a new task daily. The only thing that keeps me from staying here is no benefits for part-time employees."
good,"The salon is nice . coworkers are rude , competition is serious in the salon when there shouldnt be any competition . dont recommend  working for the company"
good,"clocking in, get a layout of what needs to be accomplished and what was left behind from the last employee. co workers usually are already busy with tasks so I immediately accommodate them if customers are not around and my task is not as lengthy. Usually if they are winding down on their task i will help them finish up so the new task can be the main focal point for the day. I would not say their was a hard part of the job it is all about how you perceive it to be. I believe you have to find the highs and lows out of every task given to you but the key is not to sit and dwell in the low state. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to engage in conversation with different people everyday. Having conversation both personal and job related and meeting their expectations gave me a wonderful feeling."
good,"A typical day at JCPenney involved working to unload freight deliveries and readying the merchandise to be delivered to the sales floor in a timely manner as well as pricing and signing duties when replenishment duties were complete. Working freight was the most enjoyable part of the job as it was a fast paced assignment that made the days fly by. It was also the best part of the job due to the fun, hardworking group of people that I had the privilege of working with. Everyone knew how to make each other laugh while working hard to accomplish the same goals. The hardest part of the job sometimes would be trying to multitask between replenishment duties and assisting with fixture/display set ups on the sales floor with the expectation that the days truck delivery would still get opened and delivered to the sales floor. What made that difficult was being short-staffed, but with a lot of determination and hard work, we still somehow managed to complete both tasks, going home at the end of the day feeling great about the accomplishment. The management never hesitated to offer a kind word or provide constructive feedback and were generally always available for assistance. They were also very appreciative of all of us when asked to work overnight when the store was closed to help with furniture department moves by throwing either a pizza party or a potluck the next day as gratitude. The management certainly knew how to motivate and thank all of us employees. It made long, late shifts worth it and fun."
good,"Great company to work for. That's why they have been in business so long, and will continue too. So if you're considering it, give them a try."
good,Jcpenneys  stresses customer service so it is a great place to work to be able  help the customer with every aspect of their purchases.  I have learned about all of the merchandise and able to multi task.  Hardest part of the job is not always having enough hours and having to tell customers we do not carry what they are looking for.  I have learned about retail operations.  Enjoy helping customersto find just the right purchases and my coworkers.
good,"What does one expect from retail? Well crazy sales, insane lines, irate customers and lots of organizing. This job required an enormous amount of patience and excellent customer service. The company's whole agenda revolved around upholding that customer service guarantee from every single employee. Closing indicated that  you would be there a couple of hours past the store closing. Depending on the type of day you could spend one hour cleaning or you can spend 3 hours still fixing racks. There was never a dull moment and helping people sure does have its advantages. JCPenney is the perfect company to work for if you are looking for a career in retail and you have thirst for providing great customer service through everything you do."
good,This location rarely has walk ins. This salon would be good for someone who already has a clientele and a following. Its clean and decor is updated with the rest of the store.
good,"Some days long hours"
good,"There is no typical day at work in retail, which is the best part. Everyday differs from the next. I usually come in and check my email and look at our store's customer service numbers. Based on the results, I will spend time with the associates in the store that night and coach and help train them on ways to give a better customer experience. I update our team on the scores we have and areas of improvement. Then, usually for about a 2-3 hour time span I spend on the floor as the Leader on Duty(LOD). During this time I handle any issues that arise and coach employees on credit, service, and any other part of the job that may need improving or acknowledgment. Once my LOD shift is over I dedicate the rest of my time to making sure the store is in good condition and provide assistance to those who need it. Hardest part of my job is that every day is different. Yes, it makes for a fun atmosphere, but it makes it hard to schedule activities into your day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the day to day interactions I have with customers and associates. I feel this job is very rewarding when I am able to help the customers find exactly what they are looking for. The management is very fun and professional. We let the standards be known, but allow for flexibility to achieve those goals. It' a very family oriented atmosphere."
good,I feel that at the time JCP was a great place to work. I had awesome coworkers and awesome managers. I started off in high school and worked there for 11 years. I feel its a good company for anyone.
good,"A typical days work was answering phones, job tracking, data entry, assisting the decorator with and info they needed.  I've learned that  keeping customers informed about there merchandise whether good or bad, they do appreciate that in the long run. My co-workers and I always worked a team for a positive outcome with there purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job is having happy customers that are pleased with the In-Home custom Decorating experience."
good,It was just like any other part time job. Do the work and make friends with your co-workers. Depending on how busy it is you get a good amount of hours
good,"Being part of JCPenney was more than a job; it was an experience and an education. There were multiple factors that led to this being the truth; a clean and well organized layout & stockroom, customers that enjoyed shopping at our store, the people that connected the customers with our vision, and the great management team that led us. The store manager at the time was by far my favorite employer to work for; he was serious & goal oriented, but smiled and had a good time, and this passion ran deep through every layer of hierarchy."
good,i worked in hair salon so it was good that i got to use my liscense. i liked helping the customer. servicing the customer is most important
good,A typical day at JcPenney for me is a day full of adrenaline because I work at the shoes department and costumers have taught us to work under pressure.
good,Helping customers purchase orders. Making sue customers are satisfy at all times. Communcation is key to success.. Learn a lot in short period of time.
good,Rec'd truck and processed new product daily.  Motivated team to work harder and faster
good,A typical day at work consisted of a lot of good judgement and management believing in that you'll be able to get the job done throughout the day without being on top of you consistently. Management always seemed to care and always be there for you if any questions needed to be asked.
good,I think this company is great. I just wished retail could be more of a stable industry.
good,"No chance to advance"
good,"The coworkers are well rounded in their environment. Just on a everyday basis at work its just customers coming to either return, purchase, order, or pick up an order from catalog. The management is good but at times some belittles coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers getting along with each other."
good,"I have worked for JCPenney for 16 years now, and everyday has been exciting and different. In years past the management staff has been kind and truly strived to create a work/life balance for every team member. The most enjoyable part of the job is the daily interactions with new team members, seasoned teammates, and of course with the customers."
good,JCPenney was my very first job. It required a very fast paced and active person which I fulfilled very well. Customer Service was the main priority which I was able to learn quickly and be responsible at my work environment.
good,at jcpennys i pretty much worked in all positions except manager. it was my first job so i learned pretty much everything i know today from them.customer service floor sets pricing visuals etc. i was there for 4 yrs and only got one raise i started at 7.50 and got a raise to 8.00 they are very unappreciative and expect so much out of you for little pay.
good,Really enjoyed working with my coworkers and also with the customers.
good,"Flexibility is a must , meeting customers needs as well as maintaining communication with management. It is a fast paced environment and multitasking is required on a daily basis. Product knowledge as well as location is key ."
good,"Selling and stocking the department"
good,"While it didn't pay well, it was the most enjoyable job I've had. The people were always so friendly, I often forgot I was at work. It was anything but physically demanding, but it felt just as complex as any other position I have had. There was a natural flow to work that made the day go fast, delivery in the mornings and placement after; in a very short time I became very good at it."
good,"Being a HR Manager is a great job.  You spend most of your time working with the associates on issues they may have, but there is so much more than that. You have the opportunity to run the entire store, oversee supervisors, help lead the store to grow customer service and sales.  However there is never enough time in the day to get the job done."
good,"The team I work with is awesome and the customers are priceless. We are more like family then just co workers. I have an array of great managers they are awesome as well. I  just wish I was making what I was worth then it would be perfect, with all the degrees and diplomas I have I can't  use them here. I came to JC Penny's with years of customer service under my wings. The typical day we laugh a lot and it helps us to get a lot done together. In the retail business there are a lot of ups and downs. The hardest part of this job is the stress it puts on your body."
good,"We were evaluated on how many problems we resolved, or tried to resolve, within an hour. I punched in at the time clock, signed into my computer in my workstation. It was pretty much non-stop until first break. We received many calls daily, placed just as many. The average hours were 5 a day. The average week 4 days except for Christmas time. The job was demanding as it was mostly resolving problems. There were no medical benefits. The best part was the people I worked with. Also when I was first hired the hours enabled me to spend time with my 3 teenagers."
good,"Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad work place at all; I just couldn't imagine working there for more than a year to a year and a half. The overall mentality there is very lax yet professional (well, as professional as retail can be). My only complaint would be that they don't believe in fixing problems. Management there would much rather replace or patch issues before ever finding the root to them; making it unbearable to stay there. That is why I believe the turn over rate is so high. Other than that, It's a great stop on the road professional success."
good,I worked the cash register which taught me cash-handling and people skills.  I always enjoyed working with my fellow associates.  Dealing with unruly guests can be difficult but helping the nice guests make it worth it.
good,Overall a good company to work for. I enjoy being a J.C Penney associate.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Penny's"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at JCP... The co-workers and managers"
good,"Maintained good quality customer service at all times"
good,This was a different experience for me working here. I met many different people from so many walks of life.
good,Getting the crew together and jobs for the day in place.Receive trucks and complete paperwork. Take calls and solve problems and answer questions.
good,The store and its customers were great. my manager was unbelievably outstanding. Corporate had their collective heads up their butts. Never had anything in on time and never contacted the store if something when wrong.
good,"JC Penny, is a great company to work for. Their focus is the customer!  I loved working at JC Penny. I worked as a greeter over the holiday season and it was the perfect job for me. I was able to assist customers locate their purchases with ease. I am a friendly person and love to help people so this was a great job for me."
good,JCPenney strives to evolve and become a new and innovate company.  The company is still going through some growth pains and once the overcome those the company will once again be a great place to work.
good,It was an okay place to work at very fast paced. One of the cons are you don't feel appreciated by management
good,"It was a seasonal job. I went at the time given to me, and folded clothes until store was closed."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Constantly changing schedule"
good,jcpenney decided to have a spirit week like we had in school. we were able to dress out a joke around with customers. so I'm with a customer an she needed me to look up her JCPenney card and to do that i have to go to a special screen. well i didn't know that our machine got upgraded. so i called a manager n she instructed me on how to do it. it was a new experience for me and the customer
good,"I learned a lot of new things in the retail business. management was good but was not great, but the  co-workers were nice to work with."
good,"Overal it's a good company, but Unfortunately the store that I worked at closed down."
good,Worked with some good people. Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves
good,"I have enjoyed my team at the salon, for the most part. JCPenney offers a well thought out plan for building your clientel as a stylist. The most difficult part of the job for me was answering to a management team who had no experience in salons whatsoever. Also the job security is sketchy. If a certain productivity is not met your hours are cut or you are terminated, so if you are unable to build a clientel you will not last here. However I have seen some young stylists fresh out of beauty school come in and be very successful, you just need to have an outgoing personality and be ambitious in reaching your goals."
good,My shift started at 5:30 a.m. and we worked until the job was completed. We would unload the truck and sort merchandise and then proceed to stock the floor. My manager was very clear and helpful to making the job run as proficient as possible. My co workers were hard working and team players. The hardest part of the job was early mornings and being on a limited time limit. The most enjoyable part of the job was working behind the scenes and being satisfied with the work done and seeing the store stocked and ready to go for the day.
good,I love people.  It was nice to have diversity.  The customers were my favorite part.
good,"Nice and fun co-workers make this job pretty cool. Some days are more enjoyable than others, but overall it isn't that bad. Holidays are the worst in any retail setting."
good,"I have been employed at JCPenney for quite awhile and have held many positions. My typical day is filled with many tasks such as to plan where the merchandise arriving on the truck the next day will be placed, making sales goals for my team, taking care of customer issues and most importantly providing an exceptional shopping experience for our customers. I look forward to everyday being a challenge and enjoyable."
good,"I learned to drive a fork lift and some customer service skills and to run a sorter worked in shipping, receiving trained many new associates, learned how to be responsible for other people work performance, learned to work with all ages and all type of attitudes. The hardest part is not having a voice when new ideas are present. I enjoyed everything about the job when its comes down too it, and hate that they had to down size in such a large amount."
good,"JCPenney in Hiram, GA is a very good place to work.  I work on the Sales Support Team which is a highly functional team.  A typical work day for me is a fast-paced, study work environment which I enjoy.  My co-workers are knowledgeable and make up a great, well-balanced support team.  Management is open to new ideas and pretty flexible with all of the moving parts that make up our team.  The hardest part of the job would be, if it was an extremely slow-paced day which would be a long day for me.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the teamwork and camaraderie among the support team."
good,"Categorize, organize clothing by department and size"
good,"I go into work, organize merchandise. Make sales. Then by the end of the day count up the money from the register. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving customer service to customers who were at the register. My co-workers were mostly friendly, others were not so friendly."
good,"Most days are filled with multiple tasks.  Provide customer service.  Having a knowledge about the storage inventory allows me to answer queries quickly about products not on display.  I've learned to use my time wisely, ensuring that my work space is neat and orderly, products visible. We work together as a team.  Standing all day is the hardest part of my job.  Meeting and interacting with people."
good,A wonderful day for me is to work in the children department.  I have always dreamed of working at Walt Disney and I have the pleasure of working in the Disney department at work.  I enjoy looking at the children playing with the toys and hearing the sing songs from the Disney movies they have watched. Parents allow me to play with their children and often I get to hold the babies. I am known by my first name by parents who shop in the store.  Sales have increased in the children department due to me given sticker to the children while they wait on their parents.  The hardest part about working in the children department is when I have to stop what I love and enjoy doing.
good,"A typical day/week includes checking current signs and sales, executing clearance and price change reports, working the truck, and interacting with customers.  This position contains a lot of tasks and is great for people who like to stay busy all day long."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at JcPenny was the customers. The company have amazing customers who consistently shops there. The ones I came in contact with while working there were great and very appreciative with the help I provided; and that always made my day.
good,The support staff at JC Penny is very effective and works as a team. The leadership is great.
good,"When working for this company, you can tell each store is completely different.  At my store things are more fun and energetic.  The store manager makes you want to come to work each and every day because of her bubbly personality.  While the other employees take the time to really notice the customers who come in and out of the store, this makes it a great work environment."
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customer and restocking merchandise. In my experiences I have learned to multitask, make phone calls, deal with customers and deadline on top of having sales goals. The most enjoyable part of my day would have to be my co workers and the new people I get to meet."
good,Helping shoppers find what they are looking.  Picking outfits for the family.
good,"Great place to see new faces and interact with customers.Typical day at work include opening registers, assisting customers and increasing sales by convincing customers to buy more things."
good,"I enjoyed working at J.C. Penney for the time I was there, it was a fast pace and very fun place to work."
good,Great first job/college job.  Not a career advancement.  Constantly doing the same thing over and over.  Checking out customers/putting up clothes.
good,Overall a good company on a rebound...Some stores have issues with upper management.
good,Great place to meet new clients and stylists.  Also good management and ongoing training.
good,"Put prices on clothing and made sure no holes in clothing,pack and un packed"
good,Heavy workload keeps you moving and challenged from day to day.
good,"I only worked at JC Penney's part time for a short period. I really loved the fast paced work environment, working with the public, and being busy all of the time. I always could find something to occupy my time, whether I was assisting customers, straightening the floor, or taking catalog orders."
good,"I have been at JCPenney Salon since January 2014. I am a new stylist, the employees are for the most part nice and helpful at times. The management can be better but it is overall good."
good,"Cashier "
good,lots of things to do. sometimes free food. sometimes management helped. most of the time they didn't.
good,I really enjoyed working at JC Penny because we had a great management team and the customers were very friendly.
good,"A typical day at work opening and closing, helping customers, learning things you didn't know before improving your work."
good,they did me wrong when i took my medical leave my husbamd had lung cancer so i had to quit ..............................manage was bad
good,Having worked with the JCP brand over the year. It is overall a good company. Even if the stability of the company itself is shaky at best. I did have a problem with temp hires gaining more hours then employees that have been working there longer and are better more efficient in production and better handling customer needs.
good,My days consist of answering the incoming calls for throughout the store. Helping the customer to complete orders.
good,"Typically, I would go around my department making sure my area was cleaned up, checking the fitting rooms every half hour and making sure my customers are satisfied. I've learned how to use a register, how to do set sales on the floor and how to do inventory. The management is really great in some cases and lacks in others. My co-workers are all very wonderful, they are just like family and I don't think I could be in a better environment. The hardest part of the job is when you're working with someone who just doesn't put in the effort to making sure that their job is done right. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with such a great team to get the job done and to really help the customers find what they need and leave the store happy."
good,The working enviorment is great. Managers care about employees. great benefits
good,"A typical day at JC Penney's includes assisting customers, checking them out, cleaning the fitting rooms, and straightening the area you are assigned too. When its busy, the day goes by fast, when its not its very slow. I got along with all of my co-workers! Management was okay. The hardest part of the job I would say would probably be the dumb questions you get asked. It gets old after a while. The enjoyable part is you get a 25% discount ;)"
good,I was able to move up in the store level. The experience I earned was invaluble.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, and always busy."
good,JcPenney was a good place for first comers in the work place. I loved working retail and giving advice on how to dress people. Management was the worst part about the job. We had some young supervisors that thought and acted like they knew everything and more experienced management that didn't know how to treat their employees fairly.
good,"Retrieve messages, break down previous days work, make necessary comments in job, send e-mails if there was a problem with job to the appropriate people to have problems fixed.  Schedule jobs that have received complete. Schedule installer in a productive manner.  Self starter, no management in the area."
good,"Very fast paced, but comfortable environment. I learned to multitask and maintain patience in busy situations. "
good,"It was a great place to be employed. I enjoyed going to work knowing what was expected of me. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and doing my best to assist them. "
good,"very great company to work for"
good,Typical day is providing services to customers and making sure they are number one at all times. I learned to help and being helpful to someone who is having a bad day is great feeling. I have great hours and have great coworkers.
good,"Ability to maintain good relationship with the customers and staff to "
good,I enjoy working here. I am a morning person and I like to stay moving throughout the day. I work from 6:30am-2:00pm. The Hardest part of my job is trying to make different managers happy when each one of them want things done differently. The most enjoyable part is simply speaking with team members and coworkers all day.
good,Overall culture is good and people strive to do their best.  The pay and benefits are comparable to other big box retailers.  Salaried management work 50 -60 hours per week which can fluctuate dependent on several factors as it does with other retailers in the industry.
good,I enjoyed being a sales associate. This was my first official job. I LOVED IT
good,"I like the environment in the jewelry department. I was trained on the register Machine to be a professional cashier, how to greet the customers, listen to them what they need and asking a specific questions, starting providing the best product them fit them, or the best solution for the problem they need help with. Make them happy to go home, willing to come back again and make them talk to their friends about our best customer Service. I love the team I worked with they still my friends till now."
good,"I was in retail Loss Prevention Management for 12 years and 6 years in Logistics Loss Prevention Manager."
good,it was basically a routine job.  you come in get your batch of cards to pick from.  i liked all of the walking good exercise. management was good and appreciated.  co workers were fun it help the day go by. Wasn't a hard part of the job it was quite easy. Just doing your job you could socialize with each other as you worked it was great.
good,"Work kept me busy with signing, pricing, and interacting with customers.  I was sad to see the store close."
good,"Work the registers, assist customers, help people order from both catalog and online, also dealing with the status and any issues of orders, deal with both credit issues and issuing new credit applications. maintaining an appealing shopping environment through replenishment and merchandising"
good,The job was fun to work. I enjoyed everything about it. I have nothing bad to say about JCPenny.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a lot of standing and cashing out customers. Standing all day long was the hardest part of the job, but my co workers always made it fun and more enjoyable!"
good,Working for JCPenney has taught me a lot about the type of person I am in retail.  I have been working as an associate here after being a manager for a long time in specialty stores.  I learned how the chain of command is used a lot in larger stores and that team work is the only way to get it all done.  We all rely on each other to get the work done. The most difficult part of the job was all the changes that came about due to new leadership in the company.  Learning how to change your work structure on a daily basis was needed to get the job done.  The people where a lot of fun to work with which makes working there a pleasure.
good,"I enjoy going to work each day greeting my JCP family as well as the customers.  Bringing a smile to someones face, lifting their spirit whether it be a customer or your co-workers is a great feeling."
good,"A typical day at work required a lot of organizing clothes, and attending customers. Very good experience for a first time job, helps you become more organized and approach others in a well manner, also helps you open up your competitive side since you have a goal of selling credit cards daily. Everyone is friendly from your managers to your co-workers, they won't hesitate to help you and make accommodations to your schedule if you need it. Honestly, there wasn't anything hard about the job. Most enjoyable parts would be able to express yourself with customers as you give them your personal opinion on outfits, accessories or home decor to help them obtain a beyond pleasurable shopping experience."
good,"A typical day would be servicing your customers-weather that be doing thier hair, manicures, pedicures or waxing.  On down time there was light cleaning to do-washing, folding and gathering towels, sanitizing the combs and brushes.  There were also appointments that needed to be made and customer walk-ins."
good,"I would work at the cash registers and assist customers with their purchases. This is more of a place for high school students to work, as I was much older than most of my co-workers. Alot of the co-workers did not take their job seriously. There was a time when I needed management and it was an emergancy, and they were no where to be found. When I went to look for them they were all in the break room just talking."
good,"Customer Service was the main priority at J.C Penney. Learning customer service gave me a great understanding that will help me with any job dealing with customers, which I think I'm one of the best."
good,"I like to be a work every day"
good,"A struggling company is always interesting to work for."
good,Great place to work and get retail experience. The products are of good quality and the prices are reasonable. I was able to learn a lot about time management and customer service. My co-workers were fun and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was actually keeping the tables from being destroyed five minutes upon completion. The most enjoyable part was giving customers fashion tips and communicating with different cultures of people.
good,"First Job,Great management and coworkers wished i could have worked there longer"
good,"the 5ft 5sec rule is extreamly annoying for both employees and customers which, in my case happened to have 5 or 6 employees in the 2nd smallest department in the store, although my department was the most busy."
good,"Employees are nice, customers are happy, atmosphere is supportive, a great environment to be in and overall great place to work at as long as you don't mind large groups of people."
good,This was my very first employer.  I learned so much about the Corp world.  I got along well with everyone I worked with.
good,"Good company, that is reinventing themselves to the old fashioned Golden Rule created by founder James Cash Penney."
good,"Oversee the store as a whole as long as lead a department. Constantly merchandising to produce sales and working with a team of 8-10 associates and coaching them to higher expectations as long as teaching them about the business. Proper disciplinary action taken when needed. Team based job working together to keep the store running with little or no problems, working one on one with all team members. Getting to know associates and recognizing talent and seeing them suceed on to greater things."
good,"  Punch in and start detailing your department making sure everything is in proper departments. Assisting cutomers with purchases, finding items."
good,learned so much about clothes and different styles of clothing. 
good,"The management team was very supportive and often gave employees compliments for good work. The pay wasn't that great, but unfortunately, that's expected in retail. "
good,JCPenney is a good company that is going through a huge identity crisis in regards to merchandising and marketing direction.
good,"Typical day at work for me included multi-tasking phone calls, customers, and coworkers. I had to schedule appointments, assist customers with both salon service and salon product purchases. I had to file any and all paperwork pertaining to the customer. I also had to maintain cleanliness and order of the product shelves."
good,"I started out as a Customer Service Associate (sales person) so I was always in touch with every customer. I learned how to follow store department design charts to set up for each season, how to close a register, and at the end of my employment there, I learned how to do signage for each department for an upcoming sale and do markdowns. I loved my co-workers and my supervisors were good as well. "
good,"I would come into work and have people sitting around waiting for things to get started. I would unload the truck with them, but they seemed to be really slow about it. The hardest partof the job was probably the staff slacking, but the best part was helping the customers!"
good,Good Job the most enjoyable part of my job is doing visual displays
good,A typical work day is keeping the store neat and cleaned for customer to have a safe and great shopping experience. We have good team players that is willing to work in any area of the store. The hardest part of the job is lack of staffing.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney in Martinsburg, WV and would recommened others to work there. There was great managment and I believed that made all the difference."
good,"Working at JC Penneys I was able to meet a lot of interesting people. This job was never boring either. I worked in customer service which consist of merchandise purchasing, returns, catalog orders or credit card payments. Also assisting customers with concerns."
good,"excellent job with great potential for progress, but I had to leave for the birth of my baby because I had no one to leave."
good,"JCPenney was a very demanding and extremely fast paced place to work. As is the nature of retail, tasks were many and deadlines were back to back. I enjoyed my job there, and received many promotions in the years I was there, ending as Division Manager. I was seeking opportunity for advancement within the company, but I was no longer able to continue working occasional night shifts."
good,What I liked most about the company\management is that they really care! aside from that your working at the mall and getting discounts! the only bad part is dealing with wacky customers who basically want things for free!
good,Great place to work just alot of changes in a littletime frame!
good,"Overall a good place to work. Always provided different type of jobs. Unloading/loading trucks,loading furniture into custmer vehicles. Always something to do and fast paced. Also had the use of driving a forklift. Many different things to do making it a fun job."
good,"I worked for JC penney for almost 4 years it's a good company and they give employees a 25% discount which is excellent. Flaws are in their system as far as management but they are a good company nonetheless. a typical day consist of getting the store ready for consumers and assisting them in various parts of the store. Most enjoyable public,"
good,"Only issue i had was with management, i was moving away for school and really wanted to keep my job because i needed it to help pay my tuition... i was told they would try and transfer or speak to management at the store closest to my new address but they never did anything."
good,cashier
good,"Sales/customer service. Working with the public, opening charge accounts, putting out new inventory."
good,"what i have learned so far from working for my past two jobs is never let your personal life interfere with your work ability. A typical day at work is providing the best customer service i possibly can so that i will make customers come back again and again. the hardest part of my job is knowing that you cant make every customer happy. What i enjoy most about my job is the ineraction with different kinds of people, developement of good customer skills, and how i am able to share and hear ideas and be of good service to others."
good,It's a faced pace environment and customer service is key. I learned the best avenues in customer service. Management was helpful at all times. The hardest part of the job was being sure to write down any needs of the customers that we couldn't meet at any given period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with a diverse group each shift.
good,great place to work love management as well as all the stylist/staff
good,"Opening the studio, photographing and scheduling appointments, doing pick ups.. I love meeting and photographing the new customer that come to the studio."
good,"J.C. Penney is a great company to work for. The environment is relaxed and fun. Anytime we as a team exceeded or achieved any accomplishments we would always celebrate by having some kind of party. As having any job there where good days and bad days but I could say that the good out weighted the bad. The hardest part of my job is sometimes having to deal with customers frustration. By me being understanding and compassionate, I was able to turn their frown upside down."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, I got along well with everyone. It was nice to talk to customers and be able to help them with their purchases. Although I like working with the visual team after the store closed to get ready for the new sales and displays. There was nothing hard about this job, easy and fun"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. An average work day went by pretty fast. My co-workers were great and wish that I would have been able to stay past the seasonal.
good,"JCPenney was great company to work for. It was fun and lively, the benefits were good and they really worked with you if you have or had a family. However, with the new CEO the company has taken a turn for the worse. Ron Johnson ruined JCPenney"
good,"I liked my job at first. It was fun helping people pick gifts or find the right size bra. I enjoyed the people I worked with in my department, and i liked my supervisors."
good,"Everyday is usually fast-paced. You learn a lot about retail and how to handle your job. They do great training. The management is very good. They have a manager for every section of the store and handle their own separate schedules. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Although, they weren't very understanding about time off."
good,I enjoy working with my customers. I have established some life long friends with my co workers and customers. Every day I am learning new things. The managers are great if you should have any problems or questions they are quick to assist.
good,Unload the truck and scan then brek it down and cleanup before we take it to the floor thenput it away and help customer out if they need help and pricing and build displays for the floor if needed.And what I learned working for jcpenney just a good place to work and we have very o
good,"had friends who worked there with me, managers were friendly and flexible with hours which accommodated my school schedule."
good,A typical day at work would be busy but exciting. I learned how to keep a leveled head even when customers would sometimes get out hand. My co-workers were amazingly loving. They welcomed me almost instantly. I can honestly say that I fond nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was watching the smiles on the customers faces once they were greeted and served by me.
good,black friday
good,"Fun environment, very productive, and ever changing. There are daily goal to complete."
good,Fold Clothes
good,"The Store Manager was asked to retire, at the time of my employment, due to sexual harassment charges over 25 years of his service. As for the co-workers, most managers were wonderful to work with. The most dificult part of the manager postion was getting ready for new ads and pricing. There was no assistance or credit if you continued your education. The most difficult part of my job learnign the position all on 'my own'. There was no assistance of any structural means."
good,"Many advancement opportunities for full and part-time employees, flexible hours, great co-workers and managers"
good,"I love working for JCPenney as a Loss Prevention officer. I was always on time, I was very good at what I do, I was honest, on till I was called upstairs to the manager office, and I was asked to write a report on an incident. I wrote the report which was the truth and I gave it to the store manager. They did not want to hear the truth, so I was asked to rewrite the report and I was told what to put in the report to keep my job, so I did, because I did not want to lose my job. The next day I came to work, I was told the reports are not the same, so I must be lying and I was fired. I did not violate any company policy. I have an idea why I was fired, but it is between me and JCPenney. JCPenney is a great company to work for, only if you get the right Store manager that cares about the employees who work for JCPenney."
good,Co-workers always wiling to help. Managers/supervisors were informative and stern on what their expectations were to strive employees to perform their best.
good,"Fold clothes, help customer, fold clothes, empty fitting room, fold clothes, run from one end of the store to another to deliver catalog order, fold clothes."
good,Any retail job is hard. This was a great learning position. JCP had a clear set of rules for people to follow and I appreciated that. Most of the hours were self-selected and only got busy during the holidays. Hardest thing was closing the stores because this position stayed until the manager left. Nicest thing was learning more about the store in this position because it had more access to store information.
good,Coworkers were friendly. Management wasnt so good but still tried to do their best.
good,"During a typical day, I would delegate a few responsibilites to my sales associates and I would touch up the floor plans and visual merchandising. I would also handle returns and exchanges and some loss prevention. Once again, I never had any problems with my colleagues because I attempted to be as fair and understanding as possible while sticking to the rules and avoiding favoritism. Without a doubt, the most difficult part of the job was handling a massive influx of customers during the holidays, but at the same time getting to know our customers was a favorite aspect of the job for me."
good,"very good place to work, learned to work in a variety of labs. lots of interesting procedures to learn. management was very good and i had great co-workers. the hardest part was when 70% of us got laid off due to incompetence by management at coorporate. also, the complete and total lack of common sense displayed by coorporate. you do not reward people for failure which they did at the coorporate level, which in turn, cost the lab people our jobs."
good,Good first job. Willing to train beyond current job descriptions. Corporate job advancements.
good,"I worked there for a very limited time during the winter of 2010. It was a seasonal position and the work was great. Good hours, nice co-workers, nice manager. Not much to complain about"
good,JCPenney taught me a lot about leadership and work ethics.
good,Extremely busy during the holidays. Low pay. Not enough hours.
good,I have been very fortunate to have a long career with this company.
good,JCP has been a good employer for a part time position. Schedule flexablilty has been exceptional. Management and co-workers have been great. Customers can be difficult at times. Co-workers and friendly people.
good,"Typical day consisted of opening the store,cashroom and cashroom safes. Then distributing money to all registers. After that I would walk the store to make sure all signing was set for the store to open. I would mark clearance and make signs throughout the day to maintain excellent customer service,"
good,"I work on the team that does all the re-ticekting for the store/ pricing. Also im the one who helps move the store around when we have new floor plans each month/week. I love the accomplishment i get from the finished product of our moves and rearranging things. I dont like working all nights, sometimes late nights. I love my co-workers and my managers."
good,"A typical day is providing excellant customer service, maintaining clean work space, referrals, maintaing cash wrap, and maintaining merchandise presentation"
good,"I really enjoyed working at the JCPenny Portrait Studio because I gained knowledge of another skill, Photography. I also got the pleasure of taking pictures of children, new mothers, newlyweds, and families. Photography gives you the opportunity to create lasting memories for your customer. My fellow employees were fantastic, as well, and always had positive attitude, even during the holidays when we were packed and all booked up. Loved this job!!!"
good,ability to give good customer service; management are friendly; hardest part of job is not enough employees working to take care of all the customers. Most rewarding of all is being able to help the customers.
good,"I worked fro JCPenney for 22 yrs. and was happy most of the time. As with most companies there was constant change. As they large layoffs came within the company, I was caught in it. But I was given a 5 week advanced notice and a severance package. This shows that this company cares about their associates and doesn't just leave them in the dark,"
good,"I started out as switchboard operator with office duties for 10 years and then the last 10 years I was moved to the busy salon with 40 hairstylists. I answered the phone, booked appointments, transferred calls to different departments, overhead paged associates. I rang up customers and printed reports."
good,"My internship at FIDM was the start of my career in fashion. The office was small so it allowed me to work with the designer and assistant designer, attend fittings, and create visions boards for future deliveries."
good,"Enjoy the daily work. Always something to do. Great co-workers, and a healthy work culture. Learned how to work hard and improve on basic work principles."
good,"Going to the juniors department and assisting with purchases, production information, upcoming sales, checkouts, and credit applications. The management was fine until everything started changing then things got hectic and confusing with who was suppose to be the manager on duty. The hardest part was cleaning; no matter how much you cleaned after a few minutes it would be messy again. Getting to met new people and see the different culture they belong was extremely enjoyable and rewarding."
good,"SC consistiing of 26 facilities at 18 locations across the US. Total facility footprint of 16 million sq ft. Processing 1 billion units annually. In support of stores, ecommerce, in-store pickup (apparel, footwear, Sephora, fine jewelry, salons, furniture / home)."
good,"I enjoyed working at this store. The employees were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed assisting customers with their everyday needs, but after a month or two, I decided that I didn't want to work in retail for the rest of my life and that it would be best if I were to further my education. This is the reason I went back to school."

good,"Typical day, clock in, go to the women's department, operate point of sales, fold clothes, assist customers, check and clean dressing rooms. I learned how to deal with different personalities. The manager of my department was very short and sarcastic, which in my opinion isn't very professional. My coworkers were very rude, since I was seasonal I was often unfamiliar with certain formalities and would ask for assistance. At which point I was met with rolling eyes, huffs and puffs, etc. There was nothing hard or enjoyable about this job."
good,"Traveled to clients homes, took measurements, selected patterns and fabrics for custom window treatments."
good,"I worked at JCP for almost 2 years, and it was a great experience all the way around. I would still be working there now hoping to retire from the company at the appropriate age, if not for job consolidation due to restructure."
good,"During my experience with this company, I had a lot of fun meeting new people and helping them find what they needed from the store. Management for the most part was very helpful in providing solutions to problems."
good,"I love my team mates and customers. Some days a customer will have it bad days, I try to satisfy their need, and go out of the way, just to make them happy. We have customer who need to talk to supervisor, they get busy engaging with other customers, we would try to ask what is the problem, if we can solve it, we will always try to solve some small and simple stuff. I work great with everyone including management. The most enjoyable part of my job is to serve the customer, by putting a smile on their faces when they leave the store. Nothing is too hard for me, as long as I work hard. I have lot of customer come back to visit, just because I gave them great customer service."
good,Working at JC Penney has been very beneficial. I've learned a lot about myself and others. My customer service skills were greatly developed here.
good,"good peple to work with, fair environment,likeable managers."
good,"JC Penney offered an exstensive training program. The job was always changing from month to month with exciting new themes. I managed every process from when we received the merch to placement, atmosphere of the store and it's markcustomer service enviroment by managing the floor daily operations. All of the operations were executed with in payroll budget as well. The hardest part of the job was also my favorite... the challange of creating an exciting enviroment for the customers by changing the ""theme"" every downs. As well as always ensuring a GREAT month. We ""revealed"" a new theme on the fist day of every month. The store was fresh and new!"
good,"Great place to meet people and learn about how customers reactions. Helping the customers,giving great service and knowing what the customers want. I met alot a good friends my co-workers. Being on the pricing team was alot of stress to get the ads and markdowns and markups and sometimes it felt the managers were not on our side."
good,"Great coworkers, fun place to work"
good,"a typical day is when you walked in the building you would receive freight and bin merchandise. Then go to the sales floor and make sure everything is filled for associates(credit vouchers,gift cards etc.)"
good,"This job consisted of gathering data from the previous day's activities and strategizing on how to improve, correct, or build on that information. The primary responsibilities were to hire, grow, and lead a team of associates to deliver exceptional customer service on a daily basis while assembling and maintaining a professional visual presentation to the customer and, thusly, upper management. There would also have to be a preparedness and readiness on any given day to assume the full weight and responsibilities of managing the entirety of the store itself."
good,"I started out as a temporary associate and within 6 months I was a department supervisor. The company always treated its associates well, and for the most part, put them first. They had several programs in place to help associates out. One example of this was an associate relief fund that helped associates in time of disasters. When Hurricane Ike tore through our city, the associate relief fund helped several associates and were loads faster and more helpful than FEMA."
good,Wonderful people and a great call center focused on providing a positive and friendly customer experience. The management team was supportive and I really enjoyed learning about the supply chain in retail and support of the customers throughout the process.
good,"I took care of all the problem freight cartons which had to be sorted and relabeled. I corrected problem pallets in the unisort area on 2nd shift with a protable computer. I also scanned problem cartons to the right lanes with an RF gun. The unisort area is where all the cartons are sorted to each store, I was also the backup lead for the garment detrash area and the unisort department when needed."
good,I enjoy working with customers with their appearance. I learned to be a better hair stylist with all the additional trainings provided by JCPenney. I believe that every manager should be fair and willing to be proactive when concerns needs to be addressed. The hardest part is you can do your best and you cant please everyone. I love creating makeover styles. It is rewarding to turn a customer around to the mirror and change their lives due to the way they feel about themselves.
good,Challenging work with talented co-workers. Project intensive workload.
good,I would handle customer carry-outs and set up fixtures for the store. I learned how to work a cash register and re-stock merchandise. The managers and co-workers were all really positive and professional. I would say the hardest part is having to move fixtures alone and the part i liked most was helping customers
good,love this warehouse always have work available for the willing to work people . just not a very steady job opportunity.
good,Management here is great and so were my co workers as well. The environment was fun and busy with plenty of work to do most of the time.
good,I had trouble readon screen script while taking phone orders therefore I excused myself first. They gave me a chance is all I could ask.
good,"Great place for young people, but coming into retail later in life, difficult to make a living."
good,"I honestly loved every bit of my part-time experience with the jc penney's family. I was able to learn new things, and not limit myself; I was also given the opportunity to climb the coorporate ladder which is alway a plus in my book."
good,"I love the fact that they reward you for your effors, and its a fun place to work."
good,"When I joined the company, I was pleased to find the positive culture and values that were encouraged."
good,"Working here at JC Penny has been very rewarding. Especially,"
good,"My one issue is how important getting someone to sign up for a credit card is,  the more you get the more you’re scheduled which I don’t think is fair."
good,Comfortable work setting with others. Learning customer service with management and peers who made me feel welcome when I first started. The hardest part was having to stand for long periods of time throughout the shift but overall wasn't too bad as long as you invest in some comfortable work appropriate shoes. The employee discount and knowing when the coupons and sales were going on was a nice bonus.
good,"Hardest part of the job was during ""peak"" handling calls with about 3 seconds between all calls."
good,Iloved working here. this job was one of my favorites. i learned a lot about hair that i didnt know. it also almost convinced me to get a degree in cosmotology.
good,"Payment is quite low for me to sustain me. While going to collage and working in a low wage is not enough for me to pay fee. Also I am a certified Nursing assistant, I am going to school for Nursing. I am trying to find a job that is helpful for my career."
good,Everything was great working at JCPenney’s. I loved the environment and the coworkers. They worked with me and me still being in school. Very flexible hours
good,Pretty inclusive environment with diverse employees.comfortable break setting and nice coworkers. Snack machine available if hungry when on your breaks.
good,"The job is not challenging at all. Although there are some skills to learn on the register and learn about customer service, it is fairly easy enough to learn the basics. JCPenney is a diverse location where everyone is welcomed."
good,"JCPenney is a typical retail store to work at. You come into work, day in and day out helping customers find specific needs in the store and keep your work area clean and tidy. It may be stressful at times when lines get long but nothing at this job is too overwhelming."
good,JCPenny is a home environment that allows their workers to feel accomplished and is able to treat their costumers well. They had flexible work hours and always had a project for us employees to do.
good,"great team, management, training. the management is willing to work with your schedule and are understanding. i enjoy working for the company. the work environment is very friendly"
good,"Employed 18 years at JCP. Begin as a clerk &, within couple years, was given an opportunity to work as the store's sales auditor. Thereafter, promoted to Sr. Management Assistant. I loved meeting new people and assisting my customers. Worked with a great group of employees in my various departments of supervision. The pay, medical benefits, 401k, & other "
good,JcPenny is a great company to work for. If you apply yourself you can advance within this company. The key is to MAKE THE SALE and BE EAGER DOING IT! Management will take notice and help you to step up within this company.
good,If you are in school JCP is a great place to work. They have a good team and a store manager who cares. They will do there best to make sure you feel at home.
good,We were able to have a lot of fun at JCPennney. We dressed and was involved with every holiday of the year.Everyone participated. Had potlucks all the time. We also worked very hard to achieve all our goals for the day.
good,"I started at JCPenney for my first job and would've been okay if it were my last. On a typical day as a starting associate, you're normally placed at a recovery position or a register to learn the basics of recovery or customer service. JCP makes it very easy to move positions if you show your interest in doing so. During my time with JCPenney, I moved positions 9 times in total, but that is not required if you are one who likes to stick to the same spot. Throughout the skills that I acquired in those many positions, I was trained enough to become a Supervisor. A normal day for an Operations Supervisor is to oversee the backend functions of the store, which may include the cashroom, stockroom, etc. and would consist of weekly tasks such as price markdowns, MTO (Merchandise Transfers), and many other tasks that would keep the store orderly."
good,"Interesting to work there, fast paced most of the time, very customer friendly. However, the hours were inconsistent. Mostly restocking the clothing and helping customers check out."
good,"The job itself was pretty easy, but there are always some issues with frustrated customers and sometimes rude ones. It was challenging but it taught me ways to approach them in respectful and as helpful ways as I possibly could."
good,Honestly loved working for them but management made it very difficult to stay around. Because of my religious beliefs I asked for Saturday’s off to attend services and it took me about 4 months of working for them to finally work something out. When holiday season hit they asked me to work 3 Saturdays a month instead of one and we agreed it would only be for the holiday season. They never switched it back
good,"The diversity of customers allowed you to see different views of life. I've learned to connect with customers, whether it be something simple or complicatded"
good,I worked in a lot of different departments and found the floor supervisors really helpful and friendly. The store I worked in has a good team that works well together and is very supportive of their staff.
good,"I worked part time, it worked with my schedule the hours were flexible for me. Manager was great to work with, most employees are great people to work with."
good,"JC Penney is an above average company to work for. The building is getting run down, maintenance could improve (for example, it used to be better lit outside) and the pay could be better."
good,Bittersweet time at a good place to work..i enjoyed my time working there. The competitive atmosphere helped me be more driven and confident..eeven in my everyday life..THANKS JCPENNEY
good,"•	Support the Store manager in general business operations, cooperate conference calls, merchandise management, and personnel scheduling. "
good,"I do not get paid enough, this company is a very good company. The management could be better. This is a job for someone who is going to school. Other then the pay I dont mind working here."
good,JC Penney was a good place to work with good benefits until major changes were made within the company .. high rate of turnover among associates and management ..
good,"Good place to work. Fair wages based on experience and managers that were kind and helpful throughout the work day. No fear in asking questions, even multiple times to be sure."
good,I worked in the salon. I went to a beauty school and had to go threw multiple test to even get my cosmetology license. That cost a lot of money. They only payed me $8 an hour. And was barley getting 35 hours a week. The people and management are amazing people that I still love. But I couldn’t take the low pay and stupid customers (customers you’ll get anywhere though).
good,"Mainly a walk-in clientele due to it being a tourism area. However, being that the mall was big it gave you as a stylist the opportunity to walk up to people and them become your potential client."
good,Seaonal employment throughout the holiday season .....Very busy enviroment steady paste organized and professional my responibilty  and duties included presenting merchadise for sale.......
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Penney's as there visiual manager had great bosses and felt very valued. "
good,"my time at jcpenney was overall fine. there are ups and downs but its basically exactly what you would expect working there would be like, ring people up, organize stock, clean after closing."
good,"Everyday we had to ask customers if they wanted to sign up for a store credit card. It was annoying because our managers pressured us into doing so. It was mostly a competition. But other than that, it's a fun place to work"
good,I liked working at the JCPenny salon. I had to leave because of family obligations. I would recommend working there. My sales associates were very nice and the management was great.
good,Excellent company culture.  They preach servant leadership and back up the talk.  Great people who love their jobs.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for work/life balance and a job they look forward to going to each day.
good,"Overall my experience was really good, but the higher up management has too high of expectations sometimes for the Jewelry department. The lower management is really nice though."
good,"Very friendly environment, great management with positive attitude. Fast paced but well organized. Other employees problematic but avoidable. With understanding and flexible hours."
good,"Like taking care of the customers. I sold Jewelry , opened and closed the Jewelry  Department.  Enjoyed helping  customers choose items for their loved ones."
good,I started off good getting up the ranks fairly quickly then it just stopped. I've been asking to be cross trained and they said they would but I'm still waiting and it's been months.
good,not a place for job advancement AT ALL. management never knows what theyre doing. and employee appreciation is a joke. They make you push the credit card and if you dont get enough they cut your hours
good,Everyday was a full hands on deck type of day. Maintaining each department and helping out at the registers are extremely important regardless in which department our in. Fitting rooms had to always be maintained although it does has it's days that it can be extremely crazy and hard to maintain when they would normally only put two people in the fitting rooms. C-racks have to get done throughout the day while keeping an eye on your other responsibilities. I was put in Juniors but I would always be called to helped in other departments and also to translate. You definitely have to work as a team and be respectful and responsible in order to work in JCPenney.
good,"Working at JCPenney was fun at first, and learning how to handle money was easier than I thought. Only trouble I had was with difficult customers, but in the end a good beginner job."
good,"This company works well with students, the benefits could have been better for a part time employee, basically nothing if your hours are irregular, but the atmosphere was good and the management pleasant."
good,The work environment was nice and they have a pretty flexible schedule. The managers were pretty nice for the most part. The general manager was great.
good,"For the most part, working there was real easy-going. There was a lot of teamwork that came into play no matter what your position was, and the environment was chill and relaxed."
good,"Upper management was great.  Break room provided a lot of room for relaxation and places to store food. store benefits were really good. Customers were always touch and go, but coworkers made things fun."
good,I worked this job seasonal for the holiday season it was great they provided food and breaks for their employees. The managers were fair and fun. They tried their best to do for the employees
good,"I had great relationships with the staff.  Only downside was lack of training when I first started.  I was only trained for 3 hours, then expected to work a busy Saturday by myself.  That was very stressful, but I got through it and it got better from there."
good,"This was a summer job in 2013, before I went back to college. The job was fun. They frequently do have meetings, which is good, to make sure that the employees are up to date on the things that is going on. I also liked how the managers during that time seem to be personable. However the down size is that they try to “encourage” their employees to get a JCPenny credit card. They wanted to meet a quota or to try to have large amount of credit card applicants. I was asked on numerous times. Once someone continued to ask me after I said no."
good,Overall pretty good place to work and grow in your friend of expertise. Managers and coworkers are helpful and motivating and help get you started in the right direction.
good,Some days would drag on but others would have a constant rush of people coming to the checkout line. I actually preferred the busy days because it would make the time go by faster. Sometimes the customers were hard to deal with but the manager took care of them.
good,"I love my job, but the company changes policies without notifcation being jcp iis in the red, I don't know what expect I have been there almost 5 years and been under 4 store managers"
good,"I had a good experience working at Pennys. My coworkers were helpful and my manager was very good at her job. Working the floor was nice, and helping the customers at the register was always fulfilling."
good,JCPenneys has a lovely environment . Sometimes really busy but quick work flow. I learned time management and how to have  good work ethics. The hardest part of the job was the competition. You were basically competing with others for the job which was really difficult
good,"Jcp is a decent job, but are very strict when it comes to attendance. Which wasn’t an issue but was difficult to manage when it was time for breaks, because the lunch room would be so full that it was impossible to get out of there and back from break on time"
good,"Everyday I took furniture escalation calls, I didn't have much help & played each phone call by ear, the ceo quit, managers quit, coaches were younger people who lacked people skills, it was the hardest but most rewarding role I have ever had in customer service, the company is declining and a lot of customers were unsatisfied. Due to the lack of employess overtime was ridiculous. I literally missed almost 3 years of my daughter's life.. Great pay but I wouldn't recommend any single parents to work there."
good,"I love the people I work with. They definitely make the job worthwhile.There is always something new with my job at the Jewelry counter, it's never the same thing everyday."
good,"Typical work day is 4-5 hours. Associates are friendly and workplace culture is competitive and encouraging each day. Have learned that importance of communication for all areas of work, getting work goals done as efficiently and effectively as possible. Management is open to concerns and holding work meetings each month with each departments associates. Hardest part of the job is effective communication between different departments. Most enjoyable part of the job is making sure the customers needs are met."
good,The people at work were pretty cool. The managers there were pretty laid-back and cool too. But it sometimes got to be to much for me and I would get behind on my work because I was the only person working that fitting room.
good,"the people I work with are the best and they are the ones who make me think of staying there "
good,Working at JCPenney allowed me to learn how to work with the public in a fast paced retail industry. A typical day at work consisted of ringing people out and making sure the store was in good order. I learned how to balance the stress of retail while going to school full time. The hardest part of the job was making every customer happy and making sure the store was tidy. The most enjoyable was the coworkers and the hard work I was able to accomplish.
good,"JC Penneys was a great place to run a salon. The challenges of working in a solon within retail location made it difficult to balance personal time with work time.  There was room for advancement in retail, but I wanted to work more closely with individuals"
good,I would go to work and do whatever was not finished the night before. The areas that I worked tended to be unorganized but they were also the heavily shopped areas of the store. My manager was very time sensitive when it came to doing tasks and if a task was not finished on time we were rushed to finish it.
good,"Works around schedules and school"
good,I really enjoyed my time at JC Penney. Working in a call center was a new experience for me and they did a great job making me feel comfortable. Management was amazing.
good,Retail is retail; you make what you want out of it. It has been ten years so I think a lot has probably changed. Just keep working and if you want to move up you will.
good,Came into this job with no previous experience but looking for a new opportunity. The fast pace took a little getting use to but it was do able. Working as a team I was able to eventually discover all what the job requires. I got a great team to work with and they are very encouraging to everyone's skills and learning process. The job was a little stressful to start with but my great team helped me finally get the hang of thing's. There are many jobs that we do throughout the week and each one is nearly completely different. learning each job effectively and quickly is a real challenge that we face as a team to better our store and company.
good,"JCPenney is a fun place to work, the managers are pretty laid back, except when it comes to making credit. They are very flexible with hours and are able to work around your schedules."
good,"Incredible coworkers, great advancement opportunities. Stressful as any job that is fast paced. Some issues with communication. Loved working here wish they didn't close."
good,Great job for anyone getting into the workforce or wanting to advance. Learned many valuable person skills and how to complete team weekly/monthly goals.
good,When I worked there I had good benifits flexibile hours. Everyone was kind and helpful. I was properly trained. There was profit sharing and stock options to invest in.
good,Good company to work for. Good people and opportunity to work and still have outside life.  I wish I still worked there sometimes.  JCP has some of the best prices and best quality products also.
good,I enjoyed my time at JCP. I would continue to work there part time if my schedule would allow it. The co workers are great. Team work and building was positive.
good,"The only problem is you have to get people to sign up for credit cards , I tried.  really hard but couldn't get enough so that's why I wasn't  kept after Christmas. ( But all you can do is ask, if they say no there's nothing you can do )"
good,"There was a lot of putting out fires with customer complaints. Promoting events with inferior product. "
good,"Busy waves while cashiering .Helpful associateswhen you needed help.It's a great first job that i recomend for everyone.co- workers all helped eachother out and i would call it a ""Family"""
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time at JC Penny as it was an excellent atmosphere for a young person like myself to develop more interpersonal and customer service skills. As a sales rep, I learned a lot about how to work with customers to provide them with the best shopping experience possible. This meant I had to be very outgoing , inquisitive, and attentive to each individual person's needs and goals. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was knowing you helped make someone's day easier by assisting them and finding them the best deal on their merchandise. Working with the customers was enjoyable but sometimes came with difficulties, especially when they had very large orders or were looking for an item that we did not have in stock, requiring the rep to search and call several other stores for its availability. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up your number of credit card applications as you are required to make company goals by signing up as many people as you could for a new JC Penny card. This was not incredibly difficult but it felt as though you were constantly being pressured into selling credit to customers which understandably could be annoying for them on occasion.  Managers were very helpful when it came to solving problems and answering question but would constantly be checking in on you to make sure you were keeping up with your credit app numbers. Reps that achieved a certain number of applications in a day were rewarded by management with small incentives like receiving a small amount of cash, from 2-5$ along with tickets that could be saved up to get money"
good,"You learn quick on your feet, you learn how people work an dhow to make them happy by providing the best service possible. Hardest part of it are the credit application quotas and how hard they push them"
good,"Coming to work with a smile on my face. Helping otbers, and trained others. I loved doing my job as a JCPenney warehouse Worker. I was a hard worker at JCPenneys."
good,Jcpenney is a diverse equal opportunity employer that incorporates a modern and welcoming environment for both employees and customers. I was able to balance work and school and gain many skills that is beneficial for a now quick paced and technical workforce.
good,"Cashier for customers. help search online for online purchases. help customers get fitted in suits. recovery for miscellaneous clothes. put clothes back in proper Isles maintain cleanliness, and great customer service"
good,"Over all family friendly, work atmosphere is okay,  it’s low in sales in custom decorating, less hours right now, no free lunches and no snacks, holidays they feed people, discount to associates, they match 5 percent of 401k, fair benefits. Offer Healthcare,  vision, dental, life insurance, and stock."
good,JCPenney is a great job for someone looking to work in a warehouse. They have plenty of benifits and offer a lot of overtime. I was a seasonal employee and in all enjoyed my time there. I would definitely recommend to anyone eager to be in a warehouse position.
good,"From the moment you clocked in, you have to walk through a set route through the store, making sure everything is neat. On busy days, it was a lot simpler because the workload increased. Management was constantly involved with their workers. The hardest part of the job was changing the way I folded clothes. The most enjoyable part of the job was being on a 15 minute break half way through the work day."
good,Its a good for now job especially if you're a student who just needs extra cash. Management was nice. It definitely had a family vibe to it. I was a seasonal hire for a pretty long time and  I enjoyed it.
good,"JC-Penny is a great place to work, you can pick your schedule, shift .... They also offer good benifits, with an option of 401K. The beginning wage is good as well."
good,"This place is somewhere I would like to work again.  It has a very casual working environment.  Drees code is as casual as a t-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, or you can dress up as much as you want to.  This is the right place to work if you like challenges and solving problems for customers.  The working environment is wonderful.  You have a coach to report to but there are multiple other coaches or supervisors that are always walking around to help you with any question that you might have or if you just need assurance that you are doing what you are supposed to be doing and doing it correctly."
good,Working the holidays with Jcpennies was a lot of fun from building displays to tearing them down and building them back up. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job.
good,the hrs are not consistent and the pay is low. you work hard and your not rewarded as you should in terms of the pay.. but the environment and the ppl that work there make it beneficial
good,"I'm not necessarily sure how you want me to rate this job, since I was fired for a ridiculous issue.  I was given full permission from my mother to use those points."
good,"This was my favorite job to work at. I have worked all over the store but the Salon was much better in my opinion. We were our own team and as a receptionist, we had to collaborate with the stylists when it came to their appointments. The stylists were all awesome and so were my fellow receptionists. I just wish the pay was better because this was almost the perfect job for someone like me."
good,Great management with corporate issues that need technological funding and training for new hires with no job history or skills in retail or customer service.
good,On a typical day at work I clean the dressing rooms and put away the clothes.  I greet customers and ring sales on register. At times the lines get very long.  Management will step in to help.  I have to constantly straighten the floor if not busy ringing sales.  I process new credit card applications.
good,"After several CEO changes, the company became less and less concerned about the employees and more concerned about making money.  More and more benefits were being taken away from us."
good,They have staff that has been there a really long time and they alway trump the new employees I was told I would be kept after holidays and that didn’t happen !!
good,"I enjoyed being busy. My trainer was very cool. My manager always had her door open to talk. This location was close to home so that was a plus. Overall, this would be a good job for college age or new beginners"
good,The job is boring and very slow. Customers can be rude but its not the hardest job in the world to do. If you're looking for an okay start............
good,JcPenny was a great job to have. It is a retail store so you do get the crazies out there. Not just customers but a few employees as well. But that is every job.
good,"This was not only my first job but also my favorite job I have ever worked, due to a sad misunderstanding the job came to an end. I worked in the men's accessories department (suits, ties, tuxes, dress shirts etc) as my trained department, after that was easily mastered I was sent to work in the Levis department (Jeans etc) and the left over men's departments (Sports, casual etc) Management was fairly decent but there was a lot they didn't teach you nor did your appointed mentor teach you, often you were left alone with barely any idea how to manage things. Hardest part was not having any idea what to do during rushes or when no one was around and everything looked spotless, though when people finally showed up to help out you were kindly explained how things worked, always kind staff never any anger shown in this work environment. The best part of the job would have to be how at home and relaxed this job feels, I always looked forward to working here, every shift."
good,"its been great, the people are great and ive had alot of fun there. its a great place for very good quality photos, id recommend anyone there. i love my managers they are wonderful."
good,Busy but a lot fun. Meet different people and the regular customers you get to know one another and develop a rapport sometime on a first name basis. Pay is based on hourly rate and commission so the commission helps a great deal.
good,"It was an cool job, it gave a lot of hours. But there was a lot of turnover in the time period I worked there. It is a job where you just ,ight go home and your feet are killing you. And you really have to have good customer service and hospitality."
good,"Very few holidays allowed to spend with your family.  Great place to work as long as you don’t expect to have many Holidays with your family.  Staging set plans is a must, good eye for detail is a must."
good,"Penny's is all about their people! They help their own, and look out for their own! It's relaxed, and they work with you. It's truly an enjoyable place to work!"
good,There was a lot of favoritism in the store i worked at. I you were 30 or older you mine as well hang it up because they only offer full time positions to the teenagers so they can groom them. I worked hard to get where i was and was doing the job of 5 people and hardly ever got any appreciation for it. But i did learn alot from working there.
good,"while working at Jcpenneys I meet a lot of good people who were my co works and soon friends. the hours were not to my satisfaction, and around the time I got my pay check it clear the hours were not enough"
good,"Its a great entry level sales position. If you're not familiar with the position of a sales person this is a great start. Your goals are to show people to the area their looking for, a little bit of side work, but the main goal is to get people to sign up for the rewards program and sign up for a credit card."
good,I enjoyed my time there management was very helpful all employees worked well together as a team system was easy to use shifts were flexible discounts were awesome
good,Day to day isn't to bad. You'll get really rude and dumb customers from time to time but its not so bad. Management tries to be there for you as much as possible. The only negative thing is that you can't really advance/move up or get enough hours. The holidays is the best to get more hours but it's a lot take in if you don't have retail experience because it gets hectic.
good,We would always have a meeting & stretch to start the shift at JCP. I would get my tickets that I had to pick & pick out a tugger to do my job. The hardest part of the job was being there at 5 am four times a week.
good,its  a good place to work at the people are friendly everyone gets along well but there is no growth within the company so it makes it hard to progress.
good,"Co-workers are friendly and help cover each others shifts.  The management is concerned about the workers and are always asking if they need help,  Jobs can vary per day so it is not tedious.  Always new customers to great and help."
good,working at JCPenney wasn't too bad. it was kind of fun with lots of stuff to do. It kind of reminded me of going back to high school because of how the employees acted. It was very repetitive but also had days that were different.
good,Eight hour work day. Very stressful to meet sales and credit goals.Company is not doing well as far as stores. On line is doing well. Management is good.
good,JCP was my first job ever and they were very willing to work around my school schedule. The managers were the sweetest and the other associates were very kind and helpful.
good,Working at JCP is eye opening in some regards. It is incredible that the company still have employees work off of computers that are from the late 90s and still expect progress. The branch I worked for had a great manager! The leadership after that was mediocre at best.
good,"A typical day at work. Over view the schedule for the day, if there was a truck delivery it would be very early before the store opened. Get team together go over the hours budgeted for this delivery and set our goal for the day. Set up new sets on the sales floor and stock the sales floor. I would record our shipments and send out any catalog returns or jewelry repairs file and record them. Check my email to see if anything was recalled or asked to be pulled from the sales floor and send back. Help with upcoming sales and price changes."
good,JC Penney was a good place to work while I was studying. They were very flexible in their schedule. The manager was very enthusiastic and detail oriented.
good,No comments. The job was sufficient for what I needed. I was hired part time and the hours were favorable for me. This is the 2nd time that I was laid off.
good,Sales targets reasonable. Ability to handle difficult customers. Responsive management to employee issues and help with difficult situations. Good team environment.
good,"I worked during summer and during winter break and loved it. I think it was a very fun job and I was able to learn a lot from it. Very nice people and very laid back although, we always got things done and valued our customers"
good,I enjoyed my time at JCPenney. The pay was good and the people were very nice and accepting. I enjoyed the work and learned some new technologies that should help me in future work endeavors
good,Being in the mall environment was exciting! There were always customers browsing and enjoying themselves while they shopped for deals and discounts that they couldn't resist!
good,Very nice place to work for and the schedule is flexible to your time. Nice associates and the discount is very nice. Manager are willing to accommodate to your benefits.
good,Just a typical work day to be there. It's usually busy whenever a coupon is almost over with. Workers are very helpful whenever you need them for any assistance
good,My position was exciting and fast paced.  Management gave me the freedom to be creative and work at a pace I felt comfortable with.  They valued my opinion.
good,"Customers are for the most part happy, however they are needy.  The company doesn't schedule enough employees to really give great customer service.   Supervisors really do everything with little or no help to get projects done.  If you take a job with JCP be ready to run hard all day."
good,"This was a very informative and easy job for me at Jcpenney, we were taught how to upsale, engage with customers, and how to make customers want to come back and feeling comfortable. I learned alot about sales at this job, being that I was only 16 and I’m very grateful for that."
good,"i personally enjoyed working for jcpenny"
good,My experience at JCP has been a good one but the big reason i am leaving is because of pay reasons and my degree. I am wanting to get a job to fit my studies.
good,"It was a nice job, except for the fact that the store the new management and basically everybody lost their job.  I don’t really have anything negative to say about the job, other than the fact that the new management was kind of rude. But other than that I found other jobs and they were excited when they heard that I had previously worked at JCPenney. It’s a great steppingstone into the work field."
good,As a part-time seasonal position. It will only work for students and people that want to make pocket change. Time does fly when you are on shift and that I would say is a good thing. Overall the management is good they are willing listen to your concerns.
good,This being my forst ever job it was easy and I was able to get quick experience as well as make new friends. Management was fair even offered to talk if we needed anything.
good,"I didnt really feel like I belonged there. The employees weren't too supportive. The one who trained me was okay, I didnt mind her. When I work somewhere I want to feel like I'm needed and wanted there. At JCP I didnt feel like that."
good,"everyone is super nice right when you walk in the door. however when ever i had a problem and i would talk to management, nothing was done about it. i did really like working there, sad i had to leave"
good,I loved working at JCPenney. But the manager their wasn't very nice. She didn't make me feel as if I was apart of the team. She would seclude me from customer interactions if certain things weren't done promptly or correctly. I otherwise enjoyed my time there. Other issue is the hours they would give. Not a lot for the amount of gas I would waste going back and forth from where I live to their. Only about 10-15 hours a week which obviously isn't enough to live and get the bills paid.
good,I found JcPenney to be a great first job. They really go above and beyond to give you praise when you are mentioned on the survey and there were pins and other incentives you could earn though this recognition.
good,"I am pleased with the collaboration and the skills that I learned at JCPenney. Whenever you are not sure what to do, someone is always there to help you. Management is willing to work with you if you have schedule conflicts, and they teach you the specs in a variety of departments. That being said, this does not mean that all of the supervisors will treat you nicely. I was looked down upon by a few coworkers for being new, but that is really the only complaint I have. You get a 15 minute break no matter the length of the shift, and you get a 30-minute lunch for working more than 6 hours."
good,"I loved working at the Logistics Center. I loved the job, loved the environment, loved the people. I just wish it wasn't closed down due to downsizing because I enjoyed working there."
good,JC Penney allowed me the opportunity to interface with many different people. Everyday presented a new challenge or something fun that someone else might consider hard work for the pay.
good,"I would take phone calls , stock shelves , take down appointments. "
good,"fun job  overall. simply worried about it's future."
good,My typical day at this location meant that I was behind a register cashing customers out who wanted to make a purchase or helping a customer find a product that we had located in the store.
good,"Some managers are fantastic, but others let the power get to their heads. Very rude, and unfair. Most of the time don’t keep up to date with schedule changes and time off requests through online board. Coworkers are friendly, many worked there for a long time."
good,Good company overall but store leadership needs improvement. High turnover rates. Store environment can be very stressful. Face paced and high exspectations with few hours.
good,JCPenney was a great experience for me definitely learned a lot experienced a lot moved around a lot through JCPenney definitely built a lot of good customers that was regulars.
good,"This job was excellent, the mangers was hard for the work that was done. They were to strict, and they always watched over you like a child. I didnt like the enviroment"
good,fun retail position that is great for student and others who enjoy their time in retail.  Company is definitely improving and headed in a positive direction.
good,It was always a positive environment. They were always friendly and always helping each other out. Everyone is working at a fast pace and hardworking environment.
good,"While employed as a customer service representative, I was able to experience a consistent flow of interactions with guests. At the leadership level, you have more of a connection to employee than customers."
good,The job includes a lot of cleaning and dealing with a lot with customers. Management handles issues very well and does a good job with communicating. Hours are usually not pretty flexible.
good,"Benefits were fair. Paid time off. Overtime during holiday season. Discounts benefits. Different activities, awards, and brainteasers. Job advancements."
good,Able to meet and interact with some amazing people and team members who are really helpful and energetic at the work they are entrusted with. Very flexible schedules
good,"At JCPenney, there are a lot of responsibilities. An associate has to clean out fitting rooms, greet customers, assist them in finding merchandise, clean off floors, fold clothes, hang them up, and put them in their respective location, check customers out, assist with credit card applications, and perform online orders in the store. While the list of responsibilities is a long one, the exciting people and amazing management makes the work environment much more enjoyable. Working here is hectic at times, but being able to help others find things that they love is something that I really love to do."
good,"When I was hired originally, I like my job. It gave me better pay and decent hours. I learned later that I would have more responsibilities than the ones that I was briefed with originally."
good,"Low pay, low hours, very little advancement opportunities. The environment is very good and morale is neutral, management is very accommodating and nice which is always a plus."
good,"I enjoyed working here, it was a fun and at times fast paced environment."
good,"On any given day at JCPenney, we are pretty busy but what makes it a great place to work are my fellow colleagues who work well together to complete daily tasks."
good,"What I do mostly is store  recovery, stocking and assist customers.  "
good,"When I started with the company, that was before the CEO retired. They treated their employees great and was staffed well. In turn, the employees cared quite a bit about their jobs. After the CEO retired, they cut positions and training. Sales changed, coupons were eliminated and that caused dissatisfaction on both the customer side and employee side. I haven't seen them bounce back after that."
good,"At JCPenney there's always something to be done. There's constantly moving parts in the job if you are working in the Operations team or as a sales representative. Management is friendly but stern. They wont give you a hard time if you're doing what you are suppose to be doing. Off holiday season, the store is recovering from prior holidays, but on season it is high tension and fast paced."
good,This is the perfect job to anyone who wants to get in the call center field. It was overall easy and fair compared to the job duties itself. The only part I didn't favor was not being able to get my full 40 hours per week and it was a temporary assignment.
good,Great place to work if you are just starting out or looking for seasonal and easy to learn how to use the cash register. Usually work with 2 or three other people and you have a good time talking with employers and customers.
good,"The only thing I disliked about JCP is the lack of training. The company took a 90% hands on 10% actual training. The management was awesome, they listened and cared about what you thought."
good,I enjoyed working for JCPenney in the Procurement Division. I improved my Microsoft Excel skills. The department is a close knit family. Co-workers are a fun bunch.
good,"They’re very open to people with some to no work experience. A very big store and a lot of walking back and forth. It’s not a bad place to work at if you’re just starting. But now I’m getting older and have my own responsibilities and will soon be having my own bills, I need a better paying job."
good,I worked as a hairstylist in the salon for almost 2 years. then I came back after being let go as seasonal help during holidays for 2 years. It was a good place to work.
good,Being a detective fun sometime stressful everyday watching people but protecting the store it was a joy making. sure your coworkers were protected and merchandise wasn't taken store quality was low each month plus working under the police force protection
good,"Supervisor position was a 9-5 job. You worked every other weekend with one closing night a week. I learned a lot of leadership skills and I grew as a person. I learned how to manage a team and provide them direction. Floor sets were a big part of the job and merchandising correctly. The atmosphere of JCPenney is one you will always enjoy. Other associates are very welcoming and a huge help to guide you through the workplace. The hardest part about the job is that you lose a lot of time to be spent outside of work. The job consumes so much of your time. It can be super stressful and if you don't handle stress well, this isn't the job for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the staff. It is a family oriented environment."
good,"A typical day at work, I would come in an hour before the store opened to prepare reports, look at important emails, plan my tasks for that day and start off the morning with a team huddle/meeting. I learned so much from the four years working there about customer service and visual merchandising. everyone was always so nice, I never had any issues with the employees, got along with everyone. The hardest job of working there was trying to schedule enough people for each department yet stay in line with payroll. But the best thing about the job was being able to be creative and also interacting with the customers."
good,Very professional at times and enjoyable to work. Was very flexible with my school schedule. I was able to switch with others when needed and able to work more hours when needed.
good,"Loved my job, I had gotten used to all of my co-workers and we are like family. We miss one another when we are not there. I learned a lot here, and the hardest part is leaving."
good,It was a great company to work for. It's a shame that it closed it's doors in our area. Took a lot of jobs away from people. A typical day would be checking in jewelry. Displaying items. Helping on the floor. Greeting customers and helping them with the needs. Taking payments and running the cash register.
good,The company has great advancement opportunities for employees that do well. The company is also making cutbacks that are effecting several jobs around the company.
good,JCPenney was a place where everything was a group team work was always top priority. It was a place where you would work at doing your best at everything you would do.
good,really nothing to say its a good place to work but also has it drawbacks tho . coud been a better experience for me if did have such an pushy attitude about the icps being sold to people
good,"I truly enjoyed my time ever there. Knew my job and was allowed to do what needed. "
good,"Very easy going work place, I was able to go back to school and complete my associates degree while working full time. I was able to gain the knowledge of being a lead"
good,Lots of team efforts and helping one another make it thru each shift. Teamwork will definitely make the dream work. Shift leaders are also very helpful and supportive. Schedule is all over the place but that's always expected with retail.
good,I loved working there the staff was great I learned a lot of new things the men's department staff was amazing it was always busy I like working with different people.
good,A great place to work and learn how to build customer service skills. You feel like you are part of a team and questions are welcome always. I would recommend this as a place to work
good,"I enjoyed working here, they had a nice break room, good management and other employees. Their training was good, the work wasn't too hard, typical folding clothes, helping customers, and working register. Towards the end though they stopped giving work hours to employees who had been there long and gave them to many new employees."
good,"As a sales associate I am responsible for closing and opening registers. I am required to meet sales quotas weekly. I am to provide, customers with outstanding customer service to meet their needs. Management could use some work, as far as scheduling correctly and working with your other work hours / school hours. Culture of the place is great, good environment, and people."
good,"Greet customers. Photograph customers. Learn how to run the camera, pose people for portraits. Generate sales of portraits. Run the register to ring up sales for portraits."
good,"Any typical day always provides you with a task to be kept busy, never is there a lazy day. Sometimes expectations are set a little too high, especially when those who set them are unaware of the current working environment or those set to help you have little to no incentive to do a good job."
good,"The culture of the store is great, everyone is like family.  In my position there was a lot to handle at one time. Not enough time to get it done in a timely manor."
good,"Everyday is a new sorta day in retail, no two days are the same. As an accomplished and lead supervisor in retail the key is to start the day off positive. Organize ones self for the morning meeting, be the stores cheerleader, open the finances for the store, check all staffing, and an example of a friendly customer service representative. Retail is a fun and fast pace environment. Allows at times to be creative with merchandising and understanding of the customers demand. Opportunity to problem solve, within policy and procedure guidelines, and complete a job with a sense of accomplishment. Having the opportunity to train and team build with a new member is always exciting."
good,"Gives you intro retail experience, cash handling and cash register experience. Not too hard of a job, but has you on your toes a lot. Customers are the usual retail types"
good,"When the business was doing well, benefits were unmatched.Discounts, on site medical, cafeterias, medical, dental. Was prideful of my job and left every day happy. But then business went downhill and cuts were made across the board."
good,"Cleaning fitting rooms, keeping the sales floor as manageable and tidy as possible throughout the shift, while also maintaining P.O.S. registers and attempting to submit as many credit applications as possible. Management is overall very qualified and moderately organized. Hardest and most tedious part of the job is maintaining fitting rooms and the sales floor during a black Friday sale. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning almost everything there is to know about Levi's."
good,"the managers a cool, its easy to get away with stuff there. pretty relaxed besides when coorperate comes to visit and inspect the store then the managers become strict"
good,Although the customers can be hassle at time the coworkers and team environment is what makes you feel so welcomed and eager to work withsuch great employees
good,"A good fast pace enviroment. They work with your scedule, friendly. Definitly a good first job. Nonetheless an awesome place, to learn and grow, within the company."
good,JCPenney operations task team is great to work in. In before the store opens and out not to long after the store opens. Amazing staff to work with and feels like you are with family.
good,"Its a solid, full package set of benefits. All the standard things you'd expect.  Plus you have bonus package.  The pension plan was offered when I was employed."
good,The staff work well together and are eager to teach new employees. You are put to start learning the area and floor plan and moved to the registers. The group relationships are excellent.
good,J.C. Penney was a great working place. Very professional. Very clean place to work. I recommend anyone to work here. Great management. Very fast pace job. Great hours
good,"I was just a cashier for JcPenny. I would run registers and clean up the store areas such as dressing rooms , unfolded clothes , stuff "
good,"I have enjoyed becoming a staple person to both my guests who spend their time and money shopping here , plus have become very familiar with management expectations and needs in order to deliver a quality, personable and memorable experience to whom ever  I may come in  contact with  each and every day. I love the connection I hope to have, with going above and beyond to make someone smile and appreciate the moment."
good,"There was a lot that I learned from this job. It helped me to think faster on my feet, and I advanced to a different section of the store relatively quickly."
good,"An extremely relaxed, slow paced work environment with a positive, go-get-em management team always encouraging their employees to do the best they can."
good,Having the opportunity to work during the peak season gave me a preview of how well I would like to work in a photography studio if ever given the opportunity to become a photographer full time. Along with an hourly salary you have a few chances to get commission for sales (which was the hardest part of the job - but not that hard if you have the experience). The best part of the job was working with the kids who (if they were having a good day) who love to smile.
good,I learn a lot working here and had the opportunity to  try different areas. Very friendly people. Very flexible with your schedule. It is fast paced but it is not hard.
good,they hire too many stylists.  Can not work enough to stay busy as there is not enough work for the amount of stylists.   we sit around with nothing to do. they should hire fewer stylists and keep them busy
good,Worked with AS400 to help setup new vendors for electronic ordering in one department.  In the other department I helped with a 5 year system cleanup for the main database for the Womens' and Mens' clothing attributes.
good,"i had a great experience at JcPenneys despite of seasonal position and unfortunately having to let me go, i fell in love with it the hours were solid and you always had a job to do."
good,"Working at J C Penney is  great experience. Each day is different and yet the same. I love that I get to interact with the customer and help to generally make their day here at J C Penney. May job gives me a seance of accomplishment working with the replenishment, signing and merchandising teams"
good,"I love working at JCPenney. They were very understanding with my hours when i was going to school. The managers and Supervisors are very knowledgeable and always was there when I had questions or need assistance. I love and enjoy working with customers. The advantage of assisting customers, is the smile on their face when they are able to get the assistance that they need to purchase their merchandise. I've learned to be patient and not take things personal when a customer complains about a certain item or situation, but I will go out of my way to explain something better or assist them so that they are happy walking out of the store."
good,Where I worked it was a friendly environment my co workers were supportive and didn’t get annoyed with my questions when I was new. I do have to say the store I worked at over hired people but didn’t work them?
good,This company shows it's appreciation of it's employees by doing specials meals all the time.  They also do contests to help the employees meet their daily goals.  It is a great place to work.  It is difficult to advance when you are only a temporary employee however.
good,"Worked as a CSR during Christmas season. Training was intense, the working environment was great. Management was very supportive.Actually looked forward to going to work every day."
good,"Unfortunately, there is no room for advancement in my area and I am unable to relocate. If relocation was possible, I wouldn't be leaving. Jcp has amazing career opportunities for hair stylists."
good,Started when I was 16. Learned some great things here. I was a college student and they would always find a way to bring me back during my breaks. At the end of the day I felt like I learned many valuable lessons that will help me in my future career.
good,"Good management and a conducive environment to work,coworkers are team player and always happy to be at work.the hardest part of the work is when there is a special sale and an associate calls in it affect the days job."
good,Its a good job to have and maybe even room to grow within the company. I would say you must have great customer service skills and willing to work with public. They offer a great discount and flexible schedule.
good,I enjoyed this job. Working with the public was fun and engaging. I felt comfortable and capable of my job responsibilities and felt i provided customers with a friendly and pleasurable salon experience. I also enjoyed learning about new products and services the salon provided
good,i processed accounts payable and receivable. I provided quality customer service. The manangment was amazing. I made wonderful relationships there. And we worked together to reach goals for our department as well as a company as whole.
good,JCP is a average job but the long hours and no off days. the pay is unfair and management don't look for new changes. the company is not the same.....
good,great co workers
good,Fun and fast paced workplace. You may wear fun and fashionable clothing to work. It is competitive sometimes with getting customers to open up a JCPenney credit card.
good,JC Penney is a good workplace for people with family or school obligations. It is a fun place to work. There is so much to learn about the apparel industry.
good,It was a fun place to work and I made a lot of lifelong friends. Good for a first job or if you want to work at a chill place. Current management is great.
good,I loved the people I worked with including management.  Everyone looked out for one another.  The only thing I did not like was that nobody worked full time.  Only thing I would change.
good,"JCPenney is an excellent place to work.  Friendly and helpful coworkers, generous discount program among other great benefits if you are full time.  I love my job at JCP."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact face to face with customers and help them find what they looking for.   There is never a lack of work to do and if you are willing you can cross train in the different departments.
good,"Great place to work! This is a company that truly embraces a servant leadership culture. However, there are a lot of opportunities for improvement. Budget cuts and lack of staffing is an ongoing issue that is not going away. Customer service suffers because of this and it can be very frustrating."
good,"Temporary Seasonal job, responsible for stocking the sales floor while assisting customers. promoting and up-sales. Warehouse maintenance and inventory control."
good,Jcpenny was a good company to work but they gave you less day and less hour to work and a little salary and there manger was neve that good and that little money Cannot pay my bill
good,This distribution center job was great.The only reason I left was that they moved to Atlanta. I enjoyed the people and management made working there so much fun.
good,"Work days started with a team huddle, which included recognizing outstanding team members.  Helping customers find gifts and special occasion items was fun and challenging.  Management recognized team member achievements and always supported staff with questions and/or customer complaints.  The most difficult part was not finding what a customer is looking for, while helping them find what they weren't sure specifically what they wanted was very rewarding."
good,"I learned how to straighten bras and panties quickly, everyday was different.  I could start out in junior department and end up in the men's department at the end of a shift.  I got along with management.  I made the workplace fun.  The hardest part of the job was getting everything done in the limited time.  I really enjoyed doing a fitting for a suit or a prom dress."
good,"This job was my first job at the age of 17. At first it's hard because they don't really teach you a whole lot, its more of a hands on learning experience but it's super easy once you get the hang of it."
good,I will continue to shop there. The discount was good but never had time to use it. I didn't like how you only had one 15 min break. Other than that everyone was nice.
good,JCPenney gave me quite a bit of room for advancement.  I greatly enjoyed working for them.  I would have loved to stay.  The revenue saving job cuts made it difficult to maintain an operating team.
good,Loved everything about this job except the lack of advancement opportunities. My supervisors were great the Management team was great. I was able to move around the store and help customers in many different ways.
good,This job was good but the only reason i life is because it was seasonal and I wanted something longterm. I learned great customer service skills and organization skills.
good,Great place to work if you need a very flexible schedule. They did well with working around the college kids' school hours but there wasn't a lot of room for advancing.
good,Clock in and out. Salary vs. commission. Paid training. Full benefits. Store discount.  It's an easy place to work at and if you have a good team a great place to work at.
good,"Working in college can be very tough. However, I was able to work almost a full time job at JCP, and go to college full time. My scheduling supervisor always made sure that there was a good balance between work and school time."
good,"A work day their, there is always something to do, there are no such thing as standing and idling around. In this line of work you have to be fast-paced and learn your store well. Take away skills from this job would be better communication skill, ability to multitask, sales, and various skills. The hardest part is  if you are a student, getting enough hours and making schedule work. But the managers are more than willing to help work around that part. It is just time and dedication you have to invest in the company. I enjoyed working with my team members and learning all the skills of what it takes to be a good sales associate that would benefit the customers needs."
good,the people and managers are very nice and try their best to work with what you need. this job requires you to be around people alot and you get to meet many different types of people in this job
good,"You never get bored because there is always so much to do. There is pretty good teamwork in the store so that helps. The hardest part is on big sale days, because there are so many customers."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent with JCPenney.  The co-workers were friendly and enjoyed working with each other.  The only reason I left JCPenney in 2006 was that I moved out of state.
good,"I learned so much from them. I was taught more on customer service, placing online orders and picking them up; multi-tasking, and covering over multiple departments of the store."
good,I was only part time but they were very flexible with hours and days you could work or not.  Good training program.  Management was good and made every attempt to keep the staffed informed of any changes.
good,The store manager is amazing but I work in the salon and the managers they have in there are not very nice  . Super rude and very lazy and selfish. But the company over all is a very good company to work for .
good,"Jcpenney's was a good environment to work in, had friendly happy managers who were always willing to help, and staff that created an awesome working environment"
good,Good work experience different departments offer different levels of learning and responsibility. Very organized during holiday events and well managed
good,Its a great place to work at if you dont like fast paced jobs. Although your hours decrease if clientele decreases. Your raises are rare and job adcancement is competitive.
good,"potential for being a great job, stressful because brick and mortar has to survive, causing reactionary changes.  great proprietary product, great vision"
good,"I am a people person, this provided a great opportunity for a people person.  The company offered great employee discounts.  The  work environment was friendly and relaxed, but at a unpredictable work environment, meaning when and for what people were shopping for."
good,"Working in JcPenney has made my knowledge bigger towards customer relationships, dealing with easy to moderate customer problems liking, to please them and make their experience a better and easier one."
good,"Their salon was very easy going, low stress days. Compensation was a little low, but as you develop your clientele the money comes with it. The manager was very nice, encourages you to grow. It's a large salon staff, but surprisingly those who are motivated do very well."
good,"Overall I loved my time with this company, its' great for a young person going to school. The pay was good for the light work that you needed to do, my managers were all great, and the customers were generally nice. The only downside was the store I worked at closed down."
good,"You do anything that the job asks of you. This includes restocking merchandise, helping on the register, and pricing/signing. If you enjoy retail then this is the job for you. The employees are super nice."
good,"My workplace has offered me much experience in customer service, problem solving, critical thinking, and even managerial training. Most days at work are a high-speed flurry of activity ranging from overseeing tasks to completion and assisting them myself, assisting customers with questions or inquiries, shipping and receiving of various goods and packages, filing of various documents for future reference or usage, and performing daily duties involving tasks and behind the scenes functions for my store, i.e. pricing, stocking, scheduling, and shipping. Workplace culture is very friendly and engaging, with everyone maintaining a positive demeanor towards each other. The hardest part of the job is keeping up when the workloads start to get high, namely during seasonal times and high traffic periods. My favorite part of the job is assisting those that need help and seeing all the great associates I get the pleasure to work beside."
good,I enjoyed working at JcPenney but my coworkers were very unprofessional and rude so it made it hard environment to work with. But overall it was a fun expiercence.
good,"While foot traffic is slow in the salon due to an over saturated market in Mount Pleasant, it was a pleasant environment.  A typical day at work includes working on clients, booking appointments, making reminder calls, checking in shipments, and assisting any other stylists when you're not busy. For the majority of the time I was there we did not have a salon manager, so we fell to the General Store managers, so some of our education classes got pushed, but the management staff was always very kind and willing to help with whatever they could. All of my coworkers were friendly, easy going and willing to help as well. The hardest part of the job was having very busy days when I didn't even get a bathroom break for my whole shift in order to get all the clients in and make them happy. The best part of my job was my awesome coworkers, and working with a diverse group of clients!"
good,Had a lot of staff during employment  then they started to downsize and lay a lot of people off.  All employees seemed to care so that is hare to come by.  The managers did what they could to boost moral and make it a fun place to work.
good,JC Penney is a good place to work. I had great bosses and we had a great time working together. Everyone works as a team and came together every night to get things done!
good,I enjoyed working for jcp I was the top seller for years. I worked for 8.5 years and quit for 3 then came back coming back was hard for me things had really changed. I still did a good job however wasn't as appreciated as much.. New management came on and I just found it hard to conform with some of it I still did my job and still had great sales. I was second in sales. I just didn't feel appreciated anymore.  I loved my customers and a lot of them came back when they found out I was back. I had a good connection with my customers and I am going to miss a lot of them
good,"I didn't work here for very long. It was my first job, great for work experience. The seasonal employment is a great way to make extra money for high schoolers."
good,"Most management was helpful and friendly, but the training received is minimal but the expectations for performance also felt low; it is definitely an entry level position with little room for growth."
good,"I love working here, my co workers are nothing but supportive. Plus the discounts are great. It has its flaws like any place. But I have worked at worse places."
good,Assisted customers and handled transactions for purchases and opening credit accounts. Cleaned and organized sales floor. Worked in the recover department and staged merchandise.
good,Jc penney was okay. I was actually lucky to have been moved to the lingerie department. The work was not as heavy as the  women department. Its okay to work there i just didn't like getting paid minimum.
good,Was a good place to work until we were told that we were closing.  There are no typical day's.  The workplace culture is good. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,Its kind of hard working your way up because they keep you as a part timer without benefits or enough time to be exposed to walk ins and meet new clients. The receptionists assign the walk ins and the mayority of appointments and if they don't like you then you won't have anything to work with. You have to keep a daily minimum productivity.
good,"Not great pay or benefits, but very flexible hours.  Managers were very compassionate and caring.  Easy job.  Good Training.  They shut down our center, because of the decline in phone orders.  Sad."
good,"Great culture, amazing co-workers and work life balance. Pay is amazing compared to other retailers, however no emphasis on career development. Managers are simply managers and terrible at developing talent along with HR. With status of JCP, your job is always a bit up in the air which is not a good feeling. Overall, potentially a great place to start career as long as you network a lot."
good,You get to meet a lot a great people working with you. Great place to be around. The hardest part would be working during the holidays for long periods of hours.
good,"When I arrived,  I started to put clothes away in the fixtures, customer service area, and the register area. I learned how to price items and mark downs. Some people in the management team weren't very professional. The hardest part was to work on weekends. I enjoyed to work there because I like to associate with people. I loved working at JCPenney."
good,"I started as a seasonal and they decided to keep me on the job. The managers are awesome and not too far away for when you need, cause you will need them for those customers, haha."
good,The training is very extensive so it prepares you for when you actually start working. You learn how to calm down frustrated customers that call in. They also teach you to use their software. There is always some one there to help you if you need it. They are willing to work with school schedules as well.
good,"I worked for the company over 4 years ago in Albemarle NC, most everyone I worked with it now gone. But while there we all had our typical duties, keep your department nice and tidy as well as check the fitting room within the marked time frames. The people that you worked with as well as the customers were such a delight to be around."
good,"A typical work day consist of greeting customers , having positive customer service and cashiering and clean dressing rooms, also straightening the department"
good,"Great salon with great stylist, they  are up to date with products, very supportive and helpful staff a good learning environment for beginning stylist"
good,The Company has changed since I started back in the 80's.  Alot of Upper management from other Companies making changes that are not always good thing.  Reducing sales floor and supervisory staffing is not the way to go.
good,"On some days it's slow so I just write down what  supplies are needed for the salon for the salon to have to stay afloat. "
good,"Strong Company with a work life balance and great benefits.  CEO seems very down to earth.  People are friendly and knowledgeable.  Pay is descent.  Training is improving, but is not the greatest in the retail industry."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. This was my first job and I don't think that any other workplace could have molded my work ethic any better. The management was awesome and very willing to work with a school schedule.
good,Company has a good work life balance. Management is fair but known for retaliating against employees. Make sure your attendance is in order other wise this is what will get you fired.
good,"push out new stock ,price markdowns, do inventory give great customer service. pricing and signing team keeping department neat and clean Nothing hard about the Job. The most enjoyable part of the job is multi-tasking-I like to be busy all the time. Everyone got along and was willing to help each other as needed."
good,"My experience with this company was very good. I enjoyed going to work. The people there was like family. We use to have cookouts, company outings and parties. It never felt like work."
good,The environment is great i couldn't ask to have a better first job. It has many amazing people who have helped along the way and if it weren't for them we wouldn't have a fun work environment.
good,You must have a love of retail in order to succeed with this company. It is an ever changing job that will provide you with new experiences every day.  The most enjoyable part of being a Merchandise Manager is seeing first hand all the new product come into the store.  Creating all the floor plans and seeing the sales continue to rise is also very rewarding.
good,What I learned was how to speak to un familiar faces. The work place cultural is mixed there is different cultural Working. The most enjoyable time is closing spending time with my employees
good,Each day I come in my managers give me a task and I'm expected to get as much clothes recovery and looking nice before the end of my shift. Working at JCPenney taught me how clothing stores set up their clothes and that there is a way of doing it. The people I work with are extremely nice and understanding. Managers also take the time to get to know you.
good,"Co-workers were great. Everyone is really nice and welcoming. "
good,"Jc Penny was great place to work they were always fair and easy to talk to about anything, daily task were given and manage were easy to access if you needed them , if I was to get another job at JC Penny I would stay at least 2 years."
good,"Assisting customers with purchases, getting customers to apply for jcpenney credit card, helping assist with checkout and stocking and cleaning and closing cash drawer at night"
good,JCPenney is a great place to work for those who are looking for a part time job with no benefits.  They offer a great retail atmosphere with much emphasis on team spirit.  Extra training and advancement are available to those who show interest in it.
good,"This is a very rewarding job for someone who may be looking for long term. Great benefits, stability, and embracing. You are definitely treated as a team."
good,"If you worked 8 hours you got a 15 minute break (paid) and Lunch (30 minute, not paid) but you always had someone there to help you or to rush over when you requested help. The training often lead to one section and if you were moved to a different section of your area you had to ask for help, but it was pretty easy to learn on the fly."
good,"Pay & hours aren't the best but you do get a raise every year and everyone is like family here.  Summer and holiday times are when there's better hours & holiday pay. Also we get 25% employee discount to use on top of coupons. Also, we get rewarded with prizes or gift cards for opening up Credit applications and having great customer service"
good,My experience while working at Jcpenney was one that made me prepared to assist customers all day in order to help them find the items that they were coming into the store to shop for that day.
good,We talk about our goal for the day. We talk about customer service.Whats new merchandise and the sales for the day. Merchandising and visualization...
good,"-typical day at work would include maintaining and displaying all necessary items within my department as well as being cashier when needed"
good,"Good hours are given here, you have a pretty good discount on the store. When I worked the managers showed a lot of favoritism to certain employees. But overall pretty cool place to work."
good,The people are very nice. The discount is great. The hardest part of the job is putting clothes back from the fitting room. Straightening the clothes at the end of the day is can be trying. Some customers can be difficult but the majority of customers are pleasant and nice.
good,"Working for JC Penny was a unique experience. I was able to learn about the company and how thing were done. I worked in the Men's department, shoes, and in linens and drapery's."
good,"Flexible working schedule, that enable to balance family, working and going to school. Leaned about Women's fashion and how sales promotion works, a well mixed culture environment, enjoyed employee purchasing discount."
good,"The job was seasonal. It was a busy season for a retail store. And I like the environment when there were many customers. I enjoyed talking to them, assisting with their needs and giving them information about the merchandise. The workplace was composed of employees from different culture, and it was fun mingling with everyone.The hardest part of the job is the fact that it was only seasonal. I could have learned a lot more if it were a full time job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the organizing of the merchandise on the floor which was one way to help customers' shopping easier for them."
good,"I worked retail over the holidays so your basic day was pretty hectic. We alternated between the floor and the register, depending on how busy it was in that moment. My job responsibilities were fairly straightforward -- keep the customer happy and keep the line short. "
good,The job is definitely for customer friendly people that can definitely deal with all types of issues when it comes to making sure all customers are satisfied when they leave the store
good,"When you work here you obviously are working you lost of people which depending on how you are might be a good or bad thing. I enjoyed it, management was nice and understanding. Just low pay."
good,worked with great people. was usually short staffed (not anyone's fault) so the hardest part was running around the store working in every department that wasn't yours.
good,"Overall, the work was always satisfying. Things like finishing a truck and getting out all of the merchandise onto the floor or into the appropriate stockrooms always left me feeling good when I left work. The hours are pretty early, but after getting accustomed to it having the rest of the afternoon off is pretty nice. The upper management at my store are also extremely positive and friendly. However, a corporate policy came along that severely limited our hours. Management always told us that it was due to a lack of hours for the department until they would ask everyone on my team to stay late to do another project instead of finishing our duties with unloading/putting out merchandise. This and a few instances of associates' schedules being changed without being told occasionally put stress on my coworkers."
good,"A typical work day was interesting in that no day is exactly the same. I learned more about good customer service. The management was always trying to improve the workplace culture with lots of smaller incentives. The hardest part was a sense of job insecurity in that at short notice, jobs could change or be eliminated or reconstructed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
good,"I love working for JCPenney. I have many, many friends and have learned so much from my experiences at JCPenney. Working as a supervisor the schedule is hard when you have a family. The shifts are not usually consistent and it is hard to be away from your family during holiday season cause it is the busiest time of the year and you are required to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday. and every Saturday from Thanksgiving to Christmas. leaving little time for family. The discount and rewards earnings are great. They also have available stock options for associates."
good,Great place to work. Very interactive with customers and associates. A lot of fun activities for associates. Love the employee discount which also works in Sephora. You learn a lot while working for Jcpenney.
good,"I loved my job and what I did there. I loved working with all the customers and working in a steady paced environment. Overall, the management made it dreadful."
good,JC Penneys is a great place to work. JC Penney cares about their employees and does a great job of showing it. There is plenty of room for advancement if you are willing to put in the work.
good,"This is a good place to work with a good atmosphere. There are always new challenges, but is hard to get full time, and without that there are no benefits. You do get advanced if you do well, though, so that is a plus."
good,Great place to work although management and many things need to be adressed within the company. Some parts within the company were very hard to deal with or change.
good,I enjoyed the floating schedule I was assigned. I even worked in watch repair when it was still there. I loved the versatility and working different departments.
good,My day would start be helping costumers with any question on merchandise. Then help than check out. I would also grab online orders from back stock room that were delivered to the store. At the end of the day we put back merchandise that was misplaced then fold and organize clothing.
good,Nice. I loke the training that was provided. The job maybe a little atressful but at the end of the day that all went away knowing that you were able to resolve a customers problem.
good,"•	Provide excellent customer service by assisting customers with plumbing questions "
good,"In my short time working at JCPenny, I learned various skills. I worked as a cashier and sales associate in the Women's department. I enjoyed working there and helping people. I also enjoyed most of the staff that I was working with. I learned the basis of operating a cash register and the responsiblities that come with it."
good,Typical day is busy. Usually a line of customers waiting to check out every Saturday and Sunday. The most enjoyable part of this job is the great customers but more importantly the great group of associates that I work with.
good,Very awesome place to work really enjoyed my time there I learned a lot about diagrams and communicating with customers and also loved the management and staff made a lot of good friends and it was a pleasant work environment I cleaned out dressing rooms assisted customers on questions they had about products in the store and also did measurement for bra fittings and also helped stock and sort new product
good,"Great working environment , group orientated ,works with your schedule . While working here showed me how to talk to people even under stress or if customer is angry , also learned how to have patience ."
good,I enjoy working at JCPenneys. I enjoy my co workers and customers. Its a good environment where everyone gets along.  Theyre pretty good at working with your schedule.
good,"I enjoyed working for JCP. However, some days can be a little overwhelming, at least at the one I work at. I usually am scheduled the closing shift so when I come in at 5:00 pm I never know what I am coming into. The people that work during the day will leave after their shift with the store a mess and the fitting room completely full, leaving the closers to do it all and help customers at the same time! And closers can't leave at night until the store is completely clean and the fitting rooms are cleaned out and everything is put away. Only good thing about this is that you are never bored and there is ALWAYS something to do (i.e. Clean out fitting rooms, fold clothes, fix clothing racks, check out customers). It makes the shift go by very quick. Everyone I work with is really nice too. Overall, it's not a bad place to work. It's retail. You should know what you are getting into when applying for retail!"
good,I enjoyed my time working for JC Penneys Distribution Center. There wasn't always work to do so the hours varied but it was a fun place to work. The employees were really nice as well.
good,"Worked here for only two months, (part time) before moving back to Chicago. Nice people. Easy going, but got a little busy during the holidays. Managers were pleasant and the location was nice."
good,"J. C. Penney prides itself on a team orientated company.  The people are helpful and friendly.  The management can be difficult to deal with at times.  If you do all that is required, then you will be fine.  Great training with opportunity for advancement.  They pay pretty well for a retail store."
good,The job was easy but sometimes they overwork you. The hours were great 6:30 a.m. till 2:30 p.m. I was a temp so sometimes they didn't have work for me and sometimes the work load was heavy.
good,"Received great work experience  "
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, I work for JC Penney for 10 years but had to let it go because the new manager did the employees wrong by cutting there hours so they would loss there benefits, and had to look for employment else where to make ends meet. If it wasn't for the new general manager I would still be there working."
good,"•	Served on every customer experience focused team, i.e. stock, visual, and pricing"
good,"The job was easy and fun. The customers were very nice and friendly. I enjoyed the job and the co-workers, but we were kind of busy because of the holiday time."
good,I am always looking to expand my knowledge and experience new trials in life and especially work. I work as hard and honest as I can and am always looking for criticism towards my work ethic so I can expand and build upon my skills. I look forward to meeting new people and to work and build with all my co-workers.
good,"Even though it was just a seasonal job, it was a good job. The employers were awesome helpful and always cheerful. It did needed to work a little on their management and communication, but over all it was nice working."
good,Good part time job i recommended. Great benefits and great friendly environment to work i use to work in the lungerai dep i loved helping women with their correct size
good,The work environment is very relaxed and works with you're schedule. The management is pretty good they will work with you on anything. The hardest part of the job is standing on you're feet all the time. The most enjoyable part is meeting all the new people and helping them out.
good,"A typical day at work was always exciting and we were always interested in what our clients needs were. We felt like professional doctors or geniuses working there, because of the variety of people that we would come across and the things we would learn on a daily. These special occasions and any given day was always something we would look forward for. We really enjoyed coming to work and the friendly, kind staff would always make it better, especially management. The management is award winning and I would recommend their management training to any company or business that is looking for ways to excel. The hardest part of this job way having to say good bye. I would still drop by every now and then to say hi, because it was one of my most remembered and rewarding jobs and I enjoyed almost everyday there."
good,"A typical day at work depends on where in the store you work if it's women's or truck can be intense fast paced and a little stressful. You must be willing to ""work"" to enjoy that area. Mens kids and shoes are right behind them they have more opportunities of down time. Occasionally you can task or find something to do which is strongly encouraged."
good,"I love working here, really I do. January and February do offer VERY few hours though. The customers are pretty nice generally. There is quite a bit expected of the associates but it is doable if someone is determined and dedicated to doing work during their shift."
good,"pretty chill working environment. everyone respects one another. fifteen minutes break, half an hour lunch. air conditioning. close to home. recovery sometimes bad."
good,A typical day at work was busy helping customers but there was a great team and supportive management.The hardest part was when it got really busy but everyone worked together. I learned to multi task and work as a team.
good,Very cool place to work. I met a lot of hard-working people from all ages. I learned that the company encouraged students to apply. The shifts were from 5 am until about 1 pm or 2 pm. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Jc penney has been the one job i've learned from the most, the time working there would pass by fast, people were friendly, the supervisors were good at there job. It was a  nice job to work at"
good,Jcpennys was a great job to work during the holidays. Most days I either helped with customer service or either putting merchandise back. I learned the diversity of people and that people love to save. My coworkers were great team players and helped the slow days go fasters. The hardest part of my job was disappointing a customer when our main goal is satisfy  them. The most is enjoyable part of my job was knowing I helped a customer and put a smile on their face.
good,Worked at Penney for 30 year . Always liked my job . Job elimation and serverance pay .. I was able to advance but now advancement is not likely as they are ellinamating jobs .
good,"JCPenney is a wonderful place to work at gives you an opportunity to open your eyes and give a better perspective of the retail environment. "
good,"The environment is jovial, but often work is left on those who actually care about their jobs. The managers try to encourage more teamwork, but some employees do not comply."
good,"For the work that one does at JCPenney I think one should get paid more. I believe that $10.50 is not good enough. One should also be given more hours, especially to those who work hard."
good,"JC Penney is an awesome place to work, however because it is only seasonal work my hourly rate and schedule is not that great. The managers are awesome and I work with a group of people that work excellent as a team. Sometimes the customers can be challenging but there is always a manager available to assist you immediately and give you direction should you be faced with the same issue in the future. The most enjoyable part of the job is I get along with all of my co-workers and everyone is there to assist and work together as a team."
good,"I will admit that working at Jc Penney was one of my better decisions in life. Although at times hours were minimal, as they are in any retail environment, there was never a time where I was bored. They gave me the opportunity to learn as much as I could about different positions and they were very excited to hear that I wanted to learn all that I could about every department and job in the store. The only thing that bothered me about working here was the management. Otherwise, this was a great job and if given the opportunity again, I would love to go back and work there again."
good,Customers are rude and need to prepare for that. The only downside is that you have to work on holidays. The best part is that they are very flexible with school.
good,Had to be friendly helpful and available to customers have a clean fitting room be able to sell and use arm checks and deal with money.
good,This job is a normal retail job that teaches you the basic everyday things that are required. I enjoyed my time there. I had wonderful co-workers at the time I worked for this company.
good,Jcpenneys is one of the most wonderful places to shop at they have wonderful deals and amazing customer service and wonderful leadership
good,JC Penney i think is a nice place to work at but it isn't for everyone and i wouldn't permanently work there unless you live close by and don't mind inconsistent shifts.
good,"love to shop? then you will love working in retail. i spent most of my check here on their great sales. typical day is a lot of cleaning up clothes off the ground , ringing up customers , and changing sales signs ."
good,Training from this employer is intensive and also hands on.  Communication between staff and workers are constant and informative.
good,"overall, a good place to work at. Socializing with customers and meeting new people was entertaining. became friends with the other employees and had fun nights out. management was on top of everything but very supportive and laid back. customers were a bit of a pain but thats just retail lol."
good,"There are wonderful employees at this location. The company seemed to be disorganized at the time I was employed there. There was a new CEO with many new ideas and plans. This made the position very interesting and challenging. I enjoyed the opportunity to excercise my organizational skills, working with others to get through a challenging time. Unfortunately full time positions were drastically cut back and benefits were being eliminated."
good,I enjoy working for this company. I have learned a lot both in the warehouse and in the store. Great associates and managers. It's been a good experience.
good,Worked here throughout college and appreciated the flexible work schedules. Supportive management who are willing to help yet maintain proper standards
good,"It can be very stressful at times, management helps when needed, I learned a lot of leadership for being one of their longer working associates. Productive environment."
good,Basic Sales job at JCPenney is what you could expect. Not so great pay but works. great starter job in my opinion. Would recommend.
good,"Stocking shoes, apparel, and accessories, helping customers find what they are looking for and ringing them up at point of sale is a big portion of the work day and the great diversity and business leaves you with a fun productive day that goes by quickly. There is always somewhere you are needed to help and easily find dependability in management and your coworkers."
good,"I started my career ten years ago as a trainee at the company, which JCPenney has an outstanding program that develops young talent with the design skills and background needed in this field with real life experiences (designing, production, travel to factories, and corporate presentations).  "
good,A day at JCP required lots of communication and being able to deal with the conflicts of others. The management was good and so were the employees. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who did not understand some of the rules. The part i enjoyed the most was being in an environment which people loved interacting and getting to know people personally.
good,A typical day at work was usually busy. I learned how to make sales. The management was laid back. My co-workers were nice and friendly people. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers who were disrespectful. The most enjoyable part of my job was being about to sit with customers and show them the different pictures they took.
good,"Come in see what tasks need to be done"
good,"typical day is working with customers, and cleaning. things I learned working there is that they care about their customers. Management will go above and beyond for the customers. my coworkers are handworkers. the hardest part of the job is leaving on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers."
good,"i enjoyed working at jcpenney.Very associate oriented. Fun to work ,calm enviornment. Managers are on top of regular day procedures and duties."
good,"My first day of working at JCpenney, wasn't so nerve wrecking as I thought it would be - honestly, I was just nervous. Although I had confidence that things would go well working there and things did. I learned how to work the computers to check out customers, doing online orders, returning items as well as online items.  I got along with all my co-workers. I loved the job and it's perks. If I didn't know how to do something I wasn't afraid to ask. "
good,"Being a CSR for JCPenney has it's challenges; but the challenges are what makes the job that much more exciting. You may take a hundred calls within an 8 hour work day; with 50% of those calls coming from customers who may be upset that they haven't received their merchandise in a timely fashion, some may have even received their merchandise damaged; and its our job/my job to assure them that JCPenney will do all that needs to be done to rectify those unpleasant issues. What I like most about my position at JCPenney is my co-workers. Actually we're more like a family than co-workers. We work together as a team to resolve all customer concerns."
good,I enjoyed working at JCP specially meeting new associates and have them to trained to become better sales associates.It was challeging when we had to setup training classes on every disctric. Cordination of suppliers and store associates.
good,"This company is really good about providing opportunities for advancement for people that prove themselves to be good workers, but they are simply not able to give me the hours that I need. I also prefer to have a fairly stable schedule which is not always possible with this type of retail job."
good,"Working at JCP was one of the best jobs I had. It was simple, fun, and an all-around positive atmosphere to work in. "
good,The days I go in your always busy helping customers. Either your helping them cash out or helping them find all the things there needing. Perhaps if they can not find what there needing you can order it for them! While working here I have really learned how to interact with customers and it has build my people skills. The people I work with are all great and there so helpful. You never feel as if you are doing all the work. I would say the hardest part working at JcPenny is dealing with some of the people that come into the store. But no matter what I just smile and try to help with any issue they might be having. Last I would say my most enjoyable part of my job is making friends and having a good work environment. Being able to  go to work and not have to worry is great.
good,coworkers are great to work with. hardest part of the job were the minimum amount of hours they give you a week. helping customers pick out outfits pick up online orders in store.
good,The culture and work experience was great until they changed CEO's. Then it went down hill quickly. Before that it was a great place to work.
good,"It started out great but unfortunately the management never trained me properly, and i was alone with no one to help me or teach me."
good,I loved working for this company. Each day was different and loved the customers I worked with. I was one of the best specialist they had until I left the company.
good,"The job was fairly easy. It's just ALOT OF WALKING. If you are looking for a workout this is the perfect job for you. I was a order filler. The job was super easy, your RF Scanner mainly did the work for you. The people were friendly. It was very hot, but they do have fans for the summer or if it's just hot. Overall the job was ok. I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes."
good,"When I would come in I would go right to any of the stands and start to fold laundry , If I saw a customer I would always greet them. "
good,"Clothing retail was not for me, I have worked in retail my entire adult life and I would much rather be culling produce then folding clothes."
good,In this job I learned a lot about dealing with customers from all walks of life. A simple smile can really brighten someone's day. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after everyone. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers.
good,"As much as I love my company and the ideals it supposedly stands for, I find that for many sales associates, we are quite literally unable to advance to a living wage. For as much work as is taken on, there isn't nearly enough compensation."
good,Excellent place to work. Good management. Nice environment. Flexible working hours for management. Store is nice and clean and I had my own office.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, and it was a fairly fun environment to work in. Management had favorites and occasionally let associates work understaffed. Sometimes we would have to stay 3-5 hrs. after closing. We were encouraged to get customers to apply for JCPenney credit cards, and were given an incentive for every application."
good,"Compensation was good"
good,A typical day at jc penney was always surprising. You would never know what you were going to get from your customers from hour to hour. I've learned that your customers are always your top priority and to always give a little more. My co-workers are very competitive when it comes to driving sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to please the customers.
good,"Though I was only hired as a seasonal employee, the business provided excellent services with employees and provided a sufficient number of work hours while being attentive to schedules."
good,I enjoy working for JCPenney Salon because you can have a career as a stylist there and it provides opportunity to advance
good,Management is understanding and cooperative when it comes to balancing outside life and work. They are understanding of people currently going to school and working. They are also understanding of important life changes that can affect work abilities (for a short period of time).
good,"My daily task at work is to unload and open boxes of merchandise from delivery trucks every morning. After opening and sorting the merchandise we the support staff restock the store. Management is always checking in and working with us to get the job done as quickly as possible. My co-workers are always helping each other and it makes in one of the more enjoyable parts of the job. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the fast pace, it can be hard to keep up and make the deadlines due to the size of the trucks, which varies day to day."
good,The company is great to work for but there was not always fair treatment given to the associates and there was a large load of work and little help given.
good,jcp is a great company to work for when you need to learn multiple skills to help you in the future. you can learn how to deal with customers and really learn the needs of people.you can also learn how to develope your work enviorment with your coworkers and really build a team.the hardest thing about it is the management is not always on one accord.you have multiple bosses who each tell you to do diffrent things and often you are the one who ends up in the crossfire.it really starts to effect your productivity on certain projects.the best part is building a realashionship with your cutomers.you really start to become familiar with their likes and dislikes and use many diffrent ways to communicate with them and sell your product.
good,"We came into a dusty warehouse that had nicely laid out workstations. We stretched at the beginning of the day because we would be on our feet all day. We received point of sale equipment, including dell pc's. NCR equipment, printers, and scanners, on the line between the stations and take stuff off to work on. I would read the ticket that was attached to see the problems and then I would begin diagnosing the issues. I would log the steps I took to attempt to fix the unit. We were either able to fix it or if we didn't have the parts to fix it we sent it to the manufacturer. We would palletize that equipment accordingly. The management was ok. Our main supervisor was disconnected from our work, but she was a nice person. There was only one co-worker who refused to co-operate and did his best to irritate everyone around him regardless of who it was. He was distracting and working near him was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having units work after you find the problem and fix it, and have nothing else go wrong with it."
good,"I loved working at JC Penney the short time that I worked there. All of my co-workers were good people to work with, and management was extremely friendly and helpful. I loved meeting new people every day, although some of them were not very friendly at times. I enjoyed learning how to work the registers, and all the other new things I never even knew I didn't know!"
good,"This is really only a job that I take part in during breaks from school, however they do try to make associates comfortable."
good,Working at JCpenney I was able to meet some wonderful people from my co-workers to the customers that came into the store if I had the opportunity I would love to work for this company again
good,"Typical day at work starts with greeting from management , co-workers, and clients. Most enjoyable part of job is satisfied clients."
good,"although this job was far and seasonal it worked out for me. i learned a lot from this job , especially interacting with customers. co-workers and managers all got along it was really one big family everyone was treated equally and cooperation. honestly the hardest part was learning how to work with the cashiers and returning items. i ended up getting used to it and did everything quickly after."
good,"First of all, JCPenney is a great place to work. There are tons of really awesome people that work there. Lots of talented people that still wonder if tomorrow they will lose their job. "
good,JC Penney is an ok company to work for but its so large that employment experience can vary from site to site. Old way of thinking has JC Penney behind the times but if you are looking for work JC Penney is not a bad start.
good,"Great place to work, I loved the environment which was almost always fast paced and busy. Very friendly and close relationship to other team members. Management sometimes unprofessional and biased towards team members. Not very many hours or employees to meet the demand, otherwise a great place to work."
good,"enjoy the customers and the experience of helping others, the feedback from the customer service surveys helps improve the work environment."
good,"Overall really good experience in retail"
good,"Typical day 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Wednesday was my night to close the store, as well as every other weekend. those hours were typically 12:00 or 1:00 to 9:00 pm."
good,"Working at Jcpenny was great, I was a cashier/customer service. The best part would be working with my friends, I met a lot of nice people who were great to work with. I learned more about the ad setting part of retail that I had previously learned at kmart. My managers were kind and helpful."
good,"As a merchandise expeditor at JCPenney the days were very busy.  My position required receiving and processing women's apparel.  This merchandise was received on a daily basis (Monday thru Friday) from 8 am to 4 pm.  The merchandise had to be unpacked, hung, and priced with the desired retail before being distributed to the sales floor.  During the company's peak seasons (Christmas, Easter, mother's day, and Father's day) it was especially busy to the point of them hiring temp services to process the merchandise while I just received and entered the data.  It also would at time require overtime, as well as working some Saturdays to be sure the merchandise made it to the sales floor.  Within the warehouse area there was a total of eight workers, including myself.  We worked well together, and always came together to help another department get their merchandise out.  For instance if the associate that received and processed men's apparel and need to get out a large shipment of Great Dad t-shirts for father's day, we all stopped to be assured that the task got done."
good,"Working for JCPenney was great, they worked around my schedule and made me feel comfortable. I loved the people I worked with and learned a lot about retail and customer service."
good,"Lots of customer interaction processing purchases and returns."
good,I absolutely loved the people I worked with. That includes the management there as well. The good days out weighed the bad ones. I learned how to work with others as a team to get things done. Hardest thing about the job was when you were scheduled by yourself. The day usually dragged by. I did enjoy working there and I'm thankful I had the opportunity to.
good,The working culture at J.C. Penney was one of the most enjoyable I have experienced. The people are friendly and it makes working a lot less stressful.
good,"It was a good work environment. The management was helpful, knowledgeable and kind. However not much job security and not enough pay."
good,"The current District Manager is all about numbers.  Consideration for fewer hours, fewer employees and increased workload is not clearly ""not his problem"".  "
good,Well managed work environment. Positive daily morning pep talks. A nice break-room for the employees. All managers were approachable and easy to talk to.
good,"Answering phones, greeting customers, handling cash and credit card payments, as well as making online orders for customers."
good,"Really enjoyable people to work with, learn a lot from your coworkers. People are always there to help you with work or personal problems. Managers are a great support team. They work with my school schedule and they also really care about their associates."
good,Awesome experience working at JCPenney. Everyone was great to work with. Management definitely made the stressful holiday season easier to get through by having fun activities throughout the season.
good,JCPenney is a great place to work if you have little kids because of the flexible schedule. I enjoyed my co-workers because we work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is the sales audit because I get to think a lot to come up with an answer on how the registers were short.
good,"Good company to work for. The management is very understanding. Great training provided. A lot of students working there, that love chatting, when is closing time, so everybody else has to stay till the whole store is ready for next day. I don't think it is fair to the rest of the team."
good,"The typical day at work we always assist customers and help them with choosing or looking for the right item.  I learned to deal more with different level of people and dealing with a lot of shortages ( shoplifting incidents ) by informing or calling the loss department.  My co-workers were all friendly and fun to work with, the management as well were okay but since the company was facing a downfall we were informed that the company might not last another year at that location.  So far the hardest part or challenge i faced working there was doing the go backs all by yourself, and the most enjoyable part was the friendship you develop in each one of the employees who worked there."
good,Keeping clothing organized on a department sales floor. I would also help customers with questions or guidance towards what they were looking for. The management was nice. My co-workers were a variety of workers (good and bad). The hardest part of the job was the scheduling conflicts at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork and helping customers.
good,"Horrible return policies"
good,People were very hard working. a very fun environment. no complaints with any mangers. most managers were very cool and awesome.
good,"A typical day at work, since I worked during the winter season, was very busy. We worked especially hard around the week of Christmas and Black Friday. My customers were very welcoming and treated me like part of the family. The hardest part of working in JCPenney would probably have been dealing with customers that were unhappy about an item they got, that wasn't what they thought it was, or other such difficulties such as that. My job was to make sure the customer always left satisfied and I did just that, if not more."
good,"JCP encourages an energetic work environment. There is plenty of room for advancement. If you were a hard worker they compensated fairly when it was time for a raise. The job was never boring and a majority of the associates got along, not a lot of your typical retail drama."
good,"JC Pennay's was a great seasonal job. The managment treats you fair, and they were very flexible with my hours and availability,"
good,"great enivroment to work , decent pay , but not enough appreciation by upper management .  Great place to start off a sales career"
good,Get to deal with all different type of people; some are fun to work with and some are little hard but at the end of the day you have something accomplished.
good,The compensation is relatively competitive with other retailers. commission for jewelry is a small percentage and does not account for much of a paycheck boost. The store environment is nice and management is typical of large retailers. good for students and those close to retirement to get a few dollars here and there. management seems attainable if you work for it and get in good with the existing ones.
good,Associates whom I had the pleasure of working with were phenomenal. On occasion I came across customers who required a little more patience and time. Overall the amount of positive vibes I received from others helped make the day or evening run smoothly.
good,"Part time associate, loved the environment and people i worked with. Regular customers are what made the day even more enjoyable."
good,"Well, there was the small chance of being hired, but even after I was laid off, I was told that I might get back in, but then was told that they weren't after a week."
good,"A typical day at work would include stocking, folding, and helping customers check out. The employees are very friendly and willing to help you expand your knowledge within the company."
good,"very detailed oriented,  fast pace with lots of job duties.  need to be willing to work with the pressure of sales and compitition"
good,"The team I worked with was amazing, they always went out of their way to help customers and each other. The managers lead by example and were always proud of their team members when a job was well done. "
good,"JC Penney Salon provided the flexibility with my schedule which allowed me to work full time during the day and attend school in the evenings. Not only did they provide flexibility but it was a fast pace, fun working enviorment with something new changing everyday. I was able to assist management with administrative tasks such as but not limited to providing information on salon services, product knowledge, promotional advertisement to new or existing clients, data entry while maintaining a cleanliness, nest environment."
good,"Loved JCP. For the most part, interacted with customers and demonstrated a high level of skill in product knowledge and persuading customers."
good,"I learned a lot from my supervisor."
good,I had such a great time being apart of the JC Penny team in Kentucky. They really treat you like a family! The scheduling around Christmas time can be hectic but its worth it.
good,A typical day at JcPenney for me would be going to my department and immediately taking care of mantaining the items on the sales floor while also ringing up customers at a register and checking fitting rooms when needed. Ive learned how to speak and associate myself with customers in a friendly manner and be productive on the sales floor. Ive also learned the value of sales in all department stores. I have great co workers at my job and a great management staff. The hardest part of the day for me is making sure at the end of my shift i have gotten the sales floor clean and ready for the next day. Usually i am alone unless on a weekend when we are more busy. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new people. My interaction with other customers.
good,"A typical day at JC Penney was quick and easy to adapt to. The staff in general, is very supportive of every person that's employed there because the management team focuses on making the employees feel prepared and confident. The most difficult part of the job description for me, was providing customers applications to apply for store credit cards. It was hard remembering the steps at the beginning, after a few weeks I was able to earn to two application sales. For the most part, I enjoyed earning recommendations from customers and working together with my co-workers."
good,I learned how to work fast and not get caught up on one task it was exciting meeting new people daily The hardest part of the job was there was no room for advancement.
good,"I worked there for seven years. I loved it in the beginning. They had coverage on the floor which was great, but it got frustrating when you were the only one on the floor. Overall it was a good experience for a 19 year old."
good,"Long days and encouraged to not take days off as salary, enjoyed floor sets, processes and systems broken and need updating."
good,"A typical day consisted of being to work between 4-6am. I would help unload the truck and would either organize hang/folded merchandise by department and size. I would then put the merchandise in the department it belonged to. Sometimes with new merchandise I had to problem solve on the spot with moving racks and finding places to place new merchandise. I also had to make merchandise were in the correct price points/racks. I would also assist with pricing and signing. Sometimes the company would want a department changed around so I assisted with rearranging sets."
good,My employment here was enjoyable because I stayed busy and the environment was nice. I also gained the knowledge of how to provide exceptional customer service.
good,work goes by fast from assisting many customers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything the customers take out on a busy day. The co workers are great. I learned communication skills and how to deal with an angry customer.
good,"First thing would be to open the registers in my department and make sure the areas were customer ready.  Once the doors were opened we were to greet each and every customer walking by.  I went over blueprints, customer-made drawings with their measurements etc. to be able to give them a correct estimate.  Also with those measurements determining exact amount of drapery to be hung or other window treatment(s).  I loved the variance of customers with all the different personalities.  There was never a boring day and always something to learn!"
good,"A typical day involved inventory management, restocking merchandise and performing customer service. There was no absence of fun and friendly people, management was outgoing and willing to work with employees that were trying to finish their schooling. Co-workers were great, made so many friends in my time there that I still have today. The hardest part of my job involved the rotating hours which could be starting at 4am or staring at 9pm. The most enjoyable part was definitely my co-workers, such great people."
good,"A typical day at work required for me to punch in on time, as tardees were unacceptable, just like everywhere else, and greetings with coworkers. If you happened to work the first morning shift you were required to attend a small meeting that involved some kind of motivating speech from team leaders and staff management. Co-workers range in personality and background, you learn a great deal about tolerance and working as a team, and being productive. The hardest part of the job would be working with customers, although, most of the time it is an enjoyable experience if you enjoy working with people. On that same vein the most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with people and being able to help them with their needs."
good,The environment is nice. Most the coworkers and managers were nice. I get a decent amount of hours. Rate of pay could be higher . They really push credit applications and that can be annoying sometimes because if a customer doesn't want to open a credit card why would you force them? Otherwise it's a nice place to work.
good,"Typical Duties-"
good,"great ppl to work with, managers needs to have more communication  & be more organized. would work there again just at a different location if the money was right."
good,"A typical day at JcPenney consist of helping customers with items they can't find or helping customers match pieces of clothing together to make the perfect outfit. There are also responsibilities of taking out merchandise to fill in empty spots and putting back clothes from the fitting room in the proper spot. What I love most would be my co workers, even with those who don't get along with one another, we all know how to put our personal problems aside and work. What I enjoy most about my job is my manger and helping customers when they need it."
good,JCPenney stores suffered immensely when the mistake was made to replace the CEO and invest in new brands the customers didn't ask for. The store itself had good standing with its loyal customers and valued employees that changed over the past few years. Overall my experience working for the company taught me valuable skills and gave me great experience in management and problem solving. I was always happy to be a part of the JCPenney team.
good,"All employees were like family. We always help each other with keep the store clean from clutter. We always try our best to make all customers that come to the store feel welcome and to make it a fun place to shop."
good,"Working at this salon has given me an opportunity to work with a new demographic. It has sharpen my communication skills and enable me to be open minded and patient, which at times can be difficult dealing with exceptionally rude clientele. As far as the company goes they provide stylist with monthly training classes so we can keep up with trends and styles."
good,"Pretty good place to work, had issues with the former management team there but it was a really nice place to be. "
good,"Start my shift,went to assign register,greeted and rang up customers purchases ,help customers find items ,cleaned work area,did cash drops,placed new merchandise on sales floor.Help in fitting rooms clean rooms also.I learned about large stores operations are more detail orientated and more time conscience.The managers,they were very busy trying to be in two places at once sometimes.My co-workers,coming from different walks of life,we found ways to work well together.The hardest part was,when someone would try and return a damage item after one years time and it would be refunded.The best thing I really enjoyed greeting and talking to older customers who tend to want to talk when you help them find their items,I learned a lot about the history of the store when they were young."
good,"This location is not as busy as it used to be, loved my coworkers and management"
good,"At my store I'm the only person who does all the signing. I do every single ad set, price changes that occurs. As new product hits the salesfloor, I remake new sale signs. I'm constantly on the go, never ending day."
good,"Before you began your shift each day, a stand-up meeting a group of employees working that day) would gather together. The store manager would read sales figures, talk about upcoming events  and also hand out employee awards.  It was a great way to start your shift.  A typical work day would consist of assisting customers with their purchases, opening credit card accounts and ordered items via the JCPenney website.  It was also necessary to keep the sales floor and dressing rooms clean and tidy. "
good,During busy season you have to stay late till 11 or 12 which gets difficult. Schedules were flexible. They work well if you have another job or school.
good,"There was something new everyday, It was never just the same thing. I loved working with my co-workers it was like a big ole' family together we always made the best of everything if today wasn't good tomorrow will be better. The hardest part is always the public because everyone is different so you have to get to know your customer, everyone has there good and bad days and some like to take the bad days out on the employee. The manager's were just as equal as the employee, we all worked hard and did the best we could not just the one's to sit in the office while we worked we all worked together as a team."
good,Assist customers with their purchases & maintain the store appearance throughout the time on the floor.
good,"I currently work in retail and assist the customer's with purchasing their merchandise.  I am a team player and can multi-task throughout the day.  I am detail oriented, reliable, hard working, and a personable team player."
good,"Part of a team making the shopping experience easy and exciting for all customers of jc Penny shipping and receiving, received professional growth through my effort and performance. Interacting with customers. Ensuring they are satisfied with their purchaser"
good,"Servicing clients was always a typical day, all day long.  I learned that my immediate managers would ask me to work even through my vacation, but when I needed to be off for an emergency I could not take off with written notice.  The hardest part was working split shifts,and I enjoy meeting new clients."
good,"A typical day at work would be monitoring clothing racks and shelves so that all clothing is folder and in size order.  I also helped customers locate items and periodically used the register.  "
good,"This job was a great exprience to enter the world of customer service. Keeping the floor clean was very important, which included making sure every piece of clothing on the racks was neat and organized. The management also worked on the floor which was very helpful. I enjoyed the co workers everyone was very happy and friendly."
good,This was my first  full time opportunity in my work experience. The flexibility allowed me to transfer my job to where ever I needed during my time here making keeping myself employed ideal.
good,I would come in at 7 in the morning and work until 12 or 4 depending on my schedule. I had a great teacher showing me everything I needed to know. The management needs to be shown more about what a manager is supposed to do and hold the right people accountable. The best part of my job is learning as much as I could about retail and visual merchandising.
good,It was tough going in each day not knowing if you had a stable job. The atmosphere was stressful at times but the polite people and great management made the day alright. I enjoyed the job when the work was steady and full. The days went by faster. I didn't like it when the days where slow and no work for all employees. It was stressful knowing you where going to be sent home and not get your full hours day work.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers in purchasing jewelry in the jewelry department. I learned many different things at Jcpenney, such as better communication skills, and different ways to build relationships with the customers."
good,"I have worked there for 2 years now and it's a cool company they do some things to show appreciation for employees. The hardest part of the job would be packing higher units. The enjoyable part would be working with friends and the new people you meet, along with the activities they are starting to do for us."
good,There was always something for me to do to keep me busy even when there weren't any clients in the salon.
good,it was agreat job meet lots  new people the work wasgreat                                   was the for 26yr
good,"A typical day is greeted with team work and lots of friendly customers, hardest part of the job was falling asleep, it can get slow at times and the store jingles become lullaby's."
good,"Typical work day greeting and helping customers, while still working in and on department needs."
good,"Customer assistance"
good,"This job definitely has you on your feet, the staff is great here, very friendly and definitely wanting to please the customers. It is very tiring but it is worth the pay."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of restocking and organizing displays, both old and new; interacting with co-workers, management and customers; assisting customers in selecting items and  going into stock rooms to retrieve particular items for customers. The JC Penney management team was wonderful. All management was very knowledgeable and always willing to assist in any way possible. The hardest part of this job was listening to the same Christmas songs over and over again for eight plus hours per day. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know many new people every day on the sales floor."
good,It is a fun family type environment. The only negative thing is that it is hard to advance in this career.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 9 years I worked for JCPenney.  I started in commission sales, but started having trouble with hearing loss (which put an undue burden on customer interaction) and onset of rheumatoid arthritis (which made even a 6-hour shift nearly unbearable).  I moved into the office associate position, which I also loved.  Unfortunately, restructuring/downsizing eliminated what I had thought would be a stable job to carry me into retirement.  Another downside to this (or any retail) job is the fact that stores are busy when other businesses are not; therefore, all major holidays are basically off the table as far as spending time with family, joining in church/community holiday festivities, etc.  Management is usually good to work with you as much as they can, but when they need ""all hands on deck"", you have to remember that's what you signed up for.  On the plus side, the people are great - - made wonderful friends among both management and non-management!  The good benefits I enjoyed, sadly, may no longer be available since full time positions have been greatly reduced along with part time hours."
good,"Great benefits, pay and people.  Company has come a long way in the past couple years to get back on track to what JC Penney has always stood for."
good,"I loved working for JC Penney it was a great time helping the customers for the many reasons encountered, and such a beautiful feeling seeing the customers leaving with a smile of joy by getting a super great Customer Service given by me. I got to work pretty independently for the most part, there was always something to be done so I stayed active, and I liked the atmosphere."
good,"In order for me to start getting the commission i had to go through extra training to learn about all the different types of window treatments and what products we had to offer. Then i had to go through even more training to learn about the mattresses and other types of furniture that the store has to offer since i am in the Draper and Furniture department. A typical day of work is slow so i'm standing around busying myself in my department or helping fold clothes in the Kids department. My co-workers are wonderful, i work with older ladies in my department and they have become good friends though when i work i am typically alone for the whole 6 hour shift so i don't see them often or for extended periods of time. Management is decent. The hardest part of the job is learning the custom window program since we don't get a lot of custom orders so i haven't had much time to practice with it so its hard to help customers with custom orders when i have no one i can ask for help since i typically work alone and most of the managers don't know the system. The best part of the job is meeting interesting people and seeing them smile when you help them plan out window treatments for their homes or help them pick the right furniture to go with their color schemes. Also, some of the most memorable moments are from when i actually get to work with my co-workers (which is rare) and we talk and joke around with each other and i have someone there to help me when i get stuck."
good,"flexible hours."
good,"Working in retail sucks! But I loved the people whom I worked with. Management could use some work, but all in all, a pretty decent job."
good,Within your own depart you feel welcome as part of a team and the department managers are usually pretty good.  unfortunately most department personnel do not intermingle and make friends outside their own department
good,"Sometimes standing for a long time was really painful."
good,"A typical day: 1) Assisting customers with their clothing needs, 2) Doing everything necessary to keep the sales floor neat and well-organized, including, but not limited to: folding clothes, hanging clothes, organizing clothes and accessories, some cleaning, etc., 3) Ringing up customers and taking their payments, 4) Ordering on-line for customers, 5) Putting out new inventory, 6) Finding clothing at other JCP stores if the sizes or colors were not in stock, 7)Ticketing inventory, 8) Keeping the fitting rooms orderly, and 9) Taking credit card applications."
good,"It's a nice place to work  : there is always work to be done.  I've learned many things working at a JCPenney, such as pricing and signing, and monthly sets.  I have gained tons of customer service experience working there.  The people there are great everyone is friendly and everyone get along.  the most difficult part of my job is trying to do so much done is so little time since the company has cut down hours.  It has been a great experience there and I have enjoyed working at JCPenney."
good,I have learned a lot from Jcpenny. All different things new and exciting. My manger's are very helpful to me. They point me in the right direction. My co-worker's are my good friends. I get along with everyone great at the company. The hardest part of my job is when there's not enough employees and there is a lot of task's to be done.The most enjoyable part of me day is when i get my job done and getting it done fast. I like to help people also.
good,I learned how to open up more to customer and learn what there needs and want were and be able to assist them.
good,Every day is a busy day at Jcpenney. We see different faces everyday and many of our customers are clients so they shop frequently. Providing Customer Service has been a great experience for me and I enjoy helping others in every way I can.
good,The hardest part was with the change of CEO it changed a lot of store policies.
good,"I am responsible for managing operational processes of the store.  Ensure price changes get completed, visual updates throughout the store are being attended to, certain scans are getting completed on a daily basis. The best part of this job is the people I work with.  They are the hardest working people and it makes coming to work much easier because these people will work for you and ensure any project or task will get completed. Hardest part of this particular job is getting the ""buy in"" from associates when it pertains to company programs and not much of a work/life balance.  The biggest part of my job role that I have learned is planning and delegating."
good,I love working with great people.  The company had some major changes while I was there which caused me to leave.
good,My customer coming back and satisfied with the business items.
good,"Nice Co-workers"
good,"Being able to help customers with their purchase,typical day would be helping with projects and cleaning your quad area acknowledging customers that enter the store. Hardest part of job was the pressure to meet credit card application quota and asking everybody. My co-workers were nice and helpful if needed, most enjoyable part of the job is knowing u were able to help somebody with getting ready for prom or picking out dresses for the bridal party."
good,"Excellent place advancement and reaching personal career goals. Meetings held each morning to motivate staff and inform staff about previous day's numbers. Open door policy with managers. typical day at work morning meetings check numbers from day before. I learned that team work makes the dream work, because J CPENNY value working together and delivering impeccable customers service. The hardest part of my job was building and scouting for new stylist and being short staffed. As salon manager, I worried to much about not completing tasks because of short staffing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the benefits and discounts."
good,"it was an ok place to work."
good,"Old Family style Insurance company"
good,A typical day working at JCP was simple. All I had to do was make sure the sales floor looked nice and neat and make sure I was giving the best customer service possible. I learned a great amount of things there just for the job alone. For example running the cash register came very easy to me. Management was well also I got along with my managers well same with my co workers it was a very friendly environment. The hardest part of the job for me was within myself when the store got really dead as in no customers coming in and just walking around fixing stuff that was already taken care of got very annoying but I dealt with it because I knew that is why I was hired. Not to just stand around and get paid to do nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and just establishing a slight relationship with them.
good,"The continuing education offered was excellent. However, this job did not allow me to spend enough time behind the chair and eventually this was the main reason that I needed to make a career move."
good,Help customers with purchases and merchandise. Set up displays.
good,"typical work day is very busy, have to ring customers ,clean store and answer phone calls all at once. I learned to be very patient and understanding of other people. Time management is very important its a very fast paced environment. Coworkers are very friendly and some of them are like  family to me. The hardest part of the job is sometimes it can get overwhelming because I may be the only one ringing and there is ten people in line and the phone is constantly ringing. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"A typical day of work consist of waiting on customers, and merchandising the sales floor to impact profitable sales. In addition, coaching associates to give their top job performance. At J.C. Penney there are great people to work with. As a member of the management team, we always strive to make store a great place to shop for our customers, and great place for employees to work. I have learned that the customer is valuable to a company. In the past years tribulations of the company, I have realized that the customer's experience in a place of business, will affect the way they patronize a business. The hardest part of the job is accommodating a customer when an item is no longer available, and they wish to have no other item. I don't like not satisfying a customer. The most enjoyable part about the job is the morning meetings. It gets everyone in the store prepared and ready to demonstrate excellent customer service."
good,I worked with different personalities and enjoyed different customers as well.  I learned about different styles and how different colors people like with their complexion.
good,"I have great bosses.  Lots of folding clothes, very quiet with very few employees to talk to."

good,Overall it was a great experience and great opportunity for me learning the system and the way of their business.
good,"Working for the company was great, the people i worked with from all levels were amazing. They helped keep me focused and driven. I loved working with some many different people from all around the world and getting to know about them. I didnt like disappointing customers and making them upset with me, i only ever wanted to help them and not cause them to get upset."
good,"I enjoyed working at JCP because my co-workers in my dept. were extremely caring.  We were all there for each other when needed.  With the different schedule changes if was difficult to prioritize personal life events, but they were willing to make it work as much as possible."
good,JC Penny is a nice place to work. Good co-workers and  nice atmosphere. The only draw back is difficult customers. Management was great.

good,"A typical work day at JCP started with meeting with my immediate supervisor to get a rundown of what the day would like and what department I would be needed in that day. Throughout the day I would speak to customers, help them with anything they needed, and even had conversations with them. My co-workers were very friendly and were good at working together.

My managers and co-workers were very helpful when i begun working and helped me learn a lot through my training, They taught me that it was okay to ask for help in a situation and I learned how to fix the situation myself. The hardest part of the job was having upset customers. It was also enjoyable when i helped out the customers find what they were looking for and seeing them smile."

good,A typical day is very busy and fast passed with many different projects throughout the day.
good,"Take care of their employee."
good,"I started out in the mail area of this department and worked my way into the CS-accounts rep. It was very busy and you had to take care of returns for the store managers of each store. You also had to get the credit approved from the vendor in order to get the billing taken care of. It was hard work but, it was really satisfying to get the accounts resolved and the stores credited for damaged goods. I liked the fact that we were a team and had meetings to make sure that we had all of the help we needed from our manager."
good,I very soon discovered that management was not up to my expectations when it came to organization and fairness.
good,Its a good place to work with if you are comfortable working in shifts. Very nice and friendly people.
good,"I worked in several departments so always learning about new products which I enjoyed.  Everyone was a pleasure to work with and got along very well.

My confidence to speak and stand in front of people and speak has grown tremendously."
good,Working at JC Penney was very enjoyable. A typical day included several refunds and exchanges as well as online orders.
good,Great co-workers and management team.  Felt like you were working with family and friends.
good,"I personalty like working at JcPenney."
good,"I learned so much at this company. I began as a telemarketer enrolling JCPenney credit card customers for 90 day no-cost accident insurance. I obtained my Life and Health Insurance license in all 50 states.  I was promoted to Supervisor within 1 year managing up to 30 telemarketers;responsible for training,coaching employees;doing daily,weekly,monthly reports;performance reviews and enhancing sales performance."
good,managers were awesome. there really was no hard parts if the supervisor saw struggle they sent someone to help. the most enjoyable was replenishment just getting to work and chit chat with coworkers after the store was closed.
good,"wished i could of stayed,but i had to relocate. they did send me through the actual csr 1 and 2,and taught me how to decipher the credit bureau."
good,"Jcpenney is a wonderful company to work for.  There are many options that are available.  A typical day would be winning together with customer service and credit apps. Talking to employees about how they are, and how are we going to achieve goals and expectations today. The most enjoyable part of my day would be to helping a customer to look great.  Also, for that customer to have a smile on their face before leaving the store and to tell me that they will be coming back. Building relationships with customers, that can't be broken.  The employees here are so unique in character.  I am amazed everyday. The hardest part of my job is when there are no relationships being built in store with customers or employees."
good,"A typical day at work consist of maintaining a clean and organized sales floor, ordering product for costumers, and ringing up merchandise."
good,"assisting customers with shopping needs, helping in catalog and credit departments, stocking and organizing the sales floor. I learned a lot about teamwork. Management was great to work with, as were my coworkers. Hardest part of the job was the hours. Especially during the holidays. Most enjoyable part was working with the customers. "
good,"Great place to work, Provide recognition for service. Diversity"
good,"Cashier, Stock and Inventory, Customer service"
good,"I was a Senior in High School when I worked at JcPenneys. They were always able to work around my school and other activities that I was in. Unfortunately I had to leave, so that I could focus on a Senior Paper that was a requirement to graduate. "
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed the customers a lot. Varied work schedule.  "
good,"love this company, however it is out of business. I started out in collections & did credit granting also "
good,"JCP is a good place to work for supplemental income. It's kind of hard to make it your only source of income, but it can be done. It has a positive environment, and it has some great products, so the 25% discount is great."
good,"I work part time at J..C Penney, but enjoy the daily interaction with customers.  I like working in the Fine Jewelry department because of the product knowledge that is required. I have worked off and on with fine jewelry for 30 years starting at Montgomery Wards. I enjoy the people I work with and the management staff is quick to help with any issues that come up. Our store has made many improvement recently and has become an even better place to work"
good,Great experience. Flexible with time to accommodate school endeavors. Able to build on people skills and communication skills. Not provided with enough hours. 
good,"I started as a fine jewelry associate and worked my way up to working in the personnel office.  I opened the store every morning to let the support team in, then I did payroll and accounting."
good,"Great second job, worked with a lot of cool people. Bosses were really relaxed. Only had 15 minute breaks but they would let it slide if you were a little late. Good discount and easy hours and money. Worst is when its holiday season and they were open pasted 12 and you had to clean for hours but it wasn't that bad"
good,Jcpenney is a great place work. I learned different things at this store for example people skill by greeting customers and being able to connect with them. There wasn't any hard part about my job everything was pretty simple. My co-workers were awesome.
good,"While working in the styling salon, it wasn't all that great.  The management was very unorganized with everything. She ended up getting fired and everything was just a mess. I started out as full-time and then ended up working part-time because of the customer traffic. I have learned how to deal with picky customers and their nasty attitudes. My co-worker's were all friendly to get along with."
good,I learned a lot while I was there. The management was willing to help out. Everyone got along and acted professional. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see people happy with their new hair style. 
good,"Any day was a pretty good day "
good,a company with a good track record in customer service and yet the latest changes may occur otherwise
good,"Test & Checks for District Level LP"
good,"I loved the customers that came and I loved the work! I operated the cash registers, closed up the store area, sold make up and skin care products, and did make up tutorials. The job was very enjoyable. "
good,"I liked working at JcPenney. A typical day was I came in to work I set up my station, I worked on my clients, I socialized with my fellow workers, I cleaned my station and some of the salon and I went home. I set my own hours that I worked. I had a lot of on the job training there which is always beneficial to a person's growth. I worked with many different women witch was both good and bad because I met a lot of great women. The bad part was that sometimes tempers flew over stupid things. That was the hardest part of the job dealing with the tempers. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers. The management was some better than others."
good,Typical day at work: Recovery and customer assistance. I enjoy the environment and my co-workers are all friendly and helpful.
good,They worked really well with me as I was going to school. I really liked how nice they were and how they treated their customers.
good,On a regular day at work i would come in go to my assigned area get my keys out safe.
good,- Typical work day is around 9 hours where you interact with your team members and ensure that they are on task and productivve
good,"Supervised merchandising, asset management, customer service and facilities management. Created marketing programs in compliance with corporate procedure to ensure fulfillment of quarterly sales goals. Responsible for training, scheduling and motivation of staff. Coached staff to increase cross sell ratio and shop performance. Reviewed and adjusted weekly schedules to ensure consistency and adherence to payroll. Organized nightly sales floor restocking process.Handled customer service and employee concerns"
good,"had fun good people, mangement was a some, customer service was the best"
good,"This job was really great because everyone was a part of the team and nobody was left out, It was a very fun and loving environment to work in. The management was great because they were never overly critical and they were always willing to do what they could to help."
good,"A Typical day at work is slowish pace but there are lots things to do to keep you active. I learned if you work as a team you can get a lot done.The management is fantastic if you have any problems they will do there best to fix it, the coworkers were all friendly and fun to be around. The hardest part is doing hanger pick-up lol but its a place that you don't mind working at"
good,loved working at jcp when i first started..but quickly realized there was too much gossip...i absolutely loved my co workers though. and i loved helping our customers find everything they needed!
good,"A typical day at work consist of inventory control, data entry, prioritize, leadership, detail orientated,and communication."
good,I would try to keep the workers and building safe. I learned a lot about fire systems. My co- workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was losing it! The most enjoyable part of the job was working my co-workers.
good,"JC Penney is a great place to work at. They have a great environment, however, there is not a lot of advancement."
good,"Loved the entire management staff. Great crew, always dependable and honorable. Management really looks out for the employees. Just good atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at JC Penney working with customers is great, greeting, helping those that really appreciate your help you build a relationship with those customers."
good,"I work at JCP part-time for extra income because I freelance and the opportunities sometimes come all at once or not consistently. The company is very customer focused and yet is concerned about work/life balance. They treat most employees respectfully. The company is undergoing many changes in branding and management right now, and needs to become more focused."
good,This company was a very comfortable setting. Had the opportunity to improve pofessional and business skills.
good,"JCP was a very relaxed and friendly work environment. I loved the people I worked with, they were understanding with your life style and would try to work with it with very few complications with the scheduling. It was easy to keep busy and you could take a reasonable amount of breaks. Supervision was minor, though present. You didn't feel like you had someone breathing down your neck. However, the credit card applications were pressured and your hours depended on how many you got. It would make it difficult because most of the customers we were getting already had a card or they were not interested in one at all. The general public the store was getting was very unfriendly, impatient, and sometimes completely unreasonable. There were many occasions where customers verbally, sexually, and physically harassed our employees with little action to control the customers. There's also no real room for promotions in the company without being there for years at a time and pay was just over minimum wage with no real pay advances."
good,"I worked as a Full Time Seasonal Employee, and all of the Seasonal Employees I worked with were very helpful, and really friendly."
good,JCPenney is a great company to work for. All of my managers and co-workers have been amazing in the 5 years I've been there.
good,I enjoyed working with others and meeting new people. JCPenney had a warm and inviting environment.
good,"During my seasonal position, I enjoyed working with some of the compassionate, friendly, and team-oriented workers of my career. I was given an opportunity into retail and I enjoyed learning and product placement, re-ticketing, and team work. I would recommend."
good,It was a good job that I had taken to at the time becomeing the leader of the Home department that I worked in.
good,"A typical day starts by logging on computer, checking what has to be done for the day and setting up your day to accomplish as much as possible. Everyday was a learning experience and there was a lot of training and updating for the job. The work environment was fun and supportive. The hardest part of the job was trying to make all the customers happy. The thing I miss the most is the customers and my working associates, so much so that I go back and visit from time to time. It was a very enjoyable job."
good,"For the most part, I very much enjoyed working for the company and would consider very strongly going back. For the employee who doesn't get too close to co-workers and supervisors, this is ideal. Because the sales support specialist is the one who deals with the incoming and setting of the merchandise, you'll pretty well learn the entire store and what comes and goes. The hardest part was being apart of two separate agendas; corporate To Do's and store management To Do's never seemed to match, though communication seemed to be quite clear. My position is only available during the holidays unless you quite enjoy the wee-hours in the morning, which I found enjoyable once getting over the 3:45 am alarm. Managers and co-workers seem to work well together, though I'm sure personal preferences differ. Overall, 4 stars."
good,"I honestly believe there are some stores that wouldn't be too incredibly terrible to work at but, that being said, I did not enjoy this job. The supervisors and manager played favorites and only expected some employees to actually do their job. You never knew how long you were going to be there if you closed because you had to stay until it is done regardless of what your schedule says. all in all, very bad experience."
good,Going to work was a joy. I learned how to be a team player. It was at JC Penney that I learned customer service and also work ethic. The hardest part of the job was being a sixteen year old girl working with other teenagers. There was a little workplace drama once in a while. My favorite part of the job is the life long friends I was able to make. And also being able to help people out.
good,Liked the job left because moved out of state. Managers were nice and always available for any questions.
good,"management is pretty good and fair. Co- workers with nice and fun, reward for good workers"
good,Steady inbound calls from customers inquiring about their merchandise they ordered online or by phone throughtout the day. I learned that the customer is always right and to not close a call until I am certain that they are pleased. The management team there could have communicated a little more often with new hires about our progress and the co-workers were friendly but focused on their job as they should be. The hardest part of the job was being there as early as six in the morning handling calls very early and the most enjoyable part was placing orders for customers and helping them make choices on the web site.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. Although there were long hours, they didn't mind paying overtime, which is hard to find now days. there was a lot of travel because if you worked at one store you worked at them all."
good,JCPenney is a good company. Plainfield warehouse was closed.
good,"Really enjoyed this position, dealt with different customers every day."
good,I enjoyed working for JCPenney. It is a great company that is currently going through some challenging but exciting changes. Changes of this magnitude create an anxious environment. Many positions have been eliminated and it is unclear if there will be more. That said I support the store in Mishawaka and have a good relationship with everyone.
good,"Greeting customers by welcoming them to the store, making sure they have a wonderful shopping experience. Assuring the customer finds everything they are looking for making them happy and satisfied. Properly checking out their merchandise in a timely manner still providing a great customer service. Working with other co-workers to assure they are also giving customer service. Working with management to assure that are standards of the store are being upheld. The hardest part is maintaining good customer service at all times even during difficult customers and the enjoyable part of the job is knowing when the customer says they enjoyed their shopping experience at our store and that great customer service was a part of it."
good,"the most enjoyable thing about my job is having many tasks to do each day and working with a great staff. Didnt have a typical day, every day was different with different job duties."
good,"Jcpenny is a great place to work therfore alot of downfalls have took place in the corporation, meaning no sales no hours, so thats where i stood in place and afterall raising two boys i couldnt have let that take affect on me. But if you ask my opinon about the company in general its a good enviroment after working for the company for two years its quite well in place for taking this downfall. But i couldnt stand by it with the way things were heading."
good,"Built on a solid legacy, high integrity and dedicated assosiates."
good,"If you enjoy a job where things can change at any moment this is the place for you. Supervisors/Lead Experts must think on their feet and make quick decisions as the needs of the store change from day to day, and sometimes from hour to hour."
good,Everyday was a learning experience. From the weekly improvements to advance customer satisfaction.
good,"Everyday working at J.C. Penney was different. My job varied depending on what needed to be done that week. One week we would do clearance, the next was getting the store to set. I really enjoyed set weeks at work. The hardest part of my job would have to be when things throughout the store need to be moved to another area. It is very detail oriented and time consuming. Most of my managers were very helpful and enjoyable to work for."
good,"They do work with employees if possible, they are also caring when things go terribly wrong in your life. The ages vary due to position, but the people a usually easy to work with."
good,customer service was my number 1 objective then keeping the mens department to par worked with great people who i enjoyed being around
good,A typical day included learning about the promotions for the day and setting up the displays with the appropriate discounts signs. The majority of my co-workers were friendly.
good,"A typical day of work usually consisted of me handling the cash register and helping customers find what they need. I learned how to how to communicate successfully with others to reach my goals. My coworkers were all great. We looked out for each other and helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was leaving actually. I always stayed a little later making sure all my jobs were done correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the competitions we held. It was always fun to win pins and treats,"
good,It was a fun place to work. My first retail job that promoted me to management. learned alot about customer service and leading other associates. Sad that I had to leave due to having a baby and needed less hours to be with him.
good,I currently work at JcPenney. I work in the childrens department.
good,A typical day for me was to satisfy customers meet quotas for credit applications. I learned that right is right and wrong is wrong even if your manager is doing it. I love my co-workers and I love people. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of shift. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and seeing them happy.
good,Management always stands behind its workers when appropriate
good,"The management was not much, but most of them are gone now. Its easy to move up with the company as long as you keep your business to yourself."
good,Productive. It was a great place to work. Benefits was good. Job was easy.
good,Your day starts with a morning meeting and shortly after the store opens. After opening you are readily available to assist customers with their purchases and to organize your department in free time.
good,Assisting customers. Running cash register. Management was ok. Co workers were helpful. The job was not hard at all. I enjoyed the consistency of the job.
good,I enjoy working with people being able to help others with isuues with finding different clothing.
good,Very busy place at Christmas. Alway busy. Managers are very helpful.
good,"-daily interaction with customers, restocking, merchandising, scheduling, hiring, training"
good,"I mainly run sales numbers and managed the business on the sales floor. I dug deeper to find out why certain entities on the sales floor were taking a loss and the best way to fix them. I also trained, coached and provided feedback to floor supervisors and associates to improve performance. I also made sure my customer service scores were where they were supposed to be( above the district average if not the best)."
good,"As a Replenishment Associate, I would meet with the other team members early in the morning, usually around 4 or 5 am to place merchandise out on the sales floor. We would get the meerchandise ready the day before and make sure that everything was in order and tagged correctly. We would follow the managers plans on how to place the merchandise so it would look neat and very attractive to our customers. The hardest part of the job was having the time to get all merchandise out before the store opened. We worked very hard and quickly to make sure everything was correct. I loved working with a team, even though sometimes people would show up late or not want to work, but we worked through those problems together. When the store opened, we would assist customers as needed. Also, I would assist the pricing department with price changes of merchandise, which was a daily activity. Also, we had to learn all the brands from jeans to jewelry, to purses, all merchandise in order to be able to price correctly, and inform our customers of the products we carry. Another great opportunity was when I was asked to be a Bra Specialist. I learned all about the different brands and how to properly fit a woman with the correct bra."
good,Work was good. You had your days when we did more than our share of work. It was our jobs; so it was okay.
good,"When I got to work the shipment was ready to unload. Everything came off the truck sorted by department. Then we went to are areas and stock what came in until 15 min. before the store opened.The pallets went into the back and we only brought out what would not block costumers from walking around. A costumer could stop us for help. Then we put up what stock didn't fit on the shelves in the stock rooms and pulled what we needed to fill. My co-workers where hard working, as where my bosses. This is the job I learned to plan ahead, stick to it, and be flexible. All my bosses did my job before I had it."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers that come in and are looking for certain items. The worst part is to tell them that we might had discontinue what they are looking for. It's nice to work for a store that the customer is first. I always stop what I am doing and go attend to that customer if he or she needs it. Now that we are an everyday price store, the associates have more interaction with the customers now because we do not have all the crazy sales going on like we used to have."
good,"J C Penney was great for the first couple of years but I would not recommend working there as career. While management and coworkers were for the most part good, the job itself could become taxing. Retail is not for the lighthearted."
good,"Great working environment with covered parking, on site gym, physician, cafeteria, and sundry shop. The hardest part of the job was the size of the company made decision-making somewhat cumbersome. The most enjoyable part was working with a great group of co-workers."
good,get in get straight to work ink tagging garments that were going out also scanning in and out the merchandise for customers or loading lines
good,I didn't appriciate the job but I loved every bit of it. Plenty room for advancememt with benefits. Overtime was mandatory.
good,"I was with J. C. Penney longer than any other company. This does not mean that the job was perfect (no job is), but it was a good company to work for. I started out in furniture sales (then they closed the department), then went to work in the catalogue department, and then the warehouse. The specifics are in my resume. It was within walking distance from home (four blocks), and so there was practically no commute. My co-workers were very good (the best part of the job), but the pay was only mediocre. For the last three years there my pay was frozen at that level because they said that was the top level of pay for someone in my position. The benefits were good, and the work/home balance was easily managed."
good,"Sign in, go to department where I worked and review the status of the day with the manager and fellow associates. Check the status of the registers and other inventory before any customers approached for service if possible. Management at the company was always helpful and pleasant to work for. All of my co-workers were a delight to work with and we were always helpful to one another. The hardest part of the job was waiting during low sales cycles and enduring very low pay. The most enjoyable was the enjoyment working with customers and making them happy with their selection of merchandise."
good,"JC Penney was a great company to work for, I enjoyed it."
good,"Daily meeting, work assignments given and trust given that employees will complete assignments on schedule. Great group of people to work with."
good,I worked in the jewelry department and loved it. had great peers and management but pay was low.
good,I know that I have been successful with my job when my customer has left the store happy with their purchase.
good,"A typical day started very early in the morning around 5 or 6 where I was the dedicated shoe department pricing specialist. This is where I had a listing and signage for current sales, prepping for future sales and markdowns. The people on this team sometimes combined efforts with each other to minimize the work. The hardest part of this job was when there were one day major sales and then having to go back to the original signage. Since I had shoes I had to touch every shoes to make sure the pricing was correct. The most enjoyable part was being able to really know the store, the team I worked on, and my manager."
good,"It's a good job if you like being around people, during the hoildays are very stressful, long hours of cleaning. mangers are helpful."
good,A typicall day at work would start off with a morning meeting and then handing out job assignments for the day.
good,This was a great place to work while attending college.
good,JCPenney is just a nice & friendly place to work. Great management and associates! It's like we are all a family!
good,JCPenney is a great place to work. Your hours are flexible and the people that work there are great.
good,My co-workers were a lot of fun and always had my back if I needed help. I felt like family instantly. We would joke around but still get our work done. We would hang out outside of work also. It was a wonderful work enviroment
good,"It was easy to work there, the only con was all of the 2 and outs. Yuppp"
good,It gave a decent amount of hours has a great training program very fun place to work
good,They were very understanding on what your hours needed to be if you had school and what not. It was hard to get off for holidays.
good,J C Penney's is a fair place to work. They provide adequate training and a decent hourly wage.
good,"Pricing and signing team, was a great team to join. That is until the new CEO dismantled the team. And everyone quit."
good,Great place to start into the work force and for someone trying to work through college.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. Learning new things, an being a team."
good,Every great place for people to work the management was very flexible
good,It is a good entry level position. It teaches you about customer service in the retail environment. You learn how to work as a team. And you have a lot of responsibilities. There is not a dull moment because there is always something to do.
good,"My co-workers were courteous and friendly. I was well trained on the cash register and products, and I enjoyed the customers. I was able to give them my schedule and make changes if I had to."
good,Always and very nice and friendly people and always customers 1st there! I love it there when I was there because I got hired in for seasonal help there
good,"Jcpenney is a great place to work at but if you're new they will treat you differently, have you doing most of the work but their are friendly staff and some that's not so friendly but overall its a great place to work at once you get a hang of it."
good,"Fun company, fun people. Always something fun going on to inspire employees, great employees discounts. Lots of potlucks. Simple dress code, everyone is a team player."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me helping customers find items around the store. I would also check them out at the register. I worked in the returns and exchange department as well. Working at JCPenney was fun  most days and a very productive working environment.
good,"Associates are valued and recognized"
good,"- Help and understand customers with the items."
good,Everyone there is amazing and caring. The leadership is very helpful and understanding. The hours were not the best though but it's an amazing first job.
good,I loved my coworkers and our manager was a genuinely nice person. We all looked out for each other and helped each other. The relationships I made will be hard to replace.
good,Great workplace. It could get really slow and boring sometimes but it would be a welcome reprieve after rushes. Pay was low. Hours were very flexible but sometimes you wouldn't be scheduled at all. Extra pay for getting people to apply for credit cards. It isn't very much but it helped if you got many applications.
good,Good leaders and team members work together in a collaborative manner. good place for some one to start their career as the organization provides good learning opportunity
good,I enjoy working here.  Fantastic group of people.  Excellent associate discount.  Flexible hours.  Love commission sales.  I feel the base rate should be higher since this is the most secured department within the store.
good,Good place to work. Major lack of communication. Work varied from hard to simple. Typical day at work was matching items to orders to be packed and shipped.
good,I worked in the salon and loved the environment and my co-workers but could not get along with management. Jc Penny felt it was best to hire someone with more manager experience than they had in the hair industry and any salon who thinks that way will loose both clients and stylists
good,The work at JCPenney is easy but there’s not much job security right now seems like retail business has it’s challenges right now since a lot of people shop online instead of going to the stores . We’ve had a decrease in our inventory.
good,My time at JCPENNEY  especially the Dyersburg tn location has been nothing but amazing and continual growth especially when it comes to interacting with our long term customers. They help us succeed. I just wish management was more consistent
good,Throughout the years JCPenney has attracted excellent people. Great coworkers and leadership make the job more enjoyable. Compensation is good and location is desirable.
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere. The salon was a good place to work and it provided flexible scheduling. My direct management was easy to work with as were my coworkers.
good,"Most of the time , is a good place to work customer service is very good and employee, are most of  then very helpful , Store overall is very organized."
good,"Schedules are fixed, however, JCPenney was willing to work me. They worked availability and my schedule changed at home, they adjusted my schedule from full to part time."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at JCPENNEY. I worked well with others as well as alone"
good,"Every day is changing and we are all energetic and ready to win. Everyone wants to see people succeed and grow within the company. "
good,I learned cash handling really well. There really wasn’t a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part is seeing a customers smile. Working at JCPenney’s is a good starting job for teens.
good,The job was fun great people and the job was pretty straight forward if you like shopping there then the job should be good. Only problem with me was the low pay.
good,Fast pace job. Everything usually move smoothly working there flexible hours. Great managers all help when needed. Just when you want to move up there it take to long and you dont usually get good raises.
good,Very fast paced job. Always on your work and steady working. Not the place for just sitting around. Typical warehouse work. Had to pay attention to the work and what you was doing at all times.
good,"Your salary depends on the area and clientele in that area, and their economic situation. Can you upsell to more than one person? Yes. But can you upsell to all the people? Likely not, but try anyway."
good,"As a stylist my pay scale is a little different than floor associates, I get hourly and commission. I've been full time for 3 years, and it's been pretty great. They offer a 401k with a 5% match, they have health insurance (you pay into), they offer PTO (a percent of your hours). There are a few more benefits, but those are the ones that stick out to me. It's a good job. It's a lot of fun."
good,"JCPenny is a nice job for beginning stylist it can give you the practice on the retail side as well with saling product, booking appointments, and customer service. They have training class as well so you dony have to go outside for your courses that are required by the state."
good,This is a very first good job for anyone looking to get started in customer service. This job helped me get the tools I needed to succeed and better myself in other careers.
good,Management is great very understanding to your scheduling and eager to help in anyway possible don't really have a chance to move up but a good place to work
good,"Working at jcpenney in major appliance sales was a good learning experience. Working here gave me a lot of sales experience, taught me about appliances and product knowledge."
good,Loved working at JCPENNEY. Great 18 years. Pay is the only thing they need to improve. People are great. Leadership are excellent. A lot of years of experience.
good,"I learned so much about retail, sales, sales goals at this position"
good,Worked here for about 3 years and was an amazing experience for a first job. Good coworkers and great environment just wish the pay was a little higher.
good,I learned to drive and operate cherry picker forklift and how to use RF scanner. I really enjoyed working there and the supervisor looked for a reason to get rid of me. I never missed a day at work but was let go for putting a smilely face on a box i was writing the date on he called it graffiti. It was more personal than it was professional
good,"This was my first job and I absolutely loved it. I was young and eager to make money. I worked at JCP and went to college at the same time, they worked perfectly with my schedule. Before every semester the store manager would go around asking all college students their school schedule so he can rearrange our working schedule with our classes."
good,This can be a difficult job if you are bad with confrontation. There will be customers who are difficult and abrasive. There should always be a senior member there to help you though.
good,Relaxing environment to work in. Ability to lift and stock shelves and fold clothes is a must. Money management and closing out registers is needed as well. customer service is key!!
good,The minimum wasn’t right and the work was too much specially for the people closing . There is too much to pick up from the floor and some people expect to get some items searched through the phone while having a long line.
good,"Nice place to work, The day is very active and on your feet. The management is very understandable and easy to get along with. It is fast-paced but you're never expected to stress about your job."
good,It is a hard place to work if you want to move to full time. They prefer to hire part time workers. Good place to make money for fun money. I like working there.
good,"It was a great place to work but instead of putting you on the schedule they would not have you working for a week then call you in and expect you to be available. They need to do better with scheduling and management cooperation. The environment was fun and friendly, everyone got along. They did a great job of training, Holidays can be hard but if you work with a partner it makes it easier. The benefits are nice if you plan to be their for awhile."
good,Great environment to work in. Learned lots of new things about retail and management. Did not always agree with general managers management style. You need to be a leader.
good,"The hours are very flexible and management is helpful at all times. Most workers are given a general  area to work and maintain according to their strengths. A person who's strong at the register isn't going to be placed on the floor very often, a person who is strong both on the floor and at the register will act as backup for the register and typically maintain the floor."
good,"Working at JCPenney was great. If you have no experience or are looking for a first job do it here; the joe battle location has a great work environment, good opportunities to advance and management support its employees; but do keep in mind that most employees only get part-time, it will be hard work for little pay and the store polices are strict. Finally like most retail places you will be working directly with customers and all that comes with it."
good,"The environment at JCP is slow-paced and has good work ethics. Sometimes it can be difficult to ask management for assistance, but your coworkers will be there to help."
good,"I actually really enjoyed my time here. The only reason I left was because I didn't fill out my vacation paperwork so they had to fill out my week visiting my fiancee as unexcused absences. Otherwise, I felt generally encouraged working there and actually enjoyed my job. I told my manager I wanted to learn Jewelry and was allowed a shift the next week to train. Definitely recommend"
good,fue uan experiencia laboral muy exitosa aprendi a desempenarme mi trabajo a conocer diferentes culturas lao cual m ayudoa desarrollarme mas facilmente para poder brindar un buen servicio al cliente feliz de haver sido parte de esta compania
good,"The job as excellent, but you had different work sites in building. It was a giant workplace requiring good physical condition. Lunch breaks were short. Excellent leadership, especially the immediate Captain. The drive to an from work was long a tiresome with a lot of traffic. In winter it was difficult getting to work."
good,"I really appreciated how flexible they were with my college schedule. I also truly enjoyed the management and my co-workers. The job was easy enough for a part-time job, however, was challenging enough so that I didn't get bored."
good,"Fun place to work. Company does not promote or advertise salon, so salon is very slow. Very few walk ins. Great pay, awesome benefits. Management is very fair."
good,I learned how to interact with various different types of people. All the employees there were very welcoming. Management understood your schedule and were flexible with you.
good,"Training lasted about 2 weeks, but I wasn't trained for everything all at once. Started truck work 3-4 weeks in, was trained as I went, my assistant supervisor couldn't believe I started with no retail experience, as I knew the names of the ink tag tops and bottoms and learned quickly. The  truck work wasn't too hard. About two trucks a week, and easy to breakdown. Fairly nice first job. Management is nice and understanding. Holidays are mandatory, even if availability prevents it. Most coworkers were polite and friendly. I learned how to sign, retag, clearance, and liquidate merchandise, as well as breakdown truck shipments of pallets and put clothing out, and rfid inventory (wasn't part of my job title)."
good,great leadership and they are willing to assist and train. they trully care for the well being of their employees and want them to succeed in their job
good,Great company to work for. Everyone seems to have fun yet still work hard at what they do. I enjoy working with my coworkers and my General Manager. Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I started at 9.50 per hour, and got a raise to 9.73 6 months later. The most of the employees were fun to work with, almost like a family. "
good,"Great company flexibility on schedule ,and works with employees. By having family leave and also great store with week sales and employees discount stores business hours are also good"
good,"I good place to work those chances for advancement and  opportunity to work plenty of hours. There incentives for employees such as ping pong table, trophy, gift cards,gifts.They are understanding about needing sick days or vacation."
good,"Jcpenney is a very family oriented work place. When I first started I loved it but after a while it got tiring. Human resource supervisor was very unprofessional. I feel that although it is nice they promote from within, they should ensure their supervisors meet the requirements for the job"
good,"Typical day at Penny's in at that time the Catalog Dept., was to check all the reports for orders, notify customers of  orders in or delayed, scan in Catalog Orders when received and simply Customer Service functions,  Answering phones, placing order for customers simply retail work."
good,"During my time at JCP, I very much enjoyed working there. I had a great manager which made coming into work enjoyable. I wished that the hourly rate was more in the salon. It would have also been nice to have more advertisement throughout the mall making it known that the salon services were available."
good,I really loved working in such a friendly environment. I got along great with all the associates and employees. The pay was not good and the hours were very minimal.
good,"This is a good position for someone who wants part time work with flexible hours. If you are good with people, you will enjoy working there. The management is very approachable and caring. Coworkers are friendly, hard working and supportive of one another. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet your entire shift, but you will get those 10,000 steps in for the day. You will also need to be comfortable educating customers on the benefits of the J C Penney credit card and rewards program and then persuading them to apply if  they do not have one."
good,"Very high paced and a little stressful. Of course I was pregnant at the time. I worked the dressing room and wow! Customers can make an easy job seem pretty hard. Lots of clothes every where you turn. Luckily, Co workers work as a team. Keep your cool, show up on time and put your best foot forward. You'll be alright. Not a bad job 🙂"
good,I really enjoyed working at this particular store . Everyone was pretty close & we all helped each other out whenever possible . The management overall was a delight to work with
good,"JC Penny is a fun place to wok. You can meet new people and work with them. Customer are nice. It's great place to learn customer service. "
good,I had a good experience working at JcPenney. The ending of my time there was not ideal because of the way I was let go. Other than that my managers were flexible and it was fun to work there.
good,"Great customers professionally with a smile  and helping them locate items they are looking for. I enjoy shopping so helping other find the right outfit is fun. Making suggestions on items help boost sales.  "
good,Working at JCPennys is a lot but it paid good money. Some managers were rude but i just brushed it off. While working there your shift will go by fast if you are working hard enough.
good,It's great to work with people who are sweet and kind. Mostly every morning they have a meeting where they talk about the goals of today and how they did last night .
good,Fast pace as you started your day had to get the pallets down and the merchandise to the floor never a dull moment but your co workers made things less stressful team work is the main key.
good,nice place to work but i wouldnt recommend it as a long time job. only a short amont of time. cause after a while there not whilling to work with you on ur schudel and just start to not care about others not doing there job and blame others for there mistakes.
good,Working here can be fun one you find the people in your department and you m make friends. Everything is fun until the ends lod the night when it comes to cleaning. It feels like a long time and it's very exhausting.
good,There is always something to do in retail. Every day is jammed with tasks complete; the trick is to prioritize your tasks. Coaching associates to live up to their potential is exciting.
good,"It was always busy, always something to do. I got plenty of hours and they were flexible hours. I liked my job and I liked my manager and other Co workers."
good,"Time spent working was very well managed. Schedules are flexible to accommodate your needs. Cheerful, yet relaxed work environment, but steadfast. Security minded."
good,"The shifts were consistent, 6am to 11am. Most of the days tasks are instructed when you arrive, tasks depend on what day of the week it is (truck day, signing day, etc.) I learned merchandising skills and techniques, as well as useful problem solving skills for retail (i.e. how to take apart a register to diagnose certain issues). It is very team oriented workplace, with friendly staff, and a good open door policy. The hardest part of the job is time management, but the tasks aren't difficult and its a low stress environment."
good,"typical day included pulling reports, meeting with comptroller and other duties. management was good and helped advance their employees. the workplace culture was relaxed and organized."
good,Working at JCPenny is fun when you get passed the standing on your feet for hours part. The job really forces you to utilize interpersonal communication skills. You will be dealing with many different types of customers.
good,It's a nice place to work. Probably the easiest warehouse ever. I just don't like how the hours go up to 6 days 12 hours to 4 days 4 hours. It's kind of unpredictable at times.
good,"This job takes patience and time to get use to, but once you get the hang of it. You're a pro!"
good,"As a whole it was not a bad place to work. The general manager was a great guy. Most of the managers there were great-with the exception of two of them. The pay was so-so in my opinion. Luckily, I only had to work one Thanksgiving as I got a full time job a couple of weeks prior to it. Was not a fan of the late hours but that’s the nature of the beast in retail. I primarily worked in the men’s section but floated a lot."
good,As  a hairstylists it was very fun working there.  I learned a lot from my fellow coworkers and different techniques with  hair.   It was nice to be hired straight out of hair school.
good,"On a typical workday the job was very informative, inclusive and always offered a great place to have fun and enjoy your shifts. Management was great and very understanding and welcoming all the time"
good,"I loved this job until they eliminated my title from the company even though they desperately needed it. I loved the morning hours though, and they did promote within the store."
good,"With the high volume of customers at my store, there was always a need for the upkeep and maintaining of good inventory displays in the departments. It was challenging to meet the needs of the high amount of people and was especially so while working black Friday but the reward of seeing a customer leave satisfied was alway great."
good,"Over the course of my career at JCPenney, a typical day of work was traditionally a good balance of constantly working without overexerting its workers. The management was amendable to giving time off for personal vacations in exchange for changing shifts as long as I took the initiative to ask them far ahead of time. The hardest part of the job was manning the register during the largest sales, but dealing with all of the unique customers and situations that arose at this job allowed me to become a complex problem solver. The most enjoyable part of this job was the camaraderie that I built with my co-workers and talking to them while doing our work. Overall, my job at JCPenney was a very profitable experience and gave me invaluable knowledge of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace."
good,"One would expect to greet smiling, friendly customers and staff members. Familiarizing with the merchandise to help identify the adequate outfit for the different client requests. Management is kind in assisting and delegating work in an efficient matter. The most challenging part may be dealing with a customer that you may have suspicions of. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the work environment is very festive and fun."
good,"Early morning meeting giving focus for the day. We were shown where we were doing as a store and what our objective was. The workplace culture was quite easy going. The hardest part of my job was explaining to customers when our vendors let us down and didn't deliver as agreed. I love my job as I love meeting and greeting people. I was beginning to have customers ask for me when they came in to shop, I was hired for the holiday season and was asked to say after the season was over. I was the only one out of 3 temporaries. I would have gone back to work for Penney's here in Ann Arbor if they hadn't removed their furniture department."
good,"I really like working in JCPenney, the workers are fun to be around and make the time go by fast. The work is pretty easy but there is days where you really need to be on top of it and especially during the holidays. Overall fun place to work in."
good,The particular store i worked  at was a mess.  if they took the time to clean the store instead of the drama in the store it would be very successful.
good,"Nice place to get going and meet a lot of wonderful people and co-workers, they are always trying to stay up to date on all new trends and give lots of sales monthly"
good,"Assisting customers was fun and engaging.  You learn a lot about marketing, what's trending, and customer service.  The employee mix is diverse and fun.  The hardest part is working extended hours for mandatory holidays, inventory times, or sales events."
good,"I worked as a QA tester for the development team, experience on sales and service modules in a completely agile environment. worked on manual and automation testing"
good,"i worked at one of their warehouses. it was an excellent place to work. co workers were nice, management genuinely cared for their associates. if they ever come back around i would work there again"
good,It is most enjoyable job. I have learned lot from there. In MD I didn't find hours the one I was wanting. Still I love to go back for part time or seasonal.
good,At JC PENNNY a typical day would start great for me. I was a social butterfly greeting mostly everyone in the morning. I learned how to value my customers and team members. To give my honest opinion and take others opinions on how to do my job better.  The hardest part of my job was telling a customers an item they really wanted was no longer available. The most enjoyable part of my job is when he impossible is made possible.
good,"- I like work at JC Penney because of flexible schedule "
good,"JCPenney is a great company to work.  The benefits are nice and the discount on merchandise, which includes the expanded appliance center for all of your household needs."
good,You stay busy so the day goes by fast. You meet new people everyday. Multitasking skills are essential. Very fun place to work if you like to socialize and work at the same time.
good,"Overall, I would recommend this company. Not every job is fun! Including doing customer service for Penney's, however, the option for working at home is a big plus and if you can handle it, it's a great option and they provide benefits."
good,I really enjoyed working at JC Penney's as they were a fashion leader at the time. I learned a lot about fashion merchandising and display work. I was able to set company ads and use my fashion skills to make impactful displays
good,"it was a decent start to my cosmetology career, decent wages and flexible hours. My most enjoyable moments at this salon was making people feel good after leaving my chair."
good,"A typical day would mean checking out customers as a cashier, assisting customers, setting ads, taking mark downs and keeping the department clean orderly."
good,The job can be stressful sometimes. Co-workers were awesome. Schedules were flexible. Benefits were great. Have to work a lot of weekends.  Overall a great place to work.
good,I liked being a good. And as a photographer I got to be a clown evetyday. The staff was amazing and being able to play all day with the kids was awesome.
good,I worked during the Christmas season and it was very stressful at times. Other than that it was a very good environment to work in. The other employees were very patient during training and helped out a lot when I first started.
good,Typical day was spent on the phone scheduling customer appointments and assigning routes to installation technicians. Occasional troubleshooting for orders.
good,JCPenney is a great entry level job for students or anyone looking to get into retail. It is fun and quick paced. There are incentives for teaching sale goals.
good,"calm welcoming morning, learned more about how to nicely fold clothes, whenever you needed help the manager was there, and even at the end of the night everyone worked as a team to clean the store."
good,"Great company with mission "
good,"Fast paced work environment, which offers me a way to utilize my creative side when doing floor sets. And also gives me the opportunity to interact with customers and sales associates while I am running MOD shifts."
good,"The training they provide new hires should be better. When I was hired years ago, they would ""buddy"" you with a long time employee for 3-4 weeks until you knew what you were doing, had enough different kinds of transactions on the register and were comfortable being on your own."
good,"I have been there 24 years and have always liked being there"
good,"I worked here part time while going to college. It paid the bills. I really liked my particular store. The managers were all great and they gave me the opportunity to help them out as a manager myself. You can get really awesome discounts as an employee. As a part time worker, you don't get all the fun benefits, but you can still do a 401K and all the basic stuff, just not the PTO. Working holidays wasn't fun, but Christmas and Easter the store was closed. If you are the closing shift, do not expect to leave right when the store closes. We had to stay and clean/straighten the entire store. Some nights we were there until 1am cleaning.  (that's only in extremely busy days when the store isn't staffed properly because of call offs or no shows. Usually we were there at least an hour after closing time) It can make for a long day on your feet. Probably one of the worst parts of the jobs, and cleaning out the fitting rooms that got trashed. Great networking opportunities, management was always willing to try and get me a better place in corporate. but I couldn't move there at the time. Competitive with credit card applications."
good,"Working at Jc penny gave me a chance ro enhance my skills and also showed me what to do and not do. The hardest part of working at Jc Penny, was the fact that they weren't giving out alot of hours and the flexibality was not there."
good,"I loved working at Jcpenney in Redlands. My manager was the best manager I have ever encountered. Everything I know about good customer service, I learned there. We all worked as a team. Like any job, not everything was perfect, but we worked very hard for our customers to have a great experience at the salon. What I loved about my job was, making my client feel beautiful with my love and skill of hair."
good,Great place to start working and gain experience. JCPenney is a positive workplace and never a boring moment. Enjoy supporting team and assisting providing customer service.
good,"While this was a great company in a lot of positive ways to work for, I can say without any hesitation that a great manager can raise a store up and bad management will sink a store faster than the Titanic. I loved most of my coworkers and developed good customer relationships with regulars. The pay on the other hand, or even the ability to grow and advance within the company, however are a joke. That is unless you are a high school or college kid with no real financial responsibilities. If you are looking to make a little extra cash, you will love it. If you are trying to make a living and provide for yourself without government assistance, you won't make it."
good,"this was for a very short period of time, it was a seasonal job! couple of months tops I worked their for the Christmas Holiday. Management was great at the time I had worked their."
good,	Conduct and investigate internal theft issues
good,"JCPenney in Tukwila is very flexible with hours and has great management. They are able to answer calls right away during opening hours, they are also able to respond to emails quickly as well. As a sales associate, you will be moved around from the fitting room and cashier so that you will become familiar with the store and where all the brands are in your department."
good,"Our location was in Hutchinson, KS so a typical day was pretty slow, but as long as you are good at making yourself busy and being creative you could usually stay pretty busy. They had the best management team I have ever worked with."
good,"Some days is very busy and fast past, and some days are slow but busy at the same time because there's always something to do around the store. Like Straighten up your area and help any customers, or another associate"
good,"Great company, great co-workers, and JCPenney absolutely gives you opportunities to promote to higher postions. I loved supervising my teams and they respected me. Great place to work!"
good,"A typical day at J.C. Penney was very eventful. It usually started at 4 AM and ended around 2 PM. It included Signing, Merchandise processing, team management, scheduling a team of 16, daily Manager on duty schedules, answering customer service calls, and benchmarking store financial numbers."
good,"Your everyday retail experience as a worker, only downside was the pushing of credit card applications. Workplace very slow paced usually with high spikes of service during holidays"
good,"If you just want to stand around and talk this is not the place for you. There is always something to do e.g.  helping customers, working the register, straightening the merchandise, replenishing the store, visual, reworking the floor plan, etc..."
good,"As far as retail stores go, this is a pretty good one. Only reason i had disagreements at all was with the end of the day procedures. At closing we have to clean up, which is understandable. However it is not just your department it is the whole store. If you work in shoes and your place is spotless by closing, you still gotta go around the store. Again that is understandable, but there were some coworkers who made it harder on purpose. I would see them in their area cleaning up super slow and could hear them talking about how they take long on purpose to get more hours. I understand wanting more hours but I was fine and wanted to go home. Literally I would clean shoes and the whole first floor, just me and 3 people, go upstairs help them then get the call that we still have work, go to that one area and they are not even half done. Its not JCP fault for these employees but it felt so unfair for me to go in a small group and clean the whole store just to come back to those people not doing their work."
good,"I only worked there for a summer. The pay was minimum wage, but the managers and the coworkers were nice. I worked in the home department, but that also meant i had to work the customer service desk. I didn't expect that, but I learned some valuable lessons."
good,jcpenney is well established and is a hierarchy that remains legendary within the community. The people I worked for and with were extremely sincere. The most genuine I've see from all my past work history.
good,"Challenging environment.  If you enjoy people....you will enjoy this job.   High paced daily with something to work on daily.  As a manager you are control on what environment you want to promote...both for your team and your Customers.   You are also"
good,JCPenny is an equal opportunity employer in which I would highly recommend. They offer numerous benefits as well as flexible schedules and a calm steady paced work environment.
good,"I like working here mainly because of friendly coworkers and the associate discount. The only downside is how mean some of the customers can be, you gotta be a little thick skinned here. Another downside that im glad changed was the management who would have us break the initial rules for a customer who wined too much. You get used to the behavior of customers it gives you perspective of how a lot of people are in the real world and how to effectively interact and handle harsh situations.Its an over all pretty chill job but when holidays come around... BE READY!"
good,Very relaxed enviornment but also great management. Very understanding staff. Easy to catch on to the job(s) and room to grow and/or expand in the company.
good,"This job was good.  I loved working at night. I enjoyed coming to work every day.  Good pay.  However, I had to leave for school.  The manager was very fair and professional."
good,"A decent job that can be stressful and fast paced at times but is all around enjoyable with the right managers and managing style, helping grateful customers was very rewarding, the only thing i didnt like was pushing the credit card so hard."
good,"Good Retailer, started its operations in 2016 and grown big. Excellent place to work for Retail domain experts."
good,"A typical work day at Jcpenney was being on time.  Each task was different daily.  I work hard and did what was asked of me. Every day there were different things that had to be done from making phone calls, reading invoices, typing memos and repackaging merchandise. The management there were great, they worked with us if they had to and treated you fairly.  The hardest part for me was to help load a tractor trailer because it was so hot.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people almost every day."
good,"I enjoyed working at JC Penny's. I loved the professionalism about the job and enjoyed working with my colleagues. My work ethics were sharpened by this job, with the accuracy and detailed work."
good,"In a typical day at work you would complete several different tasks. Sometimes completely unrelated, from customer facing ones to behind the scenes projects. I learned many skills, including specialty department training and selling."
good,very great work enviroment.  A typical day at work is me selling jewelry to loyal nice customers. My most enjoyable time at the job is helping customers with what they need.
good,Ensured truck was off loaded and product put on the floor.  Place pricing for product on the floor. Helped with clearance items on a daily basis. Performed register work.
good,All of the co-workers were relaxed and easy going.  I learned how to scan and put information into the computer.  I was able to learn about other departments.
good,"Provide your own tools. minimum wage or commission. biweekly pay."
good,Fun working here you become friends with everyone quickly. they work hard to make you feel comfortable and help you to understand how things work. The customers were friendly and willing to be patient as you work. Fun environment while also having you job role being played.
good,"It was very busy at times sometimes slow business but there was always something to do. Management team was great, sad to have to leave because the store closed down."
good,Have to know what you’re doing. Otherwise you will be lost it if s a fun workplace and you learn a lot and how to deal with people and life. great first job
good,it's a good place to learn about production. They have good benefits. Most of the employees are easy to work with.. Once a month they have luncheons in the main break room.

good,be able to operate cctv and two way radios. able to have good report with law enforcement agencies and the community. have a good understanding with emergency action plans.
good,"Staff and co-workers are nice to work with and very helpful."
good,"Nothing negative to say about the company, my district manager however definitely got rid of most African american employees one by one, the store I worked for had most black associates but one by one we were mistreated, fired or quit and more other races slid in"
good,"I worked for the company for 34 years and was very happy with what i achieved there, my co workers were great and like family in many ways. We were very team oriented and the communication and service skills were a joint effort and working together was a pleasure."
good,I enjoyed working there just needed to advance in my career. So I left to better myself and my career. I liked the environment there and the managers.
good,"The workplace was like a family excellent support from managers"
good,The hours are not conducive to someone who is looking for a full time job. The perks are good and I love the atmosphere. there is a stress on pushing the JcPenny credit card and Find more. However they do sometimes offer lunch
good,This job placement was a great place to broaden my skills in art and design.  Learning people's personality and corresponding the personality to the attire of occasion.
good,this was my favorite job. I grew up in this salon. all of the ladies became family to me and taught me a lot. Stylist lessons and life lessons.It taught me a lot of patience for others.
good,It is a great experience for the first job in school. This company is fun and very active. What every someone wants they get. Everyone is always considered in options. Everyone has a voice.
good,Great work environment.  Management is very good and willing to accommodate most requests.  Lack of career advancement. No benefit package. Great company for part time work.
good,i loved helping people and also i restock the clothes and checked people out. also i worked in catalog.  it was fast pace job and very busy at times.i loved helping my regular customers.
good,"It was pretty good the hours were good, the pay was decent. I got to work in a lot of areas around the store from dress shirts, modern men, big and tall, mens shoes, and womens shoes."
good,"It was a long time ago that I worked there, but it was a happy environment. good place to grow clients. I had a good manager that provided education and experience."
good,"Since working for the company in 2014, jcpenney has come a long way from where it was when I first started. It's had it's ups and downs, but I have enjoyed the many opportunities given to me as a stylist AND a mother. My managers have been forgiving, kind, patient, and understanding of everything asked of them by me. They've helped me grow. I believe the Cinderella project that was launched, helped stylists to feel like they were earning more from all of the hard work being put into each every stylist. I will truly value every lesson I've learned while working with this company."
good,I liked working here and helping Customers. I specifically enjoyed cashier for that fact and meeting new people. Maintaining Displays was a challenge.
good,I really enjoyed working at JCPenney. Everyone was nice and it was a fun place to work. The discount was amazing. If you needed help someone was always willing to come and give you a hand.
good,I enjoyed working there overall. It was always something to do. Customers were loyal and it was a comfortable work environment. We were properly staffed at all times. Overall a great place to work.
good,"There's a lot to get done, but everyone is supportive. It is competitive with monthly goals of online orders and credit card applications, but it's not that hard to reach. Most managers are wonderful, however, some are terrible, but that's how life works. They will all work with you is you're sick or need a break from a customer yelling at you."
good,"I learned how to deal with customers, how to manage a store. Hardest part of job is the long hours sometimes. Workplace culture was fun, a lot of nice people."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs just because it combined two of my favorite things, babies and photography. My entire team was awesome. The hardest part was honestly the sales person side of everything. I am not at all a pusher and felt bad having to try to talk up families, but understood it's all a part of business and I was not as terrible at is as I thought."

good,I was only at JCP for a short period of time but I did have fun there and learned a lot about photography which was nice. If it wasn't a seasonal job I'd like to think I'd still be there.
good,"This was a good first job for me.. Not too many hours, good experience. I wouldn't say i loved just folding clothes all shift, but i mean i was getting payed for it so i can't complain!"
good,"A typical day was organizing my area and welcoming customers. Constantly fixing clothes as well as shoes. I learned how appearance can make of break customers thoughts on buying merchandise from the store. The hardest part was trying to get people to leave information for the store such as numbers of emails. One of the things I liked the most was, even though I was an employee I'm also a customer, I got to see all the new arrivals and get to know more about brands that JcPenny dealt with."
good,Love the place. Everyone is upbeat with an great attitude. The customers come first and the employees are always looking for ways to make the customer happy.

good,"This is a great place to work for. The managers are great and they all know exactly how to fix any problem. I learned to be flexible, and offer help to everyone you see. The hardest part is not getting overwhelmed when the lines won't end."

good,"Such a great place to work so far, I really like the people and would love to stay but I’m looking for a job that’s a little more stable and can pay the bills with a little money left over."
good,"Jcp is a great place to work if you can handle the fast work place. You get rewarded whenever you a customer mention your name. And if you can sign cx up for credit card as much as possible, you are loved"
good,"My experience was positive and I would work there again. Unfortunately, the factory closed and I was unable to relocate to continue my employment. If offered I may work there again."
good,"Greet customers and identify needs, complete sales transactions using credit card or cash payment methods. I dislike hours were based on getting credit application because that was not my specialty. I enjoyed giving the customers the shopping experiences by knowing the products and where the products could be found as well as current sales and upcoming sales."
good,"I worked in a store environment that gave me flexible scheduling. It was a fast paced, fairly stressful place, especially on weekends, but a great group of co workers made it all worthwhile."
good,"It is a very fast paced work place. Friendly and Manager is full of energy and makes work fly by and has a drive for life....Its a lot of folding, straightening, sizing but rewarding....

good,"The manager was horrible she would stay in the drama, was never professional. Knew nothing about color, cutting or styling hair. She would run off talent and class, and kept trash and druggies and would let people bully new people."
good,"I interested so much working in this place & I had good experience in customer service from working for Jcpenney."
good,"Relaxed pace , very routine."
good,"Hardest part of the job is the daily changing expections.  Minimal staffing and supervision for amt of employees.  Time to finish projects very limited, always changing staffing issues and new employees to train with very limited budget for staffing with constant budget cuts due to sales."

good,"There are many things an employee will need to keep track of while meeting the expectations of management and customers. It can become overwhelming. This job tested organisation skills and quick thinking. The hardest part was keeping track of many tasks at once, but seeing the effort pay off at the end of the day was most enjoyable. This job gives exposure to many situations and people one will face, improving communication skills greatly."
good,"for people who wants to work on projects from scratch and cutting edge technologies , this would be a perfect place. in a motto to fight with their giant competitors like amazon and Ebay."
good,Easy and fun work environment. Management was very easy to get along with and very stress free job. Management worked well with scheduling and making sure time off was granted.
good,I have to be at work M-F at 4am to lead the support team in task well doing other parts of my job in the process. I have grown with this company who was willing to give me a chance after trying for a year to move up. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is Wednesdays and Fridays when we have to unload the truck. I love working in retail though and my work family.
good,"Always something to do, never a dull moment. I learned all about customer service, and working with in a team. Management could have been trained better. But I loved the other friendly associates!"
good,"I worked at JCPenney for 32 years, started as a part time associate on the sales floor and worked my way up through upper management and into the home office.  I made lifelong friends while I was there. I took early retirement when it was offered."
good,The atmosphere at J.C Penney is always upbeat and positive.  All the employees work well together and are all positive in their respective jobs. Managers are easy to approach and are always receptive to any conversations.
good,My day started with opening of the department that I was assigned to.  Learning to multitask was very necessary in order to meet daily sales goals.  Very enjoyable meeting different people on a daily basis and assisting them in sales.
good,Nothing spectacular about the job.  Was able to work the amount of hours requested.  Lots of team functions.  Management changed quite often which resulted in confusion of the job requirements.
good,"Days at work were rough, but I learned how to please clients and make them feel good and comfortable. the best part of the job it is that I got to do what I loved, the worst part it is that is not well pays for the hours I used to work."
good,I have been at J.C. Penney for a year and a couple months. The people are very helpful and will answer any questions you or help out if you are having difficulties.

good,"Workspace needs to be updated. And computers are slow. It would be nice if after a period of time you could get full time."
good,"At JC Penny, your average work day consisted of painting a fine and clean work environment, with the support of folding and hanging clothes in a nice orderly fashion. The Management was great as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was that it was a slow paced store and the business was slim. The most enjoyable part of the job was was seeing everyones passion for fashion."
good,"If you're into numbers this is the place. If you're not into the art of hair, this is the place for you. I love working with people not so much the numbers."
good,"Honestly, working retail isn't always a dream, but I enjoyed working with the people at JCPENNEY in Faribault, unfortunately the store is closing in September. I loved my boss and my managers. There is definitely room for advancement if you're willing to do the work. My customers were amazing and I LOVED helping the customers. Sometimes it made my day because somebody would be looking for something specific, or for something for a very special occasion. Unfortunately, in this business, part time work in retail pays minimum wage, however, at JCP every year you will get a raise depending on your performance value. Which is nice to have. I was able to work hours I wanted in order to stay home with my child on weekends until I decided to work them. I recommended two friends to apply there and would continue to advise people to apply."
good,"my co-workers and leaders in charge were phenomenal. i enjoyed working here. the customers were always a handful, for whatever reason. my job-tasks were always laid out for the day for me to get done. i was trusted to do my job and knew to do it well."
good,I'm an operations associate. I work early mornings (6am until 11am or 2 pm). Depends if we have a truck coming. I love the consistency and that they work with my schedule since I'm a student. They're fairly flexible and management is pretty nice along with other associates.
good,Overall a good place. This also depends on which department you work in and what your role is. Some role for some workers are easier than other and some harder
good,"All staff was really helpful when I started, staff was nice and was straightforward with how they wanted their department to look at the end of the day. Really enjoyed the environment. What I did dislike was that my schedule would change regularly without notifying me, other than that great experience."
good,"A typical day was beginning to review schedule to ensure all departments were covered with associates, review the goals for Sales and Credit Applications. Meeting with associates to distribute tasks, inform associates of sales goals, credit card goals, current sales & coupons, advertisings and other pertinent information given to me by my supervisor. During the day I would go to my departments to ensure and assist the associates in customer service, inventory accountability, stock merchandise and displays, operations process."
good,"Managers were well in preparing ahead of time what was expected in number of customers, sales, stock. That really helped because I knew what to manage and what to get done."
good,A typical day working for Penny's is fun and fast paced. I learned how they process credit cards how to run the cash registrar and what it takes to make the store run successfully.
good,"Local branch at Lansing Mall has good people and good leadership. They are encouraging and don't set you up to fail.  Too few hours for the part-timers, though."
good,"I DO A LOT OF WORK ON THE FLOOR BEFORE CUSTOMERS ENTER THE STORE. "
good,Very flexible and willing to work with your schedule. It is a great place to work and you can advance very quickly in the company. very friendly co-workers
good,I worked at JCPenny's  during the seasonal months and we were extremely busy.  It's hard work but it was fun as well.  The customers were very friendly.
good,I think that working at Jcpenny is fun I interact with people all day. Wish the pay was better. I learned at first working there but once you learn everything there isn't much left to learn.
good,"I enjoyed very much working with the associates and other managers when i was promoted. All the managers made this place a great place to work. Although before i got promoted to Manager, i was an associate and i absolutely hated the workload and the hours were definitely not fair. Some weeks i received 12 hours a week and others 32 hours a week, and associates NEVER got a weekend off. The people are nice and the environment is great, but i didn't feel safe working there when i didn't know if i was going to be able to afford to pay bills for that week or not."
good,There was never a day like the one before at JCP. Every day was a new learning experience and the entire JCP team were exceptionally thoughtful and helpful all the while with friendly competition daily.
good,"help customers find what they are looking for make it a good shopping experience for the customers, good workers ,ability to grow and learn more than what you do"
good,a very structured environment with a baseline routine that allows for a quick mastery of job and know all expectations. learned how to deal with people of all kinds and temperaments in professional manner.
good,A typical work day at JC Penney was very slow paced. I've learned the difference from retail busy days and restaurant busy days. JC Penney gave me more skills in how to work in two different atmospheres.
good,"Being a customer service associate at JCP was very rewarding and I loved my coworkers when I first started working there. I left for a while to attend my first semester of college, but returned during my holiday break to help with the busy rush during the holidays. During the holidays, I experienced trouble communicating with management about my paycheck, and they also cut my hours without really providing me an explanation. That's really the only trouble I experienced, though. I loved my managers, the job was fun and kept me busy."
good,"first job ever"
good,Working there was good. People were always friends and wanted to help. Many times though there weren't enough hands in the store. Management was always quick to help with problems and helped work around your schedule. The most enjoyable part would be the people you work with.
good,"I loved having the inside peak at all that goes on in a set store, talking and relating to customers, helping them with shopping experience. I miss the talks with retail buyers."
good,I learned a lot working there from floor design to resets mgt was always available to help answer questions or even help on the floor they had very flexible schedule
good,"Typical day of a JCP supervisor, day shift: Pull previous days reports. Check Schedule to assure floor is covered. Put in MOD notes, help open registers, have AM meeting discuss sales, cust. service, credit results, upcoming events and recognice outstanding performance by associates. open store, run store in MOD shift, check on department to ensure sales floor is set to co standard. Plan truck arrival and make room for back stock /new merchandise coming in. Coaching in the moment with associate, answering calls for change and other problems while giving great customer service. "
good,"Jc Penney is a great place to work. The core value is to do unto others as you would have them do to you."
good,the work schedule was 4 days on and 3 off. The pay was competitive for that time. no benefits due to part time employment. good work enviroment. no pressure from management as long as you did your job.
good,"I enjoyed working in customer relations since I learned more about how inquiries were handled and problems resolved.  The pay was higher, and the work hours were good.  However, JCPenney downsized our department and eliminated my job."
good,The best part of my day at this job was capturing the moments of families and kids taking pictures for them to be able to take home and enjoy forever.
good,I learned how to work in a team environment in order to get my job done. I built up my skills on using a computer and the right tools I needed to complete my job. I love that the morning stock team and pricing team were like family very energetic and fun to work with
good,"In the department I worked in, you got payed by how fast you worked. which there were 5 levels you could reach for better pay. work started at either 5 or 6 am. We were put in 3 man team. When the truck had docked one person would take a convairbelt into the truck. They would then scan and toss boxes onto the convairbelt. from that scan a sticker would print off that the secound person would then stick to the box using the numbers to make sure they were corecct. The third person then would be down the line pallet building according to the stickers on the boxes. it was very fast paced. And important not to have mistakes! But the management was really nice and great, they would take any impute you gave them and would even send someone from the team to meetings so they could get input right off the production floor."
good,"I loved it was a trainer,  customer service,  apo/fpo orders "
good,"It was a fun job in the beginning once hired until my supervisor had to leave to another store and my new supervisor resigned a month later, leaving me with no one else to work with. Other than that communication was good between the workers and I."
good,I work with great people. Arriving at work I print out my job responsibilities for the day. Then people on my team meet and discuss the goals for the helping each other throughout the day.
good,"Very good company to work for, with benefits and sales commission provided.  It was a continuous learning environment.  They trusted me with more difficult tasks as I continued learning."
good,JCP is a very fun job that is hands on and includes a lot of problem solving depending on the customer situation. There is never the same thing that happens and its always something new. Learning about all the different merchandise and learning different aspects is so interesting.
good,"Typical workday at JCPenney-"
good,"JCP is a great company to work for if you have a degree in Business, Logistics, or Supply Chain Management. If not, be prepared to bust your tail for low wages."
good,"JCPenney is a decent enough job for a college student who has an immense amount of responsibilities to take care of at school. Management is adequate and very good at their jobs. It is of course, a job in retail so not all customer experiences will be great ones. Just have to take the bad with the good."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at a supply chain/ logistics center. The hours and work were consistent. There was growth potential. Most of the people worked together and operated as a team. I learned all kinds of   work related skills; (including operating and changing out cardboard bales.),scanning various items with handheld scanners and other various things. The biggest down fall was when they brought  in a new CEO, that had grandiose ideas that didn't pan out so well. It was tough when we had to adjust to consistent management changes, and their letting our co-workers with varying degrees of disabilities go."
good,"A typical Day at JCPenney:"
good,My only bad thing is they expect so much out of you as a worker. We spend countless hours after the store closes cleaning up the store which takes forever and we have to have it clean before you leave which I think is a joke. Schedule says 930 but sometimes you won't leave till like 1030 which made me angry and wanna quit.
good,"At Penney's, you are part of a team driven with a common purpose.  The company understands who their customer is and is consistently trying to satisfy the needs of that customer."
good,Great place to shop and a good place to work if you want to stay in your position as not a lot of room for advancement.  Again working with the public on a daily basis is awesome on all levels.
good,"Easy ringing at the register, always learned to smile 24/7 and make the customer number one. All the rules from each manager were different, so no associate ever knew if they were doing the right thing. Very diverse associates. Hardest part was remembering where everything goes. Most enjoyable was being helpful to happy customers, and making others smile by giving great customer service."
good,"Good work environment, hours are early, lots to do and many skills to learn. Job requires to come in most days of the week but only for the most 4 hrs a day, that may fit some people some people may not like it."
good,The associates are very friendly and welcome you to the associate family which is very helpful to a new environment. Lots of smiling faces ready to help you with whatever you need.
good,"having co workers that were older and more experienced was a great learning opportunity. whenever i needed advice or assistance, someone was available to help."
good,every one seemed happy working there.there was no friction with management . the schedule left time for family.pay was okay.
good,"great work enviorment, really promotes team participation, with flexible schedules. a very diversive company with over 1000 stores nation wide and you are able to transfer if you have life changes and need to relocate."
good,"While all management has surely changed hands since last being employed there, JC Penney was a great retail job I which I learned how to be a reliable and worthy employee and coworker."
good,"It's a very positive and friendly work environment. JC Penney has high standards for customer service and rewards their employees for doing a great job. They also motivate their employees to be the best that they can be at doing their jobs, while creating a positive and fun work environment."
good,Out of all my jobs the management was the most professional and well organized at Jcp. It was my first job so of course I was a lil nervous but everyone was friendly and helped me when ever I needed helped. I worked there a short period of time because it  was only a seasonal job but I would love to work in retail again.
good,"JCPenney has a lot of great people working there. I made a great deal of friends working there and it was a great first job. It was fun to work with customers, while also having a work atmosphere where everyone is in a good mood and is friendly. However, hours were inconsistent which I understand is sometimes how retail works but sometimes management even though they were nice, did not always treat employees well."
good,I like working for JCPenney. It is a fun environment. Managers and associates are welcoming and willing to help when needed. Great job for someone looking into retail for the first time.
good,Management showed care to other employees and involved others. A friendly atmosphere to work in and great employee benefits.
good,I enjoy working for this company. Management is nice and so are the associates. It is hard at times to get ahold of some people at times but most of the supervisors are there when you need them.
good,"On a typical day I would open register. Check merchandise on floor, check fitting rooms, assisted customers with prices and location of merchandise.Sometimes didn't get enough hours.Work place  was good."
good,"customer service is the #1 priority."
good,"I love all the stylist I work with.."
good,"Typical retail store, fold merchandise, and check out the customers when they are ready to purchase. Get a discount which is 25% not to bad."
good,"I like working in such a different environment compared to childcare. However, I know now that retail is definitely not for me when looking for future jobs."
good,They are very flexible with your needs. The dress code is very relaxed and the customers are great.  The hardest part is getting hours cut when it is not the holiday season.
good,"JCPenney workers are often very friendly to each other, with the exception of some jaded employees. The customers for the most part are fine but you'll frequently get people try to jip and scam you out of money. The hardest part was not losing your mind when a customer is screaming at you for something that is not your fault."
good,"Every day has its surprises which makes it exciting because you never know what or who you'll come across at work. The management is of top notch and my co-workers are very friendly. I look forward to going to work everyday because, its a warm place to work."
good,my typical day is sometimes great I love my pricing job and also I love checking out the customers I love getting credit apps (one of my special things I enjoy) I also like when we take time to clean the racks and size the clothes I don't really too much like folding but I work in kids so is perfect ive learn how to do pricing and also my management backs you up ever time shout out to my managers  my co workers work together to make things happen ! TEAM WORK!  the hardest part of my day is when the store looks great and customers come and tear it up
good,The company has been good to me. I have had great managers and mentors and made lifelong friends.  It is typical retail but JCP puts more emphasis on its employees and work environment.
good,"I love this job because everyday is alwasy a little diffrernt. The managers and staff are nice and helpful. This job, just like any takes training and lots of practice to learn how the company works and all the tools you can use. Once you know what you are doing then it’s fun and challenging. Overall I wpuldnt pick another place to work. Jcpenny has great benefits and programs for its employyes. Don’t forget the assosiate discount you will get!!"
good,"A pretty good place to work. New styles, lots of clothes, and friendly customers. Hardest part was selling credit cards, and easiest part was running the registers. Co-workers and management were nice and helpful."
good,"As a sales associate it's a live place to work, great coworkers and always have good customers. Management is amazing and always willing to work with you on hours. Great place to work."
good,It was a good experience to get to be a trainee before having the potential to become a manger.Everyday was a learning experience. I learned about coaching and rewarding.
good,Simple day to day work. The place is very big with a lot of different job opportunities to choose from. Though sometimes it feels that your voice just isn't heard.
good,"I worked here for 9 years. THey helped me in highschool all the way up to after college. They were flexible, and was always willing to give me the hours I needed. I would recommend to anyone looking for a part time job!"
good,"Just by being there for a little over a month and a half, I felt like I was truly apart of the team, not just a seasonal employee. I love how coworkers and team leads encourage us to be the best we can be."
good,Jcpenny is just like macys if you into fashion you would want to work there and learn everything about the company. And how to help out customers.
good,"On a daily basis I detailed checked clothing and other items to be sent out to different store locations. Checking for mistakes on pricing, color, quantity etc. in a timely manner. I worked in almost every department in the warehouse when needed so I learned a lot. management was good. my co-workers made the day much easier and faster. The hardest part about this job was throwing up heavy boxes on an overhead conveyor belt. The most enjoyable part was the incentive you received for being fast and accurate at your job on every paycheck."
good,"There is a lot of heavy lifting and walking on concrete floors.  If your body can handle it, it's a good place to work.  Advancement is always there if you want to move up.  The supervisors and management are there when you need them."
good,"I was really blown away by the culture and character of JCP as an organization. I enjoyed working their but it was a straight forward, point of sale position."
good,Retail Sales. I learn to interactive with different personalities. Management was very reasonable and adaptive. I enjoy working with the co-workers. I did not have difficulty with this job. I enjoyed working with the different co-workers the most.
good,"I very much enjoyed working for this company and respect their core values and goals.  However, JC Penney is still going through work force reductions which impact their associates unexpectedly. and create a sense of little or no job security."
good,"clean store, put and take down new signs and billboards, customer service. The management was well staffed and professional. hardest part of the job was the carpets and the most enjoyable part was the interaction of people and the transformation of the store"
good,"Been working since July 2016, the co workers are great the supervisor is awesome. just got offered a supervisor position myself with only being working there for 4 months."
good,"When i worked for JCPenny's the enviorment around me and the people i worked with, were amazing.I didn't really learn anything about managment because i was only a sales associate. My co-workers were amazing. They always had a posative attitude and it always help put me into a better mood. Im not really sure that I had a hard part of the job. Everything was pretty easy. I mostly enjoyed meeting new people every day and learning how not to be so shy. I also loved how it made my social skills with people so much better."
good,It is a great place to learn how to interact with all types of people. It also teaches how to be responsible and how to take on a lot of responsibility.
good,"It's a place to work. Been there for years. Work is somewhat consistent, depending on consumer demand.  Some people fare better in the more physically demanding departments."
good,This company told me at this company told me a lot about customer service help people with their the item with the item very friendly places and good teamworkhig.
good,"Never a dull moment! You will always have customers to assist, just depending on the day tells you if you will be super busy or not! I loved this job, always on your feet."
good,"working the register, cleaning fitting rooms, helping customers,"
good,"working at the jcpenney salon is rewarding . my co-workers are like family and the day is never boring. I have many jobs to keep up with ex. scheduling, phone calls, cash register, and most of all customer service."
good,"Fun, inclusive work environment where everyone acts like part of a family. Was involved with helping customers on a daily basis in sales."
good,Nice for students because they offer a flexible schedule and they do not really schedule people over 25 hours a week. And the management is pretty cool.
good,It was very fun working here. It was low pay but it was a good high school job. It gave me the little money I needed to get through.
good,"Everyday you have to hit the floor running, this is a normal thing when working in the King of Prussia mall location the second largest mall in the country. I check to make sure there are no gaps in the scheduling for breaks. I check my sales floor, what need to be restocked, cleaned up, moved and or reorganized. All while directing my associates on what tasked need to be done and assisting customers as needed."
good,"JC Penny acknowledges everything and everyone."
good,great management good team work. Customers are good and don't have nasty attitudes! Management is also good with scheduling and very understanding!!!!
good,"Was a good company to work for overall. Enjoyed learning new skills and being in a new environment. "
good,"I loved working here, everyone was so sweet. You get those lazy co- workers but it was okay. Management was okay, I felt comfortable working here. The hardest part was the standing for the long hours. Most enjoyable, helping my customers."
good,"As soon as you get to work, you have to be ready to immediately start working. It's fast and requires you to be on your feet for long periods of time. "
good,"I started at JCP with the intention of making a little extra cash for Christmas then ended up quitting my other job and staying on full time when season was over! The hourly pay was not the best but they did offer a generous discount and opportunity for advancement if you worked hard. I loved my co-workers and we were all like family.I would likely still be there but our location unfortunately closed."
good,Constant communication from all levels of management in the Region.Great teamwork from all levels of management to achieve desired outcomes.
good,"my typical day would start by going in early and doing my daily task of making sure my department looked up to the standard the company wanted, then I would see what product we needed to bring out and display, would ring up customers, handle any problem a customer had, Would Talk to supervisors on what I needed or gave them ideas on how we can put out new product, then by the end of my shift and when the other person came on for there shift I would give them a list of things to do and explain to them how I wanted it done."
good,"I enjoyed this job and had no problem coming to work until I realized they kept scheduling me to close by myself for a whole department on the busiest days of the week. I felt the my co-workers never did their job and I was left with a mess and a lecture. I was scolded almost every time by upper management for not being able to get a whole trashed department done within two hours while helping every customer I saw. It was sad because most of the co-workers were out for each other and plain rude and always tried to get someone in trouble. SO, with that being said I would work for them again, but I wish people who were higher up were more respectful and understanding."
good,Jc Penney overall is a good work place. Very flexible with schedules and the benefits are great! I'd recommend anyone to work there.
good,"It was a good and easy job. I worked in retail and I am stylish to begin with. It was a great feeling for customers to come to me with fashion questions because they appreciated how I represented the company. The management there was great because every morning there was some kind of team meeting where either the head manager or the one directly below them would rally us and would want to get us excited for the new work day. My coworkers were just as excellent in the sense that they were always very helpful. The hardest part of the job was I was not able to sell credit cards at the end of each day, but that's okay.

I didn't just get co-workers, I made great friends. The hardest part of the job occurs during holidays. It gets really busy and you never know what situations you will get. The most enjoyable part of the job was once the store was closed, although you are cleaning up the store, that is the time you bond with your co-workers and get to know them. A good team always gets to know each other and get together at the end of the day and tell each other positive things."

Other than that, management is easy to talk to, laid back and is understanding of your needs. They accommodated my disability and treated me the same as everyone else. Coworkers are super friendly and always willing to help. Teamwork is an obvious value we share. There is busy work, but it makes the time go by faster. Long shifts (average shift is 10 hours). The work is very easy and the customers are nice."
good,"Everyday at work is fun to some extent. Some days I get my responsibilities done and have a few conversations with coworkers, who are always fun to talk to. Management is great! they are easy to get along with, and easy to approach. The hardest part of the job is getting fitting rooms done when customers are constantly approaching you to help them out.

You learn about different people and their cultures through they interact with you. Most of the co-workers are amazing, helpful, friendly, and hard working. The management is pretty decent, they sometimes forget that people have lives outside of JCPenny's. You just have to stay on top of them when it comes to your schedule.

I would usually have one or two coworkers with me as well, managing all the same responsibilities.

All my coworkers were very easy to get along and work with. During my shift I always learned new people skills and how to make people feel good about what they walked out of the store with. You never want to sell someone something that they feel bad about buying a day later. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smiles on my customers faces when they found that perfect shoe or that outfit they were ready to conquer the world in.

good,"The staff was friendly, pay was fair, and it was a pleasant environment, but I felt the management structure was unorganized. It was hard to distinguish each manager's role, and find someone to talk to if you had any questions and concerns. The hardest part of my job was the the workload.

Engaging experiences with my clients and staff never left for a dull moment daily.The most difficult part ofmy job was balancing the demands of two different companies and having two separate supervisors who sometimes had different directions in mind for the business. Overall I learned a great deal on how to marriage the two and maintain 5 years of financial growth. I enjoy working with clients the most, Sephora is well loved by their clients."
good,"Great retail atmosphere. All empolyees work well with one another, as it is a cooperation that believes that the best way to grow is from every one's input."

good,It's a great way to interact with a variety of people while enhancing your own wardrobe.
good,"I was laid off when JC Penney restructured.  I loved my job.  Prior to that it was well run, I learned a lot, and met some great people. Their restructure will unfortunately be the downfall for this company.  The way I rated them was at the onset of their transformation, when work life balance and job security were important to them.  There really was no typical day at work because every day was different, with different customers and situations.  Retail management really makes you learn how to think quickly on your feet because your are most times dealing with a customer in person.  I found the fact that there was really no typical day the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,A day with jcpenney was too come in log onto computer(worked in a repair department was assign tech w/reports) complete reports contact customers and inform them of tech finding with furniture.

good,Managing associates to ensure pay roll and other personnel records are accurate and up-to-date. Provide various training and workshops for company. Editor of company newsletter. The hardest part of this position was terminating an associate. I enjoy helping others.
good,Worked with a great team of employees. Had a great experience. Patience and hard work essential.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers! I love the interaction with people. A typical day is busy (which I like). The management (at least, my immediate manager) is authoritative, which I don't care for very much. I'm a quick learner, then just let me work. All of the co-workers are great! They are very helpful and believe in great customer service, as I do! The hardest part of job is that it is physically demanding at times."
good,"A typical day at work began with clocking in and reporting to the sales floor.  Depnding on the level of activity at registers, I would either check customers out or straighten product on the sales floor.  While checking customers out, I would suggest applying for a JCP credit cards for a discount on the days purchase, or help customers return or order products.  When I was straightening product on the sales floor, I would assist customers in their shopping experience by explaining the great deals that were goin on and finding them the product that they were in search of.   "
good,Was an enlightening and enjoyable experience. Co-workers always helpful and supportive.
good,I just help the company on weekends because I was in school. but over all I really liked everybody I worked with.
good,"Sales Associate"
good,"My coworkers are friends, they help you when you need it covered. Management really try to help and give you kudos. The hardest part is that there is never enough time in the day to finish what you started, customers are usually always friendly and we always have regulars."
good,"While I worked at JCP, I was able to put my multilingual skills to good use. Since I worked in the Fine Jewelery Department, I was called in to work an extra hour here and there to help Deaf couples find engagement rings, so I was the go-to interpreter for them. I was very pleased that management saw my skills as valuable and was happy to pay me an extra hour or two for when I was called in to help."
good,"A typical work day varies. Some can be slow, or busy. I learned so much about sales, it is a good time management experience. My co workers are cool, every has different talent the bring to the job. The hardest part is dealing with unsatisfied customers. Most enjoyable is helping people find what they want."
good,Helping customers find the item that they may be looking for either inside the store on the stores website. I learned to have patient and deal with angry are upset customers. My co-workers where very helpful when needed and willing to assist with any issues. The hardest part was having to relocate to a new state because of the military. I enjoyed the reward system that the company had for there employees making you feel special within the company and not just another employee.
good,"I worked there for a year, a great atmosphere with nice co workers, easy job and a pleasure to go to work each day."
good,Working for the Director of Women's Brand is a fast pass quick turn round job. With things changing all the time.  Working with these creative people is the best part of this job and the most challenging. Being able to roll with the flow works best for me.
good,A regular day at jcpenney can be very stressful but with the right employees and management can be very enjoyable at the same time.
good,Has been a great place to work for the past five years! Management has always been encouraging and pleasant!
good,store manager made sure he knew his employees and also gave great incentives on credit applications opened
good,I worked in the lingerie department so it was a lot of personal and one on one work with some customers. I became a certified bra fitter and liked to do some of the different cases like the ladies with mastectomies and the transvestites. It made my job fun and unique. The hardest part of my job was keeping the tables and racks straightened. I enjoyed my job.
good,"I enjoyed working here. My co-workers were easy to get along with, management was good, and I was able to learn a lot working here. Even though it was only seasonal, the hardest part of the job was to get the hang of being a cashier but, I learned how with the help of my co-workers and improved my people skills."
good,"Learning new strategies from management, new assignments with last minute deadlines helped us learn how to handle pressure"
good,"Going into working knowing you had a great staff and plenty of things to keep you active and busy. "
good,"-First priority help customer as much he or she needed."
good,Lots of room for advancement.  Lots of cash flow experience along with customer service contact.
good,"I clocked into work everyday and went upstairs to my work area and signed into my computer. After I signed in I went live and the phones started ringing! Customers would call for all kinds of reasons, couldnt find their order , needed help buying something online, using our coupons, a store associate would call and ask questions on returning items that were bought online , they would call to complain or let us know about a good experience. It was over all anything the customer needed we had to figure it out ! The hardest part was when something would be lost or sent to the wrong person and I had to track the packages and call the other companies and try to hunt down the merchandise. I loved talking with customers all day that were all different and all needed help for something different. It was a new challange every day I would walk in the door. I liked the people I worked with , which made things nicer because your work space is very close to the next employee. Management was amazing and they worked really well with schedules and when people wanted to pick up shifts, they had a whole system for it the was for the employees to help eachother out with work."
good,Jcpenney is a great company that looks out for employees as well as customers. 
good,The co-workers are wonderful! The NEW management is great! It is very hard to build a clientele (there is not many walk-ins). It's a good idea to have one before you start working here. Average walk-ins about 1 every two days. Retain these clients AT ALL COST! 
good,"Each day is something different. You will rarely ever be doing the same routine work. You are never in the same part of the department. The work is throughout the store. Pricing happens through the store, the floor sets (layouts) change weekly. You personally interact with the customers more than a cashier will. You are the backbone of the store."
good,Everything about this job was Amazing! From Management to the Co-workers.
good,Most people working there are awesome to work with but the leadership and fairness with employees could be a lot better.
good,Stock clothing. Cleaning fitting rooms. Assisiting customers with questions. Cashier.
good,Great Company with a lot of hours to offer was only off two days out the week and you work every weekend. The holiday season's is when you get double your regular hours . Fast pace on the weekend. 
good,"Retail is a challenging field.  A typical day is having a set plan but being able to adapt to changes that occur.  You must be able to re-allocate the resources in your building to ensure all tasks get completed."
good,Working for JC Penney is a very rewarding job. You are given 25% off all purchases. Can do shift swap with other associates if there is a conflict in schedule. Paid time off after 1 year. Flexible hours. management is very friendly and helpful. Only negative is pay raises are base on how many credit applications you can get customers to apply for not so much on job duties.
good,Taking special orders for customers. Making sure they have the color and correct sizes for the windows. 
good,"good management, very organized, relaxed atmosphere, great classes to sharpen our skills."
good,"Our shifts started with checking our signs and confirming the merchandise price matched the advertised price, making sure the department was clean and ready for customers before the store opened.  Once my department was taken care of I would assist a fellow worker if it was need in their department.  As a team, we would go through each department together to markdown the clearance items.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get all of the markdowns complete while trying to help customers at the same time, which was not very often."
good,"A day at work at JcPenney would be we come in to work clock in, prep the store for customers, have our daily morning meeting, with out morning managers on duty and store leader to learn what our goals have been set for the day is, and see if we met the goals for the previous day. while working there i learned that when we all work as a team it helps give the customers GREAT customer service. Over all i had a pretty good bunch of Managers and co-works, we all knew how to help each other when needed. There wasnt to many hard parts at jcPenneys, but the best part was knowing that we met our goals by working as a team and not indivdually."
good,Jcpenny was a great place of employment. Everyone was a team and no one was left behind. Very productive and a fun place to explore great customer service.
good,"Normal day was basically retrieving custemor orders from back, bringing them up front and loading them into vehicles. Responsible for keeping shelves & racks properly stocked and organized. Made sure that dressing rooms were cleaned out on regular basis, and that custemors at cash registers were taken care of in a timely manor."
good,"I worked for JCP as an associate through high school and college. My manager was great in accommodating my busy school schedule, and letting me come back on summer and Christmas break."
good,"Starting a day at Jcpenney was first clocking in then review your assignments.This usualy consist of either driving on the recieving dock ,putting racks of stock away or working in your own department putting pallets of stock away.I learned how to drive fork lifts really well and how to put stock away,and keep the inventory straight.Management didn,t bother you much as long as you stayed busy.Most of the time you didn,t have to work real close to your co workers.sometimes you would see them in the same isle you needed,and sometimes they would be at the same location you needed,so you would have to wait for them to get done.for the most part i got along with my coworkers rather well.the hardest part of my job was keeping up with the imbounders when i had to drive on the dock,because somtimes you had two bays and two to three imbounders in each bay.it got to really chalenging at times.the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work on my own most of the time."
good,"JC Penney is a wonderful company to work for. It has undergone some challenges recently, but I hope that it will be soon restored to it's formewr glory."
good,"Before the new CEO, JCP was a great place to work. Great team work, great incentives, and people were rewarded for doing a good job. There was room for advancement. Store parties occurred often for meeting goals. Great sales for customers. Awesome focus on customer service programs. Structured management system. Hardest part was holiday time with mean customers, everything else was enjoyable."
good,i loved working there i had a good pay rate.My work depended on me and all responsibility related to my job depended on me and that made me feel important so i liked that. It motivated me to do things right.
good,same work day after day but you had to b very accurate when unpacking and sorting the items in the aisle
good,"I worked different hours everyday. I would punch in and pick up any clothes that were returned for the children's department. I would re-leave the coworker for break or whatever. I learned how to give excellent customer service and how to organize. I loved my boss Susan, she was awesome. She was nice and taught me a lot about how to organize and shuffle multiple things at once. I loved my coworkers as well. No problems with any of them I got along with them. Hardest part of the job would have been trying to sell rewards cards and trying to get people to fill out surveys. The most enjoyable would be everything else, from interacting with customers to interacting with management."
good,"We are like a family,I enjoy the way we work together as a team"
good,When it was busy it was a good day to work there. But its been slow lately so not a whole lot going on. Its more of a clean up place.
good,Can get pretty fast paced if a sale is going on. Preferred nights rather than days. Having the day shift made the day go by slowly.
good,Customer service is always #1 at JCP. I get along with my co workers and supervisors very well it has been a very good job for me throughout the years.
good,As a manager that work can be very rewarding when up level forces are focused. But there is tendency for the company to restructure and transfer constantly at the home office which causes a lot of confusion for the field operations managers. The areas of focus changes depending on the new boss in your hierarchy.
good,"Clock in, go to morning meeting in Men's department, collect change for registers and a portable i-pod register. Also detail store throughout the day, assist customers, and stock items. Let customers know about sales throughout the store and promote credit card apps."
good,"I was hired as a contractor for JC Penney and immediately felt welcome. I worked amongst a great team of full-time employees including a supervisor who was always open to speak with. This was truly a job I enjoyed going to, unfortunately the budget cuts were unforeseen and my position was also cut."
good,"Ok company not a big fan. they dont pay a lot as you think, im not a big fan of 2 week paychecks. people are great they do help you on the job they will never let you down great team work with other employees."
good,restocking the sales floor and helping the customer. I learned that working in a team is a very important and keeps the work place safe. Management is good. My co-workers were very helpful when I needed them. Hardest part of the job is when the customer is not happy. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the work crew.
good,Support and develop marketing strategies for the company.
good,A typical day would be contacting customers via telephone to let them know that their orders has arrived. Also faxes and letters were sent out every morning to customers.
good,"Communicate with Customers, Serving Customer’s satisfaction, Accurately and efficiently ring on registers. I have learned how to deal with people and make them happy."
good,"I enjoyed work with the customer, you meet all types of people and being able to help them with exciting gift for love ones and themself if rewarding by itself. It was very competive, but the staff got along for the most part."
good,"Recovering clothing, assisiting customers, register trained"
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, wonderful management but not enough hours"
good,This where I learned to perfect my customer service skill. the hardest part of the day would be when a customer came in wanting to cuss and bad mouth the employees. I loved seeing my happy customers faces when they would leave.
good,I was part time worked 4-6 hour days. Worked at the register and folding clothes organizing shelfs. Management just wanted you to stay busy and keep the customers happy and for you to get credit card aps. Co-workers were great people. Christmas season was the hardest part of the job. Very busy hard to keep up with the register and keeping my area clean.
good,"I worked mainly in the shoe department. The job was pretty easy get the shoes from the back stock for customers, cashier, make sure the tables and displays were nice. Management was a bit iffy at times when doing projects you would get conflicting instruction. The hardest part was dealing with ""those"" customers but that's with any retail job. The best part was that I got to make a lot of decision on my own do to the downsizing of management."
good,"I mainly worked in, fashion jewelry assisting customers with their purchases. Not only fashion jewelry but, with women’s accessory, slippers, stocking, handbags and also assisting with other other departments, it kept us busy, it was so much fun getting to know more of the employees in the store and it gave me an opportunity to help more of the customers."
good,"Fun working with people every day, however is very slow when not the holiday. This is when hours get cut and never knowing when they will pick up is very nerve wracking. It's very clean and organized work area and I enjoy working with my associates the most."
good,"JCP was a great place to work with many great people. It was the job I considered my ""last job"". However the the decision was made to close the facility, that was the only reason that I would leave. I worked HR/Finance for the facility. This meant making pay changes, compiling data for many reports and many other tasks due daily, weekly, quarterly and yearly. It's not often that you can work with the people that I had the pleasure to work with and for."
good,"I learned a lot at JCPenney about retail and how it can be a friendly, family-oriented environement as well as new merchandising techniques and customer consideration at it's best!!"
good,Scheduling management was poor but reasonable if you asked for time or time off.
good,"I enjoyed working as part of the drapery department at JC Penney. This was a great start for me into the world of draperies, fabric and hard window treatments. I learned much from my managers and suppliers. I had a number of repeat clientele, which as a young designer meant the world to me. This is a great company that I wish many more years of success to."
good,My typical day at work would be very busy which I love because I enjoy working in a fast past enviornment. I learn that at all times customers come first making them happy increases the companies sales which is every company main goal. I also learn how to supervise a group of 6-10 associates.

good,i worked in a small location. We were always busy and multitasking was a must.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, and wish I didn't leave! The hours aren't the best in the world, but when you work for supportive people it makes things a lot better. I would recommend JC Penney and may eventually go back there."

good,"This job was awesome. The benefits were great, the pay was good and it was a family-like environment."

good,"Extremely considerate of their employees. The managers always stood up for their employees if a customer had a problem, and took control of the situation. Never made the employees out to be the bad guy."
good,I worked in the home department assisting customers with selections and finalizing their purchases. Loved working with the customers!!
good,"At jc penny's everything would start like ant other day. You go to work, sign in, look at the areas you have to work on that day see what's on the bar and get started....taking clothing out of cart and putting them on the bar to go out and ect. I learned a few things working there which was that the customer comes first, their logo, what working there meant to the company and more.....I learned how to use the catalog and more....the hardest part or the job would of been remembering where things go because they kept on changed things every week but it was fun.....I enjoyed working with my co workers because they made the job better."

good,A typical day at work would be to start to get ready for the price changes. Go out on the shopping floor and keep prices up to date and start clearancing items. Management was really great. Supervisors would help out when help is needed. Many were out in the storage room getting items ready to take out. The most enjoyable part of this job was having to see my co-workers and getting ready to get the day over with.
good,Working at JC Penny gave me the first opportunity of experience with public communicaton. I had a very supportive management staff due the fact of being a college student during that time.
good,"I've had the pleasure of working at three different departments, I enjoy learning new things. I've worked in the watch repair dept. (which I really enjoyed), Home dept. and fashion jewelry dept. Management wasn't always around but was supportive when they were. My coworkers were nice and helpful. The hardest part were the hours at times, But, I enjoyed chatting with my customers that made it enjoyable."
good,This company has a promote from within environment.
good,Was a great experience to work with the team and help customers. Co-workers were always there to help and so were the supervisors. Hardest part of the job was having to leave.
good,"Quality merchandise, great customer service, cleanliness of store is a pleasure to shop in."
good,Put your focus on your area...your sales goals and your associates and you can carve out a nice little niche for yourself.
good,worked with people all day and the management was great. The wost part was management had a lot of people on the floor and they would all tell me different things to do and not realize I had deadlines with other management. The best part was the people.
good,a typical day at work was relativey busy with a steady flow of customers.
good,loved working in the call center its a shame it went out of business
good,great place to work. managers let you do your job without breathing down your neck and always watching you. only time we saw a manager when we needed help.
good,A typical day at work is usually pretty busy with customers floating around trying on and finding clothes to their liking and helping them out.
good,What I really liked about my job was each day brought something different. I would start my day by editing paysheets then I would go to cash office and run cash bags from registers and then I audit the registers to find long and shorts and fix them. I handled customer problems.
good,"Great people,fun to work in this store. Hours goes fast because theres no time to play around. Great managers and working staff."
good,"overall working at jc penny's was a partime job my job was a shoe sales associate , i am a peoples person and enjoy helping my customer to make the right on their purchases and also was able to suggest merchandise, my co worker were like a family everyone was team player, the hardest part of the job was the cleaning up after the store closed and the most enjoyable was putting a smile on my custormer face for good services and see them come back on the regular."

good,I really did enjoy working here for I felt greatly appreciated working there.My typical day consisted of me walking the sales floor and determining where to place the next days merchandising plans.I learned more about leadership and its more than just telling associates what to do but to work together efficiently as a team. My co-workers were great and very supportive. I learned so much from them and am greatful for having met them. The hardest part was getting associates from different backrounds to work together.The most enjoyable was seeing customer compliments that they had an enjoyable shopping experience.
good,"I enjoyed working in the kids department a lot. Customers were great, I was trained well in many different departments, and I was able to feel a good sense of understanding of what was epected of me, and what I was required to do on a daily basis."
good,it fun to work there they teach you alot of new things . you have to remember alot of things and sometimes it can be stressful. management is good they are welling to tech you as much as they can and they have alot to do . co-workers are kind and they will also tech you as you go . the hardest part is remebering where everything is and doing you job fast and neat. the enjoyable part is doing your job and then going home.
good,I greet about 5-8 customers in a four hour work day. My co workers are very easy to get along with. The most enjoyable thing about my job is meeting new people.
good,"The typical work morning would consist of morning meeting to go over new or previous assignments. I learned products, sales, performing credit card applications. Management understood their employees. We had celebrations whether it was some ones birthday or just acknowledging an associated ability to uphold credit card sales, customer ratings ETC.. My co-workers were older than myself so it was fun learning the new things about the store and what they have experienced over the years. The hardest part was making sure the department was well kept on ""that"" busiest weekend. The enjoyable part was again meeting new customer and keep a rapport with the existing ones."
good,each day consisted of stocking the merchandise and greeting the customers being on time and making sure our workplace did not fall under standards
good,My co-workers were great to work with. There is a nice friendly atmosphere.
good,Opened salon and got ready for the customers.
good,Their management needs improvement because they dont communicate well with their employees. The employees make the company.
good,"Even though they are going through major changes, I had a nice experience working there. The older management had the views of the new way. From the words of James Cash Penney run the business by ""The Golden Rule"". If you do not know that,,,u need to to find it out. It is how everyone should live by. I believe that all retailers should go by the rule. Good luck JCP"
good,"I learned how to work at a fast paced and be safe at the same time.The mangement was ok, and co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,Working for JCPenney was an overall pretty decent employment experience. A typical day at work consisted of me checking both ends of the store for returns in my department (Home and bathroom). I also walked the department making sure everything was neat and in order. As well I also tended to customer inquiries.On days when i was scheduled for front registers i rang up customers final purchases.
good,"A typical day at work includes lots of communication with customers, you have to be able to bite your tongue at times, and make customers as happy as you possibly can, you also have to realize that sometimes you can't make the customer happy regardless of what happens. Other tasks included in a typical day is cleaning up after people, folding clothes, dusting fixtures, running a cash register and being responsible for the money in the registers. Management and co-workers are easy to get along with and very welcoming for the most part, but with the variety of backgrounds that come together and work there are bound to be dissagreements from time to time. The hardest part of my job is the big overhall that just took place at JC Penney, all the price tag changes and preparing everything for the first month was ALOT of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding that item that the customer was looking for and getting the awesome feedback of knowing that you really made their day by helping them."
good,I have worked for JCPenney for almost 10 years. Their core values are based on customer service and putting their people first. They are great with recognition and if you do a good job for them they will help you get where you would like to go.
good,"during the time I was work, company mostly hired part time helpers, pay little, yes they have oferr inshurance but it is imposible pay for with 26 hours per week,"
good,Friendly associates and management. I learned how to set merchandise to store planogram and detail merchandise/recover. Ensuring to customer service customers and put clothes back in place.
good,The optical was very easy going. There wasnt many customers all the time so we had time to make the store look perfect and presentable. I had great co workers who were willing to help anyone out. I loved helping others. But I did not enjoy the stress that comes along with dealing with perscriptions.
good,"Working at JCPenney was one of the best work experiences. Especially for an extroverted person, such as myself. I personally found dealing with customers to be a joy since finding the specific style and shoe for them was almost like a game. And if we didn't have a certain style in their size, finding alternatives added to the changing element. Even the though the job was essentially the same thing everyday, it always felt different. I still keep in touch with some of my co-workers who I befriended over the months. My only complaint was the barrage of Christmas music I had to endure over the holiday."
good,"JCPenney is a great place to work. Associates are fun and full of life, It's a joy to coach and interact with them on the floor. We have contests for credit and care plans and it definitely brings up moral for associates."
good,Some clients thought if they saw a picture that they could have their haircut or look like the image. Hairdressers job is very stressful not all clients will be satisfied can't please every client that sits in your chair. Outside of the salon a much more pleasant place to work.
good,"Working in retail can be really fun you get to meet many people. There are some perks such as, an employee discount, free lunches on holidays and other ocassions. It is face paced especially around the holidays. Overall, it is fun to work there."
good,very organized company with good benefits and perks management is very reliable and helpful they take time to listen to your concerns
good,"JC penney is a great working atmosphere, just wish that pay and benefits were better."
good,"JC Penney is not a traditional call center. Therefore, the work could be quite challenging at times.  However, I achieved the most growth in my professional career, in my role as a JC Penney Customer Care Supervisor. Also, I absolutely enjoyed working with the diverse group of associates and leadership team."
good,"This store was at a mall and had a Sephora, so alot of foot traffic. It is one of the most successful stores in the region due to the hard working manager and teamwork."
good,Great place to work if it’s for a second job or just for extra money. The hours are not guaranteed and it’s hard to pay bills that way. The managers are wonderful and easy to deal with.
good,As long as you pay attention and listen then the job was pretty straightforward. If you show you're ready to work then they'll give you that extra work.
good,"I’ve been with the company for almost four years and have changed and grown into four different positions in all that time. If you work hard and prove yourself, your hard work doesn’t go unnoticed and that’s something to appreciate."
good,"Great place to work!! worked with your schedule, family atmosphere,  and great incentives for hard work! "
good,I have work full time and part time for this company due to the flexibility of working schedule.  This is a company that puts family first and they are will to work with you.
good,"At JC Penney’s I worked In the jewelry department where I had to be in charge over a million dollars worth of jewelry."
good,JCPenney has been a great job but over the years. We have gone downhill with benefits and raises. Also job security basically does not exists. Retail is a hard job now with Amazon and other online retailers.
good,I recently quit because of family/school problems and didn’t have time for work. But I enjoyed most of my time working there and can only name a handful of bad experiences (mainly w customers not even coworkers or management) it’s a great first job or just first time in retails Very high paced weekends and holidays. Slow week days.
good,"Honestly, this job was really great especially for a college student. The people for the most part were kind, and goals were not impossible to make. Hours were flexible, pay was great! Doctor had older equipment so some flaws happened at times. The biggest negative is the lab, you can give the best service to the customer and the lab would ruin it lol. Lab was so unreliable, backed up orders, lost orders, broke glasses. Of course, the customer just sees you and blames you. It makes it harder to sell if you have no faith In the lab yourself. If the lab was improved it would definitely be perfect."
good,"Tight deadlines and a lot of hours."
good,"Good part-time job back in 2002- 2008;"
good,I worked there as a seasonal employee. Amazing work environment. Almost always someone to help you. The management was always so wonderful. I would recommend working there.
good,I felt comfortable in my work area and with my co-workers around me to give me a hand if needed. My manager and supervisor were both very kind and supportive of how I did my work and for that I'm thankful.
good,My job was to listen to the clients needs follow instructions make them beautiful I also had to stock shelves book appointments run cash register order prosucts
good,It is fun to work for this company. It's an easy job and if you do the work the time goes by quick. You better enjoy customer service because that's what this job really is.
good,The managers are always willing to help when needed and are approachable. Everyone there is approachable and easy to work with. We all help each other with tasks others are unfamiliar with. Customers are mostly nice and easy to deal with. The hardest part is trying to get some customers to understand company policy as they think we can adjust it for them and them only.
good,"It is a favorable work place where the old and new, young and old blend. Employees are cheerful despite exhaustion and overlapping of tasks. This atmosphere provides energy and inspiration even to the least inspired."
good,Seasonal jobs are very short in terms of how long you work their so I did not get to see it after the holidays which would be a big difference from the holidays.
good,Working at JCPenny gave good costumer service skills plus many other while dealing with every day work duties. They also gave me the chance to move up in the company.
good,JCPenney was a good employer although  some hours were long it did provide me an opportunity to learn different department duties which helped me work with other employees.
good,"Nice place to work at. Very flexible with hours. Supervisors will encourage you to do better, the manager not so much. Stay away from her. Other than that everything is great."
good,I didn't work at JCPenney long only three months because I was seasonal. It was my first job and I really enjoyed it. I got along with almost everyone I worked with. As long as you focused it was easy to get the job done whatever it could be. And the more experienced staff was always willing to help me or show me how something is done.
good,This has been the best job I’ve worked at. The people who work there are pretty nice and they respect your time and let you leave when your time is up.
good,it was pretty fun when I work there the manager was very racist other then that everyone was nice very convenient nice and neat  you to love going to work every morning
good,All in all I love the work I do. Managment has its quirks.  Would be nice to have a manager that knew their surroundings and how to better handle situations.
good,They work you hard but the employees and managers are pretty great other then the few people who will talk about you behind you back or just bad mouth you because they worked there for so long but it’s ok
good,I clock in and go to the floor and then I start helping customers. Doing online orders and checking customers out . If not busy the you will recover which means folding clothes and straighten up.
good,I enjoyed working with a diversity of people.  I will recommend this company for students who want to work part time.  I got to learn to work with on line customers.
good,Management was good and the benefits were good to I just couldn't support myself financially because I just wasn't making enough money to pay my rent and my bills. But I loved doing sales.
good,"Muy buenos el empleo, me gustaba, pero muy pocas horas trabajo"
good,"Nice place to work at. You meet a lot of people and learn a lot from them. We have nice managers and LOD’s at our company. If you need a day off, the proper way is to give them 1 1/2 week to 2 weeks in advance . Work with them, they will work with you."
good,Management is very helpful and mostly enjoy the part of job and used to work as team leader and help the team members and work equally with them and submit  all on time .
good,"I enjoyed my time with JCP salon as well as all the training they provided."
good,"Good starting job.Would only recommend as an entry point to a different "
good,They have a great team of associates and managers. Everyone gets along great and I really feel like my voice is heard. Over the last year associate suggestions have been taken seriously and I feel that the company has really tried to make everyone feel included.
good,I was glad I work for jcpenney for the experience there was people who helped me so much the supervisors was very understanding when I had family emergency my supervisors was understanding
good,Workplace environment is friendly and colleagues reach out to help one another. The management is understanding and resolves any issues that employees may have to make the workplace environment more productive.
good,Expect varied hours and duties. Lower range pay. Remember that this is just a job and your results are dependent upon your general attitude. Security in the department is high with someone watching over your shoulder all of the time. You must be able to work with more than one customer at a time and always promote their credit card to all customers.
good,"Always a pleasure to work for this company in my many experiences throughout the years. Family oriented and flexible scheduling. It's all in the diversity and an attitude of gratitude blended well with excellent customer service.  The latest fashions for entire family for all seasons. Great sales everyday.  JC Penney is American retail company, founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney and today engaged in marketing apparel, home furnishings, jewelry, cosmetics, and cookware. The company was called J.C. Penney Stores Company from 1913 to 1924, when it was reincorporated as J.C. Penney Co. Hats off to remarkable endurance and success."
good,Hours were low a lot . But my availability had to change due to child care they worked with me on that issue which I’m grateful for. I would recommend working here as a part time thing
good,I love working with my coworkers makes the job shift fun and easy. The customers can be rude but you always have managers to deal with them if they are extremely disrespectful.
good,Its a very fun place to work but the pay and hours isn't that good. The store it self is was to big and its not that fun to work at to many bad customers.
good,"Manage a team of 5 experienced and professional selling associates."
good,Management and team worked together to make a efficient work environment. Great place for a team or independent worker.  Keeps all customers on top priority and team members feel comfortable and responsible for their tasks.
good,Best company to work for. People and managment were great and the company cared about their employees. They respected me as a person and the work I did for the company.
good,It’s been such a good experience working for JCPenney. I can say management has improved in the past few years and I also like to work and see people from different backgrounds.
good,JCP salon company has seen many changes . I have worked there about 19 years.  Enjoy the stylists. Very flexible for me.  I am very part time at the moment. I have worked full time part time and they have worked with me.  Flexibility is very important to me.
good,Overall it has been a good experience just like every job there are hiccups but I’ve been able to move up into new positions. I would like the pay to be better
good,"I would definitely work here as first job. It gives you the experience you need like people skills, money management, time management, and business skills. They are usually good at working with you life schedule"
good,I love working here and I enjoy it. Everyone gets a long very well. The supervisors are very nice as well are the rest of the co workers. Although the pay rate is not all to great it is a nice job.
good,"Awesome place to work and management is is very professional. "
good,"Your able to receive good hours , management is well ran and other associates are polite and really feels like a team effort . Good benefits and overall a good place to work ."
good,It Was A Great Experience Workers Were Great And Working As A Cashier And Stocker Was A Great Experience. EveryDay At Work Was A Great Day To Work And I Will Be Happy To Comeback Again And Work There
good,The morning shifts were fairly slow on weekdays. We were able to finish recovering the store. We were able to switch roles on the sale floor when it was needed.
good,"The only negative aspect about my time at JCP was in my last year at the specific location I was in, the Management was going through several changes, I was hoping for improvement, was disappointed when it did not.  Had to resign due to high stress, caused by poor management."
good,A wealth of retail knowledge and experience throughout the company. A company that has been focused on the customer for 100+ years. They strive to focus on the customer experience and making the shopping experience a memorable one to keep the customer coming back.
good,Nice people flexible hours. Rotate departments so you become familiar with the store.  On you feet for 3 to 4 hrs. Can be tiring for older individuals
good,Very good first job. Very easy going. The team there is very helpful & always willing to help if needed. The management is pretty good about making sure their employees are taken care of.
good,Excellent high level management teams. Enabled employees to take accountabilities for their decisions. Enjoyed my time there and took away valuable learnings that I would later apply.
good,As I am very competitive having sales goals daily was exciting. Department Managers were always positive and encouraging. A very positive enviroment. Team work all throughout the store.
good,"JC Penney is an awesome company to work for. All of the Associates and Management are friendly and helpful. However, due to the decline in recent years of people visiting the store and the mall that houses JC Penney, as well as the lack of promotion of the salon, there is little to no way for a new stylist to exceed the hourly rate and be promoted to a position that will offer more money. The only stylists that make decent pay are the ones who have been with the salon for 10-20 years and even they have seen a huge decline in visitors to the salon.The pay is not ideal for a living wage or for someone who has a family to support and bills to pay. That is the only draw back to working for the company. If they were a busier store and salon and paid more, I would absolutely stay. But being able to provide for my family takes priority over all else."
good,Very interesting days helped put merchandise out on sales floor make sure every customer is as satisfied as possible. Was always right hand with the mens manager department having daily projects with her remodeling the sales floor to be up to date.
good,"I worked there for about 10 years.I was very happy there,and made some lifetime friendships with a few  of my co-workers.My only complaint would be that I was not paid well enough to match the additional responsibilities that were required of me over the years."
good,"This was probably one of the best places I've ever worked in my adult life.  Unfortunately it didn't pay that well and there wasn't much opportunity for advancement with my particular stores that I worked at.  That being said, I worked for JCP for 10 years and thoroughly enjoyed it.  If it weren't for the economy tanking around 2008 or so, I may have stayed on there for several more years."
good,Great company to work for. My manager was always very interactive and helpful. The store always held fun events and company parties. Fun customer appreciation events as well.
good,"I was paid on production so if you didn’t meet your work criteria it involves your pay rate, but I had an amazing work experience while I was there, if I didn’t move I’ll still be there"
good,I liked working here casue you are constantly doing something . it is  hard work keeping up with everyone esepeically during the busy seasons but you will never run out of work
good,Working here honestly helped me during high school was very well established. The managers were very good on communication and making sure every thing was well with everyone of us.
good,A very stable and competitive work environment. There is room for personal growth and advancement. You need to be able to work as part of a team and be willing to work overtime on occasion.
good,"Teams must work cross-culturally and schedule time for strategic planning via store map operations and tasks."
good,For my job the hours were skim unless it was holidays or you were in tight with management which they'll acknowledge someone who did less of a good job more than someone who did a great job only because they favorite them. I'm sure that's not all stores though.
good,"Fun work environment, easy work for great pay. The employee discount was awesome, employees also get a discount at Sephora which was nice. Laid back kind of work."
good,"Overall, It is a good company to work for. Flexible scheduling and fun associates. The management team is also great. Sometimes it gets to be a little over whelming, but you can expect that at most retail jobs."
good,"With any company trying to be competitive. Weekends have to be covered. That’s the biggest complaint. I hear, but with that said this company offers very good vacation time that is accumulated over years. Longer you are there! More you get! I do believe they do the best they can to stay competitive. With work/life balance."
good,I retired from J C Penney and l always had a positive experience with the company . Many things changed over the years but your store discount is great. I worked for them for 15 years left for 19 years and returned for 5 years and retired.
good,"It was very fun to work there, I had really fun coworkers and the job was always fun. I was new and they took me in and made feel really welcome and showed me the ropes of the job right away."
good,Your day starts with a plan and set goals. While merchandising and re-setting the floor you are helping customers find everything they need and helping all other departments with keeping the store neat and clean.
good,"Great place to work. get to meet new people, try out new products, get discounts, management is great!  You get free continuing education.  You get to try out the new products when they come out.. Free haircuts. Used to get free hair color and free perms, not sure if they still do."
good,"Overall I found the company to be fun to work for. The holiday season can get a little hectic, Black Friday is always a madhouse, but for the most part  of the year the store stays at a slow but steady rate. Good work environment."
good,It was a fun place to work you walk around the store seeing what needs to be straightened to look presentable to the customers. A lot of the customers are very nice. I always like to try to help them find something that they have seen in the store. It's Really a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed this job the hours were great. I didn’t get many raises but the pay was ok. I did a lot of walking I enjoyed the customers and management was great.
good,A typical day at work may start off slow but around the holidays it could get a little crazy. I was good at assisting costumers with what ever they need as well as adding things to their cart. There when working at the register you had to make sure to move quickly and efficiently.
good,"I liked working there. However my manager at the time was always in the middle of drama. Caused horrible rumors all around the store. She had her good moments too. The hours were good. The more you know, the more they will use you. Main issue was moving up in the company, it was hard because they would just swap other supervisors from one department to another. Hoping something will work out."
good,Working here is a blast! Great staff. Hours are short and flexible. Work load is never more than you can handle. There is never a dull day working here.
good,"Good place to start a job and to be experienced. Good management, good working environment and friendly staff with positive attitude. Good place to be"
good,"Great place to work for ,would still be there if they didn’t transfer my job to other J.C. Penney warehouse in Columbus Ohio.worked with some great people and friends."
good,The people I worked with were great. The company loves to promote within so it gives you great advancement chances. Fun to work for. Gave us every other weekend off. Money is ok.
good,Great place to work that provided me experience to pursue further endeavors in the future. I was able to get a lot out of my coworkers and the management was always very helpful and understanding.
good,Only downside was no hope for advancement or even full-time (consistent 40) hours. That also created problem with obtaining full time benefits. There was absolutely no overtime. No one was to get more than 32 hrs/WK. My direct lead was amazing. She trained me efficiently and effectively so I felt I was able to have more asst manager opportunities because of her great job at leaving and caring for her associates
good,I was hired on as Christmas help and i would recommend it for temporary or part time workers. The management are very knowledgeable and helpful and the company is very good to employees.
good,It a pretty good job is cool how you get to be inside with good temperature which makes it easier to focus more and also the co workers are really friendly.
good,A typical day starts off with instructions giving and then I am driving the forklift all day which includes loading and unloading trucks taking all merchandise to it's prospective areas. Very diverse company with the hardest part of my job having to sometimes find equipment to use and the most enjoyable part was doing what I loved.
good,I really liked the jcpenney store I worked at. I liked all my managers. They did a good job at communicating with the workers. The only bad part was the other employees that worked the sales floor. They liked to play the blame game and not take responsibility.
good,It's a great second job. Works well with my schedule. The pay is not good but the discount is AWESOME!  I love my managers.    It is hard work though.
good,JCPenney is a fun work experience where you can meet a lot of good people and improve your customer service and sales skills. However I don’t feel it is a good long term career as the pay isn’t enough to support average day to day expenses.
good,If you're looking to gain experience in retail and need a flexible schedule this is would be it. Fairly simple job along with great returning customers.
good,Awesome work environment with friendly colleagues that constantly seek to better themselves. I'll recommend Halliburton to anyone that's willing to grow.
good,"I loved working here, the only problems I had were management playing favorites with employees and the pay could have been better considering you worked almost every weekend and holiday."
good,"Great place, diverse, well organized, they work out a very flexible schedule, non criticizing, get along with others, staff is nice and on the job, everything gets done in a timely manner"
good,"Productive atmosphere, Great team experience, Advancement opportunities, Competitive salary,  Clean and safe working environment, Employee discount, Exciting"
good,Retail work is over worked and undet paid. With hardly any benefits.  The only thing I miss from working there was the employee discount on shopping.  But my coworkers were always good to work with.
good,"Absolutely loved every manager there but did not like the hours given to me even when I asked for the days off I didn’t really get them , it was hard to work around my soccer schedule"
good,Salon manager was awesome however the other managrment team members treated the salon employees like corporate employees. Its a great place to start your hairstylist career because you're paid an hourly wage while building a clientele and part time employees are offered benefits. Huge bonus! More salon advertisement by the store is needed and additional store signage would have been great to let customers know a salon is present. Corporate obviously does not appreciate having a salon in store.
good,It’s a good place to make friends. But after so long you can only go so far and you only make so much. It wasn’t enough to help with personal family..
good,"The managers are understanding and easy going, they work well with other jobs and schooling that you may have. The job is not hard or burdensome and the other associates are relaxed and easy going. Altogether the people work together to make JCPenney's a great place to work."
good,nothing  follows  I do not wish to give any type of review at all for the company . Nothing follows for this space listed asking me to write a review.
good,Was a fun place to work at. Made new friends while working there. Management was good. Interesting customers all around. Something new always happening.
good,"I was hired  in for Christmas  help , they keep me after that I was there for 2yrs and 4 months then that store close down.  I  ran register, stocking and pricing and signing."
good,"As a sales Associate my core responsibilities were to take care of the need of our customers, attend the cash register and keep the clothing and other products clean and presentable. I often had the responsibility of organizing, folding, and hanging items of clothing or shoes. If I was not doing that, I would be at the register checking out customers or helping our customers find what they were looking for with ease."
good,"Receptionist, stylist, coloring/cutting hair, opening/closing, stocking/selling product, inputting client appointment details, fulfilling client needs and emotions."
good,"I was employed in the Catalog and Credit Departments. I was pleased with the working environment, Staff, and Customers. The Job had slow periods and busy periods, and I had to adapt to both."
good,JCPenny was interesting working one on one with customers to fit and help with fashion. Targeting the right market to get to apply for a credit card and honor their discounts and coupons.
good,"The sales associate job is fun in terms of staying busy and working with people who are nice. You will always stay busy because there is always. something to do. Your superiors are helpful and resourceful, so they are a good tool to use."
good,"The staff is supportive to other staff members, and I didn't notice any competition between anyone. Very positive atmosphere. Very clean, and organized."
good,I really enjoyed working as a loss prevention officer. I was able to be on my own with my coworkers. Management gave you the freedom to work on your own.
good,Lot of advancement thought the company. Love the environment and company. Alot to do and never bored while Working in the store. Multi position training
good,JC Penney is a good company to work for in many ways. There is not a lot of room to advance and retail overall seems unstable these days but JC Penney offers a lot of benefits others do not.
good,It was a good place to work at. Good experience as well. People here was nice. Customers were nice as well. Very clean & well organized place to work.
good,working at jcpenny you would have to have the patience and a free spirt due to customers but overall staff is great and very helpful in so many ways  and also understanding
good,Everybody is friendly and helps one another out. Everybody gets their work done and continue to help others if help is needed in different departments. No one is judgmental.
good,"A typical day consists of running the store, responding to LOD calls, putting truck merchandise to floor. The management team is great. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing merchandise sets and working with customers."
good,"Nice atmosphere"
good,JCPenney was a good environment to be around. Helping customers find the things they were havin a hard time finding or even finding them something to wear for a special event always made me feel good inside. The benefits of getting customer to join the credit program were always good to have.
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work, with great people to work with.  I have worked at JCPenny for ten years in the jcp.com/catalog department, where I handle sales and customer service in the online jcp.com department which include the ordering/processing/returning of online orders; the processing of daily shipments/cancellations, call lists and shortage reports; and the managing of monthly and annual inventory.  Duties also include answering the store’s multi-line switchboard which includes customer inquiries, management referrals and trouble-shooting complaints."
good,"The only negative thing I can say about JCP, is the lack of job advancement. The JCP in Ardmore has been a home to me, the associates who are there are great people. The JCP corporate really needs to pay more attention to our store. We have had general managers in and out. We are a great store and deserve a lot of credit."
good,When working there it’s based more on how many credit cards you sell and getting the target amount sold for that day. A lot of gossip and having to compete with other associates.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working a JCP, I got to use my skills as a past manager in a position that didn't have as much of a responsibility.  I liked the store manager, was very encouraging."
good,Jcp was a good job while I was in high school. I worked with a lot of class mates and I gave me enough money to do whatever I wanted to do while I was in school.
good,"My responsibilities as  a Loss prevention Officer:"
good,"Good part time job. Flexible, management is relaxed. New co workers constantly. Great employee discount of 25%. FRANKFORT LOCATION IS THE BEST JC Penney."
good,JC Penney's was my first  job and. They taught me all the fundamentals of being in the work world. This was a perfect place for me to begin my journey.
good,"Comparing to my old job, JCPenneys is pretty reasonable and understanding to their employees. Customer Service is not an easy job so it is nice to have a work environment who supports not only its customers but also its employees as well. Of course it depends on the management. Currently, most of management I work for listens to any issues that arises and does what they need to do to fix any sort of conflicts when Sales Associates do not have any authority to do so. I believe managers should be able to handle conflicts and deal with them accordingly instead of expecting their employees to do ALL of the work when customers have a specific demand and JCPenneys I work for has exactly that. However, the lack of help around the store AND the hours being cut from hard-working Sales Associates is hitting hard. I know it is because JCPenneys is hurting financially and this can cause a lot of decent workers to jump ship if hours cannot sustain their daily living."
good,"Computer skills, multiple phone lines and scheduling multiple appointments. Fast past salon environment, with several client interactions daily. "
good,"During my 2.5 years working in the district office for JCP, I was able to deepen my knowledge of working with executive leadership team.  I worked independently 3 days per week while they traveled then enjoyed collaboration time with them 2 days per week.  I enjoyed people immensely especially when I got to assist in planning recognition and quarterly events.  However, my position was gradually being eliminated across the franchise so I took the opportunity to return to the financial services industry."
good,"Overall, steady,reliable work company. Commission quotas always were met,but sometimes difficult because of working with ten other sales people on floor."
good,"JCPenney was a casual workplace that I enjoyed for 10 years. Management was ever changing ,but I learned a lot through training .I would go back if seeking a job. When there was an emergency in my family -JCPenney management was wonderful! "
good,"Its a very fast and funnyplace to work in the heart of queens ny, and youre are always busy doing onr thing or the other whichmeans time go fast than you realized."
good,"everyday was different"
good,I love working at Jcpennys. I loved working with children. Helping people pick clothes for there children was very rewarding. Working with children can be very exciting. Lots of baby picture token in JC Penny clothes. Helping parent with size and colors kept me busy.
good,It is fast paced but the managers were always friendly and accommodating. Good job for developing customer service skills and learning proper backstocking skills.
good,"The job was easy somtimes time consuming, work flow was fast paced which was good..Management was not all that great. Superviser was better than the manager incharge."
good,"Perfect for when my children were little, part time limited hours, then more hours available if desired. Customer Service Call Center, great group of people to work with!"
good,"The pay was great and I got excellent hours. The more hours you work the more breaks you get. There were a few times I was called in, but I always had the option to say no. They were as flexible as possible, its harder when its last minute of course. The pace can fluctuate at any time, so you do have to be prepared for that. Also, many customers liked to be walked to everything so there is a lot of walking and standing."
good,JC Penney was a great place to work.  The atmosphere was fun and also competitive.  We were driven to work with bonuses and prizes. The schedules were somewhat flexible as well.
good,First ever job I had. SHOE/SALES Person. AT the beginning it was very exciting I learned that i was woring with the top 5 salesman in the world. I wanted to be just like him lol But sales are tough you have to be a go getter is you miss a step someone will be right there to grab that sale from you. I was comission and the only thing about that is if you have a return they take it off your next check
good,"At the time it was great to work for JCP, I was making money being in the salon and the customers were awesome, the pay was great, tips were amazing, I hustled!!! I make money!"
good,"It was a fun experience, everything was calm. I learn some responsibility how to work the cashier and how to talk to customers. The hardest part of the job was when you couldn't find the product and then customers start to yell at you and so did the trainers."
good,Worked in customer service. Worked with morninf stock. Trained as a bridal comsultant. Able to make discisions involving customer related issues. Promote sales.
good,Fun relaxed environment. Great people. Good advancement possibilities. Great benefits with competitive pay. Great place to meet new interesting people.
good,"I loved working for JC Penney. It is a very fast place to work. You meet great people everyday and get a chance to bright someone's day with a nice word or just by assisting them with their needs.  Management does tend to be a little all over the place but in the end they get the job done.  They treat the employees with respect and tend to shoe the appreciation quite often.  Most of the time the issues comes from the employee themselves. I do have to say that the hours are long due to a lack of employees who take their job or position seriously by not calling in or showing up for work. All in all, this is a great place to work part time since they seem not to hire full time workers as of late."
good,This was one of my first jobs and it used to be cool when I went back it was different so I stayed out of managements way but over all it was cool !!!
good,I got to meet many new people and try to help them out with any problems that they had. Many people were very nice and respectful and those are the people who make your whole day better.
good,"I worked in most positions around the store in the 15+ yrs. I was with them. Friendly co-workers, attentive management, stressful and demanding at times, but fun most of the time. The holiday long hrs. were awful, especially before Thanksgiving, and Inventory prep. in the Shoe Dept."
good,"The staff were great, and it was easy to catch on to the job. The hours were great, and staring pay was nice. As long as you work, you will get the hours you want."
good,"Really good environment, room for advancement, Management just depends on the store, Work hard you get noticed make sure if you want to advance and get promoted talk to the management and store manager, Great place for College students school and work balance"
good,I was never promoted and I work at JCP for a year and a half. I loved my coworkers but the managers weren't realistic with tasks and goals. I worked long and hard enough that customers thought I should've been promoted to a manager.
good,"I enjoyed working at Jcpenny because the staffs were amazing, everyone was very friendly, i did not have no problems working there, someone was always taking care of me checking if i was ok and i had no problem when it came to asking for my day off.."
good,I work there. For 13 years i was full time and i was on hourly and commision both ofcourse they changed everybody to part time for awhile i had a lot of benefit because of being full time employee but ofcourse all the compayies changed i become part time i lost some of the benefits but i was ok anyway i really liked that place i found a lot of freind there the place was very freindly i loved my job and the work i was doing i was happy with the money i was making because i was a good sales person and my benefit rate was good the employees getting along good i did not have any problem with managment either i do not know may be it was me i am a people person the distance for going there was very good for me ..we had in store a lot of activity like celebrating ocasions potlucks awards encouragement. good working place thats my thinking anyway...a lot of learning training in my area..certificates..awards..
good,JCPennies was a great atmosphere and a great place to work. They gave us gifts on holidays and discount on store products. Most of the employees was very nice and we got free lunch and breaks
good,I work at this store for 8 years love it. I work with some great people.  we do not have enough workers there. customers all was complaining about it.
good,"Around half the time there I was in sales, and quickly became the top sales associate. I very much enjoyed working for a well known company that had an appreciation for professionalism. But mostly enjoyed the interaction with customers."
good,"working at Jpenney is cool, flexible schedule,good team members, good management (handful) , but overall it was a good experience working there. Thank you"
good,"Wonderful place to work, great social setting and able to build communication skills while learning new ways to work faster and more efficiently. would reccomend."
good,"Retail work is difficult, but many JC Penney stores have great associates and managers that want you to succeed. Many stores are closing in this economy unfortunately."
good,"good place to work, great people to work with, great benefits great customers, they do good with your scheduling, a excellent working environment, tons of happiness in the environment."
good,"Constantly helping a guest find the exact item they are looking for or folding clothes the proper way are the two main things one will be doing at JC Penny, and will enjoy doing."
good,"Window Covering Sales"
good,"I Learn good customers service, working with different people, love to do different tasks, helping any customers that need help, answering all customers needs."
good,"Most days a work were productive; a lot"
good,JC Penneys was an excellent place to work they had good hours they treated very fairly it was a good place to work I only left because I was offered more money at another company with better vacation and more sick days and advancement.
good,My time was cut short. It was due to the testing which cam back not in my favor but still hired and when asked to retest I did but did not follow up after suspension.
good,"Gained several skills in the work place and honed skills as well, such as communucation and processing of transactions. I also learned how to apply customers for JCPenney credit cards."
good,Working there is fun and refreshing. You meet and greet new people. The managers are good they are always there to help and we all learn new things everyday.
good,The job was very easy I enjoyed it a warehouse cool coworkers just everybody working getting the job done. I like the job also because I was always busy on my feet had something to do
good,"JCPenny is a place of limited opportunity. I was bought on as a seasonal associate, however; with the lack of work and hours I was laid off. It has a strict attendance policy, and a tight fisted dress code in Sephora which was overbearing and unnecessary. However, my co workers were patient, friendly and engaging."
good,"loved working here, lots of great co workers, but awesome customers.  Wish they hadn't closed it, but I understand.  I think could have been managed better to maybe see if the store would pick up, but the expenses for the company just didn't make it feasible"
good,"Great environment to work, the people are very friendly and outgoing. The only problem that I encountered on that workplace was the new manager that came in. He is not a very friendly person."
good,"JCPenny was an overall nice place to work. However, I did feel overworked for such a low salary which is one of the reasons I put in my two -week notice."
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work, past faced and you need to be able to answer questions from diversity group and direct customers to where they can find merchandise as required when they ask the location of such products."
good,"JC Penney has been around for so long, but after almost going under in 2012, they really had to revamp their identity and climb out of the gutter. As an associate, I was okay with having sales goals, credit application goals, and individual tasks. As a manager, however, the responsibility of carrying the success of the company is a little over-bearing. It always feels like one bad day in sales can ruin the store. However, I would still say that JC Penney has been my favorite employer. Their inclusion tactics makes every employee feel like they are truly a part of something, no matter how small their title may be. They are the first company to give me a leadership position and see the potential I have in my career development. If you enjoy the numbers game and you want the team environment, JC Penney may be for you."
good,"I had great people to work with, I would hit my goals often, I wanted full time but nothing was ever open. I got pregnant and ended up not being able to be on my feet so I had to go to a office job again."
good,"Typical friendly work place  , very nice staff , lots of higher  jumps , very fast pace job , everydat is different u will b doing different things , i loved it tho , nice place i would go back"
good,"I counted money. cashier, customer service.,, retail . I customer service,  Willing to straighten clothes. Willing to do exact what the manager asked to do extra work. Helping customer finding they what they wanted.."
good,"JC Penney management would expect an employee to get the ad set up for an entire department by themselves. The main problem with this is the home office did not coordinate with the stores to have enough of the price signs to accommodate all the merchandise on sale at the same price. Also, the price signs could not be kept straight on the ad cart, because of a lack of room on the cart. This was mostly due to having too many kinds of recurring sales, and therefore too many different ad signs."
good,This was a part time job that I worked at while trying to buy my house. It was a good second job and allowed me to accomplish the things I needed. I enjoyed working here.
good,"JCPenney's  was fast paced at times but it was a fun atmosphere. Everyone worked very hard and you had a real sense of team work. I learned a lot about my customer service skills from helping with catalog item returns, phone calls, catalog inventory, opening & closing duties."
good,Fun to work here. came to work folded clothes and was cashier mainly. went to lunch and came back to do more of either. Went home and then came back to do it again
good,"Good workplace that is flexible with school schedule. Great place for college students. Good place to learn customer service skills, how to handle money, and  multi tasking."
good,This was a warm working environment and was always a cheerful place to work. All the departments worked hand in hand to ensure that the days went smoothly and when sells were being held.
good,"In the beginning, JCP was a company full of culture and a strong sense of the Golden Rule.  After going through now 5 CEO's in ten years, the company has lost a lot of its culture.  So much turnover, transition and jockeying for positions at regional and corporate level."
good,very well company to work for  they treat you well  the hardest job of their sometimes peolple will call sick and had to work double shift the cultulture was great when you where finished with your deoparment sometimes manager will let you dances and make you parties
good,"I work in the Home Specialty Department, Selling"
good,Only complaint I have is hourly pay could've been better other than that if I had to go back I would in a heartbeat. Really was fun especially during the holiday season.
good,Great place through and through everyone works together and no one is above helping one another. The managers are very sympathetic and understanding when or if an employee needs time off or is late. I loved working here!
good,I loved working with the company. You will always have different types of customers but typically they were all happy when they left the store. A job is never easy but a typical work day was always productive.
good,My employment with JC PENNY was enjoyable.Meeting new people every day and helping customers with their purchases and interacting with other employees
good,"Licensed IPA Guide with the Arkansas Health Insurance Department, assisting citizen’s with enrollment in health insurance with the Affordable Care Act."

good,I gave this job four starts because it was a great job great benefits the only problem is they overhire so hours given per week are short other than that my co worker were nice everybody gets their  job done great teamwork
good,"Mostly Warehouse/General Labor Jobs. Management seems to know what is going on, high turn over in the labor areas, Management stays a long time 15+ years."
good,JCPenny is a great place to work at. If you are a college student the meet your needs but you would not get the benefits from the beginning. The pay is little and you cannot live off of it.
good,"They were very flexible and understanding when it came to scheduling, which helped out a lot due to the fact I was also in school full time and had children. They were very good about giving recognition for achievements."
good,"JCPenney's is a great first job, but it is not a job where there is much room to grow. Hours were flexible during the holidays, but slow and harder to get during the off season. Scheduling while having a second job was near impossible as they would schedule me during my unavailable times."
good,Jcpennys is a great place to work great work environment and opportunities and prosper. The board of directors have goals to make the company great and it’s an awesome place.
good,"There was typically enough work to keep you busy throughout the day. Some days there was too much work that management couldn't train me properly. Management for the most part were understanding and supportive even when I had personal stuff going on. The culture was amazing. The diversity of coworkers was awesome. Always learning new things. The hardest part of the job was making room on the sales floor for new product. The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion, was breaking down truck."
good,Great company.  People change just about every 6 months or so whether laid off or quit.  It is undergoing changes daily so I hope it survives in the retail business.
good,"It was a seasonal position. I don't have too much experience, however during the holiday I was busy the whole time. The supervisors were good to me and the culture was good."
good,"I enjoyed my time with JCP. It was a little bumpy at the start due to some bad employees who resisted the changes. I had busy days where I had to reset entire department and slow days where I had to move a few racks. "
good,"It was a good first job.  I learned a lot, learned how retail works and how to do inventory, work orders on a computer and learned a lot about the workings of a major dept. store."

good,The hours are very flexible with my busy schedule and the discount is great. I have never had any issues with my managers and there is always something new to learn.
good,the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who don't have a receipt when returning or the own managers.  Sometimes they become extremely rude that they would even curse you out.

good,They taught me a lot about customer first and pleasing them. They made sure i new all about the products i helped sale so if anyone had a question i could answer it properly
good,Nice place to build your clientele when just starting out.  Being located inside a major store in our local mall was conducive to walk in traffic for salon services as well as having a large selection of hair care products.
good,The work environment is really laid back. They make sure that you are comfortable working there. They really care about all of their employees. Love my job.

good,"I enjoy the opportunity of interacting with most of the customers.  My teammates are great to work with.  We help each other with situations that might come up.  I love the contest that we have, its something to keep you pushing harder at what you do.  Its something to learn everyday.  Learning different ways of how to calm a customer down, how to get them to purchase more products and keep their savings where they can see it.  Happy customers are great to have."
good,"I loved my job at JCP, but it was time I go back to the medical field. If I didn't want to become a nurse so bad I would have stayed. It was a wonderful company to work for."
good,"My first job into retail and it was an amazing experience. Every time I went to work, it would be an great. Everyone that I worked with treated me with respect and professionalism."
good,What I enjoy most about working at JCPenney was the people that I worked with. Everybody treats you with respect and care about your well being. I learn a lot from my managers.
good,"Little training and little support from supervisors.  Some supervisors show big attitudes.  Management focus is profitability of store, not on the store functions (recovery, cash wrap design and cleanliness.)"
good,The customer were good for the most part but would become upset do to lack of workers so I had to answer all the phone calls as I cahiered. It was still good job because I received good hours between 25 to 35.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers and helping them find what they wanted and needed. Loved meeting a diverse group of people. All jobs were high energy and sometimes long hours but still enjoyable. Management was supportive and great at all these places. Typical duties included: customer service, sales, Point of Sale, stocking, merchandising, store cleaning, and assisting with opening and closing of stores."
good,"My day starts with checking in shipment of glasses and contact lenses ordered, checking prescriptions and notifying customers that their orders are in for pickup.  Making reminder calls to patients or calling to book new appointments.  Training is ongoing. Management is friendly and fair, Culture is collaborative.  The hardest part is handling multiple customers when you're the only one there, The most enjoyable part is happy customers and the friendships made with associates."
good,"The management was really nice and listened and the coworkers were nice. As is typical sometimes getting break was a little hard sometimes but for the most part they tok care of you."

good,I very much enjoyed my time at JCPenny.  I learned so much from my fellow sales associates and managers.  I had not planned on leaving but felt the need to be home with my first child.

good,I worked there when my mom passed because it was close to home and it allowed me to get away from collection during my time of grieving without being stressed.
good,I enjoyed working at Jcpenny's. I worked in the back of the store unloading mechandise and tagging it. Management was nice as well as the associates. i would go back if I got the chance.
good,"Working at JCPenney was one of my favorite jobs ever. Everyone there was so nice and helpful; not once did I ever have a fallout with any of my coworkers. The only part I didn't like about working there was staying so late after the store closed, but I was also an irritating and grumpy teenager at the time."

good,"A great place to start and pick up retail experience, takes time to get the place malled but once you do you’re golden. Good majority of non-seasonal days are tame and easy-going, and everyone that works there is kind to each other."
good,It was busy. I worked in the kids and lingerie section. There was always a lot to do but it was very repetitive. All I did was organize tables and clean out the fitting rooms. Management wasn't bad but they didn't really help much if you wanted to learn more.
good,At the time of me employment with the company they were downsizing. the mood was good with heard works and plenty of hours but my choose of transportation cost me my job so please do not use COTA.

good,they were not giving employees no Hours a week only worked 15 or 18 Hours did lot of changing so I don't know what I know for Sure they did fire most the manager  so I don't  know how is there was asking me if can go back there
good,In a small town you get that close connection with the people you work with becomes more like a second family rather then work. You should always be welling to help the people who are learning and don't give up on them they all just need a little encouragement.
good,worked there part time for the season.
good,It had flexible hours and the staff was friendly. Black Friday is going to be rough since you have to put in a 12 hour shift. They have plenty of free food events.

good,Jc Penney has very flexible hours. Very productive workplace. Management is great! Great benefits. The most enjoyable part about the job in my opinion is making the customers happy by helping them find what they need.
good,My typical day consists of assisting customers to their desired needs. I learned great social skills and how to work a cash register. Managment was so nice and understanding. The work culture is very upbeat and helpful. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. I enjoyed socializing with my customers.

good,I enjoyed this job because it was relaxing at times and when it was fast paced I was not too stressed. The managers were nice and so were the customers.
good,"As a first job, I grew out of my shy shell and into the company as a person.  I became more confident and  eventually as I moved up through the company with several different supervisory positions I learned how to delegate and how to become better with each change I was making.  With people, with customers, etc.  I loved this job."
good,"Very understaffed, underpaid and slightly dysfunctional establishment. Coworkers their give you the will power to show up, customers are rude and believe they should have everything free or discounted and they love to ask to see a manager."
good,"I totally loved when JCPenney used to be JCP, the environment in the store was different, many changes from the CEO in the last years. Overall, JCPenney is and it will be my best option to work with."

good,Its been a while since I have been there so its hard to rate. I do know that the company went down after a change in CEO in  2013. They seemed to care more about the cash then the customer of the employers.
good,"In my department, (fine jewelry) it is very competitive. Sometimes very stressful. I love the knowledge that i have gained in my employment here.  They allow you freedom in your dress attire with some restrictions. Management is on point with keeping rules enforced.. Overall, it is a very nice place to work..."
good,"Relaxing, laid back, really cool team coaches, fun place to work. They offer OT and they also add in OT in your schedule for the week....so that would be considered mandatory, it works for me..."

good,"I worked as a Customer Service Representative in a call center in the J C Penney Corporate Office in Plano, TX. "
good,"It was a great place to work at as a second job. Very relaxed and easy but when rush hour picks up, it gets more quick-paced. Management is great but could work on some small details. Communication could be better but overall, its a great place to work at."
good,It was. Nice place to work. Didn’t want to leave but situations caused me to do so. Loved the activities and fun ways to encourage us to get icaps and get our jobs done. Loved the events and parties.
good,"it was  a great 1st job experience. it was my first time as an actual photographer. management wasn't the best, but when i was 13 the pay was good enough for me!"
good,"A typical day at JC Penney's consisted of greeting customers some rude and some to make your day, laughter, selling multiple shoes, getting credit applications filled out and shopping.  What I learned is to greet every customer with a smile and hello regardless of how your day is going."
good,Good people I had a fun time working there in the children's department I love working the register because of the different people you come across a good experience
good,"A typical day at work included answering phones for VP, updating VP's calendar, typing and processing letters and meeting agendas.  Process any expense reports and make travel plans as needed."
good,JCPenney has a great appliance sections and I had a great team to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other team members and the hardest part was the number of people who were just looking around since we were in the mall.
good,"This job is slow paced. There's not much activity going on. If you're not ringing up customers, you're making the sales floor presentable. The managers are very calm, cool and collective."
good,"There is a lot of teamwork, you always learning every day.  You get close to other coworkers. Sometimes you either work alone or with others, there is something to do every day."
good,"There is quick advancement options within JC Penney-strong on promoting from within which I think is great. The pay is not bad, and enjoy the management team that I have worked with"
good,Overall I enjoyed working in the infant/children's department. It was a lot of retail experience I gained for my current job in grocery so I am grateful for the experience and I also enjoy working in retail clothing.
good,"I worked in Men's and had fun. My department supervisor was the coolest and everyone was nice and helpful when I started. I got the hang of things fairly quickly so I was asked to do a lot which I didn't mind. Some people in management take away from it but overall, it was cool. I was sad to leave but I got a better opportunity in the money I was making for the hours I worked. I always did overtime when asked and my raise was a couple cents. I wasn't full time and wasn't getting enough pay for going above and beyond what was asked. This would be my second job if asked."
good,"Worked at JC Penney as a sales associate for only one year, got along with my coworkers. Trying to outsell in the jewelry department on commission was a bit stressful but when customers return their purchases was the worst"
good,"JC Penny was a good company to work for. As I got older, and started a family I was able to move my hours around so I didn't have to worry about child care. The managers were wonderful and caring and I miss working with them still to this day. Plus the associate discount was nice having 2 small children that constantly grew out of their clothes."
good,"Manny different positions offered"
good,Fun place to work for. Associates care about each other and help out as necessary. Management needs to work on holding associates that are not productive accountable and stay on top of it. As well some managers gets down and dirty others do not which lowers the employee morale.
good,My everyday task punch in on time and help the customer on the furnture order and questions. Research and locate customer merchandise and be professional on all calls. Make sure provide the customer accurate information
good,"Lees Summit and Oak Park Mall has some really great Managers, staff etc. "
good,"JCPenny Portait Studios was a great. The manager and employees were extremely nice and helpful. Working there gave me the opportunity to improve my communication skills when interacting with costumers, learning how to sell, and use the cash register. I would say sell would be the difficult sometimes, because some costumers came with their mind made up and there was no way to convince them. Over all I enjoyed working there."
good,The job was challenging and I enjoyed the temporary role of an assistant manager in the womens department. I enjoyed my team and reaching goals everyday. The responsibility suited me.
good,"High paced, walk ins, Manager is great, must be able to stand on feet for long periods of time. Must have customer service skills, and be able to use a computer, and answer phones."
good,If you can deal with some rude customers its a cool job because you get to wear a suit everyday if you want to and that's always a plus with me and others
good,"I really enjoyed the job. The pay was good and the management was also lovely. Even though I worked during the season, I received good hours while working there."
good,"Assisted and checked out customers "
good,"Depending on the time of year and day of the week, work can be stressful or a breeze. A typical day a work is about 5-6 hours and consist of checking out customers, assisting them with questions and needs, checking fitting rooms, folding/cleaning, and putting back clothes. From working at JCP, I have learned how to have patience and multitask. Most customers are kind and other times they can be difficult, you just have to know how to have patience with them because they could be going through something in their lives or just having a bad day. Overall, the hardest part of the job is learning how to have patience and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and interacting with fellow employees."
good,"Buena compañia, oportunidad de empleo a buenos empleados. Sueldo competitivo."

When asking for more hours, at times they’d tell us it wasn’t in “their budget” to offord to give us more hours. The good thing about this job is, if you do your job and are a reliable employee, get your department clean or make a lot of credit applications, you will be in good terms and make a good impression with the managers and could possibly get more hours this way. Also you can add $2 to your paycheck for each credit card application you get."

good,"I truly do enjoy my job, and also get along well the my coworkers. There is no typical day, every day is different but it stays the same pretty much all day. They actually make it a point to let you know when Management will be onsite, including the Store manager, just in case you feel the need to go directly to them.   I have PCOS and management has been very understanding of my needed days off due to health issues. I work as hard as I can, but I often have to move slow, or have had to call in because the cramps have been too painful and they have been very understanding.  They truly do care about their employees."
good,A typical day at work starts off at seven in the morning to three. We started out going through inventory to put out and going through the prices and changing them.
good,"I had enjoyed this job at first. it was a nice staff and not very stressful, then the new ceo took over and changed everything, the thing that did it for me was the fact they wanted me to work thanksgiving day at 10pm and I refused because I had to work my other job at 8am and I wasn't going to be there when it is a family holiday and they are being selfish"

good,"JCpenney is a great place to work. You develop great relationships. The working environment is good."
good,JCPenney is a great company to work for but the pay is mediocre. I enjoy being around the people I work with and the culture is very relaxed. I would say that my job is a good entry-level job for recent graduates entering the workforce.
good,"A Sales Associate must be able to handle customer's needs,  transactions, and, complaints, within reason; know their assigned area, be willing to be flexible if management has to change job duties, and, have a positive personality  while working with customers and their peers. A sales Associate must be knowledgeable about what is allow, and, not allow, by management of JC Penney, Inc."
good,Working for JcPenny was a very good experience. I was able to learn more techniques for ways to do things in the warehouse. It is a big responsibility to manage a clean and safe work place. learning all the shipment orders and importing information for the right shipments into the database.
good,Being a photographer there was so much fun i learned how a studio worked and now gained knowlege as a photographer. i loved working there getting to make kids and families smile.
good,This was a ok  job. I didn't like the fact that the require the salon manager to be a licensed cosmetologist but they do not allow the manager to do hair at all. This severely reduces the managers income to a low amount.
good,"The typical work day was spent refolding or helping customers. The nice thing was that the break room was clean and always decorated, which added a little bit of more comfort to it. The people working there are kind and willing to help."
good,Good place of work everything is in order the people are very helpful and hands on I enjoyed working with them team work was very big there we all worked together to get things done when it was needed
good,"Over all the company treated me nicely, on my first month I was awarded and my name was on the board as the best employee of the month. The customers I had they were regular, I see them everyday. It was fun."

good,A typical day at JCPenney would consist of putting out merchandise on the sales floor. Management was very helpful and cared about the job and performance the associates did.

I learned how to better assist others and provide excellent customer service. Management was overall good, though there were some minor conflicts with their expectations when we were understaffed in the departments I was in. However, they supported the associates well and were easy to approach with any problems. Overall, the workplace culture was good, the associates got along, both with other associates and management, and it was a relatively enjoyable experience to work there. The hardest part of the job was managing the multiple duties I had during high traffic days and when we didn't have enough employees at work those days.

I worked every department here and took pride of the way the store was presented to our costumers thanks to our hard work. It can be extremely tired specially during holidays, inventory or walk through from headquarters. The holiday parties used to be a good way to release stress."
good,"As a Major Appliance Specialist I have had the opportunity to test my knowledge that I gained from my education.  Management is great and wants you to succeed. While I believe that the base pay plus commission system could be better organized, the overall experience gained from this position makes it worth the time."
good,"Great job I actually love it here, good people work with because of all the positivity that comes with the place. If it wasn't too far I would not be on here and the pay is a little bit under my desire but its definitely a place for someone to climb the ladder and gain experience."

good,Learned how to work with customers. Used my second language to translate to customers. Management was well organized.

good,Take care of people that need information on the product in the departments I was in. Friendly helpful environment. Helping the people who where in need
good,"The company is pretty great to work with, honestly.  All managers and employees I worked with were amazing.  The downfall is how the company treats its salon.  The salon is always  located in a hidden corner of the back of the store while the newer stores have a big, beautiful Sephora located right in the front.  Salon productivity requirements have become difficult to keep up with for newer stylists, so it is somewhat cut-throat."
good,Fun place to work.  Great corporate office full of amenities for employees.  Great compensation and benefits.  Great people to work with.  Wonderful opportunities.
good,My department is very different and separate from the store. I work for the custom decorating department so I have a different manager and team. It is excellent!

They were extremely helpful and were often always available to assist me. My coworkers were great people as well who were also extremely helpful. Overall, it was a great first job experience."

good,"I was originally hired for a seasonal position during the thanksgiving holidays, for the black Friday sales. After doing such a good job, I was asked to stay on longer."
good,Enjoyed the job. Enjoyed socializing with customers and working as a team with fellow associates to get things done. Management was good at leading the store. I was trained well when I got the MA position and it taught me responsibility as well.

good,"I worked at JP many years ago between 1993- 1995.   I worked in Retail, Men's Shoe Department. The pay was good along with that wonderful commission 8%!   I think I made more there in a year from commission alone, than I do starting off at some of these other companies, nowadays. I loved the holidays, that's when sales poored in.  I love JP and use to like shopping there too, until the Mall area became a breading ground for gangs and riots!

Then I go and walk around the store to see if there are any towels or other merchandise to clean up and check the fitting rooms. Working a typical day is cleaning your department, checking customers out and doing any projects the managers have for you to do. JCPenney's workplace is diverse, we have different cultures, race, etc.. working at JCPenney. I love how we can be very sociable with our coworkers and that everyone gets along very well. One of the hardest parts about working at JCPenney would probably have to be selling our JCPenney credit card to the customers and meeting our monthly goals."

good,"The first time I worked at JC Penney was an awful experience. Had a few nice coworkers, but managment was a joke. Lots of favoritism. I worked a lot of late shifts, so it didnt leave a lot of time for a personal life outside of work. Coming back to the company after relocating was a good experience.

good,in a day of work in JCPenny you would have already cleaned up the department your in checked people out and make sure the next department is good. the hardest part about this job is having to know all the specials they have going on. the easiest part for me was cleaning my department and helping others. also the most enjoyable part about it was that you get to see all the new things coming out and seeing the customers faces when you give them a special they don't know about.

I learned a myriad of things here that I will forever keep with me as I pursue future endeavors.  As with all jobs, you'll always find something you never quite like.

good,"My general duties at JCPenney include assisting customers with needs and checking them out when they are ready to make their purchases. Also included in these is basic maintenance of the appearance of the store such as straightening up and folding merchandise. As a restocking worker I arrive early to the store and begin unloading pallets from a truck and then unload the boxes from pallets and arrange the merchandise onto racks and carts to be put onto the sales floor. The management is decent, they listen to problems of employees and are flexible with hours, but petty discrepancies are a semi frequent occurrence. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry and arrogant customers which is really more of an inconvenience than something difficult to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to take charge of and feel proud of the work that I am doing and being able to see improvement in the store."

good,Well maintained infrastructure and well planned project. All the requirements were meet before the deadline. Good place to work.

good,"Even with recent business challenges at JCPenney, it is still one of the largest and most respected apparel and home retailers in the country.  I truly enjoyed my time there and the relationships that were built with my peers and business partners.  The best part of any work environment is the team you work with and I have the privilege to work with and support some of the best."
good,"Working here so far has been great I've met so many co-workers who are great and some who think they can do it all which if that were the case the company wouldn't be seeking so much help so don't be intimidated but the kind of people who say comments such as '' i would've done it in 10 seconds flat'' umm so why didn't you lol..anyways the workers here that I've met have been very knowledge and helpful which is needed, i come in depends on the times but before 5pm i'm on the register which is alot to learn but with the right crew you can nail it, a shift after 5pm is recovery its pretty nice its my favorite part which means time to do go backs which means time to re-stock items back on the sales floor and have the store look presentable for the next day its pretty fast paced but your in your own zone which is good...the hardest part of the job i would say is learning the register the reason why its because you need to learn to pay bills, returns, credit cards, rewards cards so much not just your standard cash also learning where everything in the store is in general...management for the most part is good they work with your schedule i would say there's 80% of workers who attend school here so if your in school this is a great place that accommodates that not many jobs do also other who have 2nd jobs they also accommodate that..overall great place to work,,,"

good,had plenty of opportunities for you to move up in the company. the supervisors and the co workers were friendly and easy to work with
good,I LOVED working at this salon! There was a lot of wonderful employees and great training. Super place to work. My original goal was to only work at this salon for a couple years to gain a bit of experience before going on my own but I was happy here. I enjoyed coming to work. I liked the my boss (miss you Sharon!). My coworkers were my friends...and to find a salon with more than 4 stylists that get along (we had 12+) was quite a feat.
good,I enjoyed the work environment and the customers. I liked that they were able to work with my schedule. I was able to get along with a lot of the employees and managers.
good,"depending in which department you work in, usually understaffed at night. Floor recovery is almost impossible to finish in 1 hour. co-workers are awesome and make work fun. (at-least when i worked there) mornings are pretty slow. store gets really messy and long hours during holidays and back to school. usally given 1 hour lunch and 15 minute break which helps."

good,I had a fun time working with both management and my coworkers at JCPenney. the benefits and work environment were enjoyable.
good,A typical day at work consisted of updating signs for the Fine Jewelry department while assisting all customers that came into the department or needed help. I learned further how to communicate with customers and assist them. I also learned a lot of new information about jewelry that I hadn't know previously. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships built with the customers and coworkers. A difficult aspect to my job was having to find the perfect piece of jewelry for that customer's specific liking.
good,"they always have something fun for employee to do and growth with the company is amazing."
good,The customers I came across at Jcpenny were sometimes really nice and other times really rude and mean but regardless I always tried to make things easier for them.  My shift sometimes ended at 10:00pm but they would make me stay longer which isn't a problem. The employees are very unprofessional sometimes and gossip about each other around customers. I'm a quite person so I stay away from that. The management were very friendly.
good,"greet customers"
good,With this being my very first job I found that it was very helpful in learning the workforce. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the company was great. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,Responsibilities varied and opportunities for growth were readily available.    Project management was most rewarding part of the job and the expectations were reasonable.
good,"Jcpenney was a great experience for me, it taught me all about retail."
good,"The customers and patients are wonderful, and rewarding when they put on their glasses and can see clearer then before. The job culture is good. I've learned the importance of  time management, and customer service."
good,"Typical work day is prepping the salon for clients in the morning, printing out each stylists clients and providing them with client consent forms. Teaming up with the stylists to provide excellent customer service and helping a team associate if they fall behind schedule. Taking care of upset customers and making sure they are completely satisfied when they leave. Setting daily goals for each stylist they need to reach by the end of each work day, this insures we reach our goal each month. Running the front desk and booking appointments, helping out other stylists that run behind, posting hourly reports on sales. Walking the floor during slow times and engaging with customers to stop in our salon and come have a service done today. Always busy and always moving during the day. Schedules, scans, layouts, pricing, calling appointments for the next day, calling 60 non return clients to let them know about or specials for the next month."
good,As sales associate I had to work with the customers face to face helping them find what they needed and directing them sometimes to where they needed to go. I Worked as a cashier/customer service associate. Co-workers were fun and we all made a good team.
good,I liked working for JC Penney until they changed the pricing and closed the store closest to me. The ongoing education classes were nice. I would have liked to learn more while I was there.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting other people. I developed good relationships with most of my co-workers and it was also nice to meet new customers. "
good,"Clean up dressing rooms, check out customers, and help with returns. I get along well with managers and co-workers. Helping customers is enjoyable. Dealing with customer that are difficult makes the job less fun."
good,"I honestly adore this place. If your looking for a start somewhere up the creative or artistic alley in place where there aren't many opening for such, this is the place to start. Very ""eccentric"" friendly environment. You have to be working in a place like that. The one thing I will warn is that it's not for those who can not deal with noise and insanity nor high levels of stress. For that reason, it take a special person to work there. I'd describe it as an addiction for the the artistic rejects. It's like when you have that one boyfriend you know is no good for you and you keep saying once a month you're gonna leave him, but somehow you keep coming back for more. I had no idea I'd love that place so much. And for the workers who get caught in its web, we become family. You'll never become wealthy or well off just working at this place. You really have to enjoy and love what you do to work there or you won't last but 3 months. Oh, and baby projectile pooping is a real thing."
good,"a typical day at work is usually productive and moderately busy. Ive learned how to professionally make confirmation calls and answer customer questions and concerns regarding the salon, as well as handling cash, and working a register. Overall, managment was organized and reliable. Working with the girls that i do in the salon was the most enjoyable part of the job. They are all very sweet and friendly with one another."
good,Checked customers out at busy retail location.  Interacted with a cross section of clients and achieved positive customer feedback.  Was also cross-trained to handle visual merchandising and work the floor due to my ability to pick things up quickly and positive customer interaction.
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer service and floor duty, folding the clothes, making sure the place looked clean and was properly managed. I learned how to use a cash register and learned little about the online website. Management was fair. My supervisor was spot on, polite and very helpful. Others tended to be more harsh. Co-workers overall were ok. Since it was a seasonal job, there were more workers my age. Hardest part of the job were the returns and learning how to do credit cards and the online website. The most enjoyable was folding clothes and interacting and helping the customers."
good,"provided excellent costumer service"
good,"Excellent relationship with employer and leaders"
good,"Great team i love working with my co workers it some like we were a little family. I love helping people, I enjoyed helping with finding the right size or style for the customers it makes me feel I've done a great job and the customer was satisfied."
good,"capture family moments, which is fun and admirable. Staff and co workers are great. Company teaches you everything you need to know about photography. Beautiful enhancements, you create beautiful moments for clients that they will cherish a life time"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers find exactly what they're looking for within the store. The gratitude and appreciation expressed is satisfying.
good,"A typical day at work I would say would have been organizing merchandise and stocking up the products or helping out customers. I learned how to fold and size in shirts properly according to JCPenney guidelines. Management there was actually well, they handled situations always in a kind and orderly fashion. My co-workers were all very nice and helpful especially when I had an questions about fixtures or items that should get put to back stock. The hardest part of my job I would say was actually unloading  all the merchandise from the truck from all the boxes and wheeling the racks and carts throughout the whole store. I enjoyed working back in the stock room with my co workers and meeting new people was a big enjoyment to me."
good,Everyday looking forward to the challenge at hand.I learned basically to be patient and to just go with one pallet at a time.My co-workers learned to work with them communicate with them makes your job a lot easier to work with.Relax and be patient that was hardest part of my job sometimes wasnt as easy depending on job work.Having being there for eleven years co-workers becoming part of family and learning cross training working different areas.
good,"Most days I see customers that I help throughout most of their many visits to the store. I get along with all of my co-workers. Through the years of being with this company I have learned many details about how to approach others with certain questions and I have also learned a lot about the brands throughout the store. For example, when a customer comes in to look for a cotton material top I am able to give information and show examples from over 3 different brands."
good,"I would process returns "
good,"Working for JCPenney has been an overall rewarding experience. It saddens me now to know that there is not one in Plainview, TX."
good,"Great Company at the time to work for. Management was helpful and respectful to employees, to maintain and gain jcp rewards members. If there were advancement opportunities I would have stayed."
good,"order"
good,"Wyoming location was fantastic. I could not wait to get to work every day! management, detail to time and flow was just the greatest place i have ever worked at! The leaders and management did the best of guiding and supportive growth both as people and workers. Did not like the way the leaders and crews in Tempe but they are now closed any way so nothing great to say nothing real good."
good,"I worked in the windows department, where I order custom- made  blinds for customer. Work around with big sales in order to achieve targets. The most enjoyable part is when the store manager sees my progress and thanks me ."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Good first job, postive teams!A lot of hard work for little recognition or advancements. Rewarding and worth the effort!"
good,A typical work day will consist of a list of tasks to accomplish. Then the group will return to the floor to assist the cashier. While working there we went through a company change and the process was smooth.
good,The work environment is excellent and the team is very supportive. Good company to work for with opportunity for growth and development in specific fields. Pay is average and technical skill development can be limited based on the role..
good,"A typical day at JCPenny Logistics can vary greatly.  You never know what the work load may be.  This eliminates repetition, and makes the work day go by much faster.  I worked with some great co-workers and excellent management. There seemed to be no hard parts of this job.  Cross training was implemented for every department  which ensured job security for motivated workers.  This overall was one of my favorite places to work."
good,"a typical day greeting and helping customer with apparel purchases"
good,"The job I had kept me busy , loved being social with people, they had a manager who did not know how to communicate in a respectful manner, I learned how to sell credit, train and how to manage paperwork, hardest part of job was the lack of respectful communication."
good,"A typical day in the JCPenney Salon was very team oriented and fast paced.  The guests were very important to each member so they were given the utmost respect. "
good,"Basically, this is where I learned all the things I now know about what it is to work in a warehouse. For example, loading merchandise into the correct container to ensure it is delivered to the right store is quite important. The single greatest way to guarantee no additional downtime. Palletizing merchandise also is quite important as some needed to be prepared this way before it was loaded into the right containers."
good,Jcpenny job work place is a great job for beginners i think. They have great benefits for part time workers and fulltime workers. The management team is very helpful and upbeat.
good,"The associates were helpful, friendly, and made me feel apart of the team. The management did a great job at making sure everything was in order and functioning correctly and effectively."
good,JCPenney is a great company to grow in your career.  Prior work credit since the age of 25 is a huge benefit towards personal time off calculations.
good,"On a normal day I assign my team members what they will be doing for that day.I am friendly and  provide excellent customer service to every customer and assist them in what they're looking for. "

good,I sorted packages and built pallets and prepared pallets for delivery department. I learned organization skills and how to pay attention to details. Time efficient and met daily quota.
good,"This is a great place to work, but the pay could be better.  The stores that I worked at had caring and hard working people.  I learned a lot about dealing with the public and working with other people as a team.  JCPenney is a great place for college students, they work very well and close with them."
good,Staff were more than helpful at all times and management kept up with the scheduling properly. A good store to work at for both entry level and experienced employees.
good,"Making customers happy is my job, and making the goals of the company possible. I have learned a lot about retail and am still learning. I've learned a lot about how running a company works. The management is great and the co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job is always the customer service. I enjoy seeing smiles on the customers faces and I enjoy having responsibility."
good,"-Simple, multitasking, and friendliest enviroment"
good,Jcpenney had a great environment  to work for . i enjoyed coming to work and working hard for this company i felt that i was overlooked on a promotion.

good,"First start of the day is a staff meeting. It is awesome and informative."
good,Days can be long but its like working with a big family. Some management is set in their ways and hard to make changes sometime.  Training has been minimal but that have improved over the last year.

good,JCP is a good company.  They have wonderful policies that when upheld make them fair and a great place to work.  They have a lot of days where employees can dress down which allows for a smoother work day which makes the whole store run better.
good,"A very nice place to work, co-workers are wonderful. The holidays are just a bit stressful and working on Thanksgiving day is not my favorite, other that that the job is pretty good."
good,Fun fast paced environment that gives you the freedom to choose the hours you want to work and the ability to work with all kinds of people.
good,Pleasant but very causal insofar as one thing can either greatly improve or adversely effect another person's duties or assigned working areas.
good,A fun and friendly workplace. I have learned and mastered the cashier. I have got a lot of experience in customer service. My co workers was outstanding and work great as team players. The hardest part was not getting enough hours to provide for family. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and putting a smile on they face.
good,"JC Penney has wonderful management, they are flexable with work schedules especially if you have a primary job.  Our managers are extremely friendly and really care about everyone.  My co-workers were wonderful to work with, they were extremly helpful in training and what was expected in the departement.  The hardest part about working at JC Penney's is the lack of staff on the weekdays and not being able to assist customers on a timely basis.  The most enjoyable part about working at JC Penneys is assisting customers in their shopping and being able to deliver a great experience and establishing a relationship with them."

good,This job was a great place to work. I was a sales associate and had to make sure the area I worked was clean. The Company was the best to work for due to the people that were employed there.
good,"A typical day includes anything from handling freight work to assisting customers in the store, and also with in store online orders. Because this stores location is quite small i became very familiar with all of the wonderful employees and all the departments this store had to offer. So it was nice that things would switch up. Offering me extra skills in Fitting men's suits, store signing, answering phones, jewelry fitting, and much more. The hardest part about leaving the store was that i wouldn't be seeing my enthusiastic boss, her kindness and positive ways made work fun. The Co-workers who became my work family with would be no longer. As a whole i loved my time and experiences that JC Penney has given me."
good,"My daily tasks were to assist and guide customers with product information, pricing, and availability. I also was multi-tasked with processing sales transactions and organizing inventory."
good,Flexible hours. Good open door policy. Employees are very helpful in training and assisting new hires. And all are ready to help when the lines are full.

good,It was a fun job that let you work closely with the customers. I wish they paid better because I would have worked there for a lot longer.
good,I enjoyed helping customers achieve the look that would give them the confidence to conquer the world. JcPenny and the customer new that your appearance makes the first impression before a word is spoken. They understood the importance of looking good and being comfortable in your clothes.
good,It was a little bit stressful but it is also a great environment. You get to meet different people who are mostly very nice.
good,"Worked one-on-one with clients daily, booking appointments, and maintaining the appearance of the salon. For a period of time we went without a manager in the salon division, where I filled in as temporary manager, when manager did come on board I was able to train her for the position. "
good,"Fast paced and a great place to work for customer service skill building. Only negative is scheduling. You really cant build a social life or get family time outside of work because your days off change weekly and with the whole Black Friday mess and opening now on Thanksgiving. Both negatives should be expected though when entering retail as a career. They care most about $$$. The company that is, not so much your local store."
good,"Even though work life balance was getting more challenging, it was still a great place to work.  I learned EVERY facet of the business and was able to grow quickly in the company."
good,"My duties at JCP was to apprehend shoplifters while protecting the current customers, and staff. Also filled out reports that would later be used in criminal court hearings."

good,"the typical day a Jcpenny is being assigned to a area you are in charged of cleaning, putting merchandise where it belongs and helping customers find merchandise."
good,Nice environment to work.  Customers are very pleasant. Hours are not long. Very easy to make extra money if you use the tools that are given and taught to you.
good,Great company -  I enjoyed working there.  I thrived and excelled there.  I was able to work without needing direct supervision.
good,"I would help customers with their purchases and find the merchandise they were looking for. Also, keep the sales floor clean at all times in my area"
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking in the catalog truck first thing in the morning or whenever I get to work. Then I would go around the whole store collecting any and all catalog order returns or catalog damages. If any of those are collected I put them in the proper return boxes. After that I print the catalog inventory check list and make sure all packages are accounted for. Once that is completed I would go down the list of customers who have not picked up their orders and call them to either inform them that their order has arrived or has been there for 5, 8, 9, or 10 days. If their orders have been in the store for more than 10 days I am to refund the orders back to their credit card. Put the refund receipt into a letter letting the customer know that their order has been in the store for more than 10 days and send them the letter. I also will assist any customer who is either needing to order an item online, make any types of returns or exchange, simply check out, or apply for a credit applications."
good,"Make sure the department is clean before the store is open and the department got the supply they need."
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the registers. Put out any new merchandise, count diamonds in cases. I learned how to attend assist customers according to their needs. My communications skills definitely broaden. Management was great and was flexible as my life expanded. Co-workers for the most part were nice and knew their role in the department. I often trained new hires."
good,"Indeed suggests I tell what a typical day working at jcp was. The truth is, there was nothing typical about working there during the 18 months when a new CEO came in and changed everything about the company. It did teach us to work closer and harder as teams though. Both, in the salon and store. While we were finished rolling out something new they would send an email and tell us to change half of it then when that was finished they'd send another email and tell us to put it all back to the way it was originally. It was a roller coaster, all day, every day! "
good,"I would work the registers each day, organize merchandise, assist customers on the sales floor, and make sure the sales floor in my department was maintained and presentable. Management staff was very friendly and there when you needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays and running out of hot items, I loved being able to interact with customers face to face and enjoyed being in the work environment with my co-workers."
good,"This was the best job that I have worked at so far, it was also my first job. The managers were great and most of the workers came to work with a positive attitude. The store was big and there were a lot of employees but we all managed to work together like a family. I am very happy with the amount of effort everyone put in and how dedicated the managers were."
good,No complaints other than the location. It is located in a Dallas suburb  which will soon be flooded with businesses. Great company to work for.
good,sales customer service setting up cases counting jewelry working with  customers  and each other as a team cleaning the cases setting up sales
good,Great place to work which has a great culture with wonderful and knowledgeable people.  Work /life balance is superb.  The company has done a great job rebounding from the previous CEO.
good,"Loved JC Penney at Lewisville, TX very accommodationg with the hours. Great Managers and friendly employees.Close to home."
good,"As a Stocking girl, stay early waiting for the truck to unload the merchandise , and then start opening the boxes, and finally putting the merchandise away.  I learned to work on a fast mode under pressure.  the management was good. the co-workers were really work together to finish everything before we clocked out.  the hardest part was to leave my job because i got pregnant.  The most enjoyable is to start early and leave early."
good,"The only complaint I have about working here was that the Supervisors were really unorganized, so not much really got done and there was constant confusion with what we were suppose to be doing."
good,I looked  working a jcpenney because of the hour's and my co-worker that I worked with. I was at the one in white plain befor it closed and i love working there.
good,"As a Facility Maintenance Technician we do the start up of all equipment, verify everything is running smooth and properly."
good,enjoyed working for the management team. A very diverce atmosphere. The temp service was a little hard to get out of. Overall very empressed.
good,"I loved my job at JCP. I worked with some of the nicest people. I have seen some bad reviews of this company, it has had it faults in corporate in the past few years, but i have worked in 2 different stores and the employees become like family.  I lost my job at the Aiken SC store because of store closing, I worked with the best Manager and Co-workers anyone could ask for. I think if corporate hadn't made so many mistakes in the company there wouldn't have been so many store closings.  If I had had it my way I would have stayed with the company till I retired,   So if anyone is thinking about working there I hope you have as wonderful of a  manager as I had,"
good,J.C. Penney offered me a great base to establish myself in customer service and sales.  You are required to work one on one with customers on a regular basis.  Co-workers were friendly.
good,"clean dressing rooms, assist customers locate items, process order, place online orders for customers, sweep the floors,"

I've learned to work under pressure especially during the holiday seasons when the store is swarmed with customers. I've also learned to work with people with different cultures and background. I would say the hardest part of the job is working against the clock. As a member of the support team, we are required to work in a fast paced environment during the early morning hours (5am) which isn't the easiest thing to do, but as long as you stay focused on the job and have a positive, blue collar mentality you should be just fine.

good,"Having worked for JCPenney for 22 years, I have learned a lot about handling people in good and difficult situations."
good,"I enjoyed working here due to the fact that they encouraged their employees to go over and beyond for the customer, including taking bags out to peoples cars if needed, I really liked that because there were times older people would come into the store and would have a very difficult time getting all of their bags into their vehicles, they allowed us to spend as much time as we needed to help the customers find and pick out clothes and converse with them producing good customer relationships that enticed them to come back! The pay is alright and the management over all is good."

Customer service was our number one priority and that has remained a guiding force in my career.  Through the years there was always opportunity for advancement through hard work and positive results that became less of the standard  toward the end of my time there and relocation became the main factor for who would be considered for promotion.   With that said, I gained such valuable experience and knowledge from my time with this company.  I am who I am today because of various positions I held and experiences I have had.

good,I thoroughly love working for a company that takes care of its employees.
good,At JC Penney i  was taught to handle cash and balance cash drawer. the managers are very hands on with the associates. They taught me  how to multitask use time management skill and computer skills. I also learned to go the extra mile for my customers. If you ever have questions or don't understand some things the associates whom work there always make working there a joy by explaining things or helping in any way they can.
good,"Working at JCP was an overall great experience, the managers there were really nice and understanding as well as my co-workers. A typical day at work was just me being myself, talking to customers and helping them with whatever  they needed assistance with. The hardest part of the job was doing put backs, there were a lot of people who would have merchandise in all different parts of the store, but overall, the work environment was enjoyable."
good,"Always something to do, never boring.  Build great rapport with frequent customers and associates."
good,I work hard and do multiple different positions in the job but I don't get the deserve pay.  I like and respect upper management but sometime I feel like they take advanage of my skills.  Working there I have learned how to be a leader and for that I am truely happy and grateful because I love when they want to teach me new stuff but I deserve to be compensated for it.
good,"not only did I love working here, but I also loved being able to shop right after I got off of work especially because of the employee discount."
good,"Multicultural Customers."
good,"Fun place to work. Great co-workers."
good,"fitting room associate ,head cashier , count registers down mad sure the store was clean had to be the first person in the store"
good,"This was a good seasonal job as an undergrad, i enjoyed the good hours and friendly management team we had."
good,"I loved being the receptionist at this location, and was promised when I started by the former manager that I would be hired in as a stylist when I graduated beauty school. I was not brought on to the team, but still stayed in the hopes that one day I would."
good,Enjoy working learn a lot good co-workers management was good and nice no hard part of my job. enjoy work there.
good,My days was good I learn to tack and use the computer the Management where ok the co-workers where friendly the job was Fine I enjoy it.
good,The most enjoyable part of working here is the people. We all have compassion for our customers. We go above and beyond to help the customers.
good,Provided hair care needs for 7-15 clients per shift. Also advised them on hair care products and sold them things for their hair. Clients were such a joy.
good,"Very slow paced work enviorment, only busy during the holidays, but great management team!"
good,"a typical day at work was very productive and fun and everyday learn so menay things good."
good,i was only here for a short time but i gained a good experience from it. i learned that some people are very competitive and like to do things on their own. everyone was friendly but when it came to business was very competitive due to getting paid on commissions.
good,"enjoyable place to work  i enjoyed working with the people, the management helped alot. learning new polices and what not . the most enjoyable part  was the atmosphere."
good,"This place is a freaking soap opera. And the manager is fake and horrible. Great pay though, and the coworkers are friendly for the most part."
good,Workinging at Penny's was fine. They gave me good hours and the other people were friendly and helped me as much as I needed.
good,"many costumers come through, always have  a smile on your face and say hello. learned to be patient, deal with stressfull situations, manage myself with different problems. GReat management. hardest part is not satisfying the costumer."
good,"A typical day at work would definitely include customer service and coaching my team.  I learned how to do proper ordering for salon supplies and how to prepare in advance.  I also learned coaching in the moment.  I was one of the only managers in the store and mostly stayed in my department.  The rest of the management team, including myself would tend to run the show and bounce between team, customers and continue to network/source.  My co-workers were typically happy and tried to stay busy.  The hardest part of the job was receiving communication and direction from corporate.  There was a lot of changes over the last 2 years with the company and efficiency and uniformity was not always followed by the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to show new techniques to my team and see their skills develop."
good,Overall customers were happy and felt as though they were very important and special.
good,"This was the best retail store I worked at everytime I punched in for work, I recieved the love and support from my co workers and customers. I had to clean the stock room, and organize the shoes by  their brand name. If I went on the sales floor, I had to interact with the customers and fix the shoes that was out of place."
good,"A typical day a work like any would start with review of the days task and expectations from the manager.  I learned how to balance my day between department task, training, and observation of my team as well as others on the floor.  Some days went smoothly, others where challenging (like employee call ins, unplanned district visits, etc.)  but I would work with the team and fellow supervisor in coming up with a plan that worked for the situation.  This would involve calling people in, asking others to work longer or come in earlier, and moving team members around to balance the store.  This could be exhausting at times, especially if they store was busy.  But that is the challenge of retail.  My coworkers were great in pulling together to make things work.  The hardest part was having a lot of task and no time to do them so I would find myself staying later  to get them finished.  The most enjoyable was having a fun group of people to work with and to work for.  I have never felt more like a family than with this team"
good,"My typical day at work would consist of "
good,The associates are all very nice and there to help you when you need help.

good,Fun place to work. Its fun to deal with people and different personalities.
good,I found if very rewarding working with a great bunch of coworkers. I learned that not everyone learns at the same pace.
good,JCPENNEY always help new comer to move up and they have great coach and motivating managers
good,"The store is very welcoming and employees are very attentive,helpful, and diverse. It was a very bright and colorful setting. The displays were neat and tasteful. The work itself had it's challenges but it also was a joy to work there. I became more knowledgeable of the register and also doing online orders, which I've never knew how to do until I worked there. My co-workers very friendly and extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job was directing the customers to the right department. Given the stores enormous size and several departments, it would be confusing at first. But, the longer I worked there, the more familiar I got with the other departments besides my own. Out of all of that, my favorite part of my job was assisting the customers. Being able to meet all the different types of people and personality was the best part of working there."
good,i enjoyed working here with teams in different areas throughout the store. the staff was great and i enjoyed the hours. the only thing i didn't like was cleaning the store for 3 hours and not getting paid for it.
good,"Good advancement opportunities, but turn over a problem in the field ranks."
good,"Customer service. Seasonal work. Shoe department primarily. Stocking, displays."
good,"It was a great place to work at one time. My job was exciting, never knew what might happen. Cuts  in department hours caused serious team exposure to danger. Investigation of internal and external theft was challenging and fun."
good,"This was a diferent job than other one I had done got to know about the clothes and msot importantly women clothers sizes the most enjoyable part of the job was some of my co workers made some really good food. I like all the co workers who I have work they were very nice people, and I had a lot of fun Jc Penney is good place to work for ggod discount and getting good deal on clearance items"
good,Detailed contracts kept for all real estate transactions. Good cooperation among staff.

good,"There are the fun days and there are the boring days."
good,"Very quiet work place"
good,"I had very good compensation and benefits including paid"
good,JCP could be stressful at times. I had a problem with certain managers because they just didn't treat people right. I was always willing to try new things. I really found my groove in doing TTR. The assistant manager at the time didn't like how i was doing it but the way i was doing it was the most efficient way given the location of the ttr room. He was always on my back but the store had to up it's exporting back to the catalog warehouses because of my work. With me handling catalog processing both in and out we had the best shrinkage report in many years. I worked in pricing and replenishment. I was a cashier. The fitting rooms were horrible. you don't know what to know what some people do that we have to clean up! I've always said that every person should spend a full year in retail and get some perspective.The co-workers were great. I worked there for five years but i had to leave because my mom was moved into management and they decided to start enforcing one of their policies. But i worked there before Ron Johnson and all the changes.
good,Learned how to work with others. I am now able to help customers and make them leave highly satisfied.
good,Sold shoes and met monthly and weekly goals being out on the sale floor with my peers
good,"My typical day with JCP is handling cash register and folding clothes , go backs and arranging the stocks in my dept with great emphasis and focus on customer service . I learned that I have great customer service skills and a knack with people. I was awarded Employee of the Month for July 2013 even if I just working for them April 2013. The management appreciates what you do specially when customers are served well. The hardest part of the Job is having to handle difficult customers but having to put it off and turning it around is always a good feeling."
good,"So far my experience at the JC Penny salon has been good. The clientele is diverse and there are a good number of walk-ins to help new stylists build a client book. Hours are fairly flexible and you can request a set schedule if you have needs outside of work. However, there are no full time positions in the salon. The maximum amount of hours I have received is 25. Management does this so it is easier to keep up with the monthly sales requirements for each stylist. If you miss your numbers 3 times in a row, termination of your position is considered. It is challenging for new stylists to reach all of the required sales numbers each month, but the manager is aware of this and takes that into consideration when monthly reviews are done. Overall, I like working at the JC Penny Salon. It is a good place to build your business and work in a fun, educational, drama-free environment."
good,"A typical day at Jcp would be very busy."
good,you sign in and take orders for people ordering from a catalog
good,great benefits and could go into further career if wanted to
good,"Flexible hours! fun people to work with. As a sales associate you keep up with the fitting rooms, tidy clothing racks, help customers and ring them up at the cash register.  You should probably like people for this job."
good,Good place to work with good people. Selling shoes and JcPenney credit cards everyday. The hardest part was putting away stock because it was bigger loads with weight since you are carrying shoes.
good,Worked in the credit dept and love the store as a whole...only left because I went back to school
good,"We were responsible of soliciting credit, greeting customers, knowing the company's brand and merchandising,"
good,"Have worked for this company since high school, at various locations. I have worked at my current location for nearly 6 years. I enjoy the people I work with, my job is very fast paced and requires skill and talent in visual merchandising, and human resource management. The ability to think and change direction very quickly and sometimes at a moment's notice is required too with my position."
good,Very pleasant environment. Assisting customers with lingerie and everyone was team players.
good,"The work was hard sometimes, when the store was busy, but that just made the hours fly by. The training for JCPenney has to be the best I've had, they truly care for your career."
good,I was there for a month on a seasonal job. My co-associates were happy. My managers were helpful when I had questions.
good,"It was a fun place to work, you get to meet new people everyday.  Love all the merchandise there as well."

good,"Fast and Fun paced work environment"
good,co-workers always are dressed nicely and are very helpful. the management company is very outstanding. customers always walk out of the store satisfied.
good,JCPenney is a fun environment to work in. The staff is large enough that you have almost every walk of life under one roof. Management is well-organized and have meetings frequently to assess company/employee issues and resolve them as quickly as possible. Co-workers are usually work oriented and work well to get a job done. The hardest part of this job would have to be holidays. Most enjoyable moments would be the company parties and shift meetings.
good,Very friendly and hard working management and employees. Breaks are a reasonable amount of time. Management is very hands on. Employees make sure to keep store clean and presentable at all times.
good,"A customer service representative maintains a good relationship with customers. ... Learn something new every day More Info... by email ... They may work in many different kinds of companies, and their job descriptions can be quite varied."
good,"Rung up customers and helped in the Bedding Department and ordered the customers merchandise out off line.  "
good,"Some room for advancement, management is not too bad. Real straight to the point."
good,"On a daily basis, I deal with a group of friendly and supportive group of people. When you are not smiling, they tell you a joke or give words of encouragement to help you get through the rest of your work day. It really touch me when I have went beyond what is expected to help a customer find or order what they need or looking for. "
good,as stated in resume the day consisted of being versatile in what needs to be done
good,"Any job in retail is going to be busy. Working in the salon, we had our busy days and slow days. "
good,overall its a nice place to start out at. the company is really good and values great customer service. i enjoy all of my co workers they are fun to be around
good,I truly enjoyed working for the JCPenney company. My store manager was fair.
good,"Great company too work for and dependable. When you are in college they are flexible with your school schedule and always gives you reasonable hours. "
good,The workplace had a very laid back environment ususally but on the weekends thing got pretty hectic. It was a good place to work.
good,Management help their coworkers with anything they needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping costumers get what they needed. 
good,I had to change pricing and signing on the merchandise and help customers with clothing that best fit them and there personality.
good,Jcpenny was one of the reasons why I'm so good at customer service because of the proper techniques they showed me when caring for a customer. The workplace was pretty cool when it came to management and my co-workers.
good,this was a job i enjoyed but the distance and travel from my home was to far
good,"Helping customers find their sizes and getting their measurments, checking the back for sizes, calling other stores if we dont have what they're looking for, or ordering it for them through the stores cataloge."
good,Nice place to work and a great management team who care about safety .
good,I worked in various departments so it kept me busy in the mornings at night it was really slow. I worked with different customers and my day seem to go fast. The management was hard to work with because they were older the hardest part was not enough help and not enough business at nights.
good,I loved this job it was my first job. The manager and co-workers were very nice and helped me alot
good,The company is a good company to work for. The only downfall is that it is hard to get forty hours a week. This job is best suited for high school or college students.
good,Assisted customers with finding merchandise that best fit their needs.   I would also help my supervisor with other duties as needed.  We would work as a team to ensure that we provided excellent customer service to all customers.  I enjoyed learning new things about the merchandise at JCPenney.
good,They were really nice. They helped me with any problems or concerns I had. They made it a very nice environment to work in.
good,"I enjoyed working there. I think they were short staffed at times, which made the customer feedback scores low. It was a fun job and had a lot of creative freedom."
good,"After graduation, my family was relocated to Texarkana, Arkansas, where I quickly gained employment in management, along with a special affinity for team dynamics, one-on-one consultations, and career-boosting toolsets. Arriving 2 hours prior to opening allowed me the time to meet with management, locate and establish key relationships with businesses throughout the community, and prepare for counseling sessions to be carried out later in the day. The management within JCP was instrumental in delivering direction and access to the materials needed to successfully complete the task at hand. The hardest part of managing the salon was developing a rapport with the employees who had sustained many programming changes and poor leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of an internal transformation that boosted productivity, lowered overhead cost, and increased the teams morale. I found myself inclined to reach out on a personal level and assist staff and their families with far more intimate issues.    "
good,"I leanred how to do many thing on the cash register, made new friends . Everyday was a good day at work."
good,"I was your typical high school student with a retail job. At the time I was making more than minimum wage, so that was a huge plus for me. Of course, you recieve an employee discount which is always great! Cleaning up after store hours was always difficult, especially after a sale."
good,"I was responsible for one department and making sure the signs were correct.  Adjustments were made accordingly, and all merchandise was scanned on a regular basis.  Putting the customers needs first was a must."
good,"JCPenney was a fair place to work. The people were nice, they had three floors and they were always busy."
good,Harderst Part of the job keeping up on busy days. Managers are good.
good,"Very sructured and organized, I like working for this company."
good,I learned how to interact more with customers. I listen to their problems and solve them the best of my abilities. I also assisted with processing orders and/or refunds.
good,No longer employed with JCPenney. I worked three years on full time basis and two years part time evenings and weekend. I really enjoyed my Face to Face customer service experiences. Management and Co-workers were very helpful. I Would like to work part time at JCPenney again as I am familiar with the Department Store ways.
good,"a very fun often fast paced environment, lots of different types of co-workers we all get along great. hardest part is selling pictures to a customer who isn't happy with final product, or their experience. great discounts and very flexible schedule."

good,cool job to have. good managers and staff. if you love customer service than jc penny is a good job to have
good,"I enjoyed my job. Every day was different ,customer service of course being number one. Training was the favorite part of my job, I loved getting to know the associates,new hires and existing assocaites. I worked well with the leadership team when it came to scheduling and training. We all worked together and that helped to make our jobs alot easier. I love woking with people,customer service being a priority."
good,"The day at work started with a time to share with coworkers and everybody's daily assignment. I learned to deal with diferent kinds of customers, which helped me to be more social with them. I also gained more people skills through my coworkers and the customers.For instance, I learned about customers' and coworkers' ideas, cultures, etc. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with impatient customers and, at times, meeting their many needs. The part of the job that I found most enjoyable was the charisma that many customers' possessed. I'm still in touch with some of the former coworkers, actually."
good,Was a fun job. Loved my work schedule. Meet new people and made new friends. I was hired as seasonal and couple months later they gave me a position for a long time career. After couple months my manager loved the way I worked and made the customer satisfied she decided to give me a raise. I super excited. I just wished I still stayed their and I probably would of been a supervisor.
good,it was a pleaser to work for Jcpenney very friendly people very helpful associate.
good,"This company is definately team oriented and customer engagement friendly. I enjoyed customer engagement on a daily basis, working with other supervisors, coaching/team building my staff and acknowleging accomplishments."
good,"Assist customers with purchases, returns, payments, and credit detail"
good,I enjoyed working at JCpenney the hours were great and I enjoy all customer interactions.
good,Greeting Customers
good,I am very good with the customers and treating them as I would like to be treated. I go out of my way to help them find what they are looking for and to help enjoy their shopping experience. I would help them find the exact item they are looking for and assist them with coordinating their outfits for them.
good,"Jcpenny was my first starting job and I learned a lot from this job, I learned how to use a cash register, I learned how to handle money."
good,"Paying direct delivery invoices and charging individual stores for merchandise. Promoted to credit desk, crediting stores for un-saleable direct delivery merchandise. Invoiced venders for these un-saleable products, and General ledger adjustments."
good,"A typical day at work is productive and planned out, so that your time can be maximized to completing tasks. My coworkers were fun to work with and the teamwork was great; although the hardest part came because of coworkers and the unnecessary conflicts amongst each other that would go undisciplined."
good,Working at JcP was so much fun. I loved being there with all the customers we had and my co-workers were fun. We always were busy doing something and even if there weren't any customers I knew how to keep busy.

good,"A typical day in the salon is busy, fast paced and full of a lot of laughs. My managers are awesome in getting the things we need to be productive in the salon."
good,I was the stockroom supervisor and it was nice to to do all the training for all new hires that worked in the stockroom.And the mgr never had and problem with my work or my team.
good,"Wide variety of daily tasks, managers provide positive encouragement, great place to work."
good,"Most of the staff is great. All but a few managers are willing to support you and consider your side of the issue when anything with a customer comes into the light. Hours aren't too bad, but they could be more liberal with them. Duties are many but easy, atmosphere is relaxing, focus is on customers and not on tasks (that is, if you're assigned to restock a department and you don't get it finished because of customer interruptions, it doesn't count against you), and everything is mostly routine. Benefits are acceptable, and pay is workable."
good,"Taking phone catalog orders,Management was good,hours was good"

good,Nice people to work with and good discount.
good,this was my 3rd time with the company even though i was only seasonal i was still glad to be back with them i worked for this store in 1998
good,"This was a great job. The typical work day was composed of restocking and recovery on the sales floor and maintaining sizes, colorization and organization of merchandise as directed. Ensuring that the merchandise is out on the sales floor at the right time, in the right amounts. I assisted in the movement of newly received merchandise to sales floor; I filled and straightened stock in accordance with the company standards.Finally I answered customer’s questions."
good,"helping and greeting customers, helping decide wants and needs of customers. cleaning sales floor and fitting rooms. unloading sales items to floor"
good,"Jc penney providing a friendly working environment very cultural different ethnic groups and civilized people who took their work very seriously, but were like a family away from your home familY.Ive developed the basic skills of deciphering problems,resolving conflict issues with some of the more intensed customers.Above all the challenge of the job was the seasonal sales around the holidays trying to maintain a very organized store while you have aggressive shoppers who are determined to be the first in and out of the doors.However I enjoyed the chemistry of the superviors to the employees everyone had a goal that they wanted to achieve and their ambition was never limited."
good,"Provide client with consultation, including estimated price of service and length of time required, prior to the service."
good,"The people I worked with had become a second family to me. We got our jobs done right because we were all able to communicate easily with each other. I matured a lot while working at JC Penney's because I had a job that needed to get done and others who depended on me. My job consisted of everything possible in my department. From setting each months new layout to dealing with customers to working in the stockroom. To my other coworkers, I was the ""manager"" of our department. The most enjoyable times during work is when we'd get customers who open up to us and are very friendly and appreciate the work we do."
good,Good paying job. i learned about the POS system. Hardest part was the short breaks. The break room was also on the second floor. I loved my co-workers.
good,I really enjoyed the best task of the job of helping others. The management was always helpful . I was able to work as a team and individually.
good,"I worked for a month Christmas season before I moved to another state. Busy all day, but work went by fast. Managers were friendly and job was easy, but kept busy all day. Selling credit cards took patience when you had long lines, but it was easy."
good,"I was only a seasonal sales hire, however it was a good company to work for. You definitely got your breaks. Training was excellent. Working around holidays can get hetic, especially on black friday! But overall it is a good place."
good,"retail it was a great experience,great environment learned retail.ordering ,merchandising,scheduling,"
good,"This postion was great for a long time. After my position was eliminated, along with several others, everyone was worried. The management team in the store was great and always tried their hardest to keep everyone up-beat and positive. The hardest part of my job was learning to prioritize tasks and let go of what cannot be completed that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put some of my own ideas to work to help make the store look great."
good,"When I come into work, I am greeted by many hello's and how are you's. We usually have a meeting in the morning and at 5pm each weekday to go over updates, customer service, and scores. I go out to the floor, greeting customers along the way, and then walk through my department, Children's, to see what items are new, if things have moved, and over all state of the area. During my work day, I process transactions for customers, answer phone calls, assist guests on the floor, and maintain a clean and organized department. The hardest part of my job is to make sure the place looks great, but I have other specialists around me to lessen the burden. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing whatever I can to meet the needs of a customer and ensure they are taken care of and that they can feel sincere about how I took care of them. I love talking with parents and their children, giving out stickers and helping make special occasions special, not a struggle."
good,"I enjoy meeting new people every day. building new relationships with clients.A smile given when you know you have brighten someones day.When selling fine jewelry you know you have been a part of a special event that is soon to happen.I love seeing regular customers ,coming in just to see you.I know I am good at my job .I have learned many thing through out the years in retail sales.Customer service is a huge part of what I do in sales and I pride myself on that fact.Christmas is a busy time in retail but the spirit of christmas does touch many people so thats what I love."
good,Excellent communication and listening skills.
good,"Stocking merchandise of racks, rearrangment of merchadise, customer assistance.I enjoyed working with fellow employess. Hardest part of job was getting companies approval of Credit for Customers. Seeing my results at end of day."
good,"JcPenny's was great when I worked there. A typical day at work included stocking, organizing, cleaning, running the cash register, customer service, helping customers, and in-put of catalog orders. I learned the meaning of Customer Service while at this job, and management was the key to that lesson. Co-workers were great workers and especially the head cashier, since she was patient handling 2 customers at once(mine and hers). The Head Cashier knew the register extremely well. I think the hardest part of the job was finding where items were located in the warehouses, since that is where I spent most of my time when I wasn't on the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers."
good,"loved this job ,jcpenny was a enjoyable place to work helping customers out with what they need"
good,"Easy to learn,hard worker,packing out orders, picking orders"

My co workers were a great bunch of people."

good,Everyday at JC Penney is an exciting day. Customer service is a major priority and I very much enjoy interacting with the customers. My Managers and co-workers are excellent people to work with and they have taught me valuable information regarding retail operations. I would have to say that there really isn't a hard aspect of this job and the most enjoyable part would be customer interaction and the satisfaction I get knowing that I have helped someone.
good,"Although this company doesn't have a lot of room for advancement, working for JCPenney's proved to be fun, rewarding, and demanding. I was able to explore the trade of selling fine jewelry; there's a lot more to it than I first thought. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the commission rates. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a customer's day by showing and selling them the exact piece of jewelry they were looking for. My co-workers are I were a very close knit team.

good,Great place to work. Really enjoyed it. The pay could be better. Alot of changes in process.

good,"I loved coming in to work, it was a relaxed yet professional atmosphere."
good,Co-workers was a enjoyment to work with. Editing internet orders for Customers was a pleasure especially when you have fixed the problem of the order or assisted the Customer over the phone to help them learn the internet site to shop. Only hardest part of the job and I would not call it hard was handling irate Customer's. I always seemed to calm them down before they would get off the phone.

good,"- Unload shipments, sort products, build pallets, wrap & move them in place"
good,a typical day at work. Had more customer experience. Got along with management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was stocking. and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers in what they need.
good,It was a part time minimum wage job that helped pay the bills. At the time management was a bit shady but other wise there are no complaints.
good,Great company values. Learned how a large apparel store operates. Management and coworkers were very supportive. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping employees to be the best the could be and providing great customer service to customers. Most difficult part of the job was maintaining the same company standards and expectations while staffing was severely reduced.
good,"Very fun place to work, I worked in the service desk, encodeing checks, money orders, chashing checks."
good,I was the associate at the end of the line responsible for labeling and shipping packages and boxes to place them on trucks for distribution. I helped to implement ideas to make the process move quickly and get more shipments out throughout the course of a day. I enjoyed the hours I worked there as they worked well with Taco Bell and being able to support myself with the pay. The work was very physical however it was not difficult.
good,"Provide accurate and expediate processing of customer orders-domestic and international, as well as internal store support."
good,"JCPenneys had alwas been a good company intil the last several years, I worked in commission sales and business got slower and they took full time employees and made everyone part time, which meant you didn't qualify for benifits. That was the down side of working there. I loved the people there and hated to leave."
good,A typical day at my work is greeting all my employees with a high positive vibe. My management staff is wonderful. The hardest part of my job is the nights that I work. I enjoy working with people and the public. I am very motivated and socialable.
good,"I've learned a lot about the retail world and how things really work in it thru JCPenneys. All of my co-workers are great and everyone gets along well as a team. We have wonderful management that always leads us in the right directions. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is having the openess working in the office area, coming and going at my own schedule while still being able to easily meet all of my deadlines. The hardest part recently has been the major cut back in hours. It has been making it very difficult for me to guarantee my bills are covered each month."

good,"Very fun enviroment, accomodating bosses . Direct what they want done without being rude . Very helpful as well."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. I was hired as a seasonal employee during the holidays. When hired they say that you have the opportunity to become a permanent employee if you show up and work hard. I worked very hard, went above and beyond by doing things I wasnt asked to do, helping others when they seemed to need it. I was never late and never called in. WHen it came to the end of the season it was clear I had never had a chance to stay. They hired 100 people and barely kept 10."
good,JCPenney's was a really fun place to work. I loved being able to meet new people everyday and help them out with whatever they needed. All the workers new what they were doing and were very nice.
good,"There were many lessons in balancing the day to day priorities while keeping my attention on the next day, week and month ahead. Relationship building was the core of maintaining and exceeding expectations and goals. With 26 stores and 100 or more sales and management team memebers to visit... there were many different personalities to traverse. I found my coaching skills to be very helpful."
good,I would assist customers with selecting frames and lenses for customers needing glasses.I also educate customers on various types of lenses.
good,"You get to meet people from all walks of life, you can offer a new look, or help find a favorite look for the customers along with keeping up with the latest fashions."

good,Diversity of employees. Work was continuous yet not laborious. Great options for hours worked. Management was great at accommodating scheduling and assisting when needed. Employees were great. Customers were highly satisfied.
good,This job is based off opening up credit cards. The more you open the more hours you get! This job is very easy and you could learn the system in a day or two.Stay on task and get those cards and you’ll be a good fit for the company!
good,"I liked how we were able to earn more money by selling credit cards, it was 2$ each credit card we sold, so it gave everyone more of a motivation to go to work and try our best with customer service."

good,A great place to work and foster your growth with utilization of many highly skilled professionals as partners that support your initiatives and field.

good,"JC Penney. Offered opertunity to learn about not just the retail business but the fashion industry in both the clothing and home industry's.  In my position, receving the the goods off the truck was giving us the team. 1St Glace at new products. As the visual team it was gratifying to create new displays. "
good,"I am a Christian which helped deal with all types of people. In twenty five years, I had only one  belligerent customer. I consider myself self motivated, willing to help others where there is a need. If you came to my counter with an attitude or sad, you left with a smile.  I enjoy people."

good,Very flexible with my availability and always works to accommodate emergency situations with family or Illness. I love this company and the people whom I’ve grown with. Pay could be better. But overall this company has my heart.
good,JCPenney was a decent place to work. They offered flexible hours to work with your schedule. They tried to give you hours based on  your own personal availability.
good,"The hiring manager at the time was really nice and helpful. The work environment was pretty welcoming, it was a really interesting first job. The discounts were pretty nice as well. The only difficult part was during holidays and when we had sales throughout the store. It got pretty hectic, but that's to be expected when working in a retail store."
good,The whole employment including management really looked out for their customers and their employees. They were a good company to work for for an extended period of time.
good,"Corporate really cares about their associates. I’ve been with the company for close to 4 years!! If you are a good worker, on time, not lazy, show interest in your job, you can grow with the company. Lazy people don’t grow in Jcpenney. The insurance, 401k stock options vacation time.... it’s a great company. 💜"
good,I worked there for 12 years and worked my way up to general manager at store closing. It was a good company to work for and they paid well. I chose to take my separation package because the closest JCP stores from me are over 45 minutes away
good,"The most difficult part of this job for me was selling the jewelry warranties/repair.  Other than that easy peasy, and always interesting due to changes in inventory and customers."
good,"It was good but had to quite for medical reasons. They provided training, which I loved. It was a very relaxing environment to work in mostly. If I decide to go back to hair I'd most likely go back here."

good,"I enjoy the coupons, discounts, Associates discounts, benefits such as insurance, 401k also have good management at JCPenney in Menomonee Falls........................................"
good,Some of the new supervisor didn't know what to do half the time but is a fun place to work at. Good pay for hard workers. And a lot of overtime for those that want it. It can get slow from time to time
good,Working with JCPenney is such a great experience and teaches me so many new skills. I highly recommend a job like this as a first job as it helps you grow within retail!
good,This was my very first job and I loved it. I liked that I got to work in different departments. My boss worked with my school schedule. The staff were all nice and helpful.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work, I met some pretty cool people and my boss was really nice and funny. I would definitely recommend this job. They are a caring company, if something tragic happens they do whatever they can to support you. The pay is okay, not something you could make a living off of tho. The only con is you always have to make sure your telling customers about the store credit card. It can sometimes be difficult if they say no, you have to keep asking until they give 3 no’s. Some people do get very angry"
good,One thing I liked about JCPenney is the training they gave us in cutting hair. The  different Technics they showed us as well as the chemical classes they provided for us.
good,"I like where I work and the people I work with. I like how much I walk when working here. I learned a lot about different brands, and how clothing sizes vary from petite, regular, kids, and plus. The work environment is friendly, and the managers are always really nice and encouraging."

good,This was a very good place to work. It gave me a lot of room to grow within the company. They care about their employees. I would go back if I needed to
good,"A typical day at work involved coordinating with the other 2 members of my manager on duty team. I needed to check my schedule daily to prepare for the set number of new employees who needed to be in a training class. I had to balance the number based on how many training registers I had in my office. I also had to assure that certain associates upheld their certification status on a regular basis. In addition to the training duties, I had the role of manager on duty. It was a position that involved effective supervision of employees, such as cleaning out dressing rooms and letting us know when were needed for issues with our customers. It was of utmost importance to diffuse the situation and let the customer leave the store without a bitter taste in their mouth. The workplace culture was that of teamwork, a feeling of building the store together. Many of the original employees stayed with the store for a long while. I learned that I was good at working with people not just a coworker, but as a supervisor as well. I learned to balance many aspects of the position while giving my best effort overall."
good,"Working the floor can be really stressful, especially on busy days if you’re alone in a department. Working with other people makes the job a lot better. Management is great: friendly managers/ supervisors who work with your schedule and are very understanding when it comes to mishaps. Associates are very friendly and mostly easy to work with."
good,Working at JCPenney was probably one of the best times I've had at a job. It wasn't so serious and professional that you had to stay on task at all times. You had time to cut up and joke with your coworkers while you were working. It was a really great team building opportunity.
good,Enjoyed working for the company until they changed up a bunch of management etc..... ok company to work for. there were times that it could be fun. its clothing
good,"My compensation became competitive with other part-time fields of work.  I was able to save with ease and manage my money better."
good,i'm pretty happy hear. managemnt really listens and hears eveyones concerns and works hard. jcpenny doesn't always pay the best but there staff makes up for it
good,The company has been around for 100+ years which is great for stability. The workplace culture is fast paced. You will normally be working with the latest technology for your field. Above all the quality of the product is front and center.
good,"Cashier, straighten, learned quickly; enjoyed meeting people and helping others; hardest part no team work; enjoyable part interacting with customers."
good,"I really did love working at JCPenney. Depending on the time of year, the hours and the store itself can get out of control. Tidying up clothing and the store is a part of the job, and when it's busy the clothing racks can get ransacked. Overall, I enjoyed this position and would work here again."
good,"I received Customers at my counter and answered their questions about clothes that they'd like to see.  I cashiered with cash and credit cards.  I folded clothes and kept my area clean daily.  I received cash bonuses for selling JCPenny Credit Cards to new Customers and received 3 awards for this.  I worked with my co+worker daily to keep our ""Men's Department"" clean and presentable.  He gave me tips about selling on Commission.  My Supervisor was nice and set the rules.  I received 50% off of clothes and 75% off of discontinued clothes."
good,Overall great place to work. Only thing that grind my gears is that the managers practically give stuff away just to keep them happy and then blame the associates for the sales not being up to par.
good,"Fun place to work. "
good,Jcpenny is a goofs place to work at we’ll meet new peoplen work with your school schedule too (: . Always positive n good stuff so. I’ve to get discounts lol
good,I highly enjoy working with my coworkers. The store and salon need to be updated to be able to compete in today's markets however. I plan on working for JCPenny for many years to come.
good,"My typical day at work consists of filling orders, stocking merchandise, and general store cleanup. I learned how to use point of sale systems as well as order packaging, delivery, and returns.The management is nice but does not have time for slacking around."
good,"When i worked there in 2016, it was a blast. Working with all of the people in my department and some of the others was great. Even during the holidays (black friday, christmas, etc) when the speed picked up, there was no toxicity in the workplace. The only thing that workers had to do beside their regular duties(working registers, helping consumers, cleaning fitting room, etc) was to sell credit card applications, aka ICAPs. If i had to work there again, i would do it 100%."
good,"I liked it there at first, and it was amazing, but the only disadvantage was that after any holiday, they start to cut your hours, and it is  extreme."
good,"You are greeted by fellow employees and customers"
good,"Fun environment because doing hair was always something I enjoyed. It was my first passion and making people feel better because they looked better was always a great feeling. Knowing that when they come into the salon they were having a bad day and then when you are finished with them, the way they look makes their day so much better which makes you feel better about yourself as well."
good,"I like it, but too many seasonal positions and not enough regular part time. Inconsistent with the my schedule, but mostly scheduled during afternoon-night. However I loved being a cashier and for every credit account opened $2 added to paycheck."
good,"Anyone who works here I appreciate you. I worked during Black Friday and it was a mad house. Plus it was my first time not working with food so it seemed slow any other day."
good,"very busy helping customers, cashiering. workplace is fast pace, always on your feet. Very busy during the holidays.Working with the public,you gain patients to understand what customers need or wants"
good,"JCpenny was a great retail experience for me , and a good way of learning how to socialize with others.   It was great and the job was easy money.   Productive , in order and great management"
good,Cool and easy. Nothing too big nor too small. Coworkers are friendly and easy to approach. Customers are normally pretty cool people with the occasional upset customer popping up every now and then. Overall a cool place to work at for anybody looking for their first job.
good,jcp policy are great when manager does order of operation correctly. the company as a whole is great company to for but when your great in one your one department they don't want to advance you.
good,"the company was good for many years , but the last four years I felt that the company cared less for there employees and more about there pockets we didnt get the help to solve the work load that they were demanding from us and hours kept going down and the pay just does not to justice for the amount of work and stress level that is required"
good,"Well first every one in my area got alone with each other, we all work to gather fast past."
good,The thing I enjoyed most about JCPenney is the ability to work under very low supervision. I like working alone and doing things at a comfortable yet effective manner and pace.
good,Working at jc penney was a fun place to work. i was a loss prevention  detective and i enjoyed every bit of my job and the employees who worked there.
good,The workplace was it joy of will for the most part also very productive and there was always something to do. The staff was very friendly and love the discount!
good,"JCPenney gave me the opportunity to work with customers directly, help with problem solving.I enjoy working on my own with or without  good supervision.  I liked the people I worked with."
good,"A typical work day for me is putting clothes back and straightening tables. I will ring out, greet, and assisting customers. Then I will go in the back where the merchandise is and start pulling. The hours are great because they work around your school schedule. There are great people to work with, everybody is really friendly and willing to help you to be successful. It's a great place to start so you can work your work in the company. In the company, you learn to be patient with everybody and always try find a new way to bring the company up."
good,"Assisting customers with orders,refunds adjustments and corporation  complaints."
good,The working environment is fun. I have a strong relationship with most of my coworkers. It's a good experience working at JCPenney. I would recommend JCPenney to my family and friends.
good,Good place to start for a first job or returning to the work force.  Flexible schedule allows you to further education or take care of family duties.  The customer service skills you gain here will help you at any job.
good,Great place to work! I have been there 15 years. I started in production and worked my way up to supervisor. We have a servant leadership type of management.
good,The staff was awesome which made the company great. The company had lots of flaws however the training and policys are great. They give raises when earned.
good,JCPenney is and will always be a go to store for me and my family. The fact that I was able to spend the last 5 years working for such a great company benefits me more than they will ever know. I was able to grow in a field that has been my passion since 16 years old. Awesome mentor's and great culture.
good,"It was fair and good to work with the staff and employees there, having a good conversations & new friends. new faces "
good,"I enjoy working for this company because the customers keep me coming back. The work overload at times will be overwhelming and you sometimes feel that the hard work will only set you back because of the work load. Although I enjoy staying busy, I would like to see that the hard work pays off instead of putting you back in a position to repeat the task again."
good,"I had a fantastic job. It's too bad there will never be another position at JCPenney, like the one I was fortunate enough to have for almost a decade."
good,"At my time at JCPenney I did indeed learn more about fashion and clothing, as well as communication skills. I uspoke Spanish and English which helped a lot of customers"
good,"As long as you're applying yourself, the team is great! There's room for advancement. Our team got along pretty well and we enjoyed giving back to the community."
good,"JCPenney is a great first job. If you are looking for career advancement, its not ideal unless you are studying business management of some sort to become a store or district manager."
good,"Provide hair services to clients schedule for appointments. responsible for productivity rates, client data, production demos and retail sales. I learned the appropriate techniques to craft my passion for hairstyles, colors, and cuts."
good,Fast paced environment on the weekends and during peak times.  Slower days during the week.  management  flexible.  opportunity for promotions available
good,"The typical retail job, the worst part is the customers but they have competitive pay, good work-life balance, a decent employee discount, and generally nice managers."
good,they do generally try to be flexible with hours nice people management is generally easy to talk to if there is a problem and people are fun to work with. Also most of the customers are friendly.
good,"* a typical day would be folding clothes, returning merchandise to their designated areas, maintaining all areas of the store clean"
good,"Working for Jc Penney’s was great, the discounts are awesome and management is excellent. For me I got pretty burnt out of doing the same thing everyday but the managers work really hard to have fun incentives. It can be a little overwhelming to make sure you meet your credit card application goal, if you don’t you will be talked to many times until you get one but all in all this was a great place to be!"
good,Wasn’t all that bad to work there. If someone’s looking for a job I recommend starting here and it’s very easy to get along with the managers they care about everyone there.
good,"very family oriented, most managers are very easy to work with as long as your meeting goals , great discounts in all clothing and household items, some of my best friends I met them in JCPenney"
good,I enjoyed my time working for the company. We were like a little family in our department we were actually a team and had each others back. Not quite sure how it is now but from my experience I would recommend them to work there.
good,My review was great! Everything I was told in my interview was true . Everyone has high sportsmanship. Team work was a big deal to that company . I loved it
good,"Conditions improved after security was transitioned to in house JC Penney associates away from contract security service.  However, corporate made the decision to eliminate over half of the security force, including the investigators and my position."
good,JCPenney's is a great store to work at and had great management. The coworkers for the most part are all a great bunch and they are all easy to get along with. Most days are spent balancing ringing up customers and keeping up with organizing and tidying clothing. The only downside is that the starter pay is lower than I expected and is barely enough to get by.
good,"JCPenney was a great place to work. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, the assignments were easy to understand/complete, and management was helpful"
good,Always kept you busy and had to stay focused. Had to have good personable skills since you worked with people and talked with clients every day. It was competitive in selling products.
good,"the hardest part of the job is when no one would come in to shop, it gets boring and you are searching for work or hoping some one assigns you work to do."
good,"Jcp is a great place to work as long as you are willing to lean. its pretty fast pace, most of the people there are nice to work with, and the Work/Life balance is good. most areas work a 4 - 10hr shifts. Monday Tuesdays Thursday Friday , Sunday to Wednesday, or Wednesday to Saturday."
good,"The managers and staff there were very nice and sometimes it was a lot of fun. Being in sales made it a little stressful, but overall the work was fun."

good,I loved working at Penney’s. The work environment was great. There was plenty to do and plenty of support to help get the job done. Pay could have been better and time off could have been more.
good,I enjoyed my time there and I really wish I didn't have to leave. I was the best job I had come across this far and I hope my jobs in the future will be just as great.
good,The overall day at work at JcPenney would be exciting .Everyday you would learn something new that you didn't know the day before things always changing within the company
good,I loved working for JCPenney because of how much work there was to do each morning. I loved getting a lot of work done really early in the morning. I had fun because you worked with your team but you also were able to work independently. I learned things not the average person learns at a job because the job I chose was doing the work that customers do not see.
good,Positions in JCPenney Information Technology departments offer a high level of responsibility with many opportunities for collaborative effort with colleagues. Leadership expectations are usually clear and a high degree of independence is extended. Training opportunities for new skills are plentiful. The workforce is diverse and generally friendly.
good,"It was always a good time working there. Costumers were friendly, co-workers were nice as well. Only reason I left was because it was seasonal, otherwise I probably would've stay there longer."
good,The job was good and hourd could have been better but over all no big complaints. The insurance package wasn't imcluded in my job. There is really not much more too say.
good,"It was a great work environment. I learned several skills as well as had plenty of help when needed to learn things correctly.I loved the staff and working there, but there wasn't enough hours to be able to make it through the week."
good,"I think a great place to work and nice people to work with.  Good programs and listening to associates.  Need to create a better pay scale for tenured associates and management.  Little slow to act on trends, but getting better.  Benefits are good, but could be improved upon for cost to associates, too much industry cut cost and pass on to employees.  Ok for individuals, but not families, to get by on."
good,JCPenney's is a place of growth excitement ongoing teaching ability to learn as well as teach others JCPenney's is a company that values family as well as it values relationships that you are able to build and grow from JCPenney's has an ongoing training program which is excellent when the career field is constantly changing
good,"I loved working here because I learned a lot from my co workers, and we worked as a team. I highly recommend this job to anyone who is willing to work part time."
good,"I love ed my experience at JCPenney's. It was one of the best jobs I held in my youth. The management was very understanding, and fair. Even through all the changes over the years, they rolled with the punches. They taught me a lot about time management, CRM, and accountability."
good,"Typical day consisted of retouching images and catalog management. "
good,"A day at JCPenney would be taking care of customers and cleaning or maybe helping rearrange some areas of the store. Most days are slow to moderate during the week, and  most of the time you are rushed on the weekends and holidays."
good,"JCP is a great place to work. Typical day is opening the till, carefully entering information into the computer and the till, and balancing at the end of the day.  The culture is friendly and helpful. I enjoy meeting customers overall, but sometimes you get someone who is angry or difficult to understand."
good,"I love JCPenney it’s my second family. I would love continue with them but my interest changed and I become more involved with cosmetic industry. "
good,"J.C. Penney is a great company with a very positive culture.  I interfaced with many departments supporting IT, Finance, HR, Legal, and Marketing from a Procurement perspective.  I enjoyed working through requirements and writing contracts with my business owners and supplier partners.  It is a great place to be."
good,I have enjoyed my time at JC Penney's so far. During the week the shifts are tough because we are not as busy.Reorganizing everything once we close is the toughest part of the job and can be frustrating. I like me co-workers and supervisors. I wish I could have longer breaks and got more morning shifts on the weekends. Overall a great company to work for.
good,It was not bad working at JcPenney it was good hours and great when it came the benifect that they gave you if you was a full-time. They had good breaks for people and the time for lunch it was good too
good,"The options are open to switch departments, cross train, learn it all if you want. UNLESS they are worried about losing you in a certain area. Then you hear every excuse in the world about why they won't let you try something new."
good,"This is a great start for those who are coming straight out of high school or collage student. If you are an expertise in retail sales or someone who just loves customer service, this is the place for you. Great place of amazing people."
good,I learned majority of the people don't look at if you'recapable of going higher in the business because thy too busy looking after themselves. they want you to be available at all times.
good,"I spend almost 20 years in the store and served many roles. However, once my daughter was of a certain age I accepted a position at a local hospital for a much higher hourly rate. I was topped out at my salary range, with no  hope of an increase unless the minimum wage was increased."
good,"Had a great experience with JCPenney.  Would have stayed there permanently. But the store in Laramie, closed in 2001. They made it a fun work environment in the store. We always had carry in lunches for holidays. Associates would sign up for what they wanted to bring."
good,I had fun working here. The other employees were fun to be around and always helped lighten the load on busy days. I wish they didn't ave to close but..
good,"A typical day working here is you clocking in & going to whatever area you were assigned to upon being hired (or if they ask you to be somewhere else). Generally you are on a register checking people out, or on the floor putting clothes back where they belong & cleaning up. I have learned how to deal with people from all walks of life, not only from the customers but also from my co-workers, although I really only see the ones who work in my area. Management is pretty good, they are pretty nice and not too too strict, but you definitely need to make sure that you adhere to the policies set forth by them, or you could get written up (which is not something you want). The workplace culture is alright, but like I said, people really only converse with others if they come into your area, or you are working together. I think the hardest part of the job is having to handle the unforeseeable circumstances, or the customers who are sometimes not so nice. But, that is something everyone deals with eventually, so that should show how simple the job really is. The most enjoyable part of the job is that they have healthy competitions, and it is a fun/easy-going environment."
good,A typical day at work is busy. I learn a lot from the managers. The management were helpful. The workplace culture was very clean. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees and all the customers .
good,I have enjoyed the time I was able to work for the company. I had a lot of opportunity to grow with the company. Being able to recognize the associates for a job well done was great. It let them know they were appreciated.
good,The manager were great along with the employees. The job itself is simple to do as well as the time frame in which one is allotted. Great environment in General
good,I have been employed at JCPenney for 10 years and have learned a lot.  I like working with people and my co-workers are great.  There are a lot of responsibilities and a fast pace job.  Great customer service is a must.
good,"Spent 13 plus years there. No regrets. Smaller stores take a lot longer to move up in. But always have the option of transfering. Learn a lot as far as customer service. Our stores turnover was amazing, I think that was because everyone had fun."
good,"I loved working at JCPenney; I hated leaving that job.  The store that I worked at was more like family than anything else.  I learned a lot from my management team and I am extremely thankful for that.  JCPenney offered insurance, discounts, and a fun work experience."
good,I would start my day by getting my assignments. I would move from one team to another. I would set up the stores advertising displays. I would price items in the store. I would even help customers with their personal shopping. I enjoyed working with people and being busy. I was awarded employee of the month my third month on the job. I enjoy helping people.
good,"Within every company small fixes could always be used, but overall it's a good company to work for. The atmosphere is great my store manager is fantastic and the girls I work with are great too!"
good,They are very good to their employees. The only problem is not enough money or hours. I would have stayed and cried when I left I just needed more money. If they paid more no-one would leave
good,"This job was a good retail experience, helping customers & seeing how you affected you're job in a positive way by helping customers find a holiday gift & learning how to keep up with a store."
good,A typical day at work Included reorganizing different clothing departments and helping the customer find what they are looking for ensuring the best customer service for them. Management was well organized and very professional. overall great team work and employees.
good,"At JC Penney, i gained many skills. I can handle a register and learned how to organize the display floor and the stockroom. I also met some great people that made my job enjoyable."
good,"I was very happy with my time here, I had an excellent manager who put her employee's needs before the company. She truly cared about our well being. The store manager took time out of his day to have a conversation with you, he would also help you with your everyday tasks."
good,"the best part of this job is making someones vision come to light especially with newborn pictures. as a photographer you get to capture the precious moments that will literally be cherished a lifetime! family photos of families that have never had a family photo framed for their mother. so many beautiful memories working for lifetouch in jc penney. the hardest part of the job is the compensation, while its a great part time job for students it is not enough to pay the bills."
good,"I use to work there only for seasonal"
good,"JCP provided a great platform for me to start developing communication and customer service experience. They were pretty flexible with my hours as a student, and shifts were never too long."
good,"There was a lot with cleaning and folding clothes, very monotonous job. but at the same time i liked it very nice people. hardest part was keeping up with the mess throughout he store. but fun as we got it done."
good,"A typical day at work is refreshing when you are passionate about what you are doing.  There are many lessons learned, but the art of customer service has been the most rewarding.  Management is diverse and the turn-over rate is generally after a few years of service.  The culture is seasonally fast-paced, and always considerate of the customer experience.  The most challenging of this position is when resources are not available to ensure customer satisfaction.  However, the most enjoyable is when they are."
good,Great place to work for. They offer benefits immediately and the pay is decent. The people and management are great and the hours are not bad. I enjoy the customers there as well.
good,"Days right now feel long, we are working long hours which is good overtime and good money, i feel i have learned a lot about the different departments in the warehouse, and they like to cross train and make sure everyone gets to move around which is nice. Management is very welcoming and always makes sure that we are proforming to the best of our ability's, if there is something wrong whether it be workplace or personal, its very easy to find someone to talk to and help out when possible. The hardest part of the job right now is the the over time we are doing, but in the long run the money is good. But i like the people, everyone is nice and energetic which helps to get through the week."
good,"it was like a big family, the company works with your hours very helpful with opportunities for growth, i got to work a few different things in one place which kept it fun and interesting."
good,"At the Portrait Studio, a typical day includes scheduling appointments, taking in appointments, photographing families and children of all ages, and selling the photos.  All coworkers are very nice and helpful even if they don't work in your department. hardest part of the job is you usually work alone, and sometimes it gets very busy in the studio so time management and great customer service skills are very important.  Best part of the job is being able to personalize each session for each customer and capturing special and unique moments for all of them"
good,Working at the fine jewelry department was not very hard. You would have to assist customers one on one and for a long periods of time sometimes. Must be able to offer credit cards to customers and help meet stores goal for the day.
good,Responsible for the unloading of merchandise and getting it set up in the store. Also was assigned the responsiblity of maintaining all mens shirts in the mens department.
good,"Doing photography is always unpredictable fun."
good,Its a well organized place to work. Steady pace no problems and the environment is great. Easy to understand the procedures and isn't difficult at all.
good,"Jcpenny had a very professional way of achieving goals, they had strict rules and a good look on the company, although i enjoyed my time there, managed to meet new people, they tend to treat some people poorly."
good,Great starting place for a person in retail. Over the course of three years I learned a lot about retail as a whole and was able to transfer those skills to a number of departments.
good,Super helpful and great management. Flexible with timing and helping each other. Guest services are outstanding along with the team work. Easy to get the job done with a lot of leaders help.
good,The JCPenney that I work at is a great environment. I love the people that I work with and the managers care about the employees. I love having an employee discount.
good,"Love working in this environment, and impacting peoples lives. Enjoyed meeting new people and working with people my age. Disliked the hours given expected more."
good,"great workers,managers are okay, like how you get money for opening a jcp credit card, and like the parties they give its a great way for us workers to get to know each others."
good,my coworkers were amazing people however the managers were very inconsiderate of the personal things that people may have been dealing with
good,Short shifts but very nice customers. I learned to take each day as it comes. Customers are more sensitive around holiday times. Management can be forgetful at times but just keep reminding them and they will have your best interest at hand.
good,Store manager was like no other!!! She was very help and enthusiastic! Really knows how to boost your spirits while pushing you to your fullest potential! But some of the dept. leads weren't as bright and it showed in their departments. This also caused for a lot of lack luster performances  from some employees which made it harder for the ones who actually cared! Wish I could still be apart of the company!!
good,"Me and my co-workers would open and unload the truck We would put the merchandise out then once the store open, we would help out on the cash registers and do catalog pick-ups when necessary."
good,"This was the first retail job I had and my experience was actually good. "
good,"Some days were busy, some days went slow but had a great staff to work with. Very understanding and co-operative manager. Enjoyed working there and learnt a lot. Loved the new experience I got working in a professional studio. Great Work experience !"
good,"working at jcpenney is really fun. its cool its its your first job and its in the mall. you get paid a nice amount and all the coworkers are friendly. the hardest part of the job is put backs, that when you but pack the clothing the customers didn't want. i learned that welcomeing customers help there shopping experience more enjoyable."
good,"I enjoy helping others, Customers and my fellow associates. I'm a very hard worker like a busy bee. Any field in retail I'm qualified to do. I've been out of work for over 8 months and I'm just ready to get started."
good,"2016"
good,I didn't work there very long but it was a fun environment with like-minded people. Many chances to sharpen your communication and service skills. Hours were flexible.
good,"I love my current position at JCPenney. I have a flexible schedule, an awesome supervisor and great coworkers that help get the job done! My position is a very productive one, from helping associates and customers to protecting the company's assets."
good,"Wasn't there long but the people I dealt with were good people trying to do the best they could. The hours can be long, the pay isn't what it should be for all the work one has to do in one shift but I enjoyed the time I was there."
good,"Great company to work for, easy to grow within easy going training, great stepping stone to gain customer service experience from. Most co-workers are very helpful and beneficial."
good,"Although I was only seasonal, the co-workers were great as was the management team. Knowing it was a seasonal job made it a little sad, but I believe JC Pennys treats their employees right."
good,i loved working here such nice people easy going environment and had no issues with management very straight forward with hrs and had little or no problems
good,"A typical day at work at J.C. Penney would involve working with customers. I would greet each customer as they entered the store and would always offer my assistance. One of the best experiences in this position would be helping that particular customer find what they needed. My goal would always be to see that the customer was happy and satisfied."
good,This job wants to see you succeed. They work very well with your schedule.  You also get very good employee discounts with them. A fun and fast paced job
good,I've worked for JCPenney for over a year and in the Jewlery department for 10 months in that year. Pay is good. Commission is okay. My manager sucks though. They made the place look like the best place to work when I first got there. Not long after there were people talking behind my back. Coworkers making rumors. It's gotten really old really quick. Hence why I'm looking for a new job now...
good,"A typical Day at work would be counting and replenishing the change in the cash registers, greeting and taking car of customers, signing customers up for credit cards, recovering the front section of clothes so the store looks presentable, and small talking with co-workers. Every one I work with is very friendly and helpful. There is no such thing as a hostile or uncomfortable environment there. The managers encourage you to get as many people to sign up for credit cards and reward you when you do. We always have event days where we bring food and celebrate on our lunch or break. Christmas and thanksgiving are flexible for you if you need to be with family or leave early. The only negative aspect of this job is the pay and the hours. Jcpenny hires a lot of high school students so most of the time, our hours get cut shorter. Shorter hours mean less money, which is even worse because we already only get paid minimum wage. That's the only bad thing about working at Jcpenny, but if money isn't a issue, you'll love  it there!"
good,Everyone there treats you like family and it is a great environment to work at. You get an associate discount which is great. And you really make connections with the customers that come in. A typical day is making sure that the floor looks clean organized. You learn a lot through your work experience there. The co workers are great too and you pretty much get along with everyone that works there.
good,"I loved the company and decided to pursue other opportunities.  Otherwise, a great company to work for. I loved the management and all the employees.  We all worked well together and got along well."
good,JCPenney is changing every day. I see a positive outlook for this company. The new management executives are actively working to improve the company as a whole.
good,They are always understanding and they put their employees first. They understand we have lives and we are people too. I have enjoyed working here.
good,"A typical day for me would start in the evening. If however you happened to work in the morning any given day its semi-busy, in the afternoon to night it can get chaotic & that's not based on holidays. Most of your coworkers are young people meaning they're still in high school or in college, a few adults for management but other than that its almost runed by young adults. You don't learn much, mostly how the store functions and how each manger for the day or night like things done in a manner."
good,I was able to work in an environment where I was able to learn and grow my skills as a hairstylist. I dealt with people constantly and had to learn how to listen to them and build my cutting and coloring skills.
good,"As a part time employee I have had the privilege to work in several areas of the store, each one comes with its own responsibilities and standards. When being asked to work in a new area, managers and team leaders are specific about expectations and procedures. If questions arise they are answered in a timely manor."
good,"If you're the kind of employee that can work in a fast paced environment, multitask, problem solve and keep a fun energetic attitude while going through your day you'll fit right in. This salon has some of the best people you will ever work with from the stylists to management. The pay is average but you'll be treated like family!"
good,"A typical workplace is smooth and easily to understand, the people you work with make working there enjoyable. The are also supervisors who are always there to help."
good,"Great for first job! Great opportunity to learn or grow in customer service and cash handling skills. Management is willing to work with your schedule, within reason, of course."
good,I enjoy going to work everyday. It is a stress free work space. I learned that not every customer is the same or wants the same thing. The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve some customer's needs in a one call resolution because sometimes it requires additional work from another department.
good,"Being there I learned how to be a part of an integrated and diverse community as well as a lot of business, clerical, and management skills. Overall, my experience there was great because in those almost three years I learned about so many different skills and lessons that will carryover to almost any job category as a profound foundation to continue building on."
good,"A typical day at work- Selling shoes!"
good,Your coworkers will help you when you need help. It is an easy going place that you'll enjoy working in. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers but there isn't many. I learned how to get out of my comfort zone.
good,JcPenney is a great place to work s my first retail job. They are very good with working with your schedule and helping you to move up in the company.
good,My coworkers were very friendly and helpful. I learned I could manage and maintain my two departments without help and enjoyed that responsibility.
good,I enjoyed selling window coverings along with shoes.  My co-workers were so much fun to work with.  This was a great part time job as the hours were very flexible while I had a full time job and when I was going to school.  My supervisor was great to work with.
good,"Nice atmosphere, hard working people, nice area. i really enjoyed it here. Retail just is not for me. I didn't like being on my feet all day."
good,A normal day consisted in attending our clients needs and trying to help them find whatever it is that they are looking for.
good,"I have worked many retail job and never have I worked for with such a caring retail team and management."
good,"* fast-paced environment "
good,"JCpenney is a nice place to work. The coworkers are friendly and it's a great entry level position for those looking to pursue a career in customer service/sales. "
good,"A few of my co workers were lazy, so I had to do a lot more when I was scheduled to work the same shift as them. I got along well with my department manager, and she called on me when ever she needed a task done."
good,This Job is amazing everyone treats each other like family its amazing i love this job but at times its hard to maintain with hours
good,"just like any other retail job with better people, good managers and its a clean store. I mainly clock in then jump right in to work. Some of my co-workers arent as pleasant as i would like them to be but, thats anywhere you go."
good,"The atmosphere is great, the employes are great and the breaks are fine, biggest problem would be standing on your feet all day ( person problem )... you find many of your friends in jcpennys"
good,I loved JCP and I continue to work part time in the winter months as it is a good place to gain extra cash. The management is great and they actually care for their employees.
good,"I love working at the J.C. Penny. Working at Pennies was my first working experience in the United States. The people were very friendly and we had each other backs. Management in that location was the best ever. Oh, This is the Pennies at Donnell Drive, Forestville MD."
good,Its a great job with fun people and nice surrounding but you cant really depend on hours or paychecks so its best for anyone who is currently studding and doesn't have any payments
good,"Great place to work and gain experience in the retail industry. I took this job to get experience in cashiering , and cash handling."
good,"The managers are fun to work with. A typical day is pulling things off the racks, and talking about how cute they are with the managers. Cleaning out fitting rooms is a big objective we try and stay up on. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything rings up right and signing people up for the store credit card."
good,"A typical day consisted of me recycling plastic bags of plastic into, and out of a baler as needed, and emptying the cardboard baler when the alarm told me that it was full. I also had to clear the overhead conveyor belt that took cardboard boxes to the baler. I had to pay attention to those tasks while inserting censor tags into clothing, and input those bundles of clothing into a computer by scanning the bar codes."
good,"A company that valued people and building great work relationships.  With so many jobs at this company I have learned so many things: Business Strategist, Developing Relationships, Collaboration, Leadership, Time Management, Creativity, Due Dates, Merchandising. The hardest part of the job was beginning so many new jobs throughout my career and the best part of the job was discovering new opportunties and developing skills in those new jobs."
good,"A decent workplace with excellent benefits. Learning material is available to perfect your role, and management will guide you from time to time."
good,JC Penney is a culture friendly place to work. They accept youfor whom you are and never judge there employees. a true EOE. JC Penney in the last year went back to dicounts and door busters which saved the company.
good,"My employement at JCPenney, like other jobs of its kind, focused on serving the customer. My regular work day would include organizing merchandise around the store, helping people find what they are looking for, and ringing them up on the register."
good,"just started off by either restocking or folding clothes"
good,"In my experience at Jcpenney I had the great opportunity to be apart of a revamping of store management. In this time I was the lead go to security personnel and was able to partner with store staff and create unique and refreshing programs to assist in determent of theft and a positive involved environment for store staff. Everyday was unique and filled with new adventures. I learned how to operate a store in a mall setting. The hardest part of the experience was getting everyone involved and make things fun but that also was the most enjoyable because it was a pleasure to see people happy again feel appreciated, recognized and respected for what they do to contribute to the team."
good,Constant interaction with customers which can be a challenge due to the high volume of traffic. Maintain fitting rooms and floor merchandise are presentable. Assist management with training of new employees as well as handle different customer issues. The best thing is seeing the customers face so happy when they leave satisfied with the price.  Can't beat that. Everyone loves a bargin.
good,Assisted customer having good time at work. enjoy working with co-workers. enjoyed brakes when we were giving treats and lunch they treatd us good.
good,The job has its pros and cons but it was very fun. You would have to be on your feet constantly and being able to manage customers as a sales associate. The store is fairly busy during holidays.
good,Loved the job!  Pressure on getting I-Caps everyday.  JCPenny is a great company to work for.  Management always tried to keep everyones spirits up.  They appreciated the hard work that we did on the floor.
good,"I would do all tasks of a Styling Salon without doing hair, nails, pedicures, waxing, etc. I was behind the scenes with inventory stocking shelves, etc."
good,JCP had a very fun work environment.   The management was understanding and concerned for me as an employee.    They gave you want was expected of you and what needed to do to succeed with JCP.
good,"Although I no longer work here I really enjoyed working at this location, very good hours for the holidays,and  Friendly environment."
good,"Fun, love the people I work with, great place, demanding, busy exciting job and I love it. The people are friendly and I have the utmost respect for my coworkers"
good,My typical day at work is filled with lots of new ideas. I enjoy interacting with associates and customers. I am always learning new things. The hardest part of the job can be dealing with an unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a project to its end and watching positive sales results come out of it.
good,I left because I felt looked down upon because of my race but great pay. I really appreciated my coworkers and the environment.
good,The greatest part of the job is helping and interacting with the customers and associates. The hardest part of the job is  I can't be in more than one place at a time.
good,"great place to work here, but only if your looking for part time. Typical day is going in and out the fitting room, helping with three and outs at the front. Helping customers on finding what they need. Management is very,very friendly :) It's really not a hard being a sales associate, and best part is your not working outside in the hot sun."
good,"Must make your goals daily and be consistent on the daily basis, and make sure you keep your team motivated at all times. You really learn a lot from the other supervisors"
good,JC Penney was an amazing place to work. Meeting and greeting new people was always a plus. I learned a lot of new skills and sales techniques in a short amount of time (seasonal position). The management was easy to work with and the co-workers worked as a team to get things done. If I could still work there I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"I enjoyed my almost 3 1/2 years of working at JcPenney. There are lots of good, friendly people that work along side you to help make that company what it is. Management treats their employees well, no one ever really had a problem with another. The one and only downside I can really think of was JcPenney losing a lot of money in stock, making it rare to see anyone advancing in positions or even receiving a yearly raise, causing problems for everyone and eventually leading to a good number of people leaving the company."
good,"On a average day at J.C Penny's it consisted on staying active with ongoing work.Although to me it was never too much i enjoyed being at work. I got a chance to learn something new as far as being a Support Specialist. It also helped me enhance my ability to work in a fast pasted manner. I learned the ropes around J C Penny's fast with the help of my Supervisor. She was very caring and easy to work with. With her help she made it easy to complete and almost perfect my duties as an support specialist, along with a lot of my co-workers. My co-workers helped me get along through the day and always kept good vibes. The only hard part of my job was leaving it to go back to my home town to help take care of my grandmother. I always enjoyed my job. I never had a reason to dislike it or not want to be there."
good,Working in retail sales and how to sell big ticket items. The hardest part of the job was the hours you work. The most enjoyable was how many people you help everyday.
good,"My typical day at work is i come in see if anything needs to fill up on the racks or tables. If someone needs to be sized for bras i help and assist them to find one that fits the best. I greet customers, ring on the register, clean up the floor put away items. I learned a lot but also I learned something new everyday. Good management. Great co-workers . I would just say the hardest part of the job is if its get's busy trying to clean up the mess. The most enjoyable part of the job is it was always fun not so stressful so much you can actually like your job."

good,Great culture and diverse employees. Numerous opportunities and of course the employee discount doesn't hurt!
good,"A typical day  would include reporting to the store leader and visual manager for tasks and/follow up with current projects and checking emails.

I update and replenish certain merchandise, perform tests on merchandise, insure designs are consistent with the company direction while providing excellent customer service.  The creativity and the customer experience is what I enjoy most about working with JCPenney.  I also have the opportunity to work with great co-workers who are extremely helpful, fun to work with and provide guidance when needed."

good,"I liked this job very much. They do work you to death lol, but it's a great work environment. The workers and management were nice and understandable."
good,"If you want to make good money and do not mind hard work and alot of hours, it is great job."
good,I worked at JCPenney throughout my college years and I loved it. They worked with me and was a great place where you could move up if you work hard.
good,JC Penney was a very pleasant working environment.  The company has gone through a major restructuring and hopefully is back on track to be more profitable.
good,Fun place to work everyone works as a team.  Great associate discount.
good,I been working at JCPenney for 6 years i have learned something new everyday i go to work. i always have enjoyed working there because everyone there is very friendly and respectfully.
good,"we had a lot of Party's and a huge lunchroom."
good,"- Typical day consisted of handling customer care and concerns"
good,"Replenishes products"
good,"My daily job consisted of me sorting, boxing and packaging customer orders made or purchased online or in the stores. I learned to work at an extremely fast pace and with a large group of teammates. I love meeting new people so I've met plenty of great associates being in the close knit quarters of my department. The job to me was fairly easy, I packed at the high level we had in our department. The best part of my job was the great pay and the group of people I worked with."
good,Everyone was friendly and ready to help. Fast paced learning environment.
good,"It is a great place to gain experience. Everyone is pretty helpful, and nice. The managers were understanding. Long as you do your job there's not any hard parts."

good,"A typical day at work, included but wasn't limited to managing a cash register, and helping customers fine products on the floor. And picking up catalog deliveries and ordering them for incoming guest."
good,"As a sales associate your number one job is to give perfect customer service; the customer is always first!  When you are not with a customer, your job is to maintain fitting rooms, straighten tables and racks, any additional tasks given by a supervisor or manager.  I have learned that working with people can be very frustrating at times but it is 100% worth it in the end.  My co-workers and i all help and assist each other during our shifts together.  My favorite aspect of my job is always meeting someone new or conversing with returning customers."
good,Wonderful atmosphere to work in accept for lack of communication between the managers. I loved working with all of the people that were my co-workers that I am still friends with some of them. The hardest part of the job was having customers with attitude problems cause they had a bad day.
good,managers are very outgoing and are not at all superior. they take the time to sit and listen when your having issues in your department and they do what they can to help you out sometimes takes long though.
good,I am a people person. I love chatting and getting to know customers while helping them with their purchase.
good,"Good place to work, friendly environment and management. Fairly flexible hours, simple once you learn the computer system. Mostly fun and friendly employees to work with, both young and old (mostly females). Hardest part of the job is learning the ins and outs of the computer system, and making commission sales. Also takes a while to learn where everything is within the store (which is what most customer questions are about). Also get a nice 25% discount and exposure to good coupons."
good,I enjoy working at JCP and one great plus is the employee's discount.
good,"A typical day would include being out on the sales floor to answer questions for customers, directing them if they needed a specific item, and making sure the fitting rooms stayed clutter free. There would be days where certain people would be assigned to be in the register quad (if there was high volume through the store) and finalizing transactions. This job has taught me excellent customer service skills and how to deal with certain situations in a professional matter. The management was excellent! They were all very organized and clear with what they wanted us to do everyday, while making the work day fun! I would say the hardest part of this job was working on those really busy days. At times it's hard to give it your all, and at first when I started it was difficult. Although for the amount of time I worked there I was able to overcome and look past how hectic retail can be and show through with what I was taught to make me a better sales associate. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be two things; being able to really help customers out and connecting with them. The second would be meeting the new people you work with and being able to have fun at your job. Everybody was very welcoming."
good,"I enjoyed the type of work I did at Jcpenneys from working in Womans department to getting promoted to pricing and signing.A typical day at work was a good day for me. I did my work did what I had to do and helped my customers. The management was pretty ok. Co workers we all enjoyed each other,provided great customer service,did our well,and worked together as a team. It was never a hard point on the job."
good,A typical day at JC Penney's consisted of giving the best customer service to our customers.
good,"I would straighten the department up throughout my shift.  Help any customer with whatever they needed.  My co-workers were friendly, hard workers.  Overall the management was great.  The hardest part of the job was when there were returns and the drapes smelled strongly of curry.  I loved helping people out, whether they were co-workers or customers."
good,"JCPenny Furniture Outlet was an ok job mot of the time. I would get to work at 7:50 and begin work at 8 with my other co-workers. I really didn't learn anything at JCPenny but the hardest pa of the job was the repeat bending and lifting. Continuous bending and lifting caused a lot of lower back pain. Overall it was a nice job. What I liked the most about this job was the hours I worked, Iworke in the morning from 8am to 2pm which gave me the chance to spend more time with my kids."
good,"I love working for this company because I am also kept on my toes. Whether it is ringing up customers, to bringing out merchandise to even setting the floor each month. I absolutely love it. It can be tiring and not fun at times but I make the best of it."
good,"cashier, floor, changing room, organizing, cleaning, item numbers"
good,"They were very nice in working around my other job's schedule."
good,"I love everyone I work with, I don't have a single problem with anyone. They are all very kind and nice people all willing to help with anything you ask. The pay isn't so good though, could be better for the amount of work they expect you to do."
good,"Easy work, decent pay. Not too many complaints, I liked management and co-workers"
good,A typical day at work would have an associate deal with customers and checking them out at the register. I felt that the management was too inconsistent. Most of the co- workers were friendly and knowledgeable. I found that the hardest part and one of the most enjoyable parts of the job were the late hours that were required after normal store hours. The recovery work was difficult however co- workers fine ways to have fun while doing their task.
good,Never a dull moment.  Fast pace and always something to make your day go very fast.  Exceptional associates to work with.  Everyone is always willing to help.
good,this was a good job to learn from it teach you a lot of thing about life.
good,"Good work environment, understandable management and family oriented"
good,"The days in the hospital consist of things you not use to on the daily basis, anything can happen at any giving time. So working in  the field emergency room is a bit more different, you have to be aware of a lot cause a lot goes on. When i started working yes it was hard its fast pace , you have patients screaming at you, patients being impatient, mind you , you trying to do everything in a good time to move on to the next task that you was doing or that you have to do.But a good thing i can say when you working and things is going on the day goes by faster , but working in the ER it always goes fast cause its always something. "

good,"A typical workday is pretty laid back but when its busy it gets hectic.  "
good,I enjoyed worked daily on projects with my team members. I learned a great deal with visual design.
good,"At work one usually folds clothes and organizes the rack of clothes and puts them away. If a customer is ready to cash out, one helps them right away and always has their eye on the register for this reason. If the customer needs any assistance with paying their credit card bill, wanting a new credit card, returning an item, ordering an item not in the store, or simply purchasing something they have right there, one would help right away. If one co-worker is busy they usually call for help and the other co-workers never hesitate to help. The environment is very friendly, if a customer gives any of us a hard time there is always a way to get them smiling again. Managers are usually near-by for help and always train us well. I have learned to have more patience, to work a register and transition to new systems quickly such as, learning to cash customers out with an ipad/ipod instead of a register. Also, I am able to communicate more effectively and sell credit even faster than most. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of doing go back, cleaning up the store, assisting customers, checking the fitting rooms, and closing registers."
good,"As a customer service associate I deal directly with customers and offer many suggestions and recommendations for products and services. The fun and rewarding part of the job is being able to govern your own responsibilities to go above and beyond for customer service and always making sure customers are satisfied with their visit to JCPenney. Processing sales, product recommendations, credit card solicitation are some of the duties that i performed."
good,Productive and fun place to work my coworkers are all friendly and helpful to not only to our customer but to each other. We all work together to get the job done and make sure our customers are enjoying there time there and want to return back. I started working a JCPeenys to help pay for college and they worked with my hour at school and still gave me hours i need to pay for my bills.
good,"The salon at J.C. Penney's was a very enjoyable place to work and meet new people. I learned many skills important to office and receptionist work, including answering phones, assisting clients, scheduling appointments, and putting data into various computer systems. I also learned valuable people skills that will help me in any position. My coworkers at J.C. Penney were fun to work with, yet they also helped me to learn and grow in the receptionist position. The manager of the salon is an excellent leader and amazing task manager. She handles business efficiently and promptly and is capable of working effectively with the many people that work in and visit the salon. The most enjoyable part of working at the salon was working with the customers and stylists. Every day provided new opportunities to learn new skills and greet new and returning customers."
good,Retagging and organization involved. Not too much of a hard job it was pretty cool working with the groups of people I worked with it was a great experience.

good,meeting and greeting customers helping them find merchandise that meets their needs

A typical day at work included answering phones, booking and cancelling appointments, changing client services, and selling hair products. Anytime you work with the public there will always be challenging moments and this job helped me to learn how to handle conflicts and please the customer. The hardest part of the job would be handling a client that is displeased with their service. Clients are not displeased often but it happens. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the clients on a personal level and feeling like you are part of the salon family."
good,The start of the day was to edit timesheets and the prepare the days money for the registers. Count and enter all money from the previous days business into the cashroom system. Enjoyed working with all my co-workers.

I also help fellow associates with daily tasks, such as, organizing and displaying the merchandise, making sure the correct price points are displayed."
good,"At JCPenney, I always was pleased with my employee's. I never went a day without any teamwork, I got to be part of something, I was able to help people effectively. There really wasn't a hard part about my job, due to the fact I catch on easily. I really enjoyed helping people. It sounds cliche but I really got to be hands on with the customers and making them happy. I even received a pay raise and a pin for my effective customer service skills."

It is definitely a good place to work and for me it was great to start off with .

good,JCPenney is a good first job for someone in highschool or maybe college.
good,I look forward to seeing my customers everyday and a very pleasant place to meet and greet new people. I've learned to to handle a problem when the supervisor is not there. The hardest part of my job is not being busy. I enjoy my customers and look forward to seeing them everyday and talking to the elder customer has taught me alot.
good,"A typical day at work is working with customers who have any question with our merchandise, who is ready with a transaction, payment, or ready to order from out cataloge online. Im the type of person who learns something everyday rather its little or big. The management at JCP is very helpful they are there to help with any questions that we may have. My co-workers are very awesome people. They're nice, goofy, and very out-going. they make my day. The hardest part at my job i may say is,.... wel there is not really anything hard about it. I mean when i first started i had some moments but i got use to everything, i know how to approach situations now. The mosy thing i enjoy about my job is helping a customer with there problems and seeing them leave with a smile on there face."

A typical day would be anything from servicing customers, to cleaning fitting rooms, to working the register, to anything else. This job taught me a lot. I learned time management, multi- tasking, and the importance of customer satisfaction working here. I had to be in several different places at once. The management was great. They were always there and alert. My co-workers were great. We had to work in teams, The management would put us in teams in certain departments, but it was the teams job to give out the duties of the team members, and make sure the tasks were complete. The most enjoyable part of the job was the faces of the satisfied customers, and knowing that you helped put that smile on their face."

Management, I never got to interact with other managers but the managers I did get to work with were very enjoyable and easy to work with. Co-workers were friendly.

good,A typical day at work is styling hair. I love what I do. A great place to work.
good,"JCPenney as an overall working environment is a job I would recommend. Associates play around, work hard especially as a team, and get what needs to be done, done. Customers are the average typical customer. For instance, they ask questions that may possibly get an associate aggravated on the other hand there are customers that make an associates day. A typical day at work is rather simple; consistent folding, greeting customers, finalizing a customers purchase, etc. However, since there is new management especially the fact that the new management has come from other department stores, our management team does not seem to realize the importance of everything an associate and supervisor does. They do not come across nice and do not really understand the tone of voice they give to other associates. Furthermore do not seem to comprehend that an associates opinion matter. In conclusion the work level is average, management does expect highly but what management team does not ?"
good,"Typical day is clocking in, finding your station and helping customers."

Co-workers very supportive. Hardest part of job was getting differenent departments to work together. Most enjoyable part was the associates."
good,"Your schedule is flexible and ideal for someone who is seeking a side job while working a full time job or going to school. The management and co-workers are friendly and helpful.

good,"A typical day at work starts with me checking my email. My manager usually has 2-3 left for me giving me a run-down on things that are going on or coming up and a list of things to do that day. My schedule requires me to get to work 3 hours before store hours so most times I'm finished with all my task before the store opens. At that point I find things to do, which most times there's plenty to do or on rare occasions when there's nothing Visual wise to do I help a lot in merchandising."

Constant challenges and changes were taking place, so I felt that it was great to learn to grow with a company that was constantly growing.

Hardest part of my job, was recruiting highly qualified stylist to become part of my team, that meant leaving a self independent pay, to a commission pay style. Most enjoyable part of my job, was the rewards from the customers and clientele who I know walked out happyl."

good,"I loved working for JC Penneys. I was in school and active with extra-curricluar activities so when something came up, my schedule could be adjusted to work around my activities. The pay was not great as we were paid minimum wage plus commission (abated against hours worked). Management was supportive with team building activities such as potlucks and meetings with awards given out, as well as the occassional contest among employees."
good,"Government kickbacks for various reasonsThis is a great place to work if you can handle intrusion into your personal affairs. I absolutely loved this job, but was very sickly during the time there and for the next four months. The management is exceptional excluding Human Resources. The business model and security level for personal info is phenomenal if you are the type who  don’t mi"

good,Have to be good at getting people to open credit cards. Cleaning fitting rooms. Being good with people. Most people are nice and will help you learn all the different stuff you need to know.
good,I left due to the fact the when I asked for help to understand certain duties of my position the district manager wouldn't return my calls or emails. His assumption of my knowledge of the position was ignorant on his part. All my past security experience advice I tried to give them was ignored. When it came to surveillance and investigation I was always on top of it. The area and job hawas very totally with no bank up. I put in my resignation due to lack of proper training and support.

good,Managers are awesome! Best supervisors I have ever had since working at my previous jobs. The managers actually care about the issues that are presented to them. Chances to advance and supervisors push you to grow and don't want you to remain comfortable! Gives you chance to learn more beyond previous positions held.
good,"Jcpenny salon has helped me through out the holiday for pushing for sales on the sales floor and becoming attentive to the customers and what to look for as in shampoos, conditioners for all types of hair ."
good,Your able to work at your own pace. I was never stressed or pressured. I got the job done the best way I could. The coworkers were also fun to work with. Everyone got along fine.
good,"I started working here when I moved. "
good,It was definitely a great experience for me myself. I enjoyed the coworkers I was placed with and I really felt a relatable work environment. I recommend this job to people still in school due to the flexible hours!
good,"I only worked at JCPenny for a short amount of time but it was one of my favorite jobs I ever had. The other employees are very helpful and always willing to help new hires get the hang of things around the store. The customers are more often friendly than nasty. The hours are flexible based on when you are available, and the company closes at a good time and I was never there past 9:30pm. The company also holds events for children and local colleges and while I worked there they had a special event for students of a local college were given a discount on certain professional clothes and given career and interview help. It was an overall very goo place to work and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get retail experience or switch to a better retail environment."
good,"The people here are amazing to work with, our store manager is the absolute best. It doesn’t take long to create a bond/family with the people here. Yes, customers can be stressful, but what place doesn’t have those moments? I love my job."
good,"Low pay and not enough hours, but it’s a good job to gain retail experience in. It’s a pretty relaxed environment as long as you do your job right.  It is also fast paced so it helps to be a fast learner. You have a different schedule every week and they change your schedule at the last minute sometimes. They expect you to keep an eye on your schedule daily. Coworkers bring snacks often for everyone. Friendly coworkers make this job a lot more bearable. I honestly would have stayed if they payed better."
good,Fast paced but lots of nice people and friends to be made at work there . When the store is not busy work goes by very slow so id very much so rather a busy day
good,It's  good. But I would recommend being out of school or making sure your assertive with the managers when telling them your schedule and how you want them unless you don't  care.
good,I work there almost 4 years as the manager of the salon. I was treated fairly by the management team and they always strived to make things better. The pay scale for the stylus went up considerably and I was able to recruit and retain stylist there.
good,Department is clear with job functions. Customers are friendly. Company itself is on th decline. But overall are good company with focused objectives.
good,Great place to work but pay is not good based on your education and experience. When I worked there we had 4 different General Managers. I made great customer relationships and friends with employees.
good,I was an intern there and I worked in the backpack division where we looked at backpacks on a daily basis to see how well the sales were going as we were reaching peak season.  I also helped with other various projects like allocating and competition shopping.  On top of that it was really cool sitting in and participating in vendor meetings.
good,"Probably the most relaxing and decent place to ever work for a freshy,sure I might of disliked a fellow employee but that didn’t stop me from working at all."
good,it was a fun place to work and i am grateful for the experience.It has really been an honor to work there i learned alot about the responsibilities assigned to the retail community.
good,"JCPenney is a wonderful company to work for and they recognize associates that work hard and contribute to the sales of the store. "
good,Very relaxed place to work pay could be better but good enough for department store but hours are flexible between work and life schedule  you also get a nice discount on clothing
good,The store was very fast paced and fun because it was very competitive and structured. Majority of the people are friendly and try to teach you what you did wrong.
good,It was really fun to work for JCPenny. I am a student so it was helpful for me to work on a flexible schedule. The management was very good and I enjoyed working there
good,"Good place to work at. However, you will be hounded to sell credit every day which is one of the reason why I quit. The necessity to sell credit cards to people was a nuisance and if you didn't get anyone to sign up for credit cards management would be on you about it. Most people didn't have time to sign up or they already had a JC penny card making it quite hard to get someone to sign up.Other than that, it was not bad working there at all.  The discount was nice too. Management was great and there was incentive for getting people to sign up for JC Penney cards. They also had free food in the break room from time to time and they had fun days that consist of random mini competition between departments or something of that nature."
good,"It's all of it.. Loved working there. Had to talk your head off just to get them to buy and try and get a credit card too. Good hour's. Pricing on clothes always had a discount and you could 15% rewards on a card. Us associated working there would get 25% plus the reward card to. Saved us a lot of money. Loved working there. Miss it there.  You can wear you own clothes.  Dressing up was fun. Had to wear a nametag. Had keys to get into the store. opened and count drawers, closed store and counted your drawers at the end of the night."
good,loved it. very easy and as long you have a great attitude and a thrive to work its perfect. i love cosmetology and being around in that department. best start up job.
good,When i come in to work i get the run down on goals we need to make. then i proceed to my area. Pricing and repricing shoe is mostly what i do. marking shoes for sales.
good,I love the people and the environment. The atmosphere is very bright and joyful which made working there a lot more enjoyable. The management is super nice and fun.
good,Amazing work experience was able to work there for a few years enjoyed our coworkers are birthday parties or celebrations of making quota there was always room to grow in that company but little pay
good,I walked in and the first manager I saw would greet me and tell me what area I was working in. I learned my customer service skills from a few fellow co-workers. This environment was an opportunity I will never forget and I still want to go back.
good,It was a good experience working as a seasonal associate at JcPenney.  They gave us 3 days of training and were very patient with us in our first days.  The other associates would also help us as much as they could.
good,"Very open about helping people achieve their goals "
good,"For my first job this was pretty awesome, great pay, raises, benefits, flexible hours and were willing to work with you, My manager at the time was amazing , I will never forget how awesome she was and was always willing to teach and work with me,"
good,"Different situations and experiences every day"
good,"Had certain duties to  do weekly, self suffiecient in after trained but was able to review on the duties given. Management was helpful and would recomment associates for new job titles, deadlines were met by many associates involved in process of duties, great team work. Company met their mission."
good,"They treat all customers great , they work as a team help you learn fast always there to help you if your stuck never leave you behind and as well great management."
good,i have worked here for a while and it has its ups and downs. i am happy i got the experience but i am ready to start my care in the medical field. i recommend this job for anyone.
good,JcPenney had so many good employees that were always willing to help out others. The only thing I did not like was it was strictly a part-time job. There are no full-time positions unless you are a manager or assistant manager.
good,"Even though there are quite a few of stylists at the salon, everyone considers each other as part of the team. We work as a team and help each other out when needed. The front desk operates amazingly and appointments are given fairly. The hardest part i would say is being aggressive in retail. There is additional education if desired. Management always tries to have contests which changes things up. The people i work with are great and everyone gets along. You really feel like a team."
good,"Working at jcpenney was a great experience for me. ALL the managers were so nice and easy to talk to. "
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney. It was a fun and positive working environment. There were so many benefits to working there and they were very flexible when it came to hours.
good,"Great location to work at, sadly it closed several years back.  The management team was always driving for excellence and they knew their team members well."
good,"Sad to say this location closed back in 2009 and the excellent team we had at Bellevue Square location either relocated to other locations or parted their ways with JCP corp.  This was a college job that almost became my career path as it allowed plenty opportunities for advancement at the time and great management was invested in nurturing their people to help them grow within the company"
good,"JCPenney provides a fast-pace, professional and competitive work environment, where employees prioritize the needs of customers, which include but not limited to online orders, ringing the cash registers, restocking returns, replenishing merchandise, etc."
good,"A perfect starter job for upcoming adults, here you learn all about the fast paced retail industry, with a okay pay start (Around $9.50). Management was fair and practical as well"
good,"When I worked at JCPenney, I remember really enjoying working there, not to mention a lot of the people are a pleasure to work with. The only problem I would say I had with working with JCPenney is that the schedule changes every week, so it's really a mystery what shift you'll have and for how long. But other than that it's been great!"
good,"Pennys Is a great place to work for any age. You do have to stand on your feet and walk around for hours. But you get to meet a lot of new people and work with a lot of people. If you are outgoing person working at Pennys is a job for you.   You can always find something to do when it’s not that busy so you can’t say you are bored. "
good,"My time at JCPenney was a huge learning experience. I was able to learn basic skills, such as operating a cash register, very quickly because of the welcoming environment. I was put to work almost immediately and help was provided to me when needed. Everything was very clear, and I was never unsure about what my job was for the day. I think that this job was a very good job to have for my first job. Now I can say that I have experience in retail, which helps in acquiring future employment."
good,"I've learned how to work efficiently in a high paced environment. I was able to use time management techniques to complete work assigments quickly. I've also learned how to work with coworkers at a competitive level and also discovered how rewarding teamwork can  "
good,Had lots of fun gossiping when not working the register. Loved my manager. Hated to leave but school got in the way. Recommend for high schoolers and people with crummy degrees.
good,"It was fun, managers and associates were such sweethearts and helpful. The only problem I had were the hours and not working enough, sometime the only had you working a day or two out the week"
good,"It's good if you're not looking for advancement.   My experience, I was one of their top sales persons & the more I requested hrs, the less I received"
good,I love the diversity and the overall vibe of the working atmosphere. The managers are very friendly. The hardest part is staying busy when the store is slow
good,"I enjoyed every morning meeting and talking to my staff. We would go over sales, and goals for the day and week. It was a happy environment. The company offered benefits and good pay for the management ."
good,A typical day at work would be me going in working on the register trying reach my goal of two new credit card members a week. The hardest part of the job was the closing because after a busy day the store. The store would be very disorganized and we would have to stay very late untill the store organized to our managers liking.
good,I loved working with my JCP family. It was a job that required hard work but the pay off was worth it. I would recommend working at JCPenney to anyone who is looking for a beginning job experience.
good,I was assigned to work as a door to floor associate. This job required me to fold clothes in the backroom and move around with carts throughout the store and organize all clothes and put everything were it belongs also at the same time providing good customer service.
good,"It feels like a family, everyone gets to know everyone. It's retail, you'll have recovery, organizing and other things to be done. Some days you will be really busy some days it will be quieter than a church mouse."
good,"We would manually process merchandise as quickly as possible with (if possible) no mistakes. There are other departments in the factory that you could go, with different expectations."
good,"A typical day was organizing the racks and shelves, register, and helping customers to their needs. The only bad times were when customers would get rude and try to argue with the employee. Management was very nice and understanding. The workplace was friendly must be cooperating in organizing. You learn to be more patient with your customers and fulfill their needs before your own."
good,"Working for Sephora in jc Penney was really fun. A typical day at work would just be asking costumers if they needed help with any products and if they did we would explain what products to recommend and why. If there are no costumers, just restock and keep the area clean."
good,"Its a good job, i went in 5am to work on the loading dock, then i guided the trucks in their bay, then i had to unload the trailer with a pallet jack since our merchandise comes on pallets, then i would stay on the dock waiting for fedex or UPS deliveries to inspect the packages for tampering, by 12am my shift was over."
good,Love the job environment but the pay will scare you. Should be a beginner stylist starting to build your client base. Not shifting from behind the chair to commission based
good,"Working at JCPenney's, a typical day at work would normally include working at the cash register, and recovering certain areas, as well as being in charge of go-backs. These activities weren't in any specific order, normally. Through both cashiering and asking customers if they needed help during recovering, I learned important aspects of customer service. The whole point of the job was to provide excellent customer service, as is similar with many retail jobs - it was quick-paced, especially around the holiday season. The hardest part, however, was dealing with more difficult customers. I made it a point to try to fulfill said difficult customer's wishes, retrieving any managers when it couldn't be handled by myself. However, the most enjoyable part was being able to learn to communicate with different people - both employees and customers alike."
good,"Typical day started out slow and then went to fast pace."
good,"It was a good job just the pay wasn’t enough to support me,the managers were great and the coworkers were awesome couldn’t have asked for a better crew"
good,"Nice people, great company and growing. Managers good and growth is a great opportunity. would have never stopping working there but the cut backs at jobs are not our faults"
good,"Each work day is a hit and miss on how busy at the Jcp i work at "
good,"Retail in general does not match with required knowledge, company policies and stress.  JCPenney was a nice place to work because I didn't let the stress get to me.  Greeting your regular customers was a nice way to spend your day on the job."
good,"I spent my days here helping customers, running cash registers, cleaning the store, and regular sales associate stuff. I got to see and talk to a lot of different people everyday and was never bored. It was a lot of fun. The hardest part was probably cleaning the store when we closed because it was Christmas and the store always got so messy."
good,Good place to work. Incentives and job reconigition is given. Lots of interaction with customers and employees. My supervisor skills are being used. I get many cutomer service reviews that are excellent. Once a month employees are given variety of food in break rooms. Special days of year are recognized and celebrated. Awards are given to high performers.
good,"I loved working here and only left due to how I was being treated by a particular employee. Otherwise, the work environment was great and it was a very fun place to work."
good,"Good store to work at,very cordial enviroment.Management appreciates your hard work.It becomes stressful when gets  busy.I also gained lot of experience by working under different supervisors."
good,"A typical day was entering my department, opening up, checking in inventory and seeing what new products had become available. Then I would deal with walk-in customers, helping to meet their needs."
good,"There's always items or shelves to straighten, but overall an easy paced job.  Job details are clear with easy instructions on task completion.  Lots of walking and standing."
good,Company gives clear direction of daily duties. Company is very customer service focused.This company like all others has very tight payroll budgets. Sometimes difficult to take care of all customers.
good,I knew from day one the exciting environment and people would keep me engaged forever! My team is like a family and we have potlucks all the time. The customers are awesome! We have regulars that come in just to see us. Great place to work.
good,"Working in a retail environment is no walk through the park, but at JC Penny of Meadowbrook Mall all of your fellow associates make work much more bearable. Management is always coming up with new ideas to make work ""fun"" whether it's incentives, lunch parties, or even getting everyone into the holiday spirit with some Santa hats."
good,"I was trained in customer service and retail skills by this job. I was seasonally employed for the holidays, and was put into black friday only a couple of days after my basic training. I then worked eight hours a day for the holiday season while simultaneously working as a custodian at night. This taught me everything I needed to know about customer service and was an excellent immersion into the world of sales, retail, and customer relations as a professional."
good,I learned how to correctly attend to customers and satisfy their needs. I learned a great deal of knowledge in retail and organization skills from a fast paced environment.
good,"Meeting different people everyday and being able to assist others and help them is always a joy. Providing a safe and secure environment for associates, vendors, visitors and or contractors."
good,"enjoyed many years working at jcpenney, provided training and advancement, a place to grow in a career. I would still be working there if the company would of not closed the store."
good,"Working on the sales floor, greeting and acknowledging customers."
good,"Being an employee at the JcPenny Warehouse is an amazing job, being able to work with an amazing group of people can bring joy into a persons life. All in all JcPenny is a great place to work."
good,Easy and stress free for the most part. At time management would have intense mood swings and treat the employees unfairly based on her mood. Other than that a great place to work
good,"It Was A Nice Positive Spot That I Liked Going Too The Customer & My Team That I Was Working With Was Kind & Respectful .. I Loved Working There The Only Reason I Stopped , Was Because The Manager Could Of Been Not So Rude .. &  Was 7 Months & Was Sick  & Pregant So I Had To Resign From There"
good,Probably the best job I had ever had. Great company before the changing of CEOs. Management and admin working together as a team and becoming close like a family. Lots of team building experiences. Relaxed atmosphere. Learned a lot about retail. Meeting and conversing with all that worked in the building. Great experiences and great people! Thank you. I wish CEOs were not changed out.
good,A typical day at Jc Penney is very fast paced and busy due to its great sales and coupons.The best part about working there is meeting new people and making new costumer friends.
good,The environment was great to work in and fun but the customers in the area are rude. They were good with availability and scheduling. Rewarded you based on sales.
good,"Pretty laid back environment, but one where hard work is expected from all associates and management. A typical day will consist of you spending your entire shift standing or walking; a good workout in disguise!!"
good,"The other associates were great to work with, They made the job that much better, the mangers were also really nice and cool about most things. They also allowed very flexible schedules."
good,Never received unfair amount of work. Always had some sort of incentive to push workers and had opening meetings daily to  have a open communication with the staff.
good,meeting new people everyday was enjoyable for me. i enjoy customer service and meeting people. i really  enjoy helping people with their fashions as well.
good,"Days were long at times. I learned a lot while there, being more aware of people in general. The store supervisor at the time was great to work for, as were most of the other supervisors. One supervisor was really lazy and never did her own work, she had others do it. Unfortunately she is still there, and all of the good ones are gone."
good,"Job profile is really good and I learnt alot while working on different assignment here at JCPenney. "
good,"Friendly work place, management was good and supportive! I worked early morning is a fast pace environment unloading and loading the truck. hardest part of the job was how fast pace it was."
good,"They work with you and try to work around your schedule , the first thing you do is check and see if have any customers to assist , handle calls , money , customers"
good,"Good company to work for. You were allowed to manage your associates without being micro managed, Good benefits if you were off for a medical reason. Salary could have been better they are not the highest paying company."
good,"It is a great part time job. The company gets everyone involved. You can find a place here. Easy to adapt. Many technical skills to learn. With the right team management runs things smoothly. Jcpenney has a wonderful training program which never leaves you behind coworker knowledge about products and other miscellaneous information.Typical workday at JCPenney-"
good,"You will be helping customers with their purchases,p and returns, as well has putting away the clothes in the fitting rooms. Customers are generally pretty pleasant, so they will say hello when you greet them, and want to be helpful. If handling the fitting room is a bit hard for you because you're helping multiple customers, you can call a manager on duty to help. The MoDs and your coworkers are very friendly and willing to help you out."
good,the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the customers! what ive learned was its very important to be to work on time and eating properly. i do miss the co-workers because we treated each other like members of our own family.
good,To work at JC Penney is like working at a new place each week.  I have learned how to be flexible each day for new and exciting changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been the family like workplace culture!
good,There's always something to do. Management is very organized and well experienced when it comes to the delegation of tasks and projects. The work environment is very welcoming and inclusive. Competitive pay and excellent advancement opportunities.
good,"The management was awesome and we had a great discount, but i was paid 25 cents over minimum wage to deal with many difficult things, including angry customers every day and the messy store - especially on weekends and close to holidays"
good,"I love working at JCpenney. The only issue I have ever had has been lack of hours unfortunately. The environment of the whole store is a safe and friendly one. Management and Co workers are professional but also very personable, a fantastic balance."
good,"I have had a good experience working at JCPenny, There are many good skills I've learned that I feel will be immensely useful at any job I work in and I couldn't ask for a better first job"
good,"Good place to work. Good for long term employment. Good management. Great discount w/in the store! Good benefits working either part or full time."
good,"They're great, the only complaint I have is that they EXPECT (and require) you to get two Credit Card quota's a week and it's so frustrating trying to advertise the credit card to people. Especially when most people in the Tri-Cities area already has one or isn't interested."
good,"A huge retail company, working in the mens wear and siut dept. was difficult, sales hard to come by as company changes it's inventory logic, and depleted the suit line in favor of a more casual line."
good,When working here you really do not learn any skills other than what they train you on.  They were changing the CEO and he changed the whole operation.
good,I learned about fashion and being able to dress people for success as well as improved myself in this manner. We was a family at JCPenney not just your typical co-worker experince and I still go see them whenever I get a chance to. I enjoyed the quality of work experience that I received at this company.
good,I like working there. They have great Benefits for your family and yourself. They also will help you gain more experiences to put on your resume. Easy work as well.
good,"I loved working for this company because it was my first retail job during the holidays. It was very busy and I was new at retail,but I got a lot of great customer feedback. I was told that I was very helpful in helping them what they needed to find and that I was very polite. The managers were helpful and understanding when it came to helping out employees during the day. The hardest part of the job was having a  handheld register and it was really hard to process transactions,but I tried to make the most of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their holiday shopping for Christmas."
good,"JC PENNYS was a truly great experience other than the traffic flow of the store. personally, I prefer to have the store busy at all times, it makes the work day go by exrememly quicker"
good,"Co-workers are fun and helpful, very diverse company which is great,  learned a lot of new things. It was just a bit hard working some of the hours they gave, but it was during the holidays so I understand, and trying to maintain school, personal life and work all at once."
good,"A typical day at work was busy on my feet all day, I learned to have patients with the customers, the management was patient with me, my co-workers helped me to do my work better, the hardest part of the job was having a long line with customer service and the most enjoyable part of the job was to make sure the customers were satisfied."
good,Many supervisors are happy with the work I do. They were wiling to negotiate on tasks. Valued associates. Hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated towards certain customers and associates.
good,Nice atmosphere with helpful co-workers. Typical day consisted of fixing displays (i.e. folding and rearranging hangers and sizes) as well as helping customers checkout or find specific items.
good,"Pretty cool, more chill than any other job i've worked. The recovery process at the end of shift is pretty strenuous. The person training me is pretty knowledgeable so I feel pretty comfortable with the position/"
good,The management and other employees are very nice and make working their a blast. They always encourage learning and never give a reason to quit.

good,"As a new employee I was brought into what seemed like a family, everyone was nice and willing to help out when things got hectic or you didn't know what to do with a certain transaction. I cleaned up displays, took orders from the back of the store to the register, worked the register and moved clothes to where they needed to be."
good,"Very supportive of schooling."
good,"I look forward to going to work everyday. Its a nice place to work if you like a fast pace environment. The management staff is great, this is the first job that I had that I can go and talk to my manager with no problems."
good,"Custom Decorating co-workers were a fun group to work with, in the store studio as well as the corporate office.  I miss those days."
good,Moderate paste if you enjoy receiving materials a great place to work. flexible hours and great productive environment to work in with great management.
good,"As in any big Company there are a lot of different personalities, I learn to deal with some of them.  On the whole a good company and I made some lasting friendships."
good,"A typical work day was like no other. I learned there are some good people in this world. The management were great, I had any problems. All my co-workers were pleasant to work with. the hardest part of the job, not knowing where to put items if there were any space. the most enjoyable was working on the truck."
good,Moving up in this company happens very quickly. You Have no personal life though. Diversity and Inclusion. Benefits are great.
good,A great company to work for. P.O.S systems are very easy to learn. Management is friendly and professional. Would recommend working here.
good,"JC Penney was a productive and a very interesting place to work. Management was visible, and willing  to honor individuals who exceeded company's goals through a reward system.  I worked with a team of tenure employees which made my job easier if I  had questions. The hardest part of my job was keeping a balance of knowing how much to compensate a customer  for inconvenience  while  keeping company matrix in mind.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing customer return for repeat business and  happy with product and writing good reviews."
good,"taking care of our customers, setting the store for ease of finding the items , be a team player with all the Supervisors and associates and making it fun to be at work, hardest was keeping up on the fitting rooms, the best was meeting new people everyday and helping them leave satisfied and happy"
good,"Working at JCPenney is like working at any other retail store. You recieve customers, happy, angry, talkative, etc. You provide customer service, ask them what brings them into the jewelry department and cater to their needs to the best of my capabilites. I think all of that is self explanatory. However, patientce is something I realized I had more than ever. I've always known I was an extremely tolerant and adaptable person, but I learned you need patience to work in retail and be a sales person because someties who you;re trying to sell to wants you to sell to them, so they ask questions, make comments, when all you want to do is close a sale, but you need patience and it was great learning that about myself. In terms of the enviornment, it was comfortable and easy going. The staff was super friendly, but not overly friendly where you can't be professional either. I loved tmanagement because they were always so supportive and rewarded you and recognized you all the time and it is very motivating to have a team so close and helpful no matter what. My co-workers are friends i have taken with me after JCPenney and I absoluetly adored this experience. It was my very first position in retail and I couldn't be any more proud to say that it was at JCPenney."
good,"Most of my shifts were afternoon shift because i had school in the morning, so it wasn't as hard for me to get work or had bad schedules, highly appreciate the managements flexibility. Loved the environment of this job. Challenging because you had to set your mind to sell or up-sell a product or achieve your monthly target."
good,"I enjoyed the discipline, encouragement, and constructive criticism to reach our goals as a team. The annual increases were a plus"
good,"A very fun and enjoyable job with the privilege of interacting with the customers.Many of the co-workers fulfill their work responsibility which means management were able to support a healthy work environment,"
good,"A typical day at JCP involved a lot of customer service. That was my priority when I walked through the doors - serving customers. I worked at the service desk often, so I was the first associate customers saw, the first one they came to with a question, and the last impression of JCP when they left the store. Days at work have been crazy; many days I've found myself with a long line of customers (some happy, some not), phones ringing, and fellow associates asking questions...all at the same time. It could be stressful, but it was something I was comfortable handling."
good,"I meet a lot of customers and associates at work. The supervisors are always ready to address any concerns that the associates and the customers may have. I have the opportunity to state my opinions in certain matters that concerns me. I also have the opportunity to suggest new ideas and to use whatever talents I have for the improvement of sales and customer service. "
good,it is usually a pleasant experience there are 15 minute breaks plus lunch break and they have special events and food for the employees in the break room and the location of the job in the mall Is great. I learned team work and my first job experience. The supervisors and management were great.
good,Friendly coworkers with a moderately paced work environment very nice managers with no days being exhaustingly overwhelming.
good,"JCPenney taught me how to work with all different types of customers, I found ways to be personable yet professional. It was informative to take in the high stress environment and figure out how to approach situations in a calm manner. The management had issues, and that was my least favorite thing about working there. The overtime pay was helpful to my pockets, but the late night hours easily bled into the morning. During the holiday it seemed somewhat normal that we were getting out at close to three in the morning. However, some nights we would be there until 5am. When the holidays ended I assumed the late nights would as well; however, it continued, and being a full-time student did not comply with the exhausting hours. That being said, I had some really amazing supervisors, and I absolutely adored my co-workers. It was the perfect job to get me started in the work force. I always say if I was able to handle Black Friday and Christmas Eve, I can handle anything."
good,"Management is great except when they demand ICAPs when there is barely anyone in the store. Paid 15 minute breaks are awesome, co-workers are awesome. Work is not strenuous at all. Customers are mostly great as well. Barely any stress involved with working here."
good,Great environment... wonderful place to assist and meet so many different people. Great leadership and management... awesome place to learn great customer service skills.
good,a typical day i would clock in do stock work maintain my work space and help customers as needed learned a lot about the company and myself
good,I enjoyed the customers. Learned how to get people a great award system like there credit card program. The hardest part was to keep on top of hanging and folding the clothes through out the day.
good,"Really liked my job but the store was one of the stores closed in 2014"
good,"Working at J.C Penny was a very enjoyable experience for me. My co-workers there were very friendly an treated everyone like family. Most of my time there was behind the scenes unloading trucks, stocking, but there where times where I got to interact with costumers and I really enjoyed it a lot."
good,En un dia tipico de trabajo siempre me esmero en terminar mis tareas para el dia y asi poder ayudar a un companero que este atrasado en su trabajo.La mejor parte de mi trabajo que me enorgullese es cuando se termina el trabajo y uno es reconocido por ello.
good,"Retail is a short ride or a long journey, and since working at three diverse companies I have learned a fair share about the customer service side of retail. A typical day dependent on location will have peak periods and slow periods, there are a variety of factors that effect the outcome of your sales: indoor/outdoor,style of clothing, construction, weather, holiday, and sporting events. Each and every single one of these is really important to understand what to gear towards your customers which can vary vastly between bargain hunters, loyal customers, and new customers. Basically every customer falls into these three categories. Understanding the dynamics of retail is the reason why as a customer service specialist I can quite honestly guarantee to a certain degree why JCP has floated in the current economic climate, and yet is still making changes to the way it caters to customers. They put customers first, they want to offer you the best quality, the best deal, and the best service regardless of the size, age, or location of your store. Working Customer Service always comes with ups and downs, not everyone is going to like or value you and on occasion they may even want to be physically defensive due to outside factors, but JCP guarantee's your safety as well as your loyalty. My management team did the absolute best despite multiple occasions for frustration, difficult customers, and complicated team workers. So if I was to salute a business purely on the standards of customer service, and affordable prices that would place JCP at the very top."
good,"family oriented and great culture.. needs more advancement opportunities, enjoy everyday of it. compensation needs to improve but so far best company I have worked for"
good,"Everyday we had to keep our work place clean and stay busy, if we were not busy the mangers would ask us to clean up or help other busy departments."

I had a lot of wierd experiences, but they made for a good workplace. It gave me a lot of time to deal with multiple stressful situations. The best part of working at JCPenney was the same customers, same family, same care. The worst part was the constant closing shop rumors."

How to manage inventory, people and office procedures."
good,I loved working at JC Penney the team was pretty great and the company created contest and incentives to make getting credit apps more fun. The only bad thing was most positions they offer for sales associates/cashier was only part time and only offered minimum wage. This isn't a problem if you are only applying for management positions.I enjoyed the Loss Prevention position its exciting and you don't need any type of special licensing to qualify for this job would be great for a criminal justice student wanting to get a taste of what its like to be in the criminal justice field.
good,Typically you go in clock in and I worked in the mens department so I would open the cash registers then I would go around and fix all the clothes and as customers would come in I would help them find anything they needed and then when they were ready to check out i would check them out and then repeat the proccess. Sometimes the manager would have me do odd jobs and I would get them doen then go back to my original Job.

good,"Great company with great people. Days consist of unloading product in the morning to prep for afternoon product fills. As well as providing help with customers as needed. Continue into the day with folding and filling the sales floor. Management overall was pretty well except to many supervisors were assigned to one job."
good,"It's retail so no one is going to get rich very quickly.  I took this job knowing that but I have found the job to be fun and exciting.  So far everyone at the store has been great to work with all the way from Upper Management to the support team.  A typical day is to monitor the store merchadise, associates and customers on the floor or back in the loss prevention room via the cameras set up throughout the store.  "
good,"Penny's has ALWAYS given good value for the buck, and they still try hard to stay current with styles and some fads.  You will NOT be sorry you worked for them, and there are mountains of nice people who put their whole careers in with just this one company.  I am worried about the future in retail as it is today, but Penny's will try hard at all costs to stay in business.  Beats the heck out of Sears."

The hardest part of the job is finishing the workload for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to accomplish your goals and seeing your hand work pay off. It's such a great position if you like to stay busy at work."
good,"Worked into my organizational skills, allowed me to go to school and work without feeling like I missed out on family or fun. Hardest part of the job were customers who insisted on a price despite ad and signed price differing. I enjoyed opening in the morning and being at the store when customers entering weren't already tired of going from store to store."
good,We basically was at a desk with 3 to 4 people in it and we had a dolly we had to at least finish one whole dolly a day. We were re-ticketing and repricing cloths and furniture.

I loved JcPennys management, They were always so nice and whenever you needed something or needed to talk to them about something going on in the workplace they would always listen to you. The short amount of time that I worked for this company was great, friendly and understanding co-workers, never a bad was to be had while working there. I'd have to say cleaning the dressing rooms was the hardest part of the job because the second it got, it went back to dirty again.

I worked in several departments so I came in contact with men, women, children, people browsing, people in a hurry, people who knew exactly what they wanted, etc. When I transfered to the salon it was a different atmosphere. Women came to relax and be pampered. It was quiet, unless there was a roar of laughter from one of our joke telling stylist. My manager taught me the meaning of being personable. Treating each woman like she was the most important client. I learned responsbilty. The most enjoyable part was the multi-line phone system. I LOVE talking on the phone and helping people, so with that being 85% of my job, I loved it."

I had a manager I didn't feel comfortable with, many other employees and even managers said ""Don't worry about what he has to say, he's kidding."" so when he did say things, I usually payed them no mind. My coworkers we're all great and welcoming, as for my managers, I felt many of them forgot many rules they'd given us to follow. Hardest part of the job was staying on my toes about correcting my hours and the most enjoyable part of the job was happy customers."

good,"Everyday is different. It doesn't get boring. The friendliest and helpful management team. Regardless of if things are busy, they help efficiently with any problem. The work environment is great, and I recommend working here to everyone. One thing that is quite challenging are schedules. It is hard if you cannot work a certain day to get that day off. Almost no one is available to switch with because they are usually working that day."
good,I loved working at JcPenny! The people were super friendly and the work was easy. I loved making credit apps and enjoyed working the busy holiday season. I think I was getting paid fair for retail but the only down flaw is the hours. On slow months like January some employees would get 0-10 hours. On the other hand that makes it a super flexible work place and a great second job!
good,"Was hired during seasonal. Every customer you get that signs up for a credit card, you get $2 towards your pay check. Managers are friendly and always checks on you to see if you are good. You have at least one other person with you in the department working with you. 15 min breaks. 30 min lunch if 7 or less working that shift, 1 hour of working 8. When not busy, try to find something to do, Such as, folding clothes, clean station, organize clothes by size, take clothes to their department if someone is with you."

The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to create a friendship with your co-workers while working proficiently.

Will have to gain knowledge of all products within store to best assist customers. Management was very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of job was getting new accounts for our credit cards.

Being a manager there for a year was a great experience and gave me new light on different companies and their styles (I was a manager at Albertson's for 3 years).  I loved the employees and how they gave me hints on the very complicated cash registers.  I was treated fairly, got a lot of hours, and was awarded a $50 gift card for having the most customers sign up for their credit card (which offered them an extra 30% on top of other sales.  So they could get 80% off their total in 1 transaction).  It was an experience I will never forget."

Pennys was good for learning new things, they had different classes on hair products and perms. penneys sent another co-worker and I to virginia for couple of days to learn about facals and body wraps.

good,Great first job with a good amount of hours. I learned Point of sale as well as gained more customer service experience. Management is friendly and very helpful.
good,I learned so much about customer service and how rewarding it can be. The managers are so dedicated to good customer service and they set such a good example for me. My co-workers taught me so much as well and it was a privilege to work with them. The hardest part of the job was trying your hardest to make the customer happy but you can't get them exactly where they want because you have done all that you can do. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how happy the customer is when you go above and beyond for them. It makes you realize how low the standards for customer service has been set.

good,"I absolutely enjoyed working here. The employees were friendly and outspoken. I learned how to manage customers better, and also fold merchandise pretty well. The hardest part of the job was trying to make every supervisor happy. Each supervisor had their own way of doing things, so it made it very difficult to please everyone. The most enjoyable part of this job was to see the look on your customers' faces when you told them how much they have saved."
good,"Have worked there for over 3 years, went from being holiday help to being a manager, very happy.. just want more work experience. It was a good place to work with very friendly customers and co workers."
good,"J C Penny's is a very good company to work for that adheres to it's vision and mission statement for customers and employees,"
good,"Working in a hair salon gave me lots of experience in customer service. I became very familiar with making sure that the clients are always happy. Team work is something that I learned is very important in a salon, in order to get things done like cleaning up after salon hours there needed to be a team effort to get things done. My co-workers were such a help when I was lost. Overall I learned that hair cutting is not a career I want to pursue for the rest of my life Although hair cutting is not my passion I do love the beauty industry."
good,"Seasonal was hectic. But, the staff made it worth while. The management was very easy going and the environment was overall loving."
good,"Help customers find items suited to their needs, straightened products, ran register, put displays together, trained new employees. Leaned that I enjoy retail work. Management was good. Co workers are nice. Hardest part was the decrease in hours due to the success of the business. Enjoyable part was working with the customers."
good,"Sales Assoicate: usually can get a lot of hours, very busy, always somthing to do, customers are complete jerks. It's a nice place to work really nice staff, get a lot of food and contests. "
good,"a typical day at jcp would be selling jewelry weather it be gem stones, gold, diamonds, custom, or watches. making sure the customer is satisfied with the product and the services. i learned how to talk to customers, how to actually sell a product, how to return an item, assist, allow a customer to feel welcome. my co workers were ok, some were lazy, some weren't, overall my co workers were nice, understanding and great to work with. the most enjoyable part about work here was knowing i help a customer get what he or she wanted and was completely satisfied with it."
good,"I enjoyed growing thru the company, however like all retail stores the respect for work life balance was lacking.  I  learned a lot about customer service both internal and external. The hardest part of the job was that the recognition for hard work and meeting goals was not consistent. The most enjoyable part was the customers and the many great managers I was able to work for and eventually with."
good,Greeting customers making sure you help them with what they need you to assist them with. cashier helping them checkout and making sure they found everything they need
good,"Talking with customers, and understanding what they need by listening before they ask. Putting out clothes, folding keeping area clean, cashier, count down at end of the night."
good,"A typical day at work is based on customer service, credit and sales, there is a lot of standing and moving around but in the end customers come first, so that defines your day."
good,"Manager-developed strong business acumen "
good,"For a department store JCPenney is a reasonable employer. Hours tended to be good, as well as management. As a young employee and due to its being one of my first few jobs, I was able to learn some of the ways corporations prefer to run their establishments, which was with complete trust (because video cameras were always watching), and with so much manpower that it was really up to the coworkers within the store themselves to get together and finish the job as quickly as possible during closing time. That was always fun, a sort of adrenaline rush as we run to the dress shirts and intricately fold each one back up or hang up the last pair of dress pants, before going back to one of the registers and closing it out, figuring the amount we earned through the one unit, and then sealing the money up in bags and taking them back to the lady in charge of handling the tender. Since it was a mall job, many of my friends made random appearances, making it for a quite enjoyable experience with plenty of surprises along the way. As well as amazing discounts on clearance items, allowing for a brighter, better wardrobe at a minimal fraction of the regular price. :) Ties for $2-3 can't be beat! I secretly would look at the advertisements for JCPenney, wishing one day to be modeling in the magazines. That would be quite a turn of events!"
good,I had a blast working there but i could work and go to school at the same time. My coworkers was awesome too. The management was good and bad .
good,The managers were always available. Worked very well with all my fellow associates. We all helped each other and it was a great work environment. I Had amazing repeat customers. There was no part of the job that was hard. Everything flowed very well.
good,"A typical day at work looks like this; clock in, set a break/lunch time, start working on register, fitting rooms, or the floor greeting customers. At night I would close registers, recover areas of the store and clock out. I learned time management, how to use a register, customer service skills, persuading customers to get Jcpenney credit cards, make online orders, payments and more. The hardest part of the job was hours, I was constantly getting horrible hours causing me to skip church services. The most enjoyable part of the job was, the environment was friendly, i got close to most of my co workers."
good,Great retail environment to work in and assist all customers needs.
good,"As I enter into work the first thing I am to do after I have clocked in is to make sure all clothes and other items are put back. After I have made sure everything is put back as the doors open to start the day of work I make sure I assist customers to the right category of clothes they are needed to be found. I have learned how to communicate with others and working at the pace that I need to, to get the job done as quickly as it is needed. Working with my co-workers makes me feel really good about my job. They help me in every way that is needed to get the job done. Especially if I am not sure how to provide the correct answers to help the customers feel comfortable with finding no problems with finding anything or asking where a certain item is they do so with helping me with no problem. The hardest part of my job at times is learning where everything is and some times explaining what's on sale and how they are to find things online when it can't be found in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and making sure they feel good about shopping at our store."
good,My day begins with service customers. Making sure product stock are fill. I learn to work well with a varity of people. I  learn to manage and schedule for  appointments co workers. i have no compalins with the working with JCPenny. I  enjoyed working with all coworkers.
good,"First thing i would do is get a item list of the items i would have to mark down, it was usually a deppartment a day. Get a RFID scanner to make sure i got the proper item and it could be counted. Then put a sticker of the current price of the item."
good,I loved working at jcp it was a fun place to work and always had a positive environment. a typical day at work was just cashiering and folding clothes making sure that the store looked presentable. Answering the phone if it rang in my department and making sure the customers got their online orders picked up.
good,"While no longer a business due to acquisition, this organization had high quality talent and advanced competencies in direct response marketing."
good,Very professional and respectful of your time and personal life.
good,"JC Penny culture is amzing. "
good,Typical day was clocking in and jumping right into the day! It was a fast paced job for the most part. Commission sales means YOU make your paycheck. Co-workers were great and lovely people to work with. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep our department clean.
good,Everybody knows everybody. Breaks are from 15 mins to an hour depending on length of shift. I love being in retail but coworkers can be very hectic in department stores. Crowds come and go but there's usually always someone there to help. The managers will remember you and they are very helpful when it comes to recommendations. May have to stay a lot later than expected to clean the store NOT JUST YOUR DEPARTMENT!
good,"love JCP Portraits!"
good,"its a wonderful day at jcpenny's."
good,"Helping fellow shoppers, what could be more fun than that! This job taught me how to advance my sense of style and help others create their own . Since the job was salary plus commission, we shared sales equally or as equally as possible. This allowed us to alternate on the register while one of us kept the Department neat  and presentable. Working as a team was what it was all about. We enjoyed the camaraderie  and a sense of purpose."
good,Good managers and good place to work. I would tell anyone to work there that wanted to know if they wanted to work there.
good,"A typical day at work included helping customers, running the register, and creating friendships with co-workers. This job taught me how to manage my time and be more independent. All of my managers and co-workers were super friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was leaving clothes on the rack and not buying everything with my employee discount! I loved working with the people I was around, and I loved the discount, and holiday parties they provided to us."
good,Learned how to work harder to help our store to grow and show love to our people.
good,"learn to work directly with clients, with goals and good management."
good,"We met in the morning and I would get behind the jewelry counter where I would count diamonds in the case and in the safe. I wrote invitations for special events and sales, sent reminders out for anniversaries, birthday parties, and Valentine's Day. I sent out merchandise for repair and would track merchandise. My communication skills got better. The management was very helpful, we could call them every time we had a question and there was always a manager on call. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy costumers about the quality of the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of this job was making friends at work and the friendly environment."
good,"My typical day at work would be fixing the floor, cashier, and sizing. I learned how to work at a fast pace and how to deal with angry customers. I helped train new workers on how to work the floor and cashier. There wasn't any hard part of the job I couldn't do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to know new people."
good,I worked in the salon with a great relationship with co-workers
good,"I was a cashier at JC Penney. I would open in the morning. Ring customers at the register. I would assist customer in ordering items online and finding items in the store. My Job duties were Cashiering, Stocking, and Customer Service."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with the customers after a while you really start to get to know them and its really nice having that bond with them. My manager was really nice and she always made sure that her employees where happy. I loved all my co workers we were like a big family.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work, the management and fellow employees where very kind. I would clean fitting rooms, work with customers, run register, help set floor plans and back stock extra merchandise. This was my first job so I learned the core values when working, the dos and don'ts. The management was very friendly and would easily correct you by teaching you how to do things the right way, Co-workers were very nice and everyone was there to help each other, if you were falling behind in one portion someone would come help and visa versa. The hardest part of this job was learning all the roles, I wanted to learn everything about everything and it took a lot of time but they were willing to help. "
good,Every aspect of this job was great it is the standard of how a job should be work straight hours have goals to accomplish. And human resource did eventually after a while take care of issues between coworkers. Management just lacked knowledge of jewelry.
good,I loved working for JC Penney! It was a great place to become close with the people you worked with which developed a really strong and goal-oriented team. I was given the chance to take on leadership roles and was trusted to be independent. I also loved being about to learn so many different aspects of the store rather than simply what was in my job description!
good,"I had loved my work at JC Penney Salon for almost 20 years. I never felt otherwise. My position had been eliminated due to all the changes nationwide, otherwise I would be there til retirement. I work with both customers and employees in the salon, making sure customers are welcomed, scheduled properly and looking to come back and stylists were motivated and organized. I've learned to be outgoing and give excellent customer service and employee service to keep our salon running properly. Management and co-workers all worked together beautifully as a Team and communication was clear and could always talk to and ask questions. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with both customers I developed for product sales and the stylists customers whom I looked forward to speaking on phone or in person and to see when they left JC Penney, they looked forward to coming back. The hardest part of my job was when there were a few times we could not make a customer happy and believe me, there were far a few."
good,"After working hard on a regular job, this job is great for a second part time job. Managers were very nice and understanding. We did work as a team."
good,My team was the best part about my job. We came from different backgrounds and were able to collaborate to get the best possible outcome. The projects that we worked on were invigorating and a great learning experience.
good,"Great place to work, it have its ups and down like any other company but the people and the customer are what really make this company shine."
good,The store was always clean and was a peaceful environment. The staff was caring and helpful. The job required you to communicate with management and other team members about what section needed servicing.
good,"I would go in early each morning and open the store. Then do signing for the entire store. I had 3 people working with me and my team did well and when checked once every 3 months by the corp. office, for the accuracy of signing, I was rated from 98% to 100%. I was also head of stock room. Worked about 7 days a week and was closing manager every Thurs. night. I would assign my workers sections of the store, they were responsible for. I learned how to manage people, to get the best out of them. There wasn't any real hard part of the job for me, because the store manager had enough confidence in me to let me get the work done I way I wanted to. I really enjoyed knowing, when the whole store was finished with signs and they were correct. I also worked the registers when needed and enjoyed talking with customers and helping them in any way I could."
good,sales
good,I liked working with the customers and helping them find what they were looking for.
good,I worked in the shoe department on hourly wage plus commission. Co-workers and management were very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part was memorizing multiple code numbers when bring customers multiple pairs of shoes to buy or try on. Most enjoyable part was the commission on all sales.

good,"During my time working at JCPenney, the staff and supervisors were nice and courteous and I enjoyed myself while working almost every day."
good,"A typical day at Jc Penney is coming in and strengthening before work. I've learned how to put orders into the computer when the are received off the trucks. I've also learned how to price merchandise before shipping to the stores. Another thing I have learned was order-filling , order-filling is a big weight in production we always had the most to do. If order-filling leak on there jobs then everyone in packing and receiving would be delayed and we would have O.T . The management is outstanding they make should everything is up to the policy and standards of the companies handbook. They also make sure nothing and no-one is hurt. My co-workers I have learned a lot about everyone I worked with. Everyone is hard working and self-motivated. The hardest part at work to is nothing everything i know and or have learned is absolutely easy. The most enjoyable part to me is just WORKING i love having and or making my own money !"
good,"Walking into work, a typical day would include checking out customers at the register, organizing clothes and merchandise, stocking, customer service, and being a friendly helping hand. I enjoyed working at J.C. Penney's. All my co-workers were very friendly and were always ready to give a helping hand. My management was great and really cared for the employees. I worked in the men's department and the most enjoyable part of my job is when someone really needed my help finding and picking out clothes for a special occasion. It made me feel great to help find that person exactly what they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated with the repetition of having to fold clothes over and over again right after you had organized them. I learned a lot here and glad that I had the opportunity to work and grow there."
good,"Cashing out customers with there purchases. organizing store, helping customers find what they need."
good,"Clock in, have our morning meeting, and get started on any stock that needed to be put out on the floor. I would also straighten, and clean out the fitting rooms, as well as greet customers. I signed them up for our Credit Card, as well as process returns, exchanges, and check out items. I enjoyed being busy all the time, and working with a majority of my co-workers. The hardest part was trying to sell the Credit Cards. I enjoyed helping customers put together items of clothes for prom, or other occasions."

Retail is a very hard and consuming job but what you put in it u will get back. We have a great management team and all wants to see growth in company and personal.
good,JC Penny had a great customer service training set for everyone to obtain.  Their concept was based around a pickle believe itor not but the basis was don't pass the pickle - meaning being a person not great to work with and pass an attitude of negativity to others.  JC Penny taught me what it's like to work in retail which is really hard work and deals with many customers daily.
good,"A typical day at work would be full of fun but yet productive, I learned a lot in the store to helping customer with their needs to learning new thing. Never have I thought that I would be working at the windows department but yet I learned a lot and fast. My workplace culture is very big and amazes me to learn from each person everyday. The hardest part of my job is dealing with tough situations at work, referring to customers but there is always a solution which is my main concern for a customer to get what they need but most importantly the enjoyable part of my job would be getting to know my associates and working with them everyday."
good,"typical day- fun and quick paced"
good,"The support team at JcPeneny was a great experience overall. Typically you work on one of three teams prior to the store opening for business. The truck team unloaded the truck, sorted merchandise and brought it to the sales floor. The signing team went around the store and changed the signage to line up with merchandise on every rack/table. Visual was the most enjoyable to work with changing signage based on promotions, dressing mannequins and general merchandising around the store. All positions are based on how busy the season was so hours would vary."
good,"it was great, I liked it, typically day was cleaning out dressing rooms, cashing customers out and stocking a few new merchandise. They all work together when you are running behind."
good,I love working for the company and the atmosphere is outstanding. I actually want to go to work there unlike my other jobs I have had in the past. I feel great coming home from working there.

good,"At Penny's you learn a lot! I learned how to work with a sense of urgency, listen to customers, be organized, and it really helped with my communication skills. Another thing about penny's is that it teaches you leadership. I absolutely loved this job! A day at work would be maintaining course standards by keeping your assigned area clean, or running the register. You have to be a very flexible person and take on any area if needed for a break coverage or etc. learning all departments as well as what is where is very important so you can assist people if needed. The only thing I didn't like was the low pay; However, this is a place I loved and made great friends that were like family!"
good,Typical workday is pleasant. I organize signs that I will need for the day and print extra signs if needed. I use a scanner that informs me of the upcoming price for any item within the department I'm working in. Reports are available for me to use as well which give more precise information and also show all the items that are on sale on a particular day for particular departments. I have learned to use both items carefully to ensure that all the merchandise on the floor has a proper signage communicating  the value or branding that supports company's promotional strategy. I also organize fixtures to ensure that signage and merchandise are compatible to one another. The most enjoyable part of the job the satisfaction of a job well done with not mistakes.
good,great customer service opportunity.Great management.Great environment and fun job.Love working with customers.The job was hard but i was enjoying doing it because i felt so great when i was assisting the customers.

good,"Great people just needs to be laid out better."
good,"During my nine years out of seventeen  at JC Penney, overall I had a good experience.  My typical day included lots of phone calls, orders large and small to enter into the system. I learned it takes a team to make everyone successful.  No one person can do it alone. My co-workers were a mixed group of women and men who challenged me but I challenged them as well.   The hardest part of the job was trying to reason with a customer who was upset if their order was wrong when it was installed. Sometimes you have to bite your tongue to keep your composure so the customer's comments don't get to you.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer calls you or emails you to tell you how much they love their new treatments.  The joy in their voice is enough to make you smile."
good,came in an assisted customers on the register and also on the floor. cleaned up the store and did customer service. It was a great environment to be in. it was great customer service and also the company was not only involved with the customers but they like to do things for the customers. which was a good thing

good,"I enjoyed my experience while being employed with JC Penny. A typical work day was very fast paced and fun at the same time. I learned many skills while working. i learned how to deal with customers, run the cash register and manage my time to complete tasks while working. The management was good. The managers made an effort to connect with there associates and know how they were fitting with the company. the hardest part of the job was completing all the tasks in my shift while helping customers. Customers could be very rude sometimes over little problems. I enjoyed working for this company. i enjoyed the working with customers the most. It made me happy when people were happy with our services and there products."
good,"family/customer oriented store, great work experience. Learned  a lot"
good,"I loved working for JCP Salon.  The entire salon team was focused on work, and got along very well.  Our manager was fantastic!  Very encouraging and understanding in all aspects of the work and home experience."

good,"Typical day at J.C. Penny was very fun & easy. Help guest with wardrobe decisions. I was able to learn a lot about retail in my short seasonal stay with the company!

I enjoyed management, they care so much about the employees & it shows!"
good,"My typical day would be "

good,"typical day consisted of assisting customers , handling all incoming calls , and at the right times socializing with fellow employees. my managers were amazing and worked with all employees as equals to achieve our tasks and goals."
good,"loved working with all the staff and never had any issues with anyone. If I needed a day off, the management helped make it happen."
good,this job makes it all worth it! the people work with are incredible I wouldnt trade these people for anything! they are very helpful and makes things real easy we work together as a team theres not one hard thing i can say about this job i guess once you get the hang of things everything come easy!
good,Good work enviroment with great people who seemed motivated everyday.
good,"I loved working with my manager he was very respectful,hardworking and funny. We really enjoyed working together as associates."
good,Jcpenny is a great retail store many young employees worked there for so long and it’s just a great opportunity to see how many different customers walks in everyday to see how young adults work hard.
good,I was temporary and did fine. Retail is not for me personally though. Lots of stocking shelves and organizing. Many different promotions and discounts that make cashier challenging.
good,It was a very amazing place to work I loved everything about the company...but I wish that they would take into consideration that emergencies and other things happen outside of work sometimes and if they could have worked with me during those times who knows I probably would still be there.
good,I loved being their receptionist. It was a great experience. Everyone was nice and welcoming but drama was a huge issue there. Its a good job to have if youre just looking for something quick.
good,I enjoyed working at Penney's. It was a good experience for me. I loved the managers and the environment. There is always something to do and I love how busy it kept me.
good,"Very good, especially for a minor. Very professional, welcoming, and a reasonable challenge. I was usually doing go backs and when things were very busy, I was asked to help assist with cashier. We were told to welcome customers, dress proper, be polite, and do our job. I worked often, however my hours did decrease over time."
good,"It is the perfect position for someone fresh out of high school or just looking for a few extra dollars, but it is definitely not enough to suppor a household."
good,Jcpenny  is definitely a great place to work . They give you many opportunities there. They really care about what going on with their workers and it’s a very fun and energetic place to work
good,"Fue bueno trabajar en JC penny, muy buenas personas y buen trabajo"
good,Great environment to take pace in. My typical days were working around the kids section and the men's section. I regularly fixed clothes by folding and putting it back on the display table.
good,They actually care for their workers and customers. They take care of their store. They’re always on something new and changing something around. It’s good because it always gives you something to do and it keeps the store looking neat and clean.
good,"JC Penney was an excellent company that trained all associates to manage associates, control expenses, improve profitability, give good customer service and develop as a manager.  As a manager you were accountable for all departments including all auditing and cash flow."
good,"Pricing is a cool job..Don't let em put you in a big department by yourself so you won't have rush doing stuff and won't have to alot of clearance by your self but the boss is so rude though,even to the customers and employees.."
good,You had to be on time an really fast remember where everything was an all the coupons they had. Had to deal with some very rude staff some times but overall it's a a good work place
good,An overall really nice place to work and time flys by. Just make sure you show up and on time to work everyday because 10 points is the limit. Manditory termination.
good,Staff was very . The manager was polite & was a great trainer. They help others when needed and they have discounts applied to the staff members. i will recommend this to a friends.
good,it was enjoyable full time position I had for 21 years is what I learned. The hardest part was to leave co workers after working with them for so may years
good,Good place to work at starting out in the job industry you have to be a very upbeat person that has very high customer service skills and be able to sell to the customer
good,I was a seasonal worker at JC Pennys and the staff there were very welcoming and ready to teach me everything i needed to know to service our customers. When we have a christmas party everyone was very warm and cheery. The hardest part of the job is just trying to remember where everything goes and trying to communicate with customers at times. Though the best part of it was really the people i worked with. Management were wonderful people too.
good,"Easy days easy work"
good,"During my time working at JcPenney I enjoyed everything i learned and got to work with. The people are greet, fun, energetic, and love to help others where they need it.. The only down fall is not having guaranteed hours."
good,"It was mainly about meeting the customers needs when it came down to it. Always making sure that all the customers left our store happy, and satisfied with our services to them."
good,the Co-workers were very nice and made me feel great about working at JCPenney. I like the pace there because there is always something to do. I learned how to always stay busy and get things done on time. The hardest part of the job are complaining customers.
good,"I enjoy my job,  just need to work more.  I plan to keep working at Penney's after finding a second job. Great benefits, flexible schedules & nice employee discount."
good,"if youre looking for a routine comfortable safe job, go with JCPenny, nothing says easy and comfortable then standing for 7 hours doing the same thing over and over and over again."
good,Assist customers and maintain sells floor. Approach browsing customers and initiate conversations to determine buy preference/ follow latest trends in oreder to provide up to update informmation
good,I was there to working every thing. Managing the dressing rooms and doing the best that I could so we could have satisfied customers.
good,"I enjoyed face to face contact with customers helping them find what they were looking for. I enjoyed working with all the associates, very nice place to work."
good,JCPenneys was my favorite job. The overall environment was very chaotic&fun& loved all the challenges. Training was not stressful because management would assist us if we needed it and &let us go at our own pace even though I'm a fast learner. I would come in &clock-in & go to my assigned section and check dressing rooms and start organizing clothes on show-floor and make sure all items are spaced properly. Then if it was busy up at the registers I'd go up to the front and sign into a register and greet the customers and greet them and ask them if they found everything they were looking for.
good,I like socializing with co-workers while working.  JC Penney is a nice somewhat quiet working environment.  The managers there are nice people.
good,answering customer calls based on orders. Placing and tracking their orders and inputting customer information into the data base
good,The training required to become a better costumer service associate helped me learn what to do and not to do to assist customers
good,"I worked at Jcpenny for about a month for back to school season it was a very good first job and all my coworkers were so nice. I started out doing fitting rooms, than did recovery and the cash register."
good,"Very well organized company.all employees were very polite, managers were very encouraging"
good,"i can write for days on how much I loved working at J.C Penneys but if I was to do that then I be giving myself carpal tunnel. I learned more in 6-7 months then i ever did at Macys. I loved the environment, i loved my management there, i loved the small things we did to help our customers find exactly what they needed no matter what, and most importantly i loved the fact my work never went overlooked or under looked. my co-workers were amazing! i always had so much fun doing the truck and it had a simple process to it as well! The inventory for anything in the store was simple and easy to do. I enjoyed that even if i wasnt put on the truck in the morning i was working in replenishment and always interacting with customers, i love helping them to their car and i loved the fact they loved me helping them! I know for a fact they taught me here at J.C. Penneys that no matter what service you could provide you always want to provide the best and thats making sure the customer is satisfied at the end of the day"
good,assit customer at check out desk
good,"Was not a good place to work , unprofessional , management needs to be improved , the job only really cares about the money and not its employees and they dont give very many hours"
good,"I only shortly worked at JCPenny's for the modeling. Other than that I wouldn't know exactly how it is to work there. I'm sure its a comfy job from what I experienced, id assume it'd be nice."
good,My job there was boring and there is no loyalty from that company .That atmosphere is not for me. Its a fast pace job. Which i like but no permanant position
good,typical day you deal w/people from all walks of life. No job security
good,I answered phone calls from customers whom wanted to place catalog orders through JC Penny's call center.
good,"Coworkers are great and understanding. A little ""clicky"", I asked for nights and weekends. They were scheduling me during the day. I was hired to work in jewelry and ended up in shoes."
good,"A typical day was setting up shoe dept. sale displays, and selling shoes. I learned how to work a cash register, how to set up displays, ask customers to fill out JCP CC. Management was selective with their employees, i.e., advancement, etc. My co-workers were wonderful, I still keep in touch. There really wasn't a hard part of the job - it was fun. My co-workers and the job were the most enjoyable."
good,"Nice place to work if you live near by.  I lived out of town and it was a hassle getting to work 6 days in a row. If it was slow I was only making min wage, not worth my time and money."
good,"work and balance life good benefits good, advancement could be better. management very good job culture good"
good,"Typical day would be to be on your table on time, everyone with a nice clean are and production was a must."
good,I really enjoyed this job it was a fun environment with great people everyone was so interesting customers a d co workers was laid back but serious when needed to be like tax free weekend!
good,Only worked in the store temporary assignment. Nice place to work but wasn't there long enough to really give any accuracy for employees.
good,"The team members were hard to get along with. things never got done on time or in the right order. Example .. if my department was clean and ready for close but others weren't we had to go help, which is fine but not every single day or for hours after close."
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in, making sure the store is neat and the drawers have the right amount of money. Management was fine but my manager and I had some disagreements but her demeanor overall is somewhat pleasant. The environment is good, and family oriented. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince the manager to let me be a main cashier instead of stocking shelves all day long. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the kid's faces light up when they stepped off the elevator ( I worked in the children's department)."
good,"Every job has its days! Loved the stock shift and the floor schedule! Most importantly loved my customers, staff and store! Management needs help and many people quick! Wouldn't go back for $20 an hour!!!! Long hours, no time for school or family!"
good,"Making sure store is clean and pickup things from the floor and put up"
good,"Management is okay , other then that great company .. it was fun because of the friends I made there .. I didn't get hours on weekdays because of school so the weekends I got a lot but not enough"
good,"I liked working stockroom but it was hard very fast pace, had to ask for my breaks they never were offered, the people you work with are always in a hurry to leave they rather not take a break."
good,I don’t have much to comment on. Some girls worked harder than others but it wasn’t noticed. Management was never around. The hours were long and we were given little to no direction.
good,"A fun place to work. Job environment can go either way. If your one of the ""popular"" workers then your day will go smoothly. If not, then your day is miserable. If you have any medical problems, the management will stiffen up and fire you due to inflexibility."
good,J.C. Penney Owasso was seriously lacking leadership. I had a great working relationship with my coworkers.
good,The work day with this company was very different. The staff was very stand offish. I learned that u have to stay very focused on your job and task at this company. Management wasn't that great. I didn't really talk with any co-worker's. The hardest part of the job was trying to get alone in a town i was new too. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer's. they we're friendly.
good,"Fun place to work, enjoyed every minute spent there. Though if ou do not promote or offer services they will not keep you. Very slow place to work unless you are running the register or customer service."
good,"Learned allot, won different challenges between coworkers.  Enjoyable.  Loved the customers. Working in different departments was a challenge.  But the challenge is what I loved."
good,My position at JC Penneys was retail sales clerk. I assisted customers with all aspects of their shopping experience from finding the clothing to cashing out their purchases. I was required to keep fitting rooms clear of clothing and make sure all clothing was placed back in their original area in the department.
good,"Being located in  a small pretty much abandoned mall doesn't help us build our clientele. No clientele, less hours, less pay. Days are slow and you start lacking drive."
good,"management fine, most enjoyable is the customers, hard part about job is not a reliable hours, not consistant with hours, only partime no full time employment, not very good benefits."
good,"I enjoyed the work that I did but because of extensive training and experience at other upscale salons it made it difficult for me to be in an associate position when I had enough training and had taken enough Psychology classes to be in a leadership position."
good,This is where I first learned about customer service and loved to work behind the register and greet people.
good,stocking shelves with the correct shoe size and helping customers with their needs in the shoe department.
good,"Everyday i would go to work and it was always a minimum of 20 people that came in the store daily. Management been there for over 20+ years and was not planning on retirement, so it was never a place where you could advance."
good,"It is a great work environment, great people to work with, and the  walk-ins are minimal, because of the location of the salon. I love doing hair services and meeting new people..I just wish pay rate was better.."
good,I worked during the holiday season so it was very busy. I liked the job itself but the managers were very pushy and everyone was in a clique of some kind
good,"What can I say it was a part time job, My coworkers were great and my managers were pretty good to the only problem was that to guidelines for lower employees did now seem to apply to managers as I saw many in places they weren't allowed and other things."
good,Love the one on one with people. Being up and moving around and selling products to people to help them feel better about themselves. Learning new things as they change with the times
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for JCP! I fell in love with the company and am a loyal customer to this day! I did not particularly like the small town I worked in, which effected the job culture at this store."
good,"Finding it harder to stay busy , Lack of team work there is a great deal of unprofessionalism, trying to make customers understand rebook becomes harder, trying to maintain clean environment having to figure out why things don't flow well in salon, management says the care and are willing to help I feel so much for that and back to free fall ! do as we please attitude,"
good,"large workload,crazy scheduling,and low pay, management not very friendly,store environment very bad for employees with allergy problems"
good,Jcpenny was a fun place to work. The only part of the job i did not like was having to work every weekend and the low pay. The atmosphere was fun and it was exciting to be able to interact with so many people on a daily basis.
good,"process several transactions including exchanges & refunds, open credit applications for customers, reshop items back to the racks, fold clothing, clean fitting rooms etc. my co workers was very friendly & fun to work with, there really wasnt a hard part of the job besides being in the store late at night until everything is neat & put in its proper place, I really enjoyed working with the public , the only thing i disliked about the job was not enough hours scheduled & needed fulltime employment."
good,After me being there for 3 years new managers came in and got rid of associates and brought in new ones from their old stores I got wrongfully terminated.
good,"I would be there for the Black Friday and it just wasn’t for me, and so un organized. The work pace is great for a retired person since everyone takes there sweet Time , lol I’m more of a fast paced worker , but here , they want you to work slow enough so that you can answer customers questions and have small conversations between folding cloths . It was t for me ., I like to do my work and be done,."
good,"I enjoyed working part time for JC Penney.  I received their discount card and made $9.50 an hour.  I attended 1 training session.  I look forward to more training on the job.    In the meantime Im looking for other opportunities and I am increasing awareness of my availability."
good,"Was a good company in the late 80's.  Enjoyed the 6 weeks vacation I received and the jobs I did was rewarding and challenging at times,  It paid the bills and worked there long enough to retire."
good,I found JCP to be employee friendly and work was pleasurable.  I liked the LOD's I worked with and enjoyed assisting customers in their purchases.  It became a very different environment once the liquidators took over in June.
good,At JCPenney  I enjoyed working with jewelry and helping my customers with finding the best they are looking for it was very busy and that was good for sells
good,"-learning new products and being able to sell"
good,"worked with people showing jewelry"
good,"Typical day involved providing great customer service, helping with choices, cash register, trying to sell new accounts , keeping stock  orderly, keeping dressing rooms clean and restocking clothing.  Managers were helpful.  Co-workers did their part.  "
good,"Long season hours. Very boring, it was a job and I have an appreciation for the sales field. Not physically demanding at all."
good,I loved working here. I had to re price all of the merchandise in the clothing and home store.
good,The Penney company used to be a great company to work for.  Due to the recent changes in the past couple of years things have become very tough.
good,"A typical day at work starts with a morning meeting about shrinkage and safety. Learning new tactics to prevent theft is a usual starter. My supervisor is dedicated to ensuring that we remain at the top in order to do so we get the reps to help us with shrinkage as well as other important factors that will help us meet our goals. In return we offer them incentives such as gifts/ gift cards, these keep them enthusiastic about helping us meet the requirements needed to prevent theft/ shrinkage throughout the store.  The hardest part of my job is doing the internals. This means that a theft has occurred within the store from one of our service reps. I find it hard to believe that that much theft can come from within. On the other hand the easiest part is being able to communicate with everyone without and had feelings while maintain the safety of our customers as well as our reps. I get a chance to say i prevented someone from being harmed or theft."
good,Didn't get promised hours or promotions. You have a lot more tasks required than what you were hired for. Management were not very helpful. Co-Workers were excellient and felt like a second family.
good,"It was fast paced and it was a new experience for me.  I learned the daily functions of the store.  I learned my tasks suck as customer service such as assisted customers ran cash register, zoned area for cleanliness, and other duties as assigned."
good,"They are a great place to work, the only thing I saw as a bad thing was that the employees are very based on seniority and not judged based on ability and performance"
good,"Repetitive, boring, no room for advancement, low pay, Didn't like the job"
good,its a strict place for people who hate courprate. my boss was amazing and did everythign she could to keep me happy and there but in the long run the upper management there is not the best and they need to get a new store manager.
good,Typical day was putting customers first
good,"my 1st and only job not working with the public and I liked it, we had a great team hours were a little tough, and I hated the winters (was in cold climate at the time)"
good,Clean and safe environment but does not satisfy my financial needs.
good,My job duties were customer service cashier hanger pick ups greeting customers and cleaning assisting customers checking up on them making sure if they need help.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working with this company is being able to help people find what they need on a daily basis, Meeting new people and seeing well known customers every other day. I also like that there is  always something to do and always something new to learn."
good,I enjoyed going to Jcpenny it was like a family atmosphere. the customers were great and the total atmosphere is very pleasant I worked on the operations team and it was fast pace but fun.
good,Very productive & enjoyable.I love meeting so many differnt people in the workplace.Helping others has always been a joy to me.I meet people with so many different personality's.I had to learn to keep calm even though there were times when I need the customer wasn't right.The hardest part was keeping a smile on my face in difficult times.The enjoyable times were when people would smile & say thank you for taking time out to service me.
good,The company is a good one to work for but there is mismanagement going on at the local store that makes working there unpleasant.  Employees were made to feel as if they didn't matter and no consideration was taken for them having personal lives.  The company has a great Golden Rule and pays fairly based on previous employment.  There are many instances for upward movement if you show promise and are a hard worker.
good,"I enjoyed the company and what the the Company stood for. The culture was amazing family oriented from the beginning up until changes  that occur at the store at the end. The hardest part of the job was resigning and the most enjoyable part was the Loyalty from the Company. I learned to manage with structure, respect and passion."
good,"Enter into secured cash office, open the stores financial operation systems, Epicore. Sort money collected from the previous days cash sales, replenish petty cash tills, make the cash and checks deposits, count all money and complete safe reconciliation, inputting figures into systems during each procedure. Run reports in Epicore and then in Oracle. Deliver till to floor and do other task related functions such as marking clearance item throughout the store. Creating sets, signing, and merchandising."
good,get there on time get work done then go home. I learned to adapt to any new work experience being always around helping co workers as well interacting with other cultures was great. hardest part of my job was leaving late for 2 hours of sleep to be back to work on time in am. my manager was excellent. most enjoyable part of work the discounts
good,"I enjoy working at JC Penney, in the photo department. I love to interact with the customers, mostly the ones with children who come in to get photos taken. I also enjoy reviewing the photos when customers come in to pick them up. Seeing the look of joy on their faces makes my day. I enjoy working in a fast paced environment, and do well under pressure. I am great at multi tasking, such as answering the phone and booking appointments at the same time. My manager is a fun loving, positive person who I enjoy learning from."
good,If you are fresh out of school or you are interested in continuing education this is a good job to check out. You start off behind the desk then you graduate on to the floor all while they provide some refresher classes
good,"Great management."
good,At JCpenney Opticial I would be assisting potential patients at affording their own glasses. If ready; appointments are scheduled or glasses are placed to order.
good,"Retail Sales can be stressful and demanding. Skill and patience helps. Being knowledgeable of your department and product is a plus."
good,At the studio it was fun taking pictures of families and individuals.  You never knew what your next picture would be taken of.  There were creative people to work with.
good,Just a fast paced cashier environment. Was my first job so i didn't really know much. did not take the time to show me what i was supposed to be doing.
good,Was there for four years but needed something new My manager was really cool but most others were horrible. The store manager up and left out of nowhere in between moving one store into another and that was very unprofessional.
good,"It is not a terrible place to work, I rather enjoyed working here especially in the kids department (was working on getting down to Sephora), however at the store I worked at the management was terrible, as well as the General Manager. This does not mean I am not willing to work at another JCPenney elsewhere, because I would love to. It was a fun environment with the right management."
good,Good sources I enjoyed the people and working there.I was sorry it was only a temporary position would have liked to make a career there. They were willing to help me get more hours than scheduled and willing to work with my schedule.
good,"I liked it but had to leave the job because they wouldn't give me a week off due to me going out of state. Over all it's a good place , busy most of the times mainly weekends"
good,"People there are nice, time goes by quickly and is an enjoyable environment to work in.must be able to deal with hectic days/ hours during holiday season but overall its nice."
good,"neatly dressed co-workers, very friendly, and always welling to help others.  Great team work, and have a great discount."
good,"I was given my 4.5 hours to work 3 to 4 times a week,  I would come in and clock in, then go down stairs to the Jewelry Department and get my keys from the lock door sign my key out, then go and work behind 3 very large glass cases areas, where all the Diamonds, gold, silver, cubic zirconia rings, watches, were and help customers with their needs and wants.  I learned a new transaction daily, my co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was to keep the costume jewelry department, that was to the side of the main jewelry cases neat, they were a very big mess at the end of every shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers, and finding what they wanted by purchase, that made me feel good inside, cause they were happy with me.  The customer left the store happy and content with their purchase."
good,J.C.Penneys was a clean and friendly place to work.  I enjoyed working and helping the customers with their purchases. The individuals I worked with were well qualified and friendly people.  I was able to improve my customer service abilities and able to meet a variety of people.
good,Fast paced family oriented company. Great company to work for. The discount is definitely a plus being an associate. Flexible hours as needed for your schedule.
good,"Great working with everyone there.  Wish they had benefits for employee paid time off, vacation pay.  I enjoy working with everyone there, but everyone works differently so wish there was more team effort"
good,"Working here was very helpful because it was close and didn't use much gas, but sadly that is all the company was good for. Its going downhill and I can see that by just working here. Looking to climb the ladder and find a more important job."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of sorting merchandise, prepping it for shipment. keeping work area clean and free of debris, Training new hires on the packing department, assisting others when in need. hardest part of the job would be the consolidated merchandise and sometimes lack of communication, and planning."
good,I actually enjoyed working for this company. I got alone with the other associates and they were patient and helpful through out my training process.
good,A typical day at work would be very laid back and relaxed. I learned the importance of great customer service. My co workers were very nice. The thing that I enjoyed most about the job would have to be the customer service. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was dealing with the pay. Good Management.
good,jcpenney is a professional place to work. everyone knows their tasks and duties and make sure it is completed at the end of each day.
good,"I had to count my drawer when I started my shift and even after my shift was over. I had to help my customer find different items and if we didn't have it in stock then I would have to order it form off online. On the days that it would slow I would have to restock all the items that needed to be restock. "
good,mostly high school part time and college kids... not a job for me
good,an a very dedicate individual who loves to work hard. I set daily personal goals for myself to achieve while am at work. The hardest part of my day is trying to make sure that I have achieved all of my daily goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is to know that I have satisfied and met all of my customers needs.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney was helping customers find their needs. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my position is constant interaction with people,associates and customers, coaching in the moment, problem solving, constant need to learn new products. I love challenges as well to motivate and inspire to reach companies goals. The working hours can sometimes prevent me from having a normal family life, attend celebrations and events so I took extra effort to organize that at work. My co-workers became my second family."
good,Wish I could have worked here longer but the position was a temporary one for the holiday.
good,need more client and training. staff needs to be more professional
good,"A very reliable position. They were always hiring for the holidays, and always took me back when I returned home from college on winter breaks and even after I had completed college and just wanted another part time job for the holidays. They were very kind people to work for."
good,"I sold shoes in the shoe department we made commission so you have to make sure you greet and help everyone you see. The managers are pretty good and share the work loads like stocking, doing displays."
good,Fast paced and goal oriented. Learned a lot about creating my own clientele.
good,I loved my job at JC Penney. Unloading and prepping the truck was one of my favorite jobs I have ever done in my retail experience but there was no advancement opportunity in that department because they only had one direct supervisor and there were no open positions in any other stores. I was offered the job as the merchandise execution lead and I took it as it was a great opportunity for growth. I loved the people I worked with. Being able to come up with a plan and meet sales goals and make the customers happy as well as my team of associates kept me going from day to day. Work was always a pleasurable experience
good,Nice place to work. Suppotive management. Co workers are pleasent.
good,Hours are ok. Hours are great during peak time. Pay is good. Give out rasies every year. employee apperciation dinners. Easy to move up in managment sopts.
good,overall good company with good benefits and culture.  able to be flexible to meet needs and training.  fun environment and great discount corporate office
good,"JCPenny was a good location to learn the basic skills needed in a more serious career. As an employee you become familiar with customer service skills, coworker interaction, and opportunities to show your commitment."
good,"Productive and fun to work environment! "
good,I think the only problems are the managers. They give 5 minutes of trading and expect 10 hours of results from new associates. They are rude and put their “ power “ into everything including threats.
good,Very good management. Very good job . Flexible schedule. Co workers were very friendly. The work environment is always positive. Very few complaints . A very easy Job
good,I would suggest you are comfortable getting into very confusing situations but remember to always feel free to ask for help. Always remember to ask plenty of questions
good,The people make the job it’s a great place to work just be weary about favoritisms for managers store managers usually switch every year so if you don’t get along with yours don’t worry they’ll be transferred out
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney, the employees were all like family. However, I did not think the pay was fair and management was not fair. Overall, it is a good job to start off with."
good,"It’s a nice job when you’re in high school or want something as a part-time , the environment it’s really nice and the team is awesome. I recommend this job"
good,"There people were great, the schedule was wondering consider having no kids at the time. I would definitely recommend working at JCPenney to all my friends and if I could I wouldn't mind doing that job as a part-time job just for fun."
good,"Great place to work if a person needs part time work, I truly enjoyed working at JC Penney but not enough hours.  Everyone worked hard & worked as a team."
good,Was only part time never wanted to leave but started to conflict with full time job. Wish I could have stayed. Worked with great people who are still friends with
good,Didn’t enjoy working. Loved the people but I couldn’t stand the management and the way things were ran. Very confusing starting out. Won’t be going back

good,I like working at jcp but need insurance benefits and need full time. I loved working with the public and helping them find what they r looking for in the store. I enjoyed working with my teammates and helping them meet their goals. I have met a lot of very nice people being a cashier at Jcp. I enjoyed the challenges of getting the credit applications that I needed to get everyday and seeing my name mentioned on customer surveys. I am definitely a people person!!!
good,No stress. Took calls from people that wanted to order from the catalog. Pay wasn't to bad for the time but hours varied from week to week. Work environment  was relaxed and  the people were a pleasure to work with.

good,Overall the company is not a bad place to work for. I loved getting to see new faces everyday. I love working with the public. Management was friendly and easy to talk to.
good,If you are single or have a small family with older children; this is the place to work.  It was a very easy job and almost all of the employees there got a long great with each other.  The departments work together to help each other out.  It was exhausting at times but it was fun too.
good,Its retail so the pay isn't great but its a fun work environment I would suggest to students. I wouldn't make a career here but its an ok place to work while looking for another job.
good,"I learned how to do many different things in a typical days work. Mostly how to work with customers and find their needs, how i can make their day a better one by just smiling and helping them find what they need. Management is great here they take the time to show you how things get done and they show how much they care by putting time int what they do. The hardest part of the job was not being able to work full time. My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with people from various group ages."
good,I would go in a start recovery in a certain department and I would help customers along with it. I would put up displays and merchandise up.
good,Company is working hard at growing the company. coming back from poor direction from the previous leader.

good,"- Easy Work"
good,pay scale too low no room for adavancement loved the co workers and the position
good,"unload the freight in a timely fashion, by working as a team player/team member. What I've learned is that by being busy is to be organized on the job and keeping the area clean. The management, would check in on the stock room personnel to see if there anything to be taken out to the sales floor. They will help you with something heavy and also help you to get it onto the sales floor. The hardest part of the job to keep safety in mind when it comes to the cleaning the area and remembering to breaking down the boxes throughout the entire time while on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job you would leave there while it is still daylight outside, and the next day to do it all over again!"
good,This job does not offer enough hours even if i ask for time on the schedule. I've learned good customer service skills.
good,"It was very fast paced because calls were coming through constantly, but calling the same customer more than twice a day was annoying not just for customers, but for representatives as we//."
good,"JCP is a great, professional business. There are many ups, and many downs to the job. Cons, there is no room for advancement as the business goes under in a tough economy. I perform a lot of managerial tasks for minimum wage. I have workerd for the company for two years without an employment evaluation, or a raise. Some of the management staff at our store is inappropriate without any discipline. However the other 90 percent of the managers are phenomenal. Pros, the business is very flexible with outside issues and circumstances. Overall the business is good to work for."
good,"open and close of office, opening of front office area, inventory of eye wear material, learned all aspects of insurance filing and copayemnts."
good,This was my first job out of high school. I was hired as a stocking associate and quickly advanced to Supervisor. Loved the job and the people I worked with. It was a little crazy around the holidays. But because we had to work during some holidays the manager would close the store and let us shop. He was a great guy. But the store closed and the manager moved to another store.
good,"I liked it. The job was a very good job that I have no complaints about. The part about the job I disliked the most would have to be how they expect us to sell those JCPenney cards, and will keep hounding every second to sell them."
good,"I love JCPenney as a place to shop, but their recent marketing changes made it hard to be an employee. We were often kept in the dark about a lot of the upcoming changes and events, which made it difficult to explain all of the new exciting changes that the company was making to the loyal customers."
good,A day would consists of answering phone calls. Placing orders and or fixing a previous order. I learned that my voice can determine if a call is going to be good or bad. management was never physically around they were always listening on the calls though. The co-workers were very helpful to the newer employees. There was not really any hard parts to the job. The most enjoyable part was when a customer gave you a good word to the management and you got rewarded.
good,I basically worked cashier as well as the catalog dept. I was hired for that dept and it no longer exists. I learned a lot about the retail scene and I think it is fun. It is very fast paced and the day goes by fast. You have the occasional problem customer but for the most part it flows smoothly. The co-workers were cool and polite. They offered way to much back story on themselves but other than that it was good. The hardest part of the job was working that hard for the pay. the most enjoyable part was being around people. I like to talk and I got to do a lot of it at this job.
good,"A family atmosphere among peers, During the years I worked for JCPenney, I could learn and develop various skills that helped me to improve my skills."

good,"Jc penny was definitely nice and easy going. The people were all very nice , i never really met anyone rude or mean there. My co.workers were pretty awesome too."
good,"A typical day at work would be nice place to work,what i learned was how to deal with the customers,management would be good management,good co-workers,the hardest part would be making sure the customers are happy at all times and the enjoyable part would be working with the staff."

good,JCPenney's is a good starting job. The company is very team oriented which makes working there easy because the environment is nice. In my particular JCP store it was nearly impossible to advance even with a bachelor's degree. The hardest part of the job is simply feeling as though you will be stuck in the same position no matter how great you perform.

good,Overall review on JCPENNY is that it’s very casual and a good work experience for somebody who wants to work retail/salesman. It teaches you how to interact with your customers.
good,I was a holiday temp. I had a great time. I stocked shelves and tables. Person on the floor wasn't happy with the way i was told to cram them on racks.person in charge of my department made me put too many on the racks. They looked bad and some fell in the floor.

At least 1-4 sales clerks to assist with putting away clothing and, 1-2 people on registers (dependent upon if the store is busy or not). "

good,"Working for JCPenney is a good job to have as a highschool or college student, or as a person who is retired. The hours are flexible to an extent. Credit is exceedingly pushed by management. The management lacks proper communication. The work environment is good. Most of the employee's get along. The hardest part of the job is when there is no communication between managers and each manager is saying different things. Another hard part is when it gets too busy and there is no consistency. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the right team members on certain shift. Another enjoyable part is that the company sometimes buys food for the break room, mostly around holidays or if the credit goal was made."
good,"The JCP company itself was a good employer. They did need to"
good,Hard working environment there’s no lacking on the job plus JcPenny is going bankrupt so they not go keep working you if you not doing your best job with them
good,A normal day at JC Penney is being there on time and do warm up activity before working. Then we would start work making sure to work safely and meet deadline with the orders. Management was great and helpful. Working with different people and becoming a team was very nice. It's a tough job physically and meeting deadlines is a must.  But environment was friendly and we worked hard as a team. Thank you JC Penney for the seasonal opportunity!
good,Unable to review issues obtained after becoming training supervisor.  Scheduling done incorrectly.  I was going to school to gain my associates degree.
good,Didn’t really let me leave when my grandfather had passed away keep getting mad because i called that day. When they got mad at me for calling in. Which is dumb.
good,"Nice place to work at, some employees are unfair and don’t divide work equally. Managers are nice and helpful. Would recommend to young people since it pays good."
good,A seasonal job that kept track of my attendance during a trial period of 90 days and decided  off of your attendance whether you should be hired which didn't work for me.
good,you will surely get the hours during the holidays and training that is required before you go to the floor. the company believes in great customer service
good,"fast working,always something to do to stay active new things to learn. Always working in teams. extra money in CAPS if needed during the week or around holidays."
good,"I’ve been with JCP for almost a year. I’ve made some really good friends, and the management team is so considerate and neighborly. It’s a job that is pretty simple, but it takes practice to learn. "
good,"Learned management skills, supervising, visual merchandising, stock and inventory, ordering custom blinds, draperies, selling ready made curtains and hardware for the clients, including shutters by Bali brand. I also sold mattress and appliances, with home accessories."
good,This was a great place to begin my cosmetology career.  They were really supportive of me being right out of school. They paired me with a mentor and helped me with clientele building techniques.  It was awesome.  Cons to working at Penney's was stocking shelves and down time. I didn't go to cosmetology school to do retail sales work.  I just wanted to do hair and lots of it! JC Penney get the butts in the seats!
good,"Great place to work, hard to get on full time, you always have to work weekends but they do offer great discounts for employees. Pay is low and initially thats why I left."
good,"When merchandise would come in I would place it on the sales floor, and organize by size, color, and style. JCP was very educational for me as I learned how to size customers and mark items if they needed alterations. My first 13 years with JCP was spent at the Benton Harbor, MI store, which was quite small and co-workers were close knit. The year I spend at the Mishawaka, IN store was a great experience as I was able to spend more time in the clothing area, as opposed to spending lots of time at the cash register while at the Benton Harbor store.  Because Mishawaka employed nearly 100 employees I never did get to know names of some of the staff. During my nearly 15 years at JCP it was very enjoyable to interact with the guests."
good,"This is a very supportive workplace and we continually have educational learning videos to help us provide the best customer service that we can for our customers."
good,JCPenney is a nice place to work. The associates there makes it easier to catch up to the speed there with ringing up the customers and how everything works there. JCPenney has flexibile hours and they’ll work with whatever your comfortable with.
good,"Over all, I learned a lot. From being on time, to get use on flexible hours of duty. To be able to adjust for other employee (not only for yourself) and especially, I learned a lot in this field of business."
good,"Managers and coworkers are awesome, everyone is very nice and are pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who walk in crabby."
good,"JCPenney is an amazing company to work for, as their team work and store morale is excellent. It is a very friendly place to work, with the only downside of little to no room for growth."
good,"a typical day at work was wonderful everyone was so welcoming and warm, our team was like a family, everyone helped everyone so no one failed."
good,I was very happy that they were able to have a flexible schedule.  Very nice management. Training was paid and at good hours. Nikce to work with the public.
good,"I worked here as a seasonal employee during Christmas Season. I would come in for my shift, check deployment chart to see where I would be and then begin straightening up, helping customers, or putting up new displays or products."
good,"Fun environment. Always something to do. It was very fast paced. Management is good. They just do not provide good hours. Ive learned how to deal with customers,"
good,"Nice place to work.  If you are a people person, you will love working in this friendly, customer service oriented company.  There are opportunities to be had, you just need to work hard to achieve those opportunities."
good,I've had about 6 jobs throughout my life and this has been my second favorite. Disney World coming in first place. Everyone I worked with was great & so was the management.
good,I would recommend for those looking for a job that pays a little more than minimum wage. I also loved it because they took their time to make sure we were trained well.
good,Working here during high school was amazing. The different things that your exposed to far as dealing with the public is a experience. The job is very easy to learn as well.
good,"Helping customers shop and working the register in your department"
good,I loved working at the retail part of the store and dealing with customers. The manager was firm but fair. I hardly ever saw my supervisor. I loved helping people find things they were looking for. But the holiday season people get very pushy and rude. More the customers than the employees. The employees were all very nice.
good,Working at J.C. Penney was always fun have lots of friends from the years I worked there.they offer a associate discount on every thing you buy very flexible on schedule meeting new friends and making friends with the customer where the best part of the job
good,Loved working there it was a great job I would lo e to go back. There are a lot of great people that work there great work environment.its a clean and safe place to work they work with you if you need help.
good,I worked with the best boss and best crew ever. I really missed the people I came into contact with on a daily. During the holidays we were treated to catered meals. Time off request was easy to ask for. They really looked out for their staff.
good,This was my first experience working in the construction business. Start out as the coordinator for the company in remodeling south Florida stores worked my way real quick to supervising carpenter union workers through their rep.
good,"I love the management and it is a very nice work place. The hardest part is having to loose my job. I love the work, and the place.A typical day starts out really busy, customers lining up at the front of the door. Then it gradually gets slower and less crazy. It is easy, yet challenging at the same time. I really love it though."
good,"Easy start up job, fast track to working with customers.  Learn some basic customer service skills.  Learn to priororitize your time and work with others."
good,Most of my duties wasnt over scene so you have to be able to work without instructions...i learned my job through trial and error and from what i can learn from fellow co workers
good,I help out customer to find out they are looking for. Helping out the manager to do plan set. Answering telephone. Helping out the Customer to Open a Jcpenney Card.
good,I worked hard for these people but I did not get the treatment I deserved as far as my rights being treated fairly.  The management was very unfair.  I stocked merchandise for them.
good,"Hours not paid , sometimes they only give you three days to work in a week or just one day during the whole week . Sometimes they switch you hours and days to much instead of being stable with your work schedule"
good,Great place to work challenging work-management was supportive but little contact-great working environment-enjoyed other installers-fun working with decorators
good,"I was employed as a customer service sales assistant."
good,Pay was extremly low co workers was great mamangment was always helpful they ended up closing down that was the hardest part everyone being without a jod or re locating
good,the coworkers where always fun and i would have stayed had i not moved but the advancement sucks the customers are mean and the credit card goals are ridiculous and they force to basically shove it down customers throats and its minimum wage.....
good,"JcPenney's was a very slow pace but held a fare amount of work. At JcPenney's I learned that working by yourself, or with a limited staff, can be stressful. Your work never goes unnoticed. But the amount of work thrown towards you everyday is difficult to say the less. The management staff was amazing and made it excited to go into work. They were understanding to the fact that their workers do have lives outside of work and was truly and honestly understanding. My coworkers made you feel like apart of the team regardless if you been there 2 minutes or 20 years. The hardest part about working retail is around the holidays and you become short staffed. Besides that  I loved everything about working at JcPenney's."
good,I Worked at jcpennys for 5 years and I enjoyed every bit of it because I had a great time meeting people and talking to them face to face and helping them find clothing for what they were needing clothing for. The management was excellent there and they were willing to help you with anything that you needed help with and ready to teach you new things. I enjoyed my co workers because we worked together and we got along very well. There was really nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to talk to customer and helping them because they were happy when you were able to get them what they needed; I really enjoyed helping others because I was able to engage with them.
good,Great place to work.   They will allow you to work usually the hours that work for you.  I think this is a great place to work if you are a student or needing part time work only.
good,"good management- they get a long great with the employees and the customers, they try their best to find the time off that employees request."
good,Monday thru Friday loading the truck first thing in the morning. Making sure all the orders are on the truck. My co-worker was very experienced and had been with the company for a long time. I learned my way around Kansas during deliveries. Being outside was enjoyable.
good,A work day consist of doing the cashier and maintaining order in the showroom. I learned how to proficiently work with other co-workers and managers. The management was very professional. The co-workers were nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was to work at a fast pace and making the customers happy.
good,great company to work for to get started on your management career. You get to work with all kinds of people from different backgrounds who are fun to work with. everyday is different and the workload can be a lot some of the days.
good,"While working here, I answered incoming phone calls from clients and scheduled appointments.  I scheduled stylest and receptionists schedules, and took care of any customer complaints if the Salon Manager was not available."
good,I showed jewelry to customers. I really enjoyed working with them. The management there was great they rewarded you for a well done job. They taught you to work in all departments when they saw you where interested in learning more. It was really a great job.
good,"I loved working at JCP because I loved learning the job. I was a Window Expert.  I made sure that their was plenty of products out for sale, the displays where up properly, all sale signs were properly displayed, clearance items where labeld and placed in their designated area, each type of window treament was gather in the proper space and the computer for custom orders was up and running. "

good,"Working in Jcpenny's was very nice, generally managers were fair, and coworkers were nice and easy to work with. The atmosphere of Jcpenny's is very peaceful and calming because of the style, the music, and cleanliness of the place. At Jcpenny's we used modern equipment that made the process of returns, check-outs, exchanges,  paying bills, etc faster and easier. Managers were fair and caring which is a huge deal in terms of having a good work experience. The hardest part of the job was busy days keeping up with maintaining the store appearance and working with customers, but my coworkers and I would work together and accomplish our goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and seeing them leave happy and well taken care of."
good,"Great work environment. Great employees. Fun place to work at with supportive environment. Big company, but family oriented."
good,"My aunt got the job here she was the HR of JC Penny, it was only part time work and I needed something full time. I didn't get any benefits, and I like all of the co-workers."
good,I was hired for the holiday season as part-time help. It was my first time working in retail and was great fun doing something totally different than I had previously done before. I was hired on as full time after the holiday season.
good,"I would go in and unload trucks, get product ready to go out to floor. I would get defective product in defectives and take care of that. I would send out broken jewelry to be fixed for our customers. How to work independent. Management was good. Co-workers for the most part were good. You always have one or two you are not going to get along with. So you just try to stay away from them or say very little. The hardest part was to do everyone else's work for them plus my own so they could leave early but I never could. The most enjoyable part was I had weekends off. Also having the same shift not having it change everyday."
good,"The job itself was easy and fun. Loved the discount, only complaint was lack of hours because it is retail so it was only part time for almost all employees and compensation."
good,"Weekly training sessions to ensure Realtors are up-to-date on the latest regulations, new communities, as well as vendors that we share with customers regularly about their services"
good,My typical day at work is mostly customer service based. I book clients for their appointments and I supervise the stylists on duty. I schedule the stylists hours and their training.  My co-workers are very friendly and love the customers.
good,"Great job environment. Diversity was accepted and individuality was celebrated.  Great benefits, pay was ok.  Store manager promoted an uneasy environment of job security with management staff.  Manager would set supervisors up to fail, when she no longer was friends with a supervisor."
good,"Open register for women department. Assist customers with locating merchandise, Sales operations. Answering customer calls and helping sells associates with customer care questions and store policy and procedures,  conducting sales overrides, maintaining adequate cash in register throughout the day.

Aid in securing store for the night. "
good,For people who need to learn the fundamentals of work life they are a great company to work for I highly recommend them. The training for any position in this company is very thorough to make sure you fully understand your job and what you need to do.
good,"Working at J. C, Penny's allowed me to interact with customers in a professional and polite manner. Keeping merchandise in order allowed me to be proud  to work for a company that cared how the store looked."
good,"This was my first real job, and it was nice. I loved the fact that we could pick up as many hours as we wanted. I didn't know my co workers well because we all spent most of the time on the phone. I learned to use multi computers. The hardest part was keeping in mind how sensitive credit card information was via phone. The hardest part was when they decided to mover the jobs over seas. I enjoyed the job overall."
good,"Very friendly enviorment, and all about custemor satisfaction"
good,I did like working at JCPenney. I learned alot of work ethic and new methods to apply to my own life.
good,I overall loved the customers no work day was boring and it was always laughs while at work. I learned how to keep up with different shoes and clothing. I liked working alone and organizing the back room. My manager weren't really the best people all the time but I enjoyed the structure and expectation they wanted very well.
good,"I really enjoyed the fact that with every costumer that I assisted they were always satisfy with my services.That is my goal, being in a company or not. I don't ask for tittles, my goal is always pleased the needs of others and make sure to keep them happy. Being part of a team is amazing; the co-workers, I can say that they are like my second family. The hardest part of the job for me was when I started I had a strong Spanish accent but knowing the fact that I had to be around costumers I had to put my fears away. The most enjoyable part of the job, Well for  me was listening to the costumers needs, We have a job just because of them. The customers are the one that make our day, as well our team."
good,"The flexibility at the time for me was great. I enjoyed the fast-paced busy environment. Co-workers were very friendly, fun and helpful."
good,"I only worked at JC PENNY during Christmas time as seasonal help but, I enjoyed it very much!"
good,"Driving forklift are a pleasurable activity for me. The picking up and setting down of loads would have to be the most enjoyable activity for me. Co Workers seem to be a little uneasy and that may have been the most difficult part of the job for me. Management was helpful in times of need but they to seemed to be a little nervy, possibly because of the agenda they had to meet. Regardless i enjoyed working as a sit down forklift operator."
good,"I was worked at JC Penny's for about 3 months during one of their most busiest times; Christmas time. A typical day there was very busy. I was helping keep the floor clean by folding, hanging clothes and putting items back where they belonged. I did not really deal with the manager because I came to work and did my job well. Customers and co-workers never complained about me; I tried to assist in anyway possible. The hardest part of the job was that it was seasonal; I really would have enjoyed working there full-time."
good,"I enjoyed working with the company.  I liked the friendly environment, Employees were all much like myself. Ready to go out of their way to make the customer feel special. Management were very goal oriented, looking to make the employee feel important and they counted."
good,I always had work to do. I learned a great deal from my fellow employees. The lack of communication from the management team would probably have to have been the hardest part of my job. Working we my co-workers towards our common goal of making it the best store we could was the most enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work was straightening stock and waiting on customers.  The management and coworkers were nice to me."
good,If you work sales support your schedule will never be the same as it was the day before. This can and will create controversy due to the fact you can plan nothing in your outside life.
good,"* A typical day at work:  Jewelry-put out jewelry per company guidelines (i.e. diamonds and back stock), make suggestions to customers, make sales calls to get customers to come shop, back up front registers when three or more customers are in line (if not with a customer)count diamonds, and help keep rest of store looking nice.   Catalog: take orders and give customers orders they have had sent to store, answer phones, but now there is no longer a catalog department.  Everything is done at the register.  Janitor:  Clean and mop bathrooms, break room and store, vacuum store and offices, dust, clean windows, and wipe down fixtures."
good,"Full service cosmetologist. Hair coloring, permanent waving, hair cutting and styling. Manicures and pedicures."
good,"As an Administrative Assistants it was my responsibility to ensure that the business runs smoothly and efficiently. "
good,"I really did not work there for along time, because I needed a full-time job, but enjoyed the time I was there,"
good,"On a typical dat at work, I will greet co-workers and customers, and multi-task on things that my supervisor or boss wants me to do. I've learned how to stock merchandise, customer service skills, and cashier. I've worked every department, except jewelry. I have great co-workers and we all get along well! The hardest part of the job was learning how to visual assignments, but I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around great co-workers and getting the job done!"
good,jcpenny is really a fun place to work at . Everyone is friendly and they treat you like a family . The most enjoyable part at work is during Christmas time when the joy and Christmas love full the environment and when you get to know the customer and help them target their shopping plan . jcpenny is my best work experience .
good,"Making deadline, getting pricing done, unloading the truck, putting truck out, and back stocking. Covering and helping out the other assoicates, running the cash register and cleaning out the fitting rooms, colorzing and sizing. I learned every one has strengths and weakness, every one has a different way of doing things and different ways of thinking. I saw strong leaders; witch I want to become. My co- workers are some of the hardest working people who make the team and complete the pie. Without them you really have nothing. The hardest part of the day was knowing there is never enough time to do everything you wish you can for that day. The most enjoyable part is seeing people and gettting to greet and meet them."
good,Very enjoyable sales position meeting new people and helping them shop. Seem to be low chance of advancement for most people.
good,A typical day at work is very busy and hands on.
good,great job to work for. Must enjoy working with customer and standing.

good,"JCPenney is a fast paced and energetic place to work. Everyone typically has a can do attitude. A normal day at the store would consists of maintaining a clean and presentable working and shopping environment. Assist customers with making purchases and suggesting add ons, as well as solicit credit card applications. All sales associates are trained on how to use the point of sale system and how to place online orders for the customers. At the end of the shift I would count money from the registers and be sure that it is safely delivered to the cash room. After that is complete the staff would work as a team to ensure the store was clean and presentable for the following business day."
good,Assisted customers with their selections in the intimates apparel department. Process sales completion transactions for customers. Restock inventory on racks and replace out of place items back to their original racks.
good,"typical day at work would be placing all merchandise in its correct area. folding them making merchandise presentable. helping out customers find things, ringing up their purchase, online purchasing. closing drawers. hardest part of my job would be dealing with an unsatisfied customer. most enjoyable was all the friendly faces."
good,"I get to watch my coworkers do their job with pride. They provide excellent customer service, and they are very skilled. When I started, the salon manager was very supportive and provided me with supplies and other tools needed to do my job and market myself. The hardest part of the job is a lack of clients for myself. I wish my work day could get busier so I can get more hours. I love doing my job, as a massage therapist, and I have amazing clients."
good,Marketing and Customer service come to mind when describing thing youll learn.
good,JCPenney is a great working environment with great associates. The campus is amazing. Lots of great work experience can be gained from JCPenney.
good,Hours were flexible.  Helping customers find merchandise were appreciative.   Had difficulty at first trying to put merchandise from dressing room back on the floor.   Hardest part of letting everyone go after the holidays.
good,Although holidays are crazy the work here is pretty nice. Wonderful co-workers will make this job 10x better. I really enjoyed it and would love to come back if given the opportunity.
good,"I loved working there it was a really positive place to be.I am truly grateful for the experience.This was my first job and I realized that I like working retail.You get to meet a lot of new people, it’s a lot of net working."

good,I really enjoyed working at Jcpenny i feel like it was a good and very supportive environment & it taught me a lot on how to work & deal with the customers.
good,It was fun and I liked working there. I like organizing and talking with customers. It did get slow at times and that was the worst. Also one manager who worked there was a very over the shoulder person and it made me uncomfortable and not perform at my best. I did better when she was gone. I did love the job in general though!
good,"I learned so much in the 2 moths of working at jc pennys, It was a learning experience. wasn't happy with the fact that co works would steal anything you put down. worked through black Friday."
good,Good place for a first job. Associates are friendly and willing to help you. Management is always ready to help but can be rather slow. Hours are always the problem but if your scheduale is flexible you can get the best hours.
good,Busy work environment so the day goes by quick. Great coworkers and work atmosphere was energizing and positive. Good selling and cc app incentives and lots of free food
good,Poor mangement skills . Not enough training for employees.. And they put you all over allwats making sure  u sbmitballot of credit cards for therir company..

good,"is a nice  Company , it provide an good customer service, people are very responsive and colaborative with customers, provide good quality to individuals, it is a nice place to work for customer service."
good,"It's a great place to get started at or to just have a part-time at, other than that if you are looking for a job to maintain a family or just yourself it would be tough with the pay."
good,It was relaxing and sometimes laidback I would most definitely work there again. I love the way they really took time to train their employees to make sure we had everything and all the skills needed to work professionally and in a a well mannered environment.
good,"It's a good company not much pressure ,like family feeling to work there it's flexible hours nice motivated supervisors makes you feel happy at work,pleased"

good,it will be a very good place to work and also the people there are very enterjetic and are very nice and it has good to work and a farily easy job to do

Management offers a yearly associate survey billed as confidential; however, my direct manager identified me via the comments section and reviewed the survey responses in a one-on-one meeting which was not professional or appropriate."
good,"jcp was my home away from home .. enjoyed going to work everyday ,from working with my coworkers to engaging with the customers .The  best part of working at jcp was so family orientated. miss my jcp family"
good,"I worked for JCP 17 years ago. I wish I would had stayed.  Great place to work, people, could had retired already, Flexible schedule,  great benefits."
good,"Nothing about the job was hard in my opinion. It was an everyday routine. Unloading the truck, separating the boxes from toys and accessories to clothes. There was a lot of communicating and moving around. Everyone was so nice, and also funny. The job always go by smoothly."
good,"At jcpenney i really enjoyed working there, my boss wasnt really a social butterfly so that made it hard to tell her what days i needed off. the security there isnt very good either the cashiers cant do anything when someone is stealing we just had to watch it happen and then report it. but otherwise it was a friendly enviroment."
good,JCPENNY was my favorite place of employment. My managers were cool and helpful. Training was complete and thorough. Fellow employees didnt mind helping out when in a delimma . Floor manager was always around and working with the crew. During holiday season everyone was in the Christmas spirit which made the employees enjoy their jobs more. Staffs energy was always positive and welcoming.
good,"I always felt very energetic and excited  and very happy to work wih people, helping them with any question and concern. Try to hit company`s goal and work fast and calm at the same time during busy hours"
good,There is a lot of involvement with all workers. JCPenney becomes a family instead of a work place. In my position there just wasn’t much opportunity for advancement
good,Great people and I had an amazing Manager.  The work was challenging but the organization had a great support structure.  I actually rue accepting the layoff and not accepting the position transfer.
good,Good place to earn if you need a little extra money.  They listen to any concerns and are willing to work with varied circumstances.  Fun to see new items that arrive weekly.
good,Great place to work but only temporary so there was no possibility of advancement or financial security which I need.  Otherwise it was a very good work experience for me.
good,"Great Pt job with flexible schedule.  they offer great employee discounts. Very busy especially in the online department.  Occasionally, you would cover multiple areas depending on store need."
good,Company has a clean store and friendly and helpful staff.  Managers were quick to help when you had a problem at the register.  Allowed you to freely leave to take a break when needed.
good,"loved the job while I was there, too bad they do layoffs after peak seasons. Unless u been there awhile or show real promise then they might keep ya around."
good,Help customers finding the items they are looking to purchase. Suggest other items for additional sales. Fun envirement to work. Made friends in a fun  atmosphere
good,"best job i've had compared to my past "
good,I enjoyed working there. Some of th people were hard to be around sometimes. I went there and did my job. I would recommend working there if you love working with people.
good,"Only work 1Month 2 Week. Company went Out-Of-Business. I love Working with New Employee, learning New Work Environment. Learning New  and Different Merchandise Come In. How to remove Merchandise to different location. Pull Old Merchandise off rack"
good,unfortunately i don't believe i worked there long enough to paint an accurate picture. It was a difficult but solemn job. you were left basically to your own devices and  expected   to  pick up as you went.
good,"I loved working at JCP, however if your looking for a job with a flexible schedule, this isn't the place. I worked there four 4 years, in the same Dept. and I literally had to train 6 different managers to teach them my job. Although they like to recruit from within the store, they don't hire the right, knowledgeable employee to each department. You are required a minimum of credit applications to get daily/weekly but you do get paid 2.00 per application. A great incentive. And employee discounts are 25%."
good,"It was a ok job, a lot of friendly people a very friendly environment. It helped me improve my warehouse experience a little more. I have to unload truck and open boxes and Bombay bins, so we would take a quick 15 minute break, but we had to be aware of the time so it was a work paced job."
good,Learned a lot about how to run in the retail business and how to develop new skills and multitask to maximize the value of the customers' time and money.
good,This was a low paying job no matter what position you held. Increases were not even enough to be considered an increase. I wanted a set schedule and that was not possible with this position.
good,"This job allowed me to find new people in the area, and learn much more about the fashion world than I thought possible. The way they train you is very extensive and makes you care more about your job. The best part of the job was being able to help someone pick out some new clothes to be able to go to school in or get for Christmas."
good,"J.C Penny gave me the opportunity to work seasonal, and it was a great start for me. They provided on the job training and were patient during the learning curve. The customers weren't always easy to deal with, but my co-workers were understanding and kind. Management worked with my schedule to ensure I could provide childcare and have as many hours as possible."
good,"I work in the Salon at JCPenney as a receptionist "
good,"good place to work if you enjoy staying on your feet and staying busy, great employee discounts and sales, very diverse, fun, good training , good management,"
good,"I worked at Jcp for a year and 3 months. I loved the majority of the managers I had, my store manager and GM were wonderful, the only issue I had with the company was with our Human Resources"
good,Workflow is slow. Compensation is minimal. Its hard to get and keep clients. New hires are last to get walk in clients. Have to meet service goal in order to get commission.
good,"A typical day for me at work was great, I loved working with the customers and taking there photos. "
good,Jcpenny I love working for them liked working employee and the Customer.  We all got along when there problem we work together. The manager  was a pain in butt. Over all I work there again.
good,"This work was part time from 6:00 pm to 10:00pm . The biggest issue was environment because i had test on my computer with environmental disaster some employment during the year. Then i got sick and was not able to continue with two jobs."
good,"fast pace,"
good,"I have work at JC Penney for almost a year and although I do enjoy working with the customers, my co-workers and my supervisors I would like to apply my skills elsewhere!"
good,I enjoy working with people face to face.  This was a good place to do that and as with most retail stores it was a fast paced job.  The items they sell are good quality so being in a sales job is easy.
good,"salon crew was great, there were a couple of people who were cut throat at the time, and would try to steal clients, but on the whole we would work together, and learn from each other. good memories"
good,The management team is great and very supportive and understanding. Tasks are nothing too difficult and customers are usually fairly easy to deal with.
good,I worked here for a short time but was worth. Friendly environment. Hours were not there. Rarely hit 20 hrs a week. Got minimum wage. But job overall was good
good,"A typical day at work was - recovery, go backs and making sure all the tables and racks looked nice and organized"
good,"Job security was a little scary with several stores closing. Management within the company was a hit and miss. Overall, the customers were great people to work with in finding their needs. The holiday season became very stressful as we were required to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday instead of being with our families."
good,It was a great job when they were busy ( During the Holidays) but after that it became very cut throat. One employee would re-ring purchases so that he would get the commissions.
good,I would recommend jcpenny to anyone.                                Great work environment and the managers are great.                   Been working for 2 years now
good,"You normally ""hit the ground running"" at this local anchor store.  Management was very opinionated; right or wrong,  The Associates are what make the store run, and (for the most part) understand their roles and come to work. If you enjoy assisting people in making retail decisions, this is your place. If you come for the pay or advancement, I would suggest another line of work.  The maturity of the workforce is mixed.  Which can bring on issues of its own; and does from time to time.  Bottom line, it's what you make of it."
good,Everyone was so nice and made it enjoyable to come to work. They weren’t just my coworkers they were my friends. I met so many new people and was given lots of opportunities. I will definitely leave JCPenney with many great memories
good,I loved the job. it really was right up my alley. I loved working with the co-workers and the public. I pride myself on making customers happy.I really enjoyed being inside the mall because the store was always busy and you never haD A DULL MOMENT. i ENJOYED ALL THE MANAGERS AND THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY DISCOUNTS MTHEY OFFERED DURING CHRISTMAS
good,"They were great about hours and taking time off, it was a easy but fun job, sometimes stressful during back to school and holiday shopping but good for experiences."
good,"Working at JCPenney was a relaxed environment, but also fast-paced and challenging. The managers and other employees are supportive and make the work day so easy."
good,I did not care for the managers. They never seemed to be happy to see me during the day. Whenever I would ask for a code Green (More money for the cash register) they always seemed like I was bothering them.
good,"I loved working for JCPenney. The pay wasn't great and when I wanted to advance, they wouldn't let me. The employees became like a second family to me though and I will always care for them."
good,"I was only hired as a seasonal worker, for the holidays. Besides the constant flow of customers and returns for the holidays it was a relaxed environment."
good,Unloading trucks setting everything out to be loaded on the floor change price tags and remove newer clothes to the front fix shoes and sign changes shoeboxes rotated shoes for clearance markdowns
good,Repetitive task either on the floor folding clothes or checking patients out on the cash resister. Management had supper nice attitude and very accommodating. Customer's were understanding and pertinent.
good,"I loved the work, but they wouldn't give me more hours.  I would have stayed if they would have worked me more.  I couldn't live on 20 or less hours a week."
good,"Very nice, management wasn't all that, and this job requires a lot of patience!!!!! To get hours you probably have to suck up the to them, be in a big department, or do an immaculate job at work"
good,As a hairstylist in the JCPenney salon it was a great stepping stone for me. I started right out of school and was able to get amazing technical classes for FREE!
good,ok place to work pretty flexible. Salon is located in the back of the store. You can go out into the store to market. Needs updated needs more marketing
good,"I really enjoy the team of workers at J.C. Penney's. Everyone treats you like family. The everyday goal is to put customers first. I welcome customers, offer them my help, respect their time and always thank them for coming in. The position is fast paced and you must keep up with all your other cleaning duties on top of helping your customers. I have been very challenged at this job and it has taught me to be great at giving customers service. I am always rewarded for my hard work."
good,"Customer service, working as one team, learning new things about new products. educating clients and team. making sales and reaching company's goals.."
good,Great Company to work for with great opportunities for career growth. The pay scale is lower than most comparable positions in the local job market specifically for the JC Penney Account. My current position does not allow for a consistent work life/balance and the account has ignored the comments of many DFM's and continually have a revolving door with DFM's on this account.
good,Jcpenney is really flexible with hours so it was perfect for when i was in school. The management there was pretty good but not the best as sometimes they can be unorganized but surely everything pays off. everyones nice there .
good,The management here definitely takes care of their employees and reward those who work hard and take pride in what they do. It is a healthy working environment and the people here are very friendly.
good,Great place to work and co-workers were like family. Learned a lot in the salon and enjoyed being a stylist there.  Employee discount was great as well!
good,M.gusta trabajo en equipo y buen compañeros y buenos jefes y valorar el trabajo de uno ect.buenos beneficios y salario .nunca falto a los trabajos y soy puntual y m.gusta aprender de to2 un poco y superarme GRAX
good,"A great opportunity to learn and use Great Customer Service. Product Knowledge and enjoy what you are doing. Establish a"
good,I enjoyed working for JC. Penny's. The team I worked with were very nice women. I really enjoyed working with people. I worked at night and it was very busy but I enjoy the fast pace. My time would fly by.
good,I love making customers happy and getting them to come back shopping with our company. I take pride in making goals and keeping the sales up in the store.
good,"Excellent place to work, good benefits and pay.  Management did not"
good,Everything about JC Penny was great except the pay rate. It was really low pay rate and would take a long time before you get a raise. And once we get a raise its really now much.
good,"From my experience, everyone was friendly and amazing people, I got along with everyone. You have to keep up with the pace though because some customers can sense things."
good,Not a bad place to work as far as minimum wage goes. Free lunch on some holidays. Probably wont advance your position. Customers are typically friendly
good,You definitely work which is of course what you are getting paid to do. The worst part is down time when you've cleaned and tidied the floor so you have to mess it up just to redo it.
good,"Free water, free food, associate discount, coupons. Overall a great workplace but there are some unprofessional problems. However, when complaints are addressed by employees towards supervision. They are not always heard but rather u walk away feeling because of their title, when disrespected u have to take it. Online typical unorganization but proper people will listen. Whether they heard and implemented away to correct the problem time will let us see. These days as an employee or customer people don't care to be caring. Employees need to realize its not our experience but the customers. Supervisors need to realize, whoever brought the complaint as an employee about another employee. They are the ones to be heard and also considered. They are not to walk away feeling as though they were trying to make you the problem."
good,"I always looked forward to going to work. The co workers, supervisors, and bosses were so nice. It was great showing off my customer service experience."
good,"cashiering cleaning, loading cars from the catalog department. folding clothes hanging clothes. collecting hangers"
good,"I enjoyed my time at JCPenney as a seasonal worker. I would start my day early mornings and prepared and open all the cash registers. I learned how to start business reports for the day, as well as how to conduct refunds and credit card payments. JCPenney encouraged growth, if business was slow they would allow us to shadow a representative in other departments. The hardest part of the job was not being permanent."
good,We had such a small store that it was difficult to place the merchandise out so it did not look trashy. Also we had no lost prevention team so that meant we spent a number of man hours on putting tags on clothing to prevent thief.
good,"caught on to new things fast, customers loved me, the managers were nice, when i needed help with something the people there had no problem helping out, ect"
good,this is a good job overall. Although depending on your location you might deal with different types of people. Mostly nice clients. Good working environment. Would definitely work here again.
good,"A typical day in the studio includes photographing, selling, using customer service skills, and maintaining my staff of workers by making a set schedule and following up with them to guide them."
good,Jcpenney is a great workplace I've been working here for two years now and I have learned a lot from working here at jcpenney's I've learned how to communicate with my coworkers and customers how to work in teams when needed and how help and assist my customers with anything and everything they needed. I work here now as a sales associate in the men's department handling dress shirts and suits and im also a cashier here and I can say the hardest part would be folding the men's dress shirts that's about it. If I do find another job I will be leaving this one not because I don't like it but because I just want lean more and experience other jobs and lean more job skills.
good,"Its a good place to work, If you are still in school because they work around your schedule. I dont like the Extended Holiday hours.  But after the Holidays it gets back to the regular hours. Then after the Holiday your hours will get cut. Thats why I said If you are still in school."
good,"When I worked at JCPenny I met a lot of new people, we worked, had a 15 minute paid break and the supervisors were easy going and very friendly. I definitely recommend this job to someone trying to earn a little extra cash or just starting out in the working field."
good,It was a great fast paste job it could get slow at times the people areally great to work with they train you very well and it's a very easy job I would go back if the warehouse wasn't so far
good,"Like the work, pros are they seem to respect and appreciate their employees."
good,"Typical day would be making and changing sale signs. Scanning racks of clothing for proper pricing .Waiting on customers. I learned to work quickly and accurately. The management team was awesome. I really liked my co-workers, they were very friendly and helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job was having to search for sale signs in the library when they had been removed for the computer system. The most enjoyable part was the hour of my job. It was early morning and I like that part because I'm a morning person."
good,"A typical day at work can be different everyday. It can get really busy all of a sudden where I can't even get off the register, or to the point where my whole department is clean and I am sizing everything. I have learned that customer service is one of the main key points because I want to treat a customer the same way I would like to be treated when I walk in any store. The management I believe, could be better. Some work harder than others. My co-workers are amazing, everyone gets along very well! We all have the respect for one an another. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with angry customers, but my enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with kids and seeing them smile."
good,Very fun workplace filled with wonderful people. Joyful and steady. I loved working here. The customers were very sweet and kind.
good,"Decent place to work at okay pay, getting shocked is a regular on the job since your dealing with clothes on metal Z-racks in bags. co-workers always put in work because its a teamwork kind of position."
good,JCPENNY was a great place to work at. My coworkers were kind and helpful. For the most part management was nice and understanding.
good,"JCP was  great place to work till I found out I was losing my job, due to new CEO. He had came up with a bad pricing strategy, which lead to him wanting to save money. Which lead to many lay offs nation wide. I miss my team I worked with and the atmosphere. My job was stressful, nut easy."
good,Working with JC Penney was enjoyable. I got to interact with wide range of people. I love taking time to change someone's day for the better with them purchasing what JC Penney has to offer at any given time. My co-workers became my friends.
good,"Different duties, each day, work console, different doors, patrol building, etc. Learned associating with different people, working with management and co workers, no part of the job was hard or difficult."
good,"I worked as a sales associate for the optical department as one of my first jobs while I was in  high school. Loved my supervisor and co-worker. Ok pay, but such a supportive work environment. Sad to hear that  the optical department is no longer at the Kitsap location."
good,"Helping Customers achieve their goals,.assisting co-workers with recovery and training. Engaging with the customers and giving the best customer service..."
good,"Had a great time working there, enjoyed meeting new people, learned how to be a line cook also. Co-worker were fun to be around and were team players."
good,"Help people find products."
good,"Has a family atmosphere, room for advancement. most enjoyable part of the day is greeting,  assisting customers, restocking and folding tables."
good,"I love my job, my managers are the BEST EVER, I have very nice co-workers. It's a hard job at times, because you have to be on your feet all day but its a good job. I've learned to have A LOT of patience with this job. Management over all is so-so. But the managers are great. My co-workers are great, Well most of them, The hardest part about my job is the ""customers come first rule, or they are ""ALWAYS"" right. NOT TRUE AT ALL. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is my team! I love working in the kids department because my co-workers make me happy! And seeing my managers. I have two specific managers that are the most sweetest people you will EVER IN YOUR LIFE meet. I love them so very much! "
good,Great place to work in that prevents shoplifting. Working for this company allowed me to interact with officers of the law and how justice was served.
good,"working at JCPenney had it perks when it came to a great work experience and meeting great customers and co workers. But one bad thing about it was the hours, there were never hours! Unless you were a full-time associate you was good but part time sucked, you only had sometimes 20 maybe 15 hours a week."
good,I would take the payments of customers and I would organize clothes in order to make the store look nice. I learned how to use the register and how to sale items.
good,"Typical work day, always on the go no matter what. There is always something to do to keep you busy, putting back clothes and checking fitting rooms. Also customers always needs assistant whether its in person or over the phone."
good,"Fun work place with supportive managment. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"its pretty good place too work at , trying to make customer experience better working on task and  balalces customer time"
good,"Typical day consisted of expediting customers' items, helping them look for an item. Hardest part of the job would be cleaning out the fitting rooms."
good,"It was a fun place to work. I enjoyed how fast past it was,and the enthusiasm all the team members had. I loved how they made it possible for everyone to input their ideas."
good,"On a typical day if open in the morning, I get out the diamonds"

I learned how to fold clothes properly, hang up clothes with the smallest size in front and biggest size in back. The management was very helpful and positive people. My co workers were team players and was always willing to help me out when I needed it, The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I helped someone find what they were looking for and left the store feelings accomplished."
good,"It's hard to serve a costumer who wants more discount than  the one the store is offering. I take all my time to try to explain it to her. However, If the costumer still insisted, i took my calm and call for a help, after i try with my associate.I love when the costumer leave happily and felt welcome."
good,"jcpenneys is a nice place to work at the only times it gets stressfull is when they are hounding you to get people to sign up for credit cards by any means necessary or when back to school/holdidays comes around. they give nice hours, not enough to live on your own but its good enough for roomates."
good,i learn to work together with a fast pace team management staff was a great help when ever i needed help with something or if i had a question they would do all they could do to give me there best asnswer
good,Great place to work. Management is great. Very Flexible and pay is decent. The only down fall is hours which is fine one week and not so the next. Great company to work for.

good,i loved working there. the people and atmosphere were great. they a friendly outgoing team. the managing staff is great
good,Getting to know daily thousands of people that shop in the store is great and if you have good co-workers better. At least in my experience there wasn't much room for advancement but I've heard others having more luck. All in all a great work experience.

good,A typical day at work included greeting and assisting customers at point-of-sale operations. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers on a day to day basis. Working retail was a great opportunity and starting point while I was attending classes.
good,JC Penney was a great company to work for however there is little to no career pathing within the organization especially in Loss Prevention.  I did manage the LP department in a lower volume Penney store which allowed for me to enhance my business acumen.
good,"En la empresa mi día a día era la atención al publico,ayudar a los clientes a encontrar lo buscaban,en cuanto a tallas,moda en especifico,lo cual considero que  me gusta mucho,aprendí en cuanto a servicio al cliente,el trato,y por su puesto ayudarlos a conseguir lo que buscaban en la empresa,aprendí a manejar cajas cierres de las mismas,en cuanto a mis compañeros de trabajo pienso que era buen habiente de trabajo siempre estaban dispuesto ayudar si alguno  necesitaba ayuda o tenia duda en el trabajo que se estaba realizando,la parte difícil algún cliente mal humorado que quiere gritar,pero en ese aspecto sabíamos como resolver la situación y explicarle al cliente las políticas de la empresa de la mejor manera,me gusto el mundo de la moda,conocer a mis compañeros de trabajo y me gusto haber trabajado en tan prestigiosa empresa por los conocimiento que adquirí"
good,Its a routine work place. The staff is  comfortable and friendly to work with. It is a typical sales associate position. There is not to many difficult task to be performed at the job. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping customers.
good,A typical day at work consisted of handling inbound and outbound calls from customer regarding their orders from JC Penney catalog and JCPenney.com.  Would check availability on the products and services offered by JC Penney. Tracked and confirmed the delivery status of customers orders. Offered alternative merchandise when products were out of stock.  When working as an Administrative assistant I handled the research and resolutions to irate customer situations.  I coordinated with our fulfillment centers and the corporate office in Plano Texas to resolve customer complaints. Send apology letters and performed any follow up as necessary.  I had also worked as a trainer with the new hires to handle inbound calls to place catalog orders and implemented company policy and procedure.

Most enjoyably part of the job was being able to help customers pick out clothes and enjoying their happiness when it has been successful."
good,"My typical day would start with sometimes opening the doors in my department if I was the first shift. We hard to greet the customers, I loved greeting them. I learned so much being there, I learned about the customers and how to better assist them with their needs, My management was not to great, they really did not help much, most things I learn was through my coworkers. They were very busy people and running a store has to be hard so I didn't bother them much. If it was a customer I would call them and they would be over right away, so they were all about customer service. My hardest part of the job was relearning what I already knew. When I came to work at JCP from TJX it was not an easy transistion, I did have to learn how to use a different cash register and learn there new rules. My time at JCP was enjoyable, my favorite part was meeting new people, talking to the customers. I had 5 stars from the customers who did the survey. I really clicked with them on a personal note and I loved to listen to what they had to say."
good,"Great working with the company,good co-workers."
good,It was a busy job that was fun and the customers that came made it worth the while.
good,Very few days were slow at JCP.   People who worked there were great.  Management trusted us when they gave us things to prepare for whether it was a big sale or managment was walking the store to see how our store was doing.  I enjoyed this part time job---sometimes your had to be prepared to straighten the sales floor to late hours at night for a spectacular look for tomorrows customers.  I learned how quickly a season would passed and it was important to push the selling aspect of the clothes on the floor to make room for new incoming merchandise.
good,I loved it. First job. Grew with the company until I was sent to a certain store where my career ended due to the store manager. Very old. Set in his ways. I became a target.
good,nice people good staff friendly just wish pay was better managment was nice and trained well
good,This is a very fun environment to work in and very fast pace so this was a great pleace with great co-workers
good,I started out as Christmas help and worked really hard as a sales associate and in turn got promoted to a Supervisor position in three months. It is an enjoyable place to work. Meeting and talking to the customers is very rewarding. My co-workers are a joy to work with on a daily basis.
good,Working there was a new experience as all new jobs are. I was accustom to Managing. My Manager was very good a definite Team Player that appreciated my past experience that I brought to the table and assisted him in training new associates and selling.

good,"A typical day is folding and helping customers organizing also fixtures as well ."
good,"Great place to work, great employees. I loved it. I learned a lot, and I miss working for them. When hired I was told by the hiring manager that I was a perfect candidate for the job.

good,"A typical day at work while I was at JCP was, constant community service, lots of cleaning and organizing. I learned how to deal with many different types of customers, and learned how to work well under stressful situations. The management at JCP was wonderful, our Salon manager was amazing, understanding, and dedicated to being helpful for our stylist, and myself. The hardest part of the job would be when we had stand still time, when all the work that had to be done was done and there was nothing else to do. The best part of working at JCP was my co-workers, they were like family. The stylist and I got along very well, we would be constantly working together to make our clients and customers satisfied."

good,Seasonal work answering phones and placing catalog orders.
good,"A day a JCPenney's is never consistant, everyday I encounter something new. I enjoy the one on one contact I have with each and every customer, and I love that everyday I experience something different. I have learned how to communicate more effectively by just having everyday conversations with our staff and customers. I help train new employees and I am expected to help when any problems take place in the department, whether it be with customers or maintaining the department. The co-workers in my department all get along very well, we all treat each other with the upmost respect and have become a little work family. This helps when it comes to doing department projects or feeling comfortable enough when anyone has new idea's or suggestions. The hardest part of my job is probably dealing with me personally and learning how to say no, I tend to go above and beyond when it comes to being asked to do something and sometimes I agree to things that has nothing to do with my department or even when it comes to working overtime and having no time for myself or my school work. The most enjoyable thing about my job would definitely be the different people I meet every single day. Not to mention my co-workers and managers are so friendly, which helps to make the working environment more enjoyable!"

I learned how to measure and install window treatments.  My manager was located in Houston so I rarely got to meet with him.  The hardest part of the job was the physical part or climbing ladders to place delivered items.  The best part of the job was my co-workers."

good,A day at work is tough but also rewarding. I have to act like I'm a shopper in order to catch the people stealing the merchandise. Its hard because it like spying on them but in a legal way. My managers and the co-workers all pitch in to help and I never have to worry about back-up. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we catch the suspects and get them for stealing the merchandise because we just save a little bit of the stores money....
good,"You get to meet new people everyday, you learn a lot from your interactions with others, co-worker were very nice"
good,"zoned and stocked while running register, had to clean and know basica about the dept i was in"

good,"Working with Jcpenney was a great experience. I started off as just a Floor Sales Associate and with hard work i moved up to the Merchandise Execution Leader. I had a great team that was determined and motivated. When changes started to occur in the store and with the company, my group of ten became a group of five; therefore workload became heavier. The hardest part of the job was getting tasks done in a timely matter, by the due date, and looking very presentable, it was a priority that the job got done."
good,"My typical day at work was to have and make great customer service, work with the cashier for Jcpenny's point of sale. I was designated to zone, keep childrens department neat and clean. I learned with great customer service brings satisfied customers. Management was professional and had good business etiquette. My co-workers were teamplayers they helped when I needed help and were friendly. The hardest part of the job was handling more than three tasks at a time but with confidence and a positive mental attitude it worked out well. The most enjoyable was satisfying the customers to the best of my ability."
good,"My typical day at JCPenney would be assisting customers with whatever it may be due to helping them pick out a certain outfit, ordering online purchases, or simply opening a credit card for them. I learned to love retail. Mangement was great. Coworkers were very helpful."
good,"Store looks good, but no customers!!! Management in some cases do not care about employees special needs or schedules....some coworkers are lazy,,avoid doing any work"
good,I would defiantly work there again. everyone got allong. we had a good team dianamic
good,Nice enviroment and friendly attitutde. It feels good to be able to put a smile on each of the customers face when u provide them with outstanding customer service. Every team member there is outgoin and also very helpful.
good,When I started at this company in was an order filler which involved stating on my feet all day and paying close attention to detail when I filled the orders. As an order verifier I was responsible for making sure that the only jewelry that left the building was what the individual stores ordered. The hardest part of this job was sitting down all day when I verified orders.
good,A typical day at work entailed unloading stock and placing the stock throughout the store preferably before the customers arrived.
good,Have always been more than fair with me.always focuses on customer first. And I like that .
good,"Primary responsibility includes managed Fine Jewelry Department, and including all departments, establishing goals for associates, coaching, and monitoring sales performance. I've learned to be prepared to answer any questions/concerns from customers or team members while providing excellent customer service at all times. I enjoyed the people I worked with and it was a fun and friendly atmosphere."
good,"Get to work with great people, good experience for customer service,"
good,"Its a good job and easy enough. It definetly requires patients,organization, and math."
good,Overall a great company to work for. An excellent example of how to treat the customer!
good,Their is no typical day at JCPenney's as everyday is different. I have had a lot of customer service training and experience with customers. At JCPenney's the customer is always FIRST. I believe in treating the customer the way I would like to be treated. I enjoy working with people. My co-workers are like family to me. It is always a good feeling when a customer gives you a good report card on a customer survey. I feel that management does a good job of rewarding me when I reach my sales goals. I can honestly say that I look forward to going to work and that I enjoy working with customers and co-workers.
good,"At JCPenney, I worked in the children's department. This included working on the cash register, processing returns, keeping the salesfloor organized, and closing the register at the end of the day."
good,I loved working here! It was such a great environment and my managers were so laid back and very understanding when I left to find a better job opportunity.
good,"Its an enjoyable, rewarding, fast paced job. I love working with customers and helping them get what they want!"
good,"Supportive learning curve from management and co-workers"
good,"It was seasonal but I really like it , I found myself working hard , I was a cashier and a Sales Associate , great customer service , very polite, great team work"
good,The salon employees work together to encourage each other as workers and as individuals. There’s always opportunities for continued education in our field
good,JCPenneys was a great work environment. Was one of the first jobs I had and they gave me opportunity to grow. Definitely met a lot of people. Management was great and were always opened to feedback. The hardest job about the job was having people apply for credit card. They were really strict when it came to that
good,"This is a good company to work for. Patience and kindness are obvious in this environment. Unfortunately, the store I was in closed up for real estate reasons."
good,Good Management. Good atmosphere. Hands on training. Learned a lot about sales and providing good customer service. Clean and professional.  I have no complaints.
good,It was a really good experience of my life at jcpenny specially my manager was really good with me! Overall It was actually pretty good and I’ve learn so many things at Jcpenny!
good,"Their new store manager is awesome and will work with you if you are honest and upfront with any scheduling or work accommodations. I worked primarily in Fine Jewelry, and though associates are there to sell products and store cards, they are very much about earning their customer's loyalty and happiness. If you are an extrovert, or have extroverted tendencies, then Cadillac JCPenney is the place for you!"
good,I enjoyed working for  jcpenney. The employees were nice and friendly. My job was really easy I worked in the shoes department. I was able to improve my customer service skills.
good,"I was treated well and enjoyed working at my cashier position."
good,"Working for JCP was a very rewarding experience. as a consumer myself, I personally wanted to give my customers the same experience that I would expect. My Supervisor was amazing at thoroughly training and making sure every employee knew what was expected during sales."
good,I loved my job. I really miss working there. I was really good at any and all of my responsibilities. I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the snow.
good,Enjoy working at JC Penney with a great team in the shoe department. Loved helping the customers with finding the best fit and brand of shoes. Find that unlike other retail stores JC Penney trains all they eployees to be the best associates when helping customers.
good,"A day at the store was great in the morning ,when we open up puting money in the registers, going around making sure everything was just right. the stations clean and sharrp for customers. When the customers came in there faces lite up with a smile ,that made me feel so good and glad im working at Penneys."
good,"Fun place to work. Liked helping customers shop for items they needed."
good,"Typical day at work usually involved being at the cashier systems, talking to customers, helping them sign up for reward programs and find whatever other accessory they needed. Two rush hours in a day, management was decently tough, but loose enough to enjoy working."
good,This was a great place to work until management starting changing everything.they took away our fulltime status.our benefits too and i had to quit and look for a job that would give me benefits. I used to love this place..
good,"During the two years I worked at JCPenney, I noticed that even though the associates came and went, the focus on making sure the customers left elated remained. It was fun talking to the customers and getting to know them while also maintaining great customer service."
good,"Had worked previously for JCPenney in Burlington, VT, 2003-2011. Had many life changing events during my time away from JCP, ie divorce, empty nest, desire to move back to hometown. But, first time working there was more rewarding and enjoyable. Moved back to Vt in 2018, still trying to find my new favorite job."
good,JCPenney is a great job for beginners and also a great job for someone who has experience and is looking to be full time. The majority of us are part time but we still manage to make a good amount
good,I worked security at Penneys and my primary job was to arrest shoplifters. It was an interesting job that required continual walking around the store watching for suspicious activity.
good,I worked the Christmas season.  They provided good training and it was a great work environment.  The management was supportive and easy to work with for the most part.  There really wasn't anything hard about the job.  I worked in the jewelry department.  I enjoying interacting with the customers the most.
good,"I enjoyed everyday working with associates and management."
good,This was by far my worst job ever. Managers were beyond rude staff was lazy. Nobody liked to do there job. Customers were beyond rude as well. Not enough employees which made everything stressful
good,"This was an excellent place to work for my first time, fresh out of highschool. I worked the catalog department mainly and floated to other areas. I did a little of everything. But it paved the way for my career advancements."
good,I love it it I miss it only job I had that let me work as much as I wanted despite my age I’d go back if u could. Great pay if you rack them hours up.
good,I love working for this company for 10 years I  Grew to have a  work family the friendships I made was wonderful it’s was a good company to work for before everything changes I still go to visit some of my friends that still there I would mind working back at Jcpenney
good,This was a great job. I started a little before 6am every morning in a great environment. I was well trained and was a major part of the process. I had a great team. I just wish we weren't shut down.
good,"I was employed in a temporary, part-time position at JC Penney, over Christmas. The work environment was very friendly, with co-workers helping each other foster a positive experience for the customers."
good,"I started at the lowest rung and after many promotions based on exceeding sales goals and other standards earned promotions to Senior, supervisor and then Trainer. I loved teaching and my manager was hands off only occasionally adding advice. He was really good at managing only when he needed to which allowed me to do my best."
good,"JCPenny is a fast-paced, competitive job that requires you to be attentive at all times. JCPenny is really flexible with hours and is willing to co-exsist with school and everyday life."
good,JCPenney is a fantastic retail sales company in the United States. JCPenney provides for their employees as the employees provide the company. The staff is s amazing as their customers. There is always a friendly environment passed through everyday.
good,"was the first job that I got right out of high school, it was amazing . you meet so many new people well working here. if in college they work ver well with school hours and work hours"
good,My most enjoyable part of my job at JcPenny was costumer care. My work hours were variable at times. Weekends were are most busiest day of the week. I very much enjoyed my work
good,"I love interacting with the customers, helping with their questions and needs about a product. It was a bright, fun environment which I enjoyed along side other workers and customers."
good,I had fun while working. It was a very positive work environment. The hours were flexible and I enjoyed working with clothing. I also worked with jewelry curtains.
good,"I love working at Jcpenney, except that the pay is low, and not enough ours for the time Im available to work. The company is struggling to keep employees due to higher paying jobs available."
good,"It is a very welcoming and friendly environment to work in.  All employees were willing to teach me how to work computers, stock inventory and taught me how to work with customers"
good,"My day would often start in the break room where I would meet with my supervisor and she would go over with me my duties for the day. I would then go to the back where the computer sis and look up how many online orders were placed and waiting for me to find. After doing that I would get my scanner, grab a pen, some note cards and go on to finding the items that were ordered online and prepare them for shipment or customer pick up. Once I located all the merchandise I would go to the back and scan and package each order until it were time for me to leave."
good,I enjoyed everything about J.C Penny. It was always a fun day at work. Bosses were always kind and understanding and an open door if needed. A+ company
good,Pleasant experience overall. Everyone is very friendly and working there it is like a family. The company likes to know how you are and what interest you may have.
good,The coworkers are the most amazing part. It can be really physically demanding and unrealistic. There often struggle to be enough people to help with trucks or signing.
good,"I really loved this job, the co workers you will meet are amazing. I never worked a retail job before. I will recommend this to anyone who is starting out. I like the managment style and the human interactions. BEst job i've had."
good,"The management team and staff are friendly and fun. You can learn n"
good,"Enjoyed working here. Got to learn all the different departments, and was giving good hours. They had excellent training programs and willing to help you. (Got laid off when jcp changed CEO's )"
good,I enjoy working here. I just don't feel that their wages are very competitive for the amount of work you haft to do. On a regular night you would unload 2 to 3 semi-trailers. So with 100 boxes to ones with over 4000 boxes on them.
good,Great as a second job or just something for part time. Once holiday season is over you only work maybe 10-15 hours a week at just $8.00/hr. Not really a place that offers position advancements.
good,"A typical day was to take orders for JCP catalog orders from customers all across the USA  Finding a special item for them and shipping it to a local store for free shipping. Tracking orders for concerned customers. I learned to be more patient and to try to understand what customer are saying. "
good,It is too bad catalog centers no longer exist in the JCPenney culture. It provided quick easy access for customers and was more integrated into the community then the large stores are.
good,"There is no room for advancement with the company. It's a good work environment as extra income. The co workers and supervisors are a great family. So if you don't want to advance in your career or juts want to learn to start then grow somewhere else, then it's a great place to be."
good,This was a job I really enjoyed doing. Loved serving customers. Holidays can get really crazy. I liked the discount. Co-workers are friendly and really fun to work with.
good,"I worked for this company for nearly 4 years and I can say that as a manager it was my role to lead and develop and that's what I did, not for me but for my employees. Great place to work if you can check your own attitude at the door. Work ethic goes along way. So come to work give 100% and go home."
good,The support specialist position is a relatively slow paced job that is not too demanding. All there is to do is resupply certain products and assist customers with what they are looking for.
good,As a sales associate I provided customer service to diverse populations. I endured patience and efficiency and learned to provide excellent customer service. Hardest part of the job was working late at night and weekends. I enjoyed the position itself because it was my first retail job.
good,Great starter job or job for people with restricted schedules. Large emphasis on credit app which can be difficult to get. Hours were dependent on these apps. I did enjoy my job though.
good,I started out in the stock room and next I was building shelves and started setting weekly ads. If you want to learn about retail this is the company to work for.
good,"Good work life balance; good culture, good people, good campus; rewards program is not good, employees at the store not savvy in terms of sizes. However most employees are very helpful."
good,"Nice job and a beautiful building to work in.  Worked console for 4 hours and patrolled building for 4 hours.  Was over an hour commute time, so it got to be expensive driving back and forth."
good,"To be honest, you have to make due with what you can get. there is many opportunities and chances for advancement as long as you work very hard. the hours are also good."
good,"I applied to JCPenney thinking that I would love working as much as I did shopping there. No way, I am now convinced the only reason I stayed was to gain experience. There was poor management at the time and I was unhappy for a few months before leaving."
good,"I like my job, co workers and suppervisor.  Good place to work. Had to change jobs because they could not work around my hours at my other job, Love my hours and discounts"
good,"Very Friendly enviroment, customers were great and I enjoyed my job very much.  Management could have been better.  Too many managers and they never seemed to be in the same page."
good,"I loved jcp .it was my number job that I enjoyed.I learned and experimented alote there.cashier,stocker,customer service skills.how to enjoy life with a job.to marking down prices."
good,"JcPenneys is a great company to work for! I was there 20 years and with hard work you can easily advance"
good,"A typical day of work would consist of ringing customers at the register and giving them the best customer service that I can give. Along with ringing, I would recover folding tables and clear out fitting rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job would be providing customer service. The hardest part of the job is trying to find available shifts when you've only been given one or two days out of the week to work."
good,"Great retailer, great people. Management was good. they just would put schooling over experience. The hardest thing about working there of course was holidays."
good,I had fun working in the furniture department and often in clothing department or lingerie to cover breaks. It was so convenient to have lunch in the food court where you more then likely run into a friend or family member shopping at the mall. The dress code was functional. When you make sales the commission rate is great but when it was good it was good I made at least 200 to 300 extra on checks.
good,"This is a good company to work for.  Greet benefits, good management and nice products.  Its a fun job.  Have fun at work and make money doing it. The down side is advancement at this job. You must have a completely open availability."
good,Wouldn't approve of them replacing the Loss Prevention Department rather than using the profit to expand the center's security instead of opening up Sephora.
good,"I love working at Jcpenny's. The management is really friendly and so is the staff. Credit is a big deal at Penny's. I enjoy going to work everyday, it doesn't seem much like a job."
good,I love what I do for a living. Working in the salon is sometimes hard. The girls are catty but I think every salon will have that. My biggest problem is our color line. It doesn't make sense that we use one of the largest color lines available and we cant keep what we need in stock. I personally hate using a warm base color line because its hard to tone out. Jcpennys needs to realize the wasted money here but it goes far above my head and I don't plan on seeing any changes.
good,"not a bad place to work, sometimes it is a lot for just one person to do in an area. It would get pretty chaotic at time, but the managers for the most part where not to bad."
good,"I saw alot of favoritism, in the department i worked in, it was more complaining then telling you what a great job you have been doing. the stock room would be horrible and unorganized sometime."
good,"JCPenney was a great company to work for.  I learned about work ethic, customer service, and teamwork.  I enjoyed most working in the stock room, receiving new merchandise, getting it ready to take to the sales floor.  The hardest part of the job was probably keeping the store clean and morale high during busy seasons"
good,Retail as retail goes. Managers are overall really understanding about other life opportunities and ongoings and are willing to work out a working schedule.
good,"A typical day at work is like going to shopping, going around the store and finds new items, making sure my team is ready to sell those items and be familiar with the products so when a customer need help s/he will finds it.  I learn time management and how to be able to work with different types of shoppers.  There was no hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed every second of it.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer like to have me a her/his personal shopper assistance where I choose items to meet her/his needs."
good,"Working for JCPenney was a great learning experience. Management was awesome at training, answering questions, and following their core idea of the Golden Rule. The hardest part of this job was the company not being completely open about which stores were staying open or closing."
good,I always felt informed on what was going on in my job and felt I could perform it well. Management was engaging and kept me on my toes. I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.
good,For the most part it's good place to work for. They do hire a lot of the younger crowd which brings in high school drama. There is favoritism in the work environment. Management isn't the best.
good,"Enjoyable work enviroment, maintaining sales goals, great customer service skills, fast paced., cash handling, order placement, merchendise standards with company policy."
good,"Manager had a heart attack on the floor. Employees would constantly yell back at customers. Employees constantly berate customers both in and out store, sometimes following them to another store."
good,"I loved working at JCPenney's it was a joy going to work everyday."
good,Great place to work and share memories with others. Enjoyed taking and editing pictures to help families capture what they are looking for. Clean and Friendly customer service.
good,Fun environment and social co-workers with open personalities. Favoritism was a bit much but the employees attitudes were great so it was over looked a lot.
good,"They have many opportunities of advancement, fun environment but consisted of many long hours. The management team cared about their employees and would try to work with you."
good,Jcp is one of the best places I've ever worked. I learned how to work well with others. JCPenney's helped me tuneup my Craft of on how to help people.
good,"I have worked as a part time seasonal worker. Pay is less.but management is good . Its a part time job so u can not see your long term future. I joined Jcpenny for the survival and to have unique experience in retail industry. "
good,totally loved this job it was very interesting working hear. great bosses and hours great pay and  very clean. so loved it
good,"I am a very hard woking associate, ready to do whatever is expected of me. Shows up for work on time, conscientious of the customer's needs, while excelling at my job. I work with others very well i am a team player in reaching all goals that we are required to reach."
good,Working here was the very first job I had and I loved it for a first job. The management was very helpful and so were the associates. I worked at store 0909. I loved everything about the job and the customers was awesome. Of course you would have a bad customer every now and then but you always will. They were good with working around your schedule because I was in school at the time. The main reason I left was because management began showing their shady side. Besides that it's an awesome place to work. I even found love at jcp lol.
good,Much respect to this company. Was a great experience to learn from such hard workers an was able to understand the quality work that gets done during the day!
good,I only worked there for the holiday season but it was a good workplace.  I loved working with other people.  Some parts of the day went by fast and some parts went by really slow.  I worked over in the shoes and not many people come check out over my shoes.
good,Working at JCPenney was a fulfilling experience teaching me important lessons such as advanced communication skills and excellent problem solving finesse.
good,This was my first cosmetology job right out of school. I gained tons of clientele and always seemed busy. I learned more about cuts and color here and continued to learn everyday by other stylists. I worked full time here and after the manager left and moved away I was responsible for ordering supplies and putting away inventory.
good,"I loved every minute working for JC Penney.  It was my first time at Retail and I loved it.  I started in the Shoe Department with ""top"" sales for my first three months.  Then was promoted to Supervisor of the Men's Department.  They have awesome communication with their employees and make them feel like they are part of the company."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much. I left because I met my husband and moved to Arkansas. I enjoyed interacting with the small children, knowing you can impact there life."
good,"The store is very busy place, management is helpful most of the time. My coworker are very nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is working along. Helping customers fine what they need."
good,hard workers last the lazy people going to the bathroom every 5 mins  and walking around dont. But every body is very friendly and you will learn alot if you are trying hours were great but you can get buried in hours around holidays.
good,This is a great company to work for. The company does care about its employees and tries to be competitive in salary and upward mobility. I worked for the company during and after our struggle and subsequent revival.  It has been rewarding to come through that time and to watch our company grow again.
good,"My work experience at JCPenney was fun. I enjoyed helping customer locate an item. Also, the staff was welcoming. It was an overall great experience."
good,The Buena Park distribution team works in collaboration to get results.  From top to bottom there is a good chemistry of personnel to work together to meet deadlines and service the stores.
good,"I opened the department scan shoes on a monthly basis. Provided customer with proper service when needing merchandise, checkinbg prices."
good,enjoyed working with my co workers in this fast paced environment  co workers were nice and helpful store cleanliness was excellent
good,Would help customers find what they need. Translate when needed. Stock merchandise back on floor. Kept are nice and neat. closed out register.
good,"The job itself is not bad, but at some points dealing with some of the staff would be a bit much. One thing I did like to see,was the manger working her butt off, instead of just sitting in an office all day.A true leadership spirit."
good,"Learned how to take customers' orders, navigate computer system."
good,"This company has gone through a lot of changes through the years and they try to accommodate the customers' likes and dislikes. It is a good experience for the customer service learning and I enjoyed working with the other employees.  They are dedicated to Breast Cancer Awareness, which is outstanding."
good,the only reason I stopped working for the weave shop is because I moved out of the state. It is a great place to work you get steady clientele because the salon promotes itself regularly. Most salons have cable so that you can keep up with your favorite shows and they pass out snacks to keep your clients happy. Also the weave shop has hair in stock so that you never have to turn down a client. also did I mention that you get commission from all product and hair sales in addition to the commission you receive for every client.
good,The most ejoyable part of this job is being able to listen to music while u work which makes the day go by a lot faster.alsoi being able to get a raise every two weeks based on your team work performance.from the time I was there I started at $8.00hr and ended at $13.50hr.
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Interesting to be able to help customers not only in men's department but in any other department in the store."
good,"lots of cross-training"
good,customer service. Made sure all the clothes were organized in order by size. Made sure customers found what they were looking for and helped them if they didnt. Cleaned out dressing rooms
good,"Great company to have work for. The ability to work with several teams was a major plus. My role as the situation manager gave me valuable insight to how other teams function. My experience with working with a great group of people in several different areas, speaks volumes."
good,A great place to work . A typical day is providing quality customer service to our guest and making sure they found everything and are happy with their purchases. Teamwork and communication is the  key to an enjoyable job.  Management is always there to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my job was not buying everything that I liked. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing customers happy and satisfied with their shopping experience in the store.
good,"A really well rounded company and really well organized and also always clean. Compared to all of other jobs I have worked. I learned a lot about color, visual, and time that is spent on making all of the store look presentable."
good,"My day starts at 5am\"
good,I enjoy working with the associates and the managers they are fun and out going.  I loved when customers came in and I was like a personal shopper and walked them around the store to find what they needed for themselves or for their family.
good,"I had a lovely time working at JC Penney. I was new and very nervous about starting a new job but, whenever I had a question or felt overwhelmed my co-workers were always there to help. I really enjoyed my time there."
good,Jc pennys is a fun enviorment. It is a good place to gain knowledge in retail. Also if attending school they work with your schedual.
good,"I work at jcpenney from two back years ago, has a good working environment for both the customer and employees, mostly it is a very busy place, where REQUIRES stand all shift, very friendly and polite but for me that is not something difficult I like and enjoy what I do, my place is the area of babies and infants where you have to be very affectionate and attentive to our best customers, fond of animals and something that makes me easier work despite how busy I am always, my supervisors are very nice and caring people and my fellow d work too,"
good,"It was a wonderful job! Too bad that it was only temporary, hired help for the holiday season.  I loved the diversity of customers, helping with the merchandise, learning and growing."
good,"I would greet the customers, help them when they needed, handling money, and cleaning the store. I learned how to be more involved with customers. The management their was great I can't remember who the manager was at that time because I was seasonal, but she was very nice and worked well with everyone. The hardest part of the job was after the Holidays we would sometimes work in to the am. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment it made you feel welcome."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with the fact that the call center was going to close down.  Other than that, it was a great place to work for"
good,"they are very very good about working around school, and family life. fun place to work they tried to make new goals and prizes for staff to achieve store goals."
good,Serve our clients on all they need. I had great team work. I really enjoy to work at jcp  they have a great benefits for all the associates.
good,"Very satisfied with working at JC Penneys. Co-workers all friendly and able to get along with each other. Supervisors works along with Associates. No ""Big I and Little you"". Supervisors have the best interest for the Associates. Consideration was shown toward employees during a crisis within their family. "
good,"A typical day at work at JCPenney is ringing out customers on the cash register, organizing clothing on sheves and racks and making sure clothes are stocked. Also, our goal is to make sure our customers have the best shopping experience possible and also to get as many ICAPS as we can to better our business. I have learned to be more organized than i already am, i have learned to come out of my comfort zone and be much less shy, i have also learned confidence. Management at JCP is overall good. All of my co-workers are very very friendly and nice. The hardest part of working at JCP is getting ICAPS because it is very difficult to convince customers to apply for their own JCPenney credit card even though there are many benefits. The most enjoyable part of working at JCP is helping customers and satifying their shopping needs and wants, putting a smile on their face and making their day better."
good,Good people to work with and management is on their toes. Fast paced and ever changing makes it like new.
good,"It was a good first job experience, I learned about time management and fitting into new groups."
good,"Great place to work management and co-workers were all very friendly. The job was not hard to do, in fact it was fun."
good,"I actually liked working here. I got to help someone look their best everyday, i even helped a few ladies find their inner bombshell. I loved working here, although i didn't like that management told my customers that i left to pursue a nursing career. It did take me a while to get a raise too. I was there for almost six years and by the time the let me go i was only making 8.59."
good,"management is always willing to work with the employies."
good,Typical day meant working part of the day as a team and part of the day in my own department.
good,"A typical day at JcPennys salon would be servicing clients on various hairstyles, waxing, and performing manicures and pedicures. I would also sell retail to my clients and other customers, answer the phone and schedule appointments and call to confirm appointments. I've learned working in the salon about the importance of customer service, marketing skills by selling retail and promoting the salon to gain customers. My co-workers and I compliment each other very well, we know each others strength and weaknesses, and help each give our client the best experience. The hardest part of my job is satisfying every single customer 100% but the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the look on their face when I do accomplish a look for them."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers, taking payments and being submerged in a woman's favorite place to be, a clothing department. Helping people shop is fantastic. It's a nice place to be able to get one-on-one with customers and help them find exactly what they need. I love the people I work with! It was very easy to make friends here and I believe that when you like who you work with it makes the job THAT easier. I received excellent training and now have the skills I need to do my job and do it well. The hardest part of my job would be when I cannot answer a question myself, however there is ALWAYS somebody I can ask and get an answer."
good,"Retail sales"
good,"I loved the atmosphere, people and customers. For the most part it was enjoyable. A usual customer service job. But I loved the most being able to work with others and myself.

The most enjoyable part is working with customers daily and growing relationships with them."
good,"I worked part-time for Christmas one year, great work enviorment, I learned people are the same as they were the last time I work retail, the hardest part was, everyone is in a hurry at Christmas, but for the most part realized they would have to wait a little while.

Management was really reliable, they were always there to listen and offer a solution.. There were so many co-workers i didnt get to meet them all!! but it was fun and very relaxing to see so many faces and have some good conversations."

"
good,"JCPenney, overall, is a good company to work for. Company warrants ownership over your workload so it is not too micro-managed."
good,"I only wished this was a full time job, honestly. Even though we were all getting up around 3 or 4 to get to work at 5, it was a decent and easy job, but the people I got to work with made it just awesome."

good,A typical day at work would be busy.
good,It's a over all good job with some benefits such as discounts.
good,Normally i would assist customers by checking them out and giving them helpful advice on a gift or just a outfit they needed help on.

good,I loved working here but the hours and pay were hard to work with
good,"I started working for J.C. Penny in 2002. Love this department store, always a great atmosphere, and terrific people. This store gave me my very first job and boy was I shook with what I had to do. The fact that I absolutely love fashion, help selling it was a plus. But it was sort of difficult for me to really grab it by the horns and ride it out. My position was very short lived due to harsh management at that time. All I have to say about that is, if you going to blame something serious on an employee, make sure you have all your t's crossed and your i's dotted. Definitely, don't terminated someone only means of income without substantial proof that they did the unthinkable! If you can't find any evidence, then more likely, the person didn't do what's being accused. Working in retail took me by surprise, but also has it demands. Overall J.C. Penny is still a excellent store to shop and I continue to spend my cash there."
good,A typical day at work would be me clocking in and starting my shift by helping out a customer or ring a customer up. I learned how to deal with customers during good and bad times. I really didn't do any management. I enjoyed co-works they helped me out a lot cause that was my first job. the only hardest part of my job i would have to say was the register. I enjoyed meeting and helping new people.
good,Excellent place to develop customer service skills. There is a wide variety of duties to be performed daily. It is a good place to work.
good,Great customers.
good,I enjoy my job and the p eople that I work with very much. The benefits are okay but things are becoming more unstable latey with the layoffs that have occured in the past year.

I learned how to manage my time, cut hair faster and more efficiently, how to build my clientele and maintain their continued business. Management in the salon was wonderful, I could always ask for help when needed and always received support and encouragement which helped me to succeed. I thought of my co-workers as family and absolutely loved the opportunity to work with them. The hardest part of the job for me was learning to gain more self confidence. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know my co-workers and each and every client I had."

good,JCPenney is a huge company but each store is like a family. Everyone cares about each other. There’s lots to learn about every little thing in each store.
good,Very good job and you are very busy at the job. Everyone there is very helpful and will help you in the job. You really have to work hard at it. The more you do the better.
good,I enjoyed working at JCP however it closed down in my town so had to seek work else where. But the people I worked with were amazing and supportive. I really enjoyed working there.
good,Management likes to make last minute schedule changes and lack of staffing and open registers having people ring up merchandise other than fine jewelry at the jewelry counter. Vacations don't get approved easily due to the lack of coverage. Just got frustrated with the lack of support and the feeling that the company doesn't care and left.
good,It’s a very fare company but fast paced during holidays. You must call in if you don’t plan on coming in to work & you only get 3 no shows before you get fired.
good,"Mixed hours, poor communication. Doing job opposite of what was told to me. Feel like tug of war going on sometimes. If you like retail, this is a good place to work."
good,It really just depends you and the people you work with and for. You have wiggle your way in to get somewhere always ask if anyone needs an extra hand or if you could be useful elsewhere once you are done with your tasks. That's what I did and I got noticed and praised for the work i do.
good,I love work with customer. I also love to be behind the Scenes. Good customer service is what I stand for. I am also looking to go into management eventually in the future.
good,"I have learned to do many things and different jobs besides the one in which I was hired for.But I'm the kind of person that likes a challenge, alot of people get hired for a job and become stuck in the same routine slowly become unhappy with what they do. Hardest part about my job is getting people to do as their asked to make sure that things are on track for the company. Most enjoyable part of my job,is knowing that I go to work to achieve goals that benefit the company , customer & myself. This is a typical day at work."
good,I have a great seasonal job working at JCP. The place gives me a hands on and visual learning environment. Which makes it great place to work and have great Co workers and postive working environment as well.

good,I worked here and really enjoyed it. Everyone was friendly and got along. If anything the gym was kind of scary but she just really cared about the company which i understand now that I am older. The only downside was minimum wage but that’s okay for someone still living at home.

good,"JCPenny was a good place to work, its beneficial if you want to create good social skills. The managers are very considerate and kind. You have to be able to work fast and quick so you can get a lot done. Having good memory will also help you help customers with the items they’re looking for. Get the job you were assigned done then look for another. I don’t regret working at JCPenny, workers get a discount on clothing and other items just before or after your shift. It’s a good place to work if you plan on working in retail later on, very much recommend this to high schools looking to find their first jobs. This is a wonderful place to work and you gain a lot when yo leave, especially when it comes to maintaining responsibility! Work at JCPenny!!"
good,"Fair, however had some issue with h&r. I had sought a transfer and they were hindering my interviews request at new location due to confidentiality breech and other poor judgement pertaining to my health"
good,Got promoted pretty quick. For someone starting out a could be a great start out. I got promoted in 4 months so it was reallya great start. Some thinngs to expect is get a positive outlook with angry or stressful customers.
good,"I loved working here, even though I only worked here for a short time I would love to go back, the only thing I didn’t like was there was a little bit of drama but that’s any place you work. I didn’t let the drama get to me. I just did my job to make sure the customers were happy."
good,Great for part-time positions. Great paid incentives for most credit card sales. Flexible hours. And has many locations to relocate. Great for students.

Overall,the experience was wonderful and if given the opportunity I'd do it all over again. A typical day of work for me included buying breakfast, getting dressed, clocking in and attending our morning meetings,then unlocking the doors for the waiting customers.i would then proceed to do my daily duties,which included but were not limited to, assisting customers, ringing the cash register,retrieving online orders,etc.Some days I hated to leave work, others I'd be relieved.the management team was very friendly, easy to get along with.There was never really a difficult part of the job for me, the easiest part of the job was assisting the customers efficiently and thoroughly. The workplace culture was very friendly and tolerable."
good,"friendly staff, and flexible  hours. never a dull moment. love working at JCPenney if your are looking for a Part Time this is the place to be.the holiday are exteremly busy but fun...."
good,"The work was mundane in a way that is a good thing when on your feet so much. You sort out clothes, help customers, and before you know it your shift is over. There's something gratifying in helping others, even in something so simple as directing them where to go to find what theyre looking for. The hardest part was in the beginning getting used to all the standing, as well as occasional customers who are angry and take it out on you as an employee. But it's important not to lose your temper, however tempting it may be at times to give someone rude a piece of your mind, its not in the job description, and theres a chance in such a big store with so many tourists, you'll just never see them again."
good,"very good management , super team oriented company. they will promote you when they see a good work ethic . you could defiantly make a career  out of this job."

good,"I worked long and hard but the efforts were recognized and rewarded.  The people I worked with were like family in many way and a joy to be around, even on tough days.  My typical day started around 7:00 and ended around 6:00, but that was by choice and always appreciated by my superiors buy never requested."
good,"Working at JCPennys I ran the cash registers, I made displays for clothing. I did a lot of different tasks assigned to me. I was also promoted to the shoe department where I was able to earn commission. It was a great place to work."

good,"The moment you arrive, you stay busy.  Taking items back to appropriate departments, to fixing clothing racks.  I learned that the retail side can be a bit stressful.  I was a seasonal employee, so I spent several days switching between opening and closing.  I enjoyed pricing and stocking.  The hardest part was the language barrier.  I really enjoyed meeting and helping so many different kinds of people."

good,"I enjoyed working at jcp, made many good friends over the years, the position I held was just right for what I wanted during that period of time. I have nothing  unpleasant to say. The management always accommodated me and was very fair. But I was a very good employee and could be trusted."
good,A lot of money was at steak. You have to be aware of your surroundings and make sure is put away properly to avoid theft. Loved every single coworker.
good,"pay is great & great work environment. just there are some people that are willing to work with & teach you and there are other people who do the opposite. only problem is the points system if you get 10 points in a year you get fired, have to wait a whole year until it resets to 0."
good,I learn here customer service. Work place was very nice. You get to know you daily customer that would go shopping all the time. You would get discount.
good,Working as a merchandiser for JCPenney was great! I got to follow planograms and decorate stores many depts overnight. Play dress up with mannequins and got great discounts on merchandise.
good,JCP is a great place to work at if you are just starting in the work environment as well as great people and experiences. We believe that all the associates should get recognized for their great work.
good,I would have to scan the box and push it down a line all night I worked third shift . All of the mangers was nice half the time I got paid 11.00 dollars an hour I also had a new born so the hours was a little crazy so I now longer work there.
good,"Loved it. But they shut down and stopped printing their big catalog. Short breaks though. Very difficult for some people to be on time, but overall great place to work"
good,Jcpennys was fun I liked meeting all new people and I Emory fashion. some nights get stressful when it comes down to the end of the night and theres only a couple of you left to clean out all the dressing rooms and organize the store.
good,"it was my first job so it was to be as expected, but short lived. the management was nice and for it to be a department store, we would get out at a nice time every night."
good,"JC Penney is a good job that is easy to go back to every day. Unfortunately, being the business they are, they don't really care about your personal life or will allow you to have family time. They will work you until you physically cannot work anymore, and wont pay you respectively.."
good,Fun place to work. Great team and management. The only con is when it gets slow you will likely be put at a quad by yourself at night. Night time there is alot of clean up.
good,One of my favorite jobs because management was kind and understanding. But required great attention to detail especially during sales and check out with constant promotion changes and not a price tag to scan in the register a mistype could overcharge someone.
good,nothing i dont have anything to say was just a temp job and i needed the money to take care of my family. The people was really nice but some employees could be really messy.
good,"I loved working here, very fun place to work. Kept me busy all day most days. Nice staff. Store was fairly clean most days and easy to manage. Frequently kept organized. Over all great place to work, never felt like I was treated unfairly nor other workers treated unfairly."

good,"*Greeted and helped customers locate products, handed out flyers, or conducted intranet search for product."
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work if you only want to work 15-20 hours a week. Pay isn’t great, and there’s no room for advancement whatsoever. Good coworkers, and a good discount."
good,"I had no idea what I was expecting.  For the most part, the salon was always neat and tidy.  Never had an issue with a client ( even though I was fresh out of school) only issue I had was with a couple of employees, but nothing a tough skin couldn't handle."
good,"The skills I did was putting the clothes back, working on the cash register and helping customers. Helping the customer find clothes and locate where they need to go."
good,I loved working here and the people that I worked with. I got pregnant and needed more for my baby. LendNation offered benefits and better wages so I started there. Definitely missed my coworkers though.
good,I would recommend working there. The discounts are great. the bonuses were great as well. The managers were very nice and friendly. I loved working there when I was there.
good,I will recommend this job to anyone. I enjoyed working there. My bosses and co workers were fun to be around and they made the day go fast. I only left because of a sudden family emergency.
good,Start the day hard and finish even harder. I learned leadership skills. Management is satisfactory. Work place is good overall. Hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the pace.
good,"It was nice working as a stylist at JC Penny. I catered to a diverse clientele. I was able to learn as well as work. There were times it was fun and full of laughs, there were time it was stress, busy, and chaotic with people, but overall I enjoyed making other feel and look beautiful about themselves."
good,"I am a very part time employee.  I do not have any expectations from J.C. Penney's as far as advancing. Because I am not pursuing it.  They are a wonderful company with a GREAT management staff.  I just need make more money to provide for my bills as I am the only one in my household that is working."
good,Very busy inbound call center. I learned to be patient with elderly people that shop online. The management was okay there. I liked how upbeat the workplace was. The calls were constant back to back and a lot of customers complained that was the hardest part. I enjoyed helping people place orders and track them that was the easiest part.
good,"Positive attitude, helping others, fast paced environment, memorization, suggestive sales, helping to make others experiences easier, quicker and happier."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping customers find and get what they wanted. Seeing their faces of gratitude was enough to make my day. The hardest part was closing time. Managers sometimes where a little stressed about the whole processed and in returned employees were also stressed because they wanted to please the managers. Most of the time the store didn't end up cleaned and organize because of bad management.
good,Management cares for your well being and always makes sure your are doing okay. They take your side and the culture of people is amazing. Everyone works well together.
good,JCPenneys has a nice salon with a lot of training which made it especially nice for continuing education. It has a nice atmosphere for the clients that come into the salon.

good,This job is great for high school graduates or if you are trying to build up your resume super friendly environment and great hours also manegament is on point and wiling to work with you and your life schedule.
good,"Safe environment. Managers are very sweet and do their best to make sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing. I learned to greet other customers and make them my first priority while they are shopping. Our main focus in the store is to keep it clean and help the customer find what they are searching for,whether it is online or in store. You may have the choice of ordering from another store or by ordering online in case if the item can not be found in the store.  The hardest part of the job is not finding an item online for a customer and leaving the customer with no other choice but having to obtain an item from a different store. Everyone overall is very sweet and ready to take on any task that they are given. Associates are very work driven and this is very important"

good,"I worked there for awhile as a 2nd and 3rd job to cover the medical expenses that were left over from my hysterectomy.  I learned how to repair jewelry, became diamond certified through online training, and I met a lot of fascinating people who I still see out and about today and remember the great customer service I gave them in finding that special piece of jewelry that they were looking for.  The hardest part of the job was opening the ancient safe when opening the store on the weekend mornings since I have a Mon-Fri 8:30-5 job, so I would have to have assistance with that task.  That is the safe that held jewelry repairs that customers were picking up.  What I did learn is that management there was not always available when needed, especially for the new employees."

I have enjoyed working for this company I will miss it dearly."
good,I would recommend my friends to work there my experience there was very good. I learned great customer service skills working at Jcpennys. you get really good benefits working there as well. management at my store was awesome as well.
good,"A Typical day at JCPenney is setting up new shoe displays, answering phone calls, and making sure we help out the customer the best way we can.  The only reason i rated the Benefits with one star is because i was seasonal so i was not there long enough to know if they have great benefits. The hardest part about the job was leaving. I had learned so much, and met great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when i helped a customer out, and they left that day with a smile on their face."
good,I gained speed workih at Jcpenney because of the fact that we had to have all of the merchandice on the floor by specfic deadlines each day. It was a great experience.
good,"I would either open in the morning or close at night.  Inventory had to counted for at both times.  I loved selling - and I was really good at it, my nickname was Bling Bling.  I did not like the competitiveness because other employees didn't like it when I would meet and beat my quota for sales."
good,"You will spend your day taking calls, you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. There are lots of opportunity for over time if desired. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the systems at first, but once you get that down it's pretty easy going."

good,I enjoyed working at JCP for almost 7 years. I was given the chance to be a supervisor over training. I appreciate the opportunity to advance when I wanted.I enjoyed helping people find clothing for special occasions.
good,JC Penney was a great place to work.  I enjoy working with the public and helping people.  Management at the store were great.  The only problem was it was only part-time and would never grow into a full time position.  I need a full time job with some benefits like vacations and holidays off.
good,I love my time over there just wish it wasn't a seasonal job. I have learn a lot and it helps to grow and be better for the future. I hope to have another opportunity soon.
good,"Honestly, I loved working with JcPenny but at times it was tough to deal with the rude customers but I learned how to deal with myself in those situations"
good,I worked in throughout high school and college. Environment was great and really learned a lot of on the job skills. Management was great in helping you achieve goals to help once you found your lifelong career. I could go to my manager about anything and she would take the time to answer questions or find the answer. I would recommend working here to anyone!

good,"There can be a lot of politics in retail. Find yourself and be the reason everyone else shows up for work. Loved the Cape Girardeau, MO location. Great employees."
good,"Working at J.C.Penny gave me an appreciation on peoples feelings , because when you go into a store you expect to receive exactly what you asked for. On a day working there I would greet customers with ""Hello, did you need help finding anything specific today?"" and if they said yes I would make sure they would leave the store satisfied. If I could not help a customer I would call someone working in that department to help the customer. Customer service is so important."
good,"I have worked for JCP in two different states on more than one occasion. It has always been a good fit for me, when I needed a job. I like the interaction with customers."
good,"I had a very enjoyable experience at the JC Penney's' I worked at in New York. The hour long breaks, when we worked 6 1/2 or more hours, were incredible. During the holiday season, lunch was provided many times. I loved the encouragement from management all around."
good,Jcpenney is a wonderful atmosphere with wonderful managers that assist you when needed. I work with great co-workers we are great with helping each other when needed. The hardest part of the job is making sure things are neat and clean. The most enjoyable is that you get to interact with the public and meet there needs. I have learned so much especially using a cash register.
good,Great Company to work. While the current JCP is not what I worked for years ago I can say that the values and family initiatives that were founded and locked onto were followed as core and did not have any bias on business. Bottom line if it was a business decision bad or good then you were aware of it way before it happened and there were no suprises and or punches to be pulled.

good,My passion for this industry is amazing and continues to elevate. My title with Jcp is Artistic Master and which i have the opportunity to mentor new stylist to engaging with trendy techniques and hands on training. The hardest part of my job is keeping busy because this is what i love. The most enjoyable part is having a manager that believes in you and All that you offer the company and you excels.
good,Fun workplace and excellent management team !!! Managers are very hard working and co-workers have taught me a lot !!! It has been was of my best working experience !!!
good,"I was a retail photographer working with jcpenny portrait studios. I learned a lot that I was very quickly able to apply to my photography skills, that ended up making me better as a overall photographer. I was an on-call person most of the time so I can't say a whole lot. a typical day involved getting a customer and their family ready for picture taking then you create/edit the photos to sell to the customer. you also answer phones to schedule, create, and manage appointments. the pay is awesome, but It was only seasonal."
good,wait on customers process credit sales payments etc. there is no part of the job I consider hard. I need a full time job. I love what I do at jc Penney I need 40 plus hours
good,Try your best and you will succeed. I love this job I really wish I couldve stayed. We had 15 min breaks which was nice.  Some customers was really rude.  Others was amazing and understanding
good,"Use to work at the Roseville location in Michigan and the staff was awesome and the store manager was Amazing to work for. Literally, the best boss I have ever worked for. Department managers are pretty cool although you will have the occasional ones who let having some power go to their head. Overall it's a great place to work."

good,I enjoy working in the retail world. However department stores tend to have a hard up keep due to the shopper and worker ratio.
good,I really enjoyed working at JC Penney's. I think this company has strong customer based values that show in their sales. The hardest part of the job was probably working with the P.O.S. systems during the busier hours of the store. I loved having the opportunity to explore different store departments and the career advancements that Penney's has to offer.
good,Working for JC Penney Salon is such fun experience. I started off as a receptionist last year and is almost on the verge of being promoted to level 2 out of 3 stylist.  The hours are very flexible and everyday I'm learning new things not only in the salon but within JC Penney in general.
good,"I was employed at JCPenney during the holiday season, and overall I didn't like my experience there. Manager were nowhere to be found. When it was my time to be on the floor, I didn't have a schedule as to which department, I would be working in that day etc."
good,This was a good first retail experience. I learned how to fold clothes and attend customers and use a different type of register.
good,"Great place to work, most of staff very friendly as should be in a customer service environment, will work around your schooling as long as you don't give your exact school schedule, Don't always take into account the time to get there or the fact that you may have to stay after to get additional help"
good,"Typical day at work started with checking previous days sales results, emails, and touchbases. Learned how to manage multiple projects at once while motivating a team to drive results. My co-workers consisted of a team of 30+ individuals in territories across the country. Hardest part of the job was to fight with payroll to get tasks completed in store. Enjoyed working with a great team."
good,It has been a while since i worked in this company. As i recall working here i had a good experience. I do remember enjoying my work and time there as a sales associate.

good,"A typical day at the office, would be a status meeting with the business on the current project. I would lead the meeting and discuss the testing and assist the users with UAT. "
good,"Kept very busy."
good,"Its a great company to work for, the job is challenging an there are good rewards for hard work. but its very hard to excel in the company without education, or experience. Managers are always hiring more part time employees instead of giving the loyal employees full time."
good,A typical day at work would consist of taking photographs of families and children. The hardest part of the job was keeping the children all looking in the same direction. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the family reaction when they reviewed their pictures.
good,"Typical day would be busy working at the mall. I've leanred a lot on this job on how to be proficient customer service wise as well as productive in the work/task I was assigned to do.Also,became very good at sizing men for suits,knowing what each customer wants style,fit,feel,etc.co-workers helped me also be successful in my time there building me to be one of the best workers in the district for several months.Hardest part of the job was being more than one place at a time trying to keep my customers happy which later I had adapted to and became much more productive and manageable."

good,"My typical day would begin and end with processing special orders for customers on window coverings, bedding ensembles, and other home decorative ideas by phone,faxing special order forms, and catalog entry on the terminal.  We loved helping our customers and one of the associates would always be acknowledged for reaching goals.

good,"I lost my job for budget cuts, but the people were awesome to work for. They don't have a lot of hours to give out for most of the year, but they do try to work with you. Great associate discounts."
good,"I enjoy working at JCPenney, but it is a great part-time job. My co-workers are very nice and is a great team who really like to work together."
good,Friendly working environment. My fellow co-workers were fun and made my day go by swift and efficiently. The customers were friendly and open for change. The only thing that I would say negative about JCPenney is they changed their policies too much.
good,The people and management was awesome and it was a fun environment! I loved everyone there and management was really awesome.
good,"helping customers finding what they are looking for and making them happy"
good,"JCPenney is a department store that sales clothing,fashion jewelry, and accessories. I am currently a cashier. You provide customer service, handle purchases and returns, and maintain standards in the department."
good,"I would come in put out new items and straighten out sales floor. I would assist customers with purchases and give them ideas for future purchases."
good,JCPenneys was a great place to work. The co-workers were like family and we worked well together as a team. The management worked very well to keep the employee morale up. I miss this job very much.

I learned how to accomplish more on the job depending my schedule. The hardest part of the job was to keep it tidy specially on holidays and closing times which was daily."
good,"I loved working for JC Penney, it was a great environment, and my coworkers were always there to help with anything that i needed help with."
good,"I would open the childrens department area in the mornings everyday and I loved my job! I have kids and so it was easy for me to help customers with their purchases and knowlege of the name brand of clothing that they wanted and that was in style,  I recieved awards for selling and promoting credit cards for the company many times, I also got alot of customer call in and reviews on my skills and how i helped them and had great customer service skills. It was was busy and we did have alot of clean up during hoildays and back to school times. I did have great relationships with regular customers and on first name basis. I had a great relationship with my management team also they were great to work for as well as my team."
good,"I generally worked all over the store simply because I was cross trained in all departments. The management is ok, but could use some training. A lot of managers do not have the common sense or decision making skills, which can effect the store as a whole due to some of their decisions. Honestly, this job was fairly easy and I enjoyed not knowing what that day had in store for me since I was in different areas. Some co-workers were very stubborn, while others were very friendly and people I saw outside of work. The thing I enjoyed the most was helping customers find the perfect outfit, accessory, or gift and getting to make their day a better one."
good,"A typical day would be working so hard and get paid less then minimum wage , What I learned about working there is you need to be patient and work hard to get what you need , My co workers were so much fun they felt like family more then co workers , The management was not that great with schedules."
good,My overall time with JCPenney was good. We went through ups and downs as a company but overall we are a good company. There were a lot of opportunities for growth and development.

A typical day at work for me was opening cash drawers in the morning, ringing out customers on the cash register, organizing and stocking clothing and helping customers with what ever they needed."
good,"On a typical day, I will work directly with the customers in fine jewelry. I also am able to handle customer complaints quickly if they should arise without consulting a manager. I have been trained in several area of the stores. I enjoy working with my co-workers and the management always makes it a fun place to work by awarding us  when we reach or exceed sales goals. It is difficult to advance though as there are only six supervisor positions and very rarely are there openings in them."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy. Customer satisfaction is always the main focus. Making sure our guest have an enjoyable shopping experience. Processing purchases, returns, special orders, credit card sign ups, and applications. And much more. The hardest part of the job is when equipment doesn't work the way it should or trying to please and appease difficult customers. My management is always there to stand by the associates and lend a helping hand. I've learned to stay calm when situations get tense. Always show excellent customer service even when circumstances are challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the support and fun I have with my co workers and making customers happy."
good,"its alot of work but i manage to work well with my coworkers and tio provide great customer service"
good,"JC Penny Optical was a great place to work! I love my optician and the Dr. in our office! I had to leave for personal reasons and the management and dr had changed by the time I was able to come back so I choose not to, but while I was there I very much enjoyed my job! The customers were fantastic! Rarely saw a rude face and they were very appreciative of my help! I loved working in an office setting and would love a job like this again!"

good,"Loved my job, sadly ended due to large amount of store closings. Salon could use some updates and more advertisement. Classes are a little outdated. Retail sales are easy because this company has great sales on products. Downfall is I had to deal with a lot of diverters and instead of refusal to sell I had to go by company standards which are way to high."
good,I enjoyed my time at JCP. I was able to gain commission in my dept and dress up nicely in a pretty calm environment. I learned how to be patient and helpful to peoples' needs and enhance my customer service skills!
good,"allowed me to express myself with my style, great co workers didn't care for disrespectful customers, management professional as well as great to work with, and good working environment for both employer as well as employees."

good,I enjoyed working for J.C. Penney.  The Department Manager and the Store Manager were great and gave me the opportunity to begin my career in fine jewelry.
good,"Even though JCPenney will b closing its doors in Waterloo, it was a great place to work. The environment is friendly, the Supervisors are amazing people to work with/for."
good,The bond and dedication of the employee is what makes being apart of the team worth wild. The co workers are always willing to help one another. I have gained some really great friends along the way that I will cherish for a lifetime.
good,A typical night at work would start off with all ten employees getting the carts ready to unpack the merchandize. i worked overnights. once all the boxes where unpack we would have a meeting and would head out to our departments. i did kids department with one co-worker. we would size the iteams and put out what was needed. we also had to take off iteams that were over stack. the last thing we would do was back stock.
good,It was a fun place to work but low pay. They were more concerned if you processed a credit application than actually making a sale.
good,Great company however their future is uncertain like many retail chains in the current marketplace. Positive attitude within the store regarding private and workplace balance. Easy to accommodate customers and create long lasting relationships
good,Fun environment with a lot of satisfying moments. I learned a lot about the ins and outs of managements. Working with irate clients are the most difficult.

good,Company was great. Provides understanding and Balance to Work and Home. Room for advancements with relocation options. Benefits were amazing. This company give back to there employees. Co-workers on the team I was on were professional and a pleasure to work with. Management within Loss Prevention was great was developed and trained. Depending on your location the opinion of management changes for me. As well as the balance of Work/ Family
good,"Assist multiple customers at a time"
good,"First thing id do everyday at work is clock in of course, than check all the food bins out front to see if any need to be refilled, than id fill the ice machine, sweep the floor, cleaned the tables, restock the soda machine and chip rack, than begin making subs. The busiest time of day while working at subway was at lunch time, between the hours of 11am and 3pm, there was always a nonstop line of customers during these hours, we were always super busy at this time. The hardest part of my job id have to say is, refilling the soda fountain because you have to add a certain amount of water to each kind of soda and it gets confusing at times.The most enjoyable part of my job, was coming incontact with so many different people each and everyday."
good,I enjoyed my time there. It was short due to the Holiday season. The Company was well ran. I helped customers with their shoe selections. I did not enjoy being on my feet for long hours at a time. I did truly enjoy working with and for people

good,A typical day at work is being behind the chair making clients look and feel beautiful! I have learned so much from the previous salon I worked at and have carried it over to my current position. The management is great! I couldn't ask for a better manager that is understanding. I absolutely adore my co-workers. They have turned into family and we always work as a team. The hardest part of the job is only getting 25 hours a week right now. The most enjoyable part of the job is having passion for what you do for a living and knowing that you're following dream.
good,I only worked there as seasonal help but I really enjoyed it. I needed a part time flexible schedule and they gave really great employee discounts.
good,"Great place to work,  "

good,Good job for teenagers in high school or anybody who like just a job on the side
good,I liked my job. It was my first time working at a cash register and I learned more about money and how to count my drawer. The management was very professional. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was counting the till. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed.
good,I love enteracting with the public and this job allowed me to do that.
good,I loved being able to interact with customers and help them find things. my co workers were awesome and jcpenney was a great part time job.
good,Great company! The training is awesome and the supervisors are nice
good,"My JCPenney store was a great place to work. Just about everyone there was team-focused and would do whatever they could to help each other on a daily basis. The managers (for the most part) were a great bunch (particularly the store leader) and would help you learn and get as far as you wanted and were able to go in Penneys. Unless you became too good at one thing, in which case they would make you do that 95% of the time, even if you hated it, and wanted to do more with your career there than just that."
good,"Stay busy, learn more about chemicals and styles, co-workers was great, but the hardest part is keeping up with customers"
good,"Typical day at work would be folding clothes, working on cash registers, or on the sales floor making add on sales. What I've learned from work is that not all customers are nice. Black Friday was the worst day to work with angry customers. The managers are very cool and understandable. The hardest part of the job is going to look for online orders in the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job is working around clothes because I love clothes!"
good,"I had a great experience working here honestly. If there came a time where I would be in need of an occupation, I would definitely go back to JCP. There is a lot of opportunity."

good,I liked working in Jewelry it gave the opportunity get to know my clients where I could call them about particular sales.
good,I stocked items after getting them off the truck to where they need to go the hours was from 6:00 am to 12:00 noon everyday.
good,Very nice place to work. Little room for advancement though.
good,Worked with jcp for a few months and had an ok time working there
good,"Since working at JCPenney the company has made some changes, but my time there was wonderful. They worked well with my high school class schedule and gave me the exact amount of hours I asked for, and stuck strictly to my preferred availability. They hired me as holiday help and I got a great employee discount. 25% off everything! The holiday season was madness, and on Black Friday I worked a 9 hour shift straight without a lunch or a break, but that wasn't management's fault. They asked me if I would like to take my lunch and everyone was so overwhelmed that I opted not to take it and help out. In return they gave me 2 days off that I didn't ask for. They're great about personal appearances and management told me they would be okay with my fresh dyed fire truck red hair color. The pay is average, but making $7.75 per hour to fold clothes and play with a touch screen cash register isn't all that bad. They didn't offer me much opportunity for advancement because once January came, corporate called the store I worked at and said that they couldn't keep any of the holiday help, even though we proved we were worthy of remaining with the company."

I got along with all employees but usually there's always that one you didn't too much get along with but other than that it was fun and I looked forward to going to work.

good,"a normal day at work consists of keeping the men's department as clean as possible, making sales goals and credit goals, and keep track of Levi's sold that day. From working at JC Penny's, Staples and the Yorba Linda Country Club I have learned work with my fellow co-workers, and I have learned how best to keep my sales in line with my overall production at the company. I know it is vital to get my work done and achieve goals set by the company for that day or for longer. I have felt that management is key to being able to delegate properly the tasks that need to be done and by whom they need to be done by. Management should also not be overly forceful, and allow for some creative intuition by the employee when designated because me and my coworkers have the ability to work and accomplish what we need to do when asked. The hardest part of my job has been dealing with customers that will ignore me during my work day while I try and make the store look neat and they just mess it up as I go by every table."

good,"A typical day at J.C. Penney's start off with me doing a walk through to see what departments are going to needed the replenishment team help. Along the way I help out with customer service, by either asking a question, check the customer out, or directing them to a department or item that they are trying to find. I also help out with package pickup. Package pickup is for customer who bought items but they are to heavy for them to carry so we carry down stairs to package pickup. The customer then pick up the phone to let the operate know that they have some items in package pickup and we come and load it in their car free of charge. All my manger and co-worker are very nice in commuicated to me with areas are going to need help. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is package pickup especially around the spring when we have alot of patio items being sold in the home department. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to put a smile on my customers faces after I get done help them."

There really is no advancement at all just from designer to senior to master based on how much money is brought in NOT on skill. The manager is hardly ever in the actual salon

good,"Enjoyed working for this employer. I’ve learn a lot about merchandising and sales. The downside is the company priority is to sell customers the credit card, which create a very competitive environment. On the downside, most employees loose confidence and feel that their job is not secure due to not being able to make their quota."
good,The pay is what the state start pay. Plus $ 2.00 extra if customer FILLED out a credit card and got approved. That's what the Managers focused on. They hire for seasonal and if you don't get enough people to fill out credit card application and get approved they look down on you. And let you go at the end of the seasonal work

good,"Love the customer interaction working in the Fine Jewlry dept. At JCPenney store in medford, Iregon."
good,"JcPenney was a good job for me. I worked there for just over 5 years. I was promoted from sales associate to supervisor after my first tem months and then did not even get considered for another promotion any other time in that 5 plus years.

They were willing to work with me with whatever! Also they know how to talk to people I never had a rude encounter I honestly wish the company I am with now was as nice and supportive as they were.

good,"A typical day at JCPenny, I would arrive into work at 6:00 am and would down stack the truck and put the merchandise to the floor. I learned how to be efficient with putting to floor"
good,"fun place,"
good,"I loved working at JCP. It was perfect for me while I was going to school. Since it was part time work salary wasn't to high ($9 an hour). It was basic retail duties, keep the merchandise presentable, ring up customers, stay positive. I only left JCP because I transferred to a new college and the one located near where I was moving wasn't hiring."
good,the optical was int the middle of JC penney . So i saw a lot of people . I love who I worked with . This job was was the one that made me  pursue my career in optics .
good,I arrive at work check the duties for that day. I ask customers what they need help finding. JCPenny had a great work environment and the co-workers was very friendly.
good,"Working here was a great experience. My managers worked with my school schedule and gave me the training I needed. When I did have a question, managers were easily accesible and knowlegable. I knew I didn't have to worry about not knowing something, allowing me to use my full potential. The hardest part of this job is reading customers to find out what they're actually looking for. The easiest and best part is when you find what they're looking for and they thank you for your assisance. I learned how to size people for suits."
good,"fun and we were all treated like family, we had dinner on holidays like family at work, the only down side is there were not many hours for the employees."
good,"Great place to excell"
good,Wonderful place to work both with employees and customers. Time goes by fast when you enjoy your work space. I've never had to deal with an irate customer.
good,nice i really enjoyed myself very family welcoming. the  shift vares but they work with your school schudule. the pay is excellent 20 dollars an hour help with my kids at home
good,"A typical day at work for me was an early morning shift pushing out the merchandise, clearance, re-ticketing, signing, and folding. I learned the signs need to be up-to-date and accurate and clothes need to be put away in a certain way/area. The management was good; they checked up on us to see if we were doing okay and helped us learn new tasks and to be better at the old ones. JC Penney is a pretty culturally diverse place along with its location, Joliet. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was put out correctly and signs were certain. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers were all nice, helpful, and funny, and my tasks could be done quietly, relaxed, and independently."
good,"I work in the fine jewelry department . JCPenney is super flexible with the hours you need . But sometimes manager is bad with communication and just changes your schedule and the staff is small but is family like , I enjoy working here . They usually try to give you the off days you need for anything special you have to do on the side from party’s , trips and family emergencies."
good,Its a good place to work at. Everyone is friendly and very helpful when you need help or have questions. And there is always something to do in there so you are never bored.

good,"It was a really cool place to work I got to pick when I take a break 2 15 min breaks and 1 30 min lunch break I loved my coach she was so nice they play alot of games and you win prizes all the time, the only thing I didn't like was the cafeteria served food you had to buy and they do not deduct it from your pay and I feel like they should"
good,"a positive work space , calm and relaxed . i love helping out customers and organizing the store was really fun. very fun during holidays and you can feel good"
good,"all things hair, cash handling, customer service. I love what I do. Everyday is different. I get to meet and talk to new people everyday. I want to do more"
good,"It is a great work environment. The managers are informative hey of the company. They keep you informed of the changes that take place. It has great work ethics. The hardest part of the job is closing the store at closing, getting the store back to the basic.The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting the customer."
good,Working at jcpenney during the holiday season is very stressful because it gets very packed lines backed up in the store. I learned to deal with anger customers and to remain calm.
good,"have only worked there for a year but considering somewhere else. first GM was great and had been at Penney's long enough to retire, our new GM came from a different store and is changing the store into what they came from. Seems to only care about the bottom line instead of the people that work for them."
good,"Great place to work. Great management, good staff and a great team altogether.operations of daily activities seam to work well from the front of the house to the back. Well organized, well staffed, and associates seem to really help others out when they know their employees are struggling thru difficulty times. (with family and other issues pertaining to life)"
good,I enjoy the fast pace work and the ability to move up within the company. I enjoy the associates i work with and my Supervisor. Wages are good because you can go from base salary to max within a months
good,I worked at a JC penny that was part of the mall. It was a good experience. I love my co workers. It was just a very good group of worker till be around. But had to catch up on school and only one car at the time. Family was using it to another job.
good,JCP was a fun pace to work people were great and the management would help out with closing and getting everyone out as soon as possible. some cons would be the pay and the location depending on what store you are at can be bad. pros would be the are flexible with hours and will work with you.
good,its just kinda bland they make you take group breaks and lunches. they make you do everything in a group like you are a baby. it isn't really a lively place to work and you don't really learn much.
good,I honestly loved working at JCPenney the environment was amazing and i was excited to go to work everyday to be honest the whole staff was amazing we always shared a laugh or two together

good,"I think it is always important to have a great team, it makes the work environment better and thats what i liked about jcpenney everyone there was so nice to each other."
good,I enjoy my job i work in different department of the store.  I learn some new things. The only thing was the hardest dealing with the customers. Its was a easy job.
good,I love working with everyone in the salon and register. Manager is great and coworkers are too. I could work here forever this place is a little fast paced but easy
good,"Very friendly work environment, professional and courteous managers. Slow paced for the most part although it is known to get rushes of people. Co workers are always willing to lend a hand."
good,"JC penny's was my very job, very nice to get used to, the big thing about retail is customer service, presentation, and cleanliness . making sure your customers are happy is always number one goal."
good,Sephora cosmetics made a bug entry into JCP and the customers loved it !  We were able to introduce them to many new products and show them tricks with cosmetics that made their day fun !
good,Time management is the name of the game. Fall behind could mean that a suspect goes unnoticed in other stores. For the most part this place is fun to work at.
good,"Very cut throat due to one employees jealously, insecurity, and childish behaviors, Supervisor knew about it and played game with her,,,making this employee very uncomfortale and a very stressful work environment"

good,I loved this job the most. I worked long hours but it was fun. I was able to bring in the truck and work the floor. I got a chance to arrange departments and make suggestions that were actually taken.

good,"JC Penney is a really cool place to work, especially for temporary work. They're really flexible when it comes to your schedule. Great for summer or to get some extra money for the holidays"
good,Fast paced environment. Low pay for the type of work that is done however co workers are nice and so is management. They give raises and incentives to employees.
good,Jcpenney's was a good company to work for very fast pace during holidays  but slower pace in between . I love working with the public meeting new people and offering my expertise on catalog sales . I enjoyed making people happy by the time they leave my desk after placing catalog orders and applying for a credit card and being approved the best part of my day. Management for the most part attended to our needs as store associates their really was no hardest part of the job as long as you apply yourself anything was possible.
good,"I love working here. I got an amazing promotion with great pay and benefits. The new manager is amazing, very involved with the store, the hours can be exausting at times with the evening shifts and weekends but overall the hours are pretty good."

good,"Assess customers needs and provide assistance and information on product features"
good,"I literally grew up in JCPenney. I was there a lil over 30 years. If you want to grow in character and want a challenge apply now. I have grown in character tremendously. Your dealing with the public and associates daily. It is like another family fun at times and at the high peak seasons very busy.Christmas season be aware of long weekends. Overall good Company if you have good mgmt in place."
good,"The co-workers tend to be very nice and the mangers are cool and usually even keeled. They try to get you to push sales a lot which is typical of retail, but they know when they are being too much."
good,"working at JCPenney was nice, I was there for a year but its time to move into new exiting things and that is the reason why I am looking for something else."
good,"Jcpenny helped me get a view on retail, helped me learn how to be behind the register, and also it helped me grow as a person and better myself with customer service the management is great and it's a very super friendly place."
good,"Lots of great co-workers. straightened merchandise, assisting customers with purchases. Opening credit card accounts, being able to have customers use discounts with these."
good,It was a clean place to work. Plenty walk ins. You got good reards there for sales and discounts in the store. Winning awrds is fairly easy.  Good place to start work. Good place to work good place. I have no more.
good,"Worked together in a team to deliver customer satisfaction by assisting and selling merchandise in a fun and customer friendly way"
good,Working for this company has been very educational for me. They give you hands on learning and keep you up on the latest styles. We have a great team work.
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Always something to do nonstop work environment. Everyone works in a team to get everything done perfectly. Also, time so by fast"
good,"I loved working for the company, the customers are very loyal, very easy to learn the day to day task,the dress code is cute so you can be stylish. Also they sell very nice clothing items."
good,"A typical day was always intense, I was Loss Prevention Agent in one of the more active JC Penney in Puerto Rico. The colleagues were great."
good,The company makes company standards very clear and concise. They stay up to date with industry standards by involving the guests in their visits to each location.
good,"This was my first job. They provided the training that was needed. This job was easy to preform. The work place was calm and slow. The hours can fluctuate a lot, it was never a consistent. The management was okay there was noting that really sticks out that i remember that made them awesome."
good,You may not want to be friends with your coworkers but if you work there long enough you get to know so many of them and it gives you something to look forward to. They are willing to show you how to do things without hesitation.
good,I would take care of pricing and signing in the women's department of Jcpenney. I would take care of the defective items in the store. I would clearance items out and help employees put new merchandise on the sales floor.
good,"every time I came into work, I was always smiling, I either was organizing/cleaning my department or providing customer services. I have earned all my retail experience from JcPenny and it was worth it. I've worked there for a whole year and learned so much about retail, that it gave a different perspective about retail. The hardest part about working at jcp is the progress throughout the whole day, because I even when I got everything done, there was still more to get done. If I was done cashing out customers for the day, I would have take care of dressing rooms, cleaning the floor, organizing racks or shelves of clothes and even closing registers. I gave all my cooperation to the store and it's customers and I was able to keep up the progress everyday with no complaint. I enjoyed working because I realized I like working retail."
good,"I worked in several different departments over the 20 years I worked for JCPenney. "
good,"Managers here are willing to help you advance but you have to tell them that is your end goal since a lot of associates are there just for quick cash. Turnover is somewhat high, but the job is great for earning some money on the side. All of the associates at my store were friendly. Trading shifts is very easy, so its a great place to work if you need flexibility. The only bad part about working here is the morning meetings which take up time that could be used more productively, and cleaning up at closing, which used to take up to two hours, but I hear they have since changed that policy."
good,Learned how to stay active worked hard Team leader independent always on time at work if i need to stay i would to better my future for me and my kids
good,I was responsible in making sure that the merchandise was set and ready for the business day.  I learned how to manage other team members.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the management was great.
good,"Loved the store and the employees, I also loved the discounts we got as well as the benefits we would receive during special holidays like Christmas and thanksgiving"
good,Great training was provided and lots of opportunities to work. They provided flexible scheduling. I worked with awesome hardworking people who truly believed in the company.
good,"Great place to work. All of the coworkers are nice and very easy to get along with.  Employees are not given enough hours to work.  Because of this, most employees either have other jobs or are attending school.  There also isn't much space for advancement.."
good,"Working at JCPenny was a great experience in the customer service field. Upselling is not my strong point, as you are required to sell JCPenny cards to customers, so when the season ended I decided to move on with my life."
good,"I loved working at JCPenney's for the time that I did work there. The manager was very understanding, and very lenient. I could always go to him, if I had any kind of questions or concerns. I would definitely recommend this to someone as a part time job. If you are looking to just make some extra money, or to have something to do in your free time, this is the place to work."
good,"They are pretty good and flexible with availability. I am a college student so my hours vary and they are very understanding and helpful. I like it, good for college students."

good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and constantly changing. I learned to be professional and maintain a professional workplace attitude. The management, for the most part was great! The most enjoyable part was meeting new people. The least enjoyable was holiday season and the long work hours overnight."
good,JcPenney is a great place to work the atmosphere is great to work in. We act as if we are a family and work as a team throughout the day. I would recommend this place of work to anyone.
good,"on a typical day at work, I would work the floor, this consist of working t the cash register, restocking clothes, cleaning out the fitting rooms. no benefits available"
good,This job environment was outstanding. Everyone is so kind and polite. The way they handle black Friday is very impressive. They keep up with all of the new trends in today's society.
good,"JCPenney is a nice company to work, balancing work profile along with personal life. Management has changed hence lots of changes happening. But overall a good company to work."
good,"It's a really great place to work. The environment and the people you work with make your day. It's really flexible scheduling, however it's just a starter job; there isn't really chances to move up."
good,great place to work . very friendly and helpful managers and associates. very flexible and will help you with time off if need be . Great enviroment to work in
good,This job was a lot of fun. It was filled with ups and down. A lot of learning curves developed here. Life lessons that I will always implement in future practices.
good,"Liked working with fellow associated and customers."
good,Out of all of my jobs this one was my favorite. This is also the same job where I learned that I love the loss prevention field as well as the criminal justice field.
good,I loved helping the customers with day to day issues with placing orders and questions on returns. The employees and customers provided an excellent job experience for me. The management was very nice and helpful to.

good,"I was apart of the JCP team for 3yrs, and I loved it. From helping staff to class refreshers, JCP ensures your technical skills are up to date. I've learned so much about being both a stylist and customer service professional there. Total recommendation!"
good,"JcPenney was my first job and gave me the proper tools to handle customer service. From my co-workers to the management team, it's all very friendly. The hardest part about working here would be the lack of hours I receive. My job requires that I assist customers in any way needed and provide them with excellent service, along with taking them through the checkout process. My favorite part about being apart of the JcPenney team is that I am able to interact not only with co-workers, but each and every customer that I have encountered."
good,wait on customers that come to my department and help them when asked. The hardest part is dealing with customers that are rude but have to remember that the customer is always right
good,When you first arrive to work the sun didnt shine yet. We unloaded trucks early in the morning and had a goal to be finish before time for the customers to enter. Making sure clearance and other sale items are properly priced.
good,"Loved working here, was my first job working at the Outlet. Was able to be trained in different departments to help out. Was sad to see it close down."
good,"The day starts early and gets out early. I am usually out by 12:30 pm, and I have the rest of the day to do what else is needed at home. The team is excellent and management is understanding."
good,"A typical day for me is to do put backs when i first arrive, clean out fitting rooms, fold outside tables,and then register, sort clothes based on sub-lpts and put back clothes throughout shift closest to me. This is where i learned I'm at my best solo vs. team. Management is there but busy with their tasks. Co workes are like customers. The hardest part is self determination, you want to leave less for the next ahift whild kthers could care less. The mlst enjoyable is seeing customers happy withthe prices they've paid on a flip note I've witnessed horrible attitudes( things that shouldn't be said by workers), and customers leave with a smile and thanking other workers as they leave."
good,"Being apart of the JC Penny family has been a huge honor. The store is full of different personalities and people. You may come across some rude customers but other than that, the atmosphere is perfect."
good,Very great people and job .The stayed busy and the customers was very happy. I was tell people to apply for the job because it really is a great job to work at.
good,"Great management, employees. Reward system motivates challenges in order to meet stores goal, the fun part is competing with other local stores and seeing your workplace shine. Opportunities for advancement do exist but it be more suitable for younger people because it will takes some time."
good,"* providing excellent  customer service to everyone and anyone "
good,Working here was very nice. The staff was like family and the management was great! The staff was very helpful to new employees and were willing to offer help and training
good,It has a great culture. Sadly the management and communication lack here and so you are constantly unaware of what is occurring. The basic aspects of the job are customer service and merchandising. Very easy.
good,"Jcpenny helped me a lot with customer service because I was pretty antisocial with a lot of people, The environment was OK at jcpenny I felt welcomed!"
good,"I traveled several states to train drapery sales and products."
good,"Clock in get to the work floor."
good,I loved working for JCPenneys. Great Store manager. Pay could have been better but the benifits were good. I worked Catalog/Credit was good but not exciting enough for a girl like me. I loved working in the mens department.
good,i liked working there because it was really fast pace and thats what i really enjoyed the most. working with people was really nice. the mall is small and JC penney use to always be packed
good,I worked with JC Penney for 6 years and was sad to leave.  Life happens! Busy work days with lots to do but rewarding. Mentoring new team members was a superior experience.
good,Enjoyed and loved my brief time there until they laid off all HR Mgrs. Wish the company was more stable but they make harsh decisions to try to pull the company out of the hole its dug itself in. Job security can be a mystery there.
good,I started working at JC Penney in 2005-2013 it was a part-time job.Co-workers were great. It really anything hard. The most enjoyable part of my job celebrating making our goals.
good,I like the fast pace of my job as Visual Specialist.  Every day is a new challenge. The tools needed to do visual is always there.

good,"Job Responsibilities:"
good,I love jc penney. This is place to shop. people manager everyone was great. I miss the discount. and the great people I worked with I loved seeing new customers and helping people out.
good,They had a great staff and changed it to cut pay. Alot of us left because their new ideas were not good for customers. Change is good if you make your customers happy.
good,"Enjoyed the teamwork and using my skills in jewelry and sales. I was able to use my knowledge in sales of many pieces of jewelry and time pieces."
good,An exciting atmosphere to work in.  fast paced and high energy.  Great supervisors at store level but Corp. Supervisors clueless as to what happens in stores
good,"Good place to work, but partial to younger employees.  Like to hire high school and college kids to work.  Not many older people working there unless they are supervisors. Older people that are working as sales associates are over look for promotions and advancement while younger are quick to advance . Only want to work employees part time. Employees must adjust to working customer service jobs because shoppers can be rude. Mostly it is a good place to work.  Of all my previous bosses, JC Penney has the best and they try to work with you and get to know you as a person."
good,"Great place to work for college student. About 15 hours per week , more during the holidays. Fast paced, learned a lot about retail. Company's founder was a Christian and JCPenney tries to uphold the Golden Rule."
good,"working with jcpenney is easy. they will work around your schedule and will give hours to the people who deserve them if they have hours to give. the only bad thing is pay and raises. they give raises once a year, but they usually are not good raises."
good,"It has been a great experience working for JCPenney.  The friendships acquired during my time there amidst the rigorous scheduling of the retail business has enhanced my diligence, patience, and social skills."
good,It is a fun place to work at. Coworkers are friendly as well as upper supervisor and managers. I helped customer with their purchases and offered them a great customer service.
good,My day started by checking in packages then set out books at each door I learned to watch for shop lifters my manager was a very cool person my co workers were ok as well the hardest thing of this job was trying to arrest a shop lifter armed with a knife the best part of this job is that it was close to home
good,"Spent 7 wonderful years at the Home Store with J C Penney's. It was like my second home and I will always dearly miss the friends that I had made there. I was taught everything about a big box retail environment, and how to give out great customer service. I have no complaints and was always most often treated with respect even when asked to do things differently on occasion. I had worked other employments while at JCP those seven years, but always retained my employment there also. My work at JCP got me through college and help me raise my daughter on my own.  I will always remember my experiences there with love as that was part of the culture of our company, treat your customers as you would like to be treated yourself! Great time spent with JC Penney's as I wish them the best in retaining the status they deserve in the retail market as a whole."
good,It was alright but could be extremely stressful at times. They work really well with people's schedules and weed out the bad workers relatively well. Most of the employees got along and are willing to help one another.
good,I absolutely love being apart of the JC Penney salon team. Having a diverse clientele ensures you to be come a well rounded stylist. Incentives are always given to boost sales and commission. Stylist are friendly and always willing to help. Classes are also offered to keep up on new skills and techniques
good,"A typical day at JCPenney Portraits involved cashier work, customer service, and photo editing. In this position I advanced my skills as a photographer, I learned more ways to do photo edits and learned new computer skills such as Excel.  The management at the store I worked at was excellent and my co-workers were wonderful, they were all friendly yet professional. The hardest part of the job was learning to use Excel, but the most enjoyable part was being able to interact with customers and learn more photography skills."
good,This was an amazing time and had alot of growth when it came to opportunities to work with different people..Working close with management gave me the encouragement i needed to advance.
good,I am apart of the warrior team. I enjoy being apart of this group because this group reinforces the idea of teamwork. We come up with fun activities for all of the associates and help create a positive work environment through planned events.
good,Everything was easy to learn and it helps you have an open mind. The workplace environment was very friendly and I got along with all the co-worker.
good,"Customer service, perfectionist, organize, team player, hard working and responsable.Front desk, shampoo girl, assistent to the manager, stocking and organizing."
good,working at jcp felt like a family i truly enjoyed working there. they all are willing to help new employees. Generous breaks and all the managers are friendly
good,It was a very fast paced environment and I loved that. The team was very understanding and helpful but I didn't like how they wanted me to be there at 4:30 and I get out of school at 4.
good,"I did seasonal work during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year of 2013-14.  I put out and removed merchandise, priced, processed lay away, was a cashier, straightened merchandise, and other job related duties."
good,I learned a lot and met a lot of different people. Great company to work for. Gained permanent employment thru temp agency.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is handling the new merchandise"
good,Working at dairy queen was fun for me because of my co workers and managers. It is a very fast pace job but as long as you know how to make and do everything then the job comes easy.
good,it was a Great way to start off my working experience. Working at JC Penny opened my eyes on how the retail business works.
good,"So I was hired on as seasonal and kept afterwards. This place has a very positive environment and the managers are quite fair. Yes they ask us to open credit a lot but that's pressure from above. For the most part, my schedule has been VERY fair. If I've needed time off, gotten sick, or wasn't feeling well, they were supportive."
good,love dealing with different customers love selling the products management and co-workers was cool and respectful most enjoyable day was making a customer happy
good,"My typical day at work was helping customers order merchandise, make payments on their credit card, and cashing them out. I learned how to do customer service, and merchandising . The management was very helpful and was willing to assist you with issues or concerns. The co workers were a joy to work with them all.

good,"First, I must say that my overall work experience was great for a seasonal job. I got the job I signed up for, which is all you can really ask. My immediate supervisor was outstanding, but I'm afraid I can't say the same about upper management. For one thing, I had this one guest who came into our store with a bunch of coupons for the holidays, and while I told her it was against the policy to use them all in one transaction, the manager came to my register and overrode it, bringing a $300 purchase to $5. Since the communication among managers was so poor, the other manager came over and let me take the heed for that. "

Management was very good, they communicated thier reasoning in decisions gave workers incentives, did thier best to accommodate special needs or circumstances, and everyone was treated fairly and equally. The coworkers I have encountered at the two stores I've worked at have been wonderful, each person has a unique personality and brings a special talent to the sales floor, and I always find joy in working with anyone. The most difficult part of the job is trying to do multiple things at once such as answering a phone call while ringing a customers purchase out while being asked a question from a customer that has just walked in the store. The most rewarding part of the job is the bonding experience from customers, some people will specifically come back to see a cashier or to make specific purchases or ask for personal input in regards to a purchase from one in particular individual."
good,"I learned a lot about dealing with customers, co-workers and management.  "
good,"I was a custom decorator, with window treatments. They have since shut down that department over most of the country. I loved my boss and staff. Great training!

good,I enjoyed working for JC Penney and have learned so much while employed. I worked in every dept minus the Salon and Jewelry. I even worked in replenishment. Overall the management was pretty decent. I didn't think that Advancement options for employees was a fair system when it came to selection. The hardest part to my job was as of January 1st.. I was lucky to work 4 hours a week. The most enjoyable part was working with my co workers and providing the best customer service that I could. I received Associate of the Month while employed for outstanding customer service.

I love helping people get what they want."
good,"Over all working for JC Penny as a part time temporary associate was pleasant, however the hours are scares and there is no hints at being hired out side of season or not, for the suport crew, they only have part-time jobs available all year round and with the limited hours i did received working there temporarily I would be fearful for them who are looking for good hours, the pay on the other hand is quite nice, every one there is kind and they are very helpful to there employees ."
good,Dealing with customers and also making the store look great. I work a team player and got the job done. The management was good. my co-workers was some great people to work with.

My co-workers were great we hall had a good understanding with one another it was like we were a big family, they've all had positive attitudes and they were good team players.

Management is there to help you when needed and always wants you to preform at high standards. The hardest part of the job would be counting diamonds at the end of the night because there has to be two employees and if your numbers dont match up you have to start the count all over. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing someone walk out with exactly what they where searching for. Finding that precious gem that they can't live without and seeing the reaction always makes me feel like I have went above and beyond to make the customer happy."
good,"My typical day involve relieving an associate at the work station, discussing how her day went and discussing current sales specials so i could better serve customers. Through out my shift I enjoyed interacting with customers by helping them with there selections and purchases. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting customers visiting from other states or countries."
good,"Heavy customer service at catalog desk. I learned how to REALLY multi-task Cash handling of three registers, a bank, order delivery. The hardest part of the job is all the returned Items. Most enjoyable part of job was my great co-workers and my supervisor's example on how to interact with customer's, and the discounts!"
good,"I loved working for the company during a time of flux. What with the changing of our C.E.O., a complete new pricing and advertising structure, I thoroughly enjoyed being immersed in a company that was reinventing itself."
good,Excellent opportunity for growth and to learn and become the best in the industry.
good,"Jcpenney cares for their customers and employees. Every Jcpenney I worked at and even shopped in, the associates are normally always great with everyone around them and do what they can to make each customer have a happy purchase. Which those are my favorite parts of the job. I have learned so much about customer service while working here that those skills have turned into my everyday life socially."
good,overall this was a great place to work only bad thing is the hours.
good,"I worked in jewelry, had to account for all diamond if open the store or close store the diamond count had to be right, Sometimes you could not depend on co-worker, you had to make sure you did your job. The hardest part was when the count did not come out right when you closeout at the end of the night. You had to go back an account for each purchase to figure out where the account was off. The most enjoyable part of the job is when one of your customer shows up looking for you because you provided great customer service to them. There was great customer that came into the store."
good,"great place hard to find certain things but great anyway, learned well not really learn i developed great people skills and enjoys my time with my co-workers , i learned from them everyday and vise versa"

good,Jc penneys is a fun place to work out. Good hours. Fun people to work with. Nice raises.
good,JCPenney is a good place to work. It would be evening better if they understand people life outside of work
good,Jc Penneys is a balance of work and having doing it. Such as having rewards for best customer service and utilizing time well.
good,"Helping customers when looking for sizes, colors, and styles. Cash register handling. Checking fitting rooms every 15 minutes. Always smile and greet customer. I learned how to handle money, handle customers the right way, open/close terminals, and make return/exchanges. Management would always do anything for associates to give their best to customer service. We got compensation when doing credit applications. My co-workers were like my own family. We got along very well. Teamwork was our priority. The hardest part of the job was inventory, where we had to stay late. The most enjoyable part was replenishment. At closing time, we would clean our department. Fix every table so it would be prepared for the next day of business."
good,"Great atmosphere, good team work, good service being provided, motivational management"
good,Help assist customers and bring joy to there life!! Great managment and good personnel.

good,This is a great company which is well structured and organization. The Management was great and supportive of the contractors and were good leaders.
good,I loved working there I just didnt receive enough hours. I loved working with people and being able to help them. You have to be a multi tasker and work at a fast pace.
good,"I loved the company, my co workers and even the customers! The morning start up meetings really get the day started on the right foot."
good,This is the best place I have worked for in a long time. The supervisors are great and so is the Store Manager! Its a great place to work if your wanting something part time.
good,Working for JCPenney‘s in Beckley West Virginia was an awesome opportunity I definitely go back and help throughout the holiday seasons again the employees are great the bosses are awesome and are very understanding when things happen and you can’t make it in due to being sick
good,"Awesome workplace, I had a great manager. First retail place I loved working for. Customers were great and I loved helping them. The company gave us adequate breaks and incentives. Had parties as well. They treat their employees well."
good,Don’t expect to stick to just one job. While I was in jewelry I was also expected to cover mens and/or women’s and not including fitting rooms. It’s easy but they really never had coverage which left other people suffering.
good,"Great people to work with every day."
good,I was treated fairly and pay was low but when you love your job you accept it. I understand pay has changed for the better ad it has been two years since I worked there. Managers can make all the difference! Some thought they were above talking to us but then we would get one in that was glad to be there and made goal setting fun!!  And achievable!!
good,Job is good overall.  Can be challenging.  You have to be able to adapt and learn quickly.  It's very necessary to help upset customers find solutions to problems.
good,I think the pay is not worth all the work done $9.00 per hrs is just not enough I enjoyed the job & people I've worked with it was overall an excellent experience.
good,"The management along with the environment is awesome. You get treated fair, they work with your schedule and understand life problems. Highly recommend working at JCPenney as a starter job."
good,we had to be on cashier most of the time and making sure we would be doing go backs and making sure to have great customer service. Overall the job was great

good,Great first place to work super sweet people and great management  they are very supportive of their employees. Super understanding of their employees.
good,Great place to work Male Manager is awesome the female can be very unreasonable at times. But it's the greatest company to work for as long you aren't a cashier. Customer tend to be very demanding and get out of hands quickly because of lack of Supervisor to fast solve issues.
good,"Awesome experience and gained alot of experience that helped me in the QA and Logistics Center field. Great company for growth and experience, awesome employees and management."
good,"I really liked working here,the pay wasn't that great but the environment and working with the employees  and customers made it stress free.  Put me in the Christmas spirit everyday I was there and the customers were great!  I would work there again for the seasonal holiday's it was a fun time.  They start their morning with an employee  hand pile go team go!"
good,Get to work with clothes. Great with fashion ideas. The management is good with training and schedule flexibility. Typical day at work is very laid back and easy.

good,I love working at JCPenney! It’s a great environment. Management is very nice and flexible. They understand life happens and won’t hold it against you. I highly recommend this wonderful place!
good,It was a fun filled place to work in the salon. I loved interacting with my clients in a daily basis. I loved helping women get there pep back in their step. Make them feel beautiful.
good,I love working at jcpennys. It is a non stressful job. My associates and managers are extremely nice to work with. Management always let you know when you are doing a great job. The only thing I don’t like is we always have to push credit application to are customers. That can be annoying to customers . Thcustomers get sometimes.
good,I enjoyed working For JCPenney’s they did a lot for the employees I enjoyed working in the men’s department and measuring for men’s suits. It was a great company until they close down.
good,"I had a wonderful experience at Sephora , I learned new things everyday. The only thing I don’t like was the pay rate .. the pay rate is too low, they should higher the pay rate"

good,"Great environment, mgmt is great,  employees are fun to work with. I worked off comission but you also get an hourly rate, if you dont meet the comission requirements"
good,I would come in to work at 5 am and help unload the truck and put the shipment onto tables and open them. I worked with a group so it was a team effort. We put the items on the right racks and put the merchandise out on the sales floor where they belonged. The racks were heavy and hard to pull but I did not give up and was able to finish my work on time. Everyone was very nice and always willing to lend a hand to help others that needed it.
good,"Very busy,  sometimes you had to deal with very ignorant people. The only ting I didn't like  was, if you worked at nite,  before any one could go home we all had to almost always go help another dept"
good,"Management is great and so are coworkers, I had a really great time while I worked there and the 'mood' is much, much better than like M*cy's. JCPenney's employees are friendly and easy to get along with in my experience. "
good,"A typical day working at JCPenney was moderate since sometimes I had to work all alone in a single department with lack of assistance and experience at that particular job. However, the management was excellent and enjoyed working with the supervisor and other employees."
good,"worked part time, management was great and i enjoyed going to work. fellow employees were fun to be around and we worked together as a team to get our daily tasks done."
good,"Our stations were not only for cashiering, but for full customer service as well. We also opened charge accounts and  placed orders online. Team leaders guided our schedules through the day. The workplace culture was warm. The hardest part of the job was seasonal sales like Black Friday. The most enjoyable was customer interaction."

Inform customers of key product attributes to generate interest and to build clientele. Meets or exceeds sales goals by contributing in-depth knowledge and customer service."

good,Store closing due to area and location.  Salon business was growing annually under my leadership. We are an extremely successful salon business with 23+ stylist.  We were very successful in meeting and exceeding sales and profit plans.
good,A normal day is like any other i would go any handle my orders for the day and go home the management was always helpful and the best part they bought us food .
good,"Fun out going people, short breaks, can be very hectic during holidays and also long days. The people that work there get are very easy to get along with and gets along with others"
good,"I am a Hairstylist, so my job is completely different than that of the rest of the store. It's a good culture, everyone is nice, and the benefits are good."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-worker and the hardest part of the job is when you get to know someone and they leave for another job.  The work place culture is diverse."
good,"I am going to start with I LOVE this company! I have only been here for a short time. I was hired for another position. The management quickly saw my drive. Asked about past experience in retail management. Seeing I was way over qualify for what I was hired for I was promoted. I like to say that many places either interviewing or working may see experience like mine as a over  Qualification. JCPENNEY did not. They love their employees and lift them up. It feels like family. From day one of training (they have a  Extensive training program) everyone was so nice. They teach you about working as a team. It takes EVERYONE to make it work. In all my years in management I have never seen a HOLE store be this happy and friendly. This says a lot. Customers are great as well. Pay was a little less then I like. However, this is with most jobs. I feel the family life balance as well as happiness on the job overrides this. As well as the opportunity to advance. If you are looking for a fun job with many opportunities to advance this would be it. I love my store!! All the managers within are great.  Can not wait to see what career advancement Jcpenney has in my future."
good,"One of the nicest people "
good,"Every morning we had a meeting to discuss sales expectations and to review the previous day's sales numbers. The GM of the store was a very helpful and hands-on manager. He was able to answer any questions and was always smiling. He also took the time to learn every employee's name, which I thought was a wonderful thing. Being able to help customers locate items they were looking for and being able to be myself were the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,"Great Place to work and a friendly relaxed environment. I was the loss prevention specialist, but Only part time. The management staff was excellent to work for and with."
good,"I love the people there! My location had amazing levels of diversity in its staff, and the team and management are all outstanding! I wouldn't say they're laid back but they definitely understand people learn differently and have different struggles. They help you learn the tools of the trade until you're ready. If you put in the effort, then you'll succeed for sure! "
good,"This store is a place with great management, co-workers, and hours. They will be as flexible as you need and work great with my shifting schedules. I love most of my managers and they treat us well."
good,JC penny is a great place to be but the thing is that as far as job security goes you never know when you will be laid off and that is the only downside to this place..
good,Its a great place to work.  Great environment ans co workers.  You all ways meet new people.   If you live to help people and feel like you really make a difference this the place the customer  are great
good,"Depending on the location your experience can be different. I really enjoyed working at this location. Managers were awesome, employee discount was good, and coworkers were great. Customers were a mix, but enough good ones the bad ones did't matter. Easy to call in sick or get time off.  A lot of team work to cover each others shifts and have fun. Managers were realistic about goals and never felt the pressure to sell more."
good,a typical day at work  would be cleaning out the fitting rooms helping out people seeing if they need any help. I learned here at this job is to be patient. the hardest part about this job was keeping the fitting rooms clean because people destroyed them back to back.
good,"Enjoyed working at JCPenney. Worked with many good people."
good,JCPenney in Eugene offered a very good family feel. you had supportive managers and coworkers. the coworkers were sometimes unprofessional but that was not accepted by the manager.
good,It’s really good opportunity to start new career. Pay very well with when start new career. Dealing with different peoples. Everyday you have to work with different departments.
good,"This was a part time job while I was in collage, this was a pretty ok job as they worked with my hours and were always willing to have me switch schedule."
good,I have been with them for over a month and I applied for Cashier but I have not been trained for a Cashier I have only been put in Recovery and this is a group of associates that clean and fold clothes around the store.
good,"I loved working at jc penny, I always knew when to take on a task and when to help someone else. once I clocked in, usually my area was a mess, so I got straight to work, mainly folding clothes. management was great there, out of three different managers, all of them were understandable and good to have a chat with whenever they would pass you by. if I had to pick the hardest thing about this job, it wouldve been taking on making sure your department is as clean and nice as it can be."
good,Associates work well with one another. The assignments & projects that are asked to be done are fun to do & complete. Respectful environment & decent benefits
good,"learned about cash credit handing ,new products ,how to do link selling,worked in friendly and great environment Supervisors were great. Manager kept employees motivated to work."
good,Employees are encouraged to work together as a team. I have worked here for over 12 years and I still enjoy it today. The employees make the environment enjoyable for the clients and customers as well.
good,"A typical day was reviewing inventory levels and making purchases based on levels.  I had more autonomy here.  No one reviewed my purchases.  They trusted me to make the right decisions.  The long hours were the hardest part of the job, but there was a lot of self satisfaction because we weren't micro-managed."
good,"The pay was good, people were friendly and helpful. There are resources to learn about systems you don’t understand. Fast paced and always challenging. More people on the floor continuously recovering store so it doesn’t always fall to night shifts."
good,Great company until it was decided to reinvent itself. Change was too drastic alienating the core customer base. Trying to win them back has been challenging to say the least.
good,Unloaded merchandise from pallets. A lot of work goes into opening a new store. A great group to work with. The hardest part of this job was remembering to take my breaks. The most enjoyable was knowing how the behind the scenes work in a large retail store and all the new friends I met.
good,I worked in a seasonal catalog department position during the Christmas season. I was not offered any opportunities for advancement into a full time permanent position.
good,"I am disabled, and JcPenny did everything in their power to help me be able to work within their company. I was very moved and appreciative of them. The people and management there were absolutely fantastic."
good,"they have good benefits if you work 40 hours a week. They took away the health benefits from all employees. The employees at the Stockton store are fun to work with. It's fast paced, but it's a little more relaxing and the bosses are very friendly.  They make sure that you're okay and ask if you need any help."
good,"Very nice setup for workplace, team managers were polite and competent. "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent working for this company and the people in it. Work keeps busy at all times, pay isn't bad with several opportunities to earn more. However, they did not want to be flexible with my hours working while going to school."
good,Assist customers with purchases and returns. Maintain a clean working area. Management is usually very helpful; there may be one or two that have attitudes but overall they are fantastic. The customers can be a little hard to deal with at times. Overall the whole experience was worth it; taught me a lot about myself and how I can some pretty tough situations.
good,This is a great place to work with great benefits and pay. The job position comes with a great base pay and incentives to make more by bonuses and commissions.
good,Jcpenney was a great place to work. I just wanted a change and more time with my kids. We was like family and when Something happens to someone  the whole company comes together
good,Loved working for the catalog store.  Would probably still be there if it hadn’t closed down.  Sad they quit making catalogs which was the down fall of the store.
good,I was working partime at JCPenney. It was a great work environment. Management was always able to work with you under any situation. That what I loved JCPenney. All the associates are willing to help you anytime.
good,Jc Penney was great I loved the pay I loved the workers.  I recommend this place for work. Both of my daughters worked for Jc Penney. The parties were fun. The provided food on busy holidays.
good,typical day consisted of  unsupervised processing of purchase orders for shipments of inventory to their 1200 retail stores. I have learned through the 20+ years at JCPenney to master professionalism and to be a dedicated team player. The management staff is also dedicated  and supporters in any way needed for the good of the company.
good,Jcpenneys was a great company to get some sales associate experience. I loved the work environment and interacting with customers daily. Jcpenneys has great management and very flexible hours. This is an overall great company.
good,"Store is no longer there so not much to say about it,. Everyone there was fun to work with. In my department was pretty relaxing. Work steady and all was good."
good,Would stock and help customers. I learned how to sign a person up with a store credit card there. Management is good but co-workers are helpful. Culture has a bunch of different varieties. No hard part but enjoyable part is every worker is very kind.
good,"The management at JC Penny was very good. I learned a lot skills working here such as unloading a truck full of merchandise, pricing merchandise, running a cashier, providing customer service. I really liked the other employees I worked with. Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,I loved working here. I was always getting called in to work to cover other peoples shifts. I learned a lot and performed a variety of jobs. Management was well structured and knowledgeable. It was like family working there the environment was the best.
good,"I started this job with a mentality of being in a hostile environment (thanks to my previous job). But these people were one of the best I have ever worked with. Very reassuring, fun to talk to. Overall great coworkers."
good,"It is a fair and equal place to work. Made some close friends that I have known for over 12 years. They offer medical, dental and vision. Also offer 401k and life insurance."
good,It was busy on cupon days. Also big sales.  I like to be busy all the time. I spent a lot of time cleaning and organizing to keep myself busy. I need a fast paced environment.
good,"people are friendly i work with and they will give you days off you need. i am on the support team, which is a fast pace and always busy. Support team is signing, mark downs, unboxing pallets, and "
good,It has always been a good company. I have worked in two locations and the majority of my managers have been good. I have also had opportunities to promote.
good,"I never worked too long at JCPenney, but I loved the environment. The pay was sufficient for starting, and the work was simple. I was enjoying just folding clothes for hours and assisting the infrequent customer. The experience overall was good, but it didn't ever quite fit with my schedule."
good,"My managers loved me, I ran a whole department by myself at times, I was trustworthy with money and a cash register, and customers were always so nice. Overall it was the best job I had by far."
good,People there are super great and fun to be around. Managers love to talk to the associates and customers. Super fun job and you get to meet tons of new people. The biggest down fall is having to work Sundays.
good,"It has been a while since I worked for JCP. The time I did work there, I enjoyed it and learned a lot about the company and how to strive to do the best. You had your good days and bad days, but it was a positive experience."
good,JcPenny was a great job for me in high school. The hours was flexible and they worked with my school schedule. The co workers and management was very nice.
good,My job at JCPenney's was to recover clothes from other departments it was to make sure my department was clean and neat it was to give great customer service being a cashier to get as many charge cards applications out as I could daily which I did very well on and I will return the JCPenney's again if so for the seasonal just for the Christmas season
good,"Every day was different for me personally. Some days I would go in and it would be busy so I would be on registers all day. Other days it would be slow so I could use my time to clean up, organize, replenish the floor, and work on projects. Other days I was training new hires. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers in a professional manner and coming to a compromise."
good,"I have been working the area and of all the jobs, I think JCP would be the best place to go to for someone who is just starting to work.  JCP is my first department store job. I applied as cashier but was hired as an operation associate. I enjoyed this work tremendously. I learned a lot about back store work. Pricing, merchandising, visuals, safety and service. I felt encourage to improve my work in support of the manager and supervisors who were all very kind and very generous with their knowledge. The interaction in the store was professional, I felt like a customer while being at work as an associate. I will miss working here. "
good,I enjoyed working for jcpenny when i was a minor. but it wasn't a job to raise a family off of. It was very flexible with school hour. also with working another job for a short while./
good,"I worked for Pennys for many years starting as a clerical assistant to a management position in Merchandise control of the Women't department in the Los Angeles Buying Office.  It was a challenging but productive and fun positions as I worked directly with the buyers and their assistants and representative from the suppliers and the Penny stores.  I loved the work but eventually decided to go out on my own.  Unfortunately, I was unable to do that.  I enjoyed working for the company as it gave good opportunities for women associates, paying well!"
good,The job was pretty relaxing and I did in fact enjoy talking to customers. My skills as a bilingual speaker came in handy since I was able to help as many customers as possible.
good,"I was treated well and fairly, the work could be stressful at times bit coworkers are always ready to help. Managers are understanding and firm when it comes to tasks and performing them. My experience was a good one."
good,"Great company culture focused on people first. Great opportunities to advance and receive recognition for a job well done. To be successful  you need to be a team player, have a positive attitude, good work ethic and be a great multi-tasker"
good,"Shipping and receiving, moving merchandise in stock rooms and onto the sales floor.  You learned much warehouse work and about stocking and processing."
good,"Great place/environment to work, I love meeting new people everyday and in a Salon environment, I was able to do that.  Because of new Management for the entire Company 1,000 people throughout the country lost their jobs in JCP Salons because they were trying to go on a different path that ended up failing for them.  For example, taking away commissions and eventually taking away jobs."
good,JcPenney's was a business causal job.Very friendly and laid back associates who knew their jobs very well. Managers were always on the floor helping out.
good,"I worked at Penneys for two years and I loved every minute I was there and never had a bad day. I was in sales support so I never knew what I would be doing when I started work and that made the job better than doing the same thing over and over everyday. The chemistry was right, everyone got along fine. The store has been closed for years but the employees rent a country club every year for a Christmas party. The people just like each other."
good,excellent training. management very down to earth. weekly activities to build staff moral and exciting goals to meet with prizes like blue jean Friday.
good,Every day was a fun day because or manager and the environment are perfect. The customers usually was older persons and that contributed to the nice environment.
good,"Working at JCP was the best job I ever had, I regret leaving but I was awarded a better opportunity elsewhere within my degree. Definitely recommend as a first job."
good,Always have something to do; depends on the department you work for. Great Supervisors that keep you motivates. Also they provide a great work ambient.
good,Had a bad experience with the manager and employees sabotaging my work.  And my customers were satisfied with my work  but client weren't given to me . My schedule would be moved
good,Lot of room for growth and technologies to learn. The high end cutting edge technologies used and the adaptation of new technologies keeps your knowledge bank up to date
good,"We did a lot of customer service through the day. The managers were great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working fast-paced, and with great people."
good,"Very fast paced and enjoyable work environment with team work effort and everyone working to make the best of everyday. Good pay and great benefits, competitive pay."
good,JC Penney is one of the more satisfying jobs I have had in my retail career.  The Management respects me and does not micromanage me. I am given space and the opportunity to run my department as I see fit within the SOP's of the company.
good,"I had many hours per week and all of  the management were helpful and uplifting.  I liked working there during the Thanksgiving to Christmas season, because it made it more exciting and cheerful."
good,I absolutely loved working at JC Penney. I started working there during the holiday season of 2013 and continued my employment all the way working my way through college and starting my new career in 2016.
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney it was a fair place. They gave us good discounts and I had great hours. I had a good pay rate. They cared for their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney, and if the store hadn't closed, I would probably still work there.  It was a relaxed work environment, and I liked the rapport with my coworkers.  It made it easy to welcome customers to the store and provide great customer service."
good,"JCPenney came back from the brink of financial ruin and they did it with the support of there brick and mortar stores.  The culture is fun and driven.  The hardest part of the job would be the operations piece.  Penny's has high standards with regards to the placement of merchandise, look and feel of the store, and signing execution."
good,"JCPenney really developed employees with mentorship, paying for training classes/seminars. Had a great benefits package and an excellent place for young mothers/families"
good,I loved working at JcPenney because they were flexible with hours. I gained a lot of customer service skills. I was trained well in solving customer complaints. The company is great to start of in customer service. Favorite part of working at JCPenney was that the team felt like a family and we were all well at working fast together.
good,"Great Company to work for.  This 118 year old company is a great place to work for.  They are a wonderful company to grow within.  They see the potential of the employees and helps them grow,"
good,"I was only a seasonal associate at JCPenny's, but I wanted to stay because I loved the environment and the people there. They were very nice and would help you with anything you needed. It was my ""first"" retail/clothing job and JCPenny's made me want to stay in retail. Management was very understanding and helpful if you had something going on or pop up. Flexible hours!"
good,"Jc Penney was a great employer because while working they would pay you to take classes, sometimes out of town, to learn new techniques and hairstyles."
good,JC Penney was a pleasant place to work with many different cultures and requirements.  It was enjoyable and helping gentlemen locate appropriate styles and fit was extremely rewarding
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone just looking for a few days a week that does not necessarily need a steady income. I was mostly a stay at home mom and it helped pay for groceries. "
good,very clean place to work fun people to work with workers around to help you when in need vey fast past work place. bus stop very close to job so the walk is not far if you dnt hvae a car
good,"Shift differential,award best Customer Service;Top five percent of company Credit Card  processors;Awards for on time clock-in.                    I dI decided to stay in retirement"
good,I love my job just looking to grow with the company. The day can start off cool and fun then may end up stressful when all these emails start coming in with things they want to change last minute.
good,It's an awesome place to work. Friendly environment and very helpful employees whose aim is to make sure their customers are happy and ready to come back.
good,I work here now and I enjoy it very much. I would not change much due to how great it already is. Once you find your way in the store then you should be fine.
good,Working together as a team to meet the required goal of the department. Holding yourself and associated accountable on performance and safety. Drive productivity. Providing leadership and operational direction for multiple operational and logistical functions; utilized advance analytics and assessment to develop and implement corrective plans of actions to improve overall workplace functionality and efficiency.
good,Very enjoyable for part time employment.  Management works with employees schedules for time off.  Pleasant work environment. I would not want it for my primary employment due to benefits and lower pay.
good,"A very nice place to work at. You get good hours , the pay is only $8.00 . The people are very nice and it's a nice job to work at. You get 15 minutes paid breaks but you cant leave the store."
good,"I liked working at JCPenney/JC 5 Star.  After the outlet store was sold to JC5 Star Things just went down hill.  Before being sold it was a fun place to work.  We had potlucks and at Christmas time the store manager catered lunch in on Fridays.  Everyone was like family there if someone was having problems everyone would help out.  The hardest part of this job was loosing it.  Management was very good. Store manager always made sure we knew what was going on and what we should do about it.  A typical day at work for me was getting my shoes from the stockroom filling in shelves, checking what was going on sale, set the sale if necessary, help any customers.  Help out at the customer service desk if busy and relieve for lunches and breaks."
good,J.C. Penny was a great first job to have while still in high school. I learned a lot through my peers and management. The skills and traits I learned carried on to other employers I had after I left the company to advance my career.
good,JC Penny is a great place to work! The pay isn't really good. I work in the salon and its a great place to start especially if you're just graduating out of cosmetology school and have no clients you still get paid for coming there and working.
good,"As a manager and the experience I attained I can not complain it  was the best job as a manager."
good,A typical day at work depended on where I was needed. Either it was recovery or register. The register was fast pace and fun. Doing recovery was the most enjoyable part of my job because it allowed me to move around the store and help customers.
good,I totally enjoyed this job. They are a great company to work for. They are good about recognizing when you work hard. The managers are willing to perform any task that they ask the employees to perform.
good,"Over the years I have developed into a compassionate and dedicated associate. The management was wonderful and knowledgeable and a joy to work with such sincere and fun group of people. "
good,it was alot of fun. The managers were respectful and fair and they always had work for you. They made sure that they had enough management to spread work a easily a ossible to be a big establishment.
good,"If you work hard, they will bend over backwards to accommodate you in your job duties and work hours. Management is great as are most of the staff. Great employee discount as well."
good,I loved being a part of a team that was very family orientated and I loved customer service and being exposed to the people. My favorite was working in Jewelry.
good,"i was a customer service specialist whose duties consisted of checking out customers and taking payments as well as processing refunds and/or returns.  It was my responsibility to keep the store looking neat keeping all clothes folded uniformly and all hanging clothes facing the same direction and not sticking out.  It is generally the younger crowd that works here (it is a great first job).  The hardest part was dealing with angry customers or customers that wanted to talk all day when other customers are waiting to be helped.    The managers were great, and the stress level fairly low."
good,It's a enjoyable place to work. Depending on the department you get placed in. They recognize hard work and do promote with in the company. No day is ever boring and makes for a good first job.
good,I only had to quit because they refused to work with my school schedule. But it is a very good company to work for. Decent pay and the managers do care about you.
good,"I love my job as manager here, the guests are fun to work with and you get to watch the kids grow which makes you feel like they are your own at times"
good,"the people i work with are always in a good mood. i never dread going to work. the work is pretty easy, and theres always something to do so the days go by quick."
good,"I enjoy working at JCPenney because it's a friendly work environment,  we make sure customer service is our main goal, and you can always find good deals at our store. On top of all that, we almost always have good discounts/coupons which helps the guest ""get her penney's worth."""
good,What my typical day at JCPenney was I login and automatically taking customer orders. On a good day my calls are maybe 4 minutes or less. Work place was pretty nice and I enjoyed everyone who I have come across. Management at this location on Lackman wasn't all that great. Alot of managers werent as professional as I had expected. What I most enjoyed about JCP was that they did alot to make the employees on the floor feel that we were all a team. Even creative with the work competitions.
good,"This was a great job, good benefits an wonderful work environment.  I would sometimes open an close the store. I was commissioned    sales Expert in window an furniture. Stocking an hanging new window treatment were challenging"
good,I loved working there the pay was good if you had a full book like I did my co-workers were the best no gossip for a salon with 20+ women.  I would work for them again.
good,I love working here. Everyone acts as a whole family. I was nervous to be working with new people  but everyone is so friendly and it is a very enjoyable pllace to work.
good,"A day at JCP is busy and fast paced. There are always things to do and although we were understaffed, we all managed to work together to get the tasks finished. The hardest part was being understaffed and having limited hours to finish tasks, the most enjoyable part was the staff and customers I encountered."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company! Learned to manage with difficult customers and how to overcome hard situations "
good,"A Typical day at work starts with a team leader giving my coworkers and I directions on what projects are to done and how much  time we have to do them."
good,"Good company to work for flexable schdule,many things to learn for a high profile on dealing with the public on customer service,many of your loyal customers come back"
good,"Nice place to work. "
good,"Great place to work with awesome managers and available shifts. "
good,I have enjoyed working at Penny's because everyone is friendly and caring. The customers are nice and are understanding if there happen to be complications. The work is easy and you feel accomplished with how things went.
good,"JCP salons are structured towards and dedicated to giving their stylists every opportunity to succeed! Between the training courses they PAY you to attend, marketing tools, free product samples for potential new clients, they strive to remove any obstacles along your path to success within their company."
good,Great place to work. I was in customer service and catalog department. Cashier and money handling. Must be able to multi-task. Only bad thing is working holidays
good,This job was fun I love kids and being able to work with them to make them smile for a picture that will last a life time. Hardest part was you had to be fast but give good work.
good,I Loved this job. The people were great to work with. This was my second retail job where I mostly learned the ins and outs. This job was great. The hardest part was store closing.
good,"It was a great place to work. I had people who came in and asked for me. I love being able to make someone feel better than when they came in the door. We were a team, no one was stuck doing the same thing. We rotated positions. You knew that the whole store had to be ready for the next day. If your area was finished, you helped the department next to you."
good,"I had many responsibilities at JC Penney over a 31 year career."
good,"great working environment .great management  love working here "
good,A typical day at work at JC penny is so exciting. You get to meet new people everyday. Behind the counter you learn how to manage money and give the customers a great satisfaction so they can go home with smiles on their faces. The employees are very sweet they care about you trying to do the best you can so that you can do what you need to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you don't have to sit around all day you can be up and running.
good,This is a great company to work for. They value their employees and they are very flexible with your schedule. The pay is average on the sales floor but they have the best pay for stylists in the industry.
good,"wonderful company and benefits , not a lot of walk in clients for a young stylist. clean and tons of room for advancement and cont. education. very good with schedules and needing time off . could have its moments of drama and management probably could have been more firm with carrying out what they said"
good,I worked at jcp for several years and would have stayed if the pay was better. So many wonderful coworkers and loyal customers. I feel this is a great job .
good,Worked for JCP for nearly two years. Visual Team was very informative and willing to teach. Our particular location received a remodel package so for 6 months I worked over nights moving fixtures rather than doing visual. However it was still a learning experience.
good,"A typical day of work was busy helping customers but there was a great team and supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers make good choices about clothing and telling them where merchandise was in the store. What I learned while working at JCPenney I learned valuable life lessons as in how to deal with money and talking to customers. The management team was always helpful and if I made appointments before hand would be able to accommodate them in my schedule. The workplace culture was upbeat ,employees always had a smile on their face and if you had any questions on the job, they were polite and helped assist you.  The hardest part was rush hour and putting the misplaced merchandise back in their department."
good,A  typical day at work is working with customers and assisting them in appliances. I am my own boss and I prove that in my work performance. My workplace has many employees carrying out task and doing what they are told to do. The most enjoyable part of my day is assisting customers and being told I'm great at it.
good,I love that the JCPenney associates work as a team and are willing to help the new associate by answering questions and training
good,It was a great place to work at because everyone was so friendly. The staff was always productive. The store was organized and coordinated very good. I loved meeting new people and being able to make customers days with the sales and discounts.
good,good first job and busy environment. good when first starting to work and gaining experience. would recommend to new workers and people still in high school.
good,Working at JCPenney was a fun experience and I learned a lot.  It was my first job out of high school and I was able to move up in the company.  I will always have a special respect for this company for taking a chance on me. They allowed me the opportunity to prove myself and grow.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney consisted of being active with not only fellow associates and management but more importantly the customers. While at JCPenney I have learned the skills to help improve a customers overall experience, which included helping them find a product, assisting with any questions that need answers, and making sure the store environment was clean to make the customers feel at ease while shopping. While being with the company, JCPenney has become like a second home to me all the associates felt like one big family that worked together for one main purpose."
good,"Would recommend to others."
good,"Great place to call home. They treat you like family. The only downfall to this company is the turnover of the management. That department they need some work on. Otherwise, its a great place to work and to call home."
good,"Working here not only taught me more about selling products, but also providing excellent customer service. I was always gentle and respectful with my visitors and it surely paid off. You also get great benefits from working here as well. Despite the busy holidays like Black Friday, the paycheck surely compensates for all the craziness. Overall the job is pretty good if you just keep a positive view on things and make the most out of each day!"
good,I loved this job although it didn't pay a lot it was a great first job for me. I was able to show my customer service skills and show how well i could handle money at the cash register.
good,Chances in advancement of position are high. Need more people to help ring and recover the store. Need a dress code. Needs better air conditioning on second floor during summer.
good,A typical work day for me at JCPenney is that that they schedule works with you and you meet a lot of people. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with a great team
good,At Jcpenney our main focus is our customers without them there is no sales which means no sales goals. Our customer being loyal is what drives sales for us so we always want them to feel welcome and leave highly satisfied and willing to recommend us to family and friends. As  a associate with this company I learned loyalty. I think the hardest part of my job was maybe being on commission my management was wonderful and my co-workers felt like family
good,"Coming to work greeting customers, keeping the racks neat,folding clothes and ringing up customers. I learned that it takes team work and a good attitude. management not so good. Co-workers are good. The hardest part of the job is trying to do your best when it is under staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people.."
good,"JCPenney was a wonderful place to work. I wouldn't have left if I hadn't moved. It's a great company, but your level of enthusiasm and enjoyment at work will likely depend on your direct management as opposed to the company generally speaking. The La Crosse branch, however, is absolutely amazing. The people there are loving and supportive and we felt like a family. We get food sometimes and it's a friendly, fun, but competitive atmosphere. If I could've moved the store with me to continue working there, I would have."
good,co workers are awesome and great team players. hardest part of job is the down time. the most enjoyable part of the job is the commitment and motivation of of the co worker they bring joy to the work place
good,Clock in go straight to task which is either stocking or cash register. Take a break then go back to work.Go back to work and see if you had to stay overnight if the store was busy.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people save money by spending more money. Watching majority of the people leave satisfied and ready come back and shop some more.
good,"It was always fun to work for jcpenny, there like family did all they could to make you feel like home.. have very good customers and guaranteed customer service.. always had the best customers I have meet and they always enjoyed getting their jewelry back in the shape that they wanted.. has a great community of people to be around. Loved the cookout that the company had for the employers."
good,"fun, not overly demanding, loved co-workers management and the customers, no one talks down, free food on holidays, over all excellent place to work"
good,"A typical day at work would include customer service, and side projects. The Shoe's Department at JCPenney requires a lot of work, asides from customer service. Projects include pricing and signing of shoes, managing mis-mates, displaying shoes, and making sure the stockroom is organized. These projects get done through a great amount of teamwork and understanding amongst co-workers. Although there are many projects, customer service always comes first. I've learned how to speak to customers, understand what they want, and try to help them to the best of my ability. In the past, I believed that making sure every customer was satisfied when leaving was the hardest part of the job, but I learned that it is usually quite easy. Even if we do not have a particular shoe the customer is looking for, I could offer them a similar style. Sometimes, just being friendly and polite would allow the customer to have a better shopping experience. I think that is probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,A great way to engage your team and customers by helping them learn and grow as individuals.  Challenge to improve sales and service while maintaining an exciting store environment.
good,Enjoyed working at the Salon. Having every hair product available to you without cost is Great!! The Salon handles all of the promoting which really helps. There are always clients coming in. The only draw back I had was that the store manager was running the salon and had no knowledge of how a salon works. Other than that the experience was great!!
good,Really enjoyed working for this company even though I was through a temporary service. This job taught me how to scan and count inventory. This was a great experience.
good,Typical work day started off before store opened. Spent time getting sales in adds ready and sorting stock. Co-workers were amazing and the job was truly enjoyable.
good,"I really enjoy my job. I love meeting new people and learning new things daily.I get along great with my co-workers. I would say that my managers, supervisors and GE go above and beyond to make sure things run smoothly for both associates and customers."
good,I love working here! All of my co-workers are so friendly and welcoming. I love coming to work everyday. I love the fact that they pay you two extra dollars for every credit card you open. They also get the associates involved in a lot. Like sometimes we have raffles and we get jeans days.
good,"JCPenney was an amazing experience I'll never forget. From the actual job to my coworkers I never had a problem. A great, positive place for anyone to work."
good,"Assisting customers with questions about the merchandise, cashier, customer service, organizing the clothes on shelves and hangers"
good,"Great people and a wonderful work experience. Management is fantastic and I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for part time, full time, or seasonal jobs."
good,"The Portrait Studio is a fabulous place for those wishing to do birthday and holiday photos."
good,"I like how they have monthly classes on different areas such as haircuts, color. They also are very goal oriented. Another great beginning salon for fresh new stylist"
good,"A typical day at Jcpenney's shoe department was serving customers with a smile while also maintaining  the departments cleanliness. This taught me to always be patient with customers and to always lend a helping hand when needed, working at Jcpenney also thought me how to keep a leveled head in busy times. Management and Jcpenney was good the supervisors got along with the employees always making sure that we had a close bond as supervisor and employee. The hardest part of the job at Jcpenney would have to be keeping it clean while very busy. The most enjoyable part at working at Jcpenney would have to be my coworkers and the friendly customers of Jcpenney."
good,"Fun place to work while going to school. Loved the discounts. Flexible with school. Crazy during the holidays. Nice managers, given yearly review on time. Hated closing because of recovery could take hours!"
good,making sure that all the kids are help fun and learning at the same time. making sure that they treat each other with respect and love. prepare food and maintaining a healthy environment for the children and all stuff
good,A typical day at work is walking around the store and making sure you speak to all the customers and see if you can help them. Making sure the racks and fitting rooms look clean and organized. Responding to registers that need help checking people out. Making signs and ensuring the sale going on corresponds with the sales signs. Unloading trucks of merchandise and distributing among the store appropriately. I learned a lot of communication skills and how a business operates. The co-workers are the best part of my job and a lot of the reason I love going to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the redundancy of the job.
good,a very interesting and fun place to work at with a really great group of people. Could not ask for a better group of people to work with
good,Working with JcPenney's gives you a family sitting not only with the managers and co-workers but also with the customers. You can advance within the company if you have great customer services skills and are willing to work to achieve the advancement you are wanting
good,I love working at my job. Great management and great co workers. Hourly wage is not the best but the environment makes up the difference in pay. Management cares and the company cares.
good,it's a wonderful place to work in fun and managers are understating . it's fun envierment . its very interesting working in jcp
good,The company is on the road back to recovery. There are some truly amazing managers who work in this company. Technology is far behind the times but the company is focusing its resources in other areas. Great new merchandise departments coming into the stores which should really help to drive the bottom line.
good,"Employee recognition and appreciation; employee discounts!"
good,Working at jcp requires putting clothes away helping customers and satisfying their needs with whatever and working as a  cashier. I learn a lot about different people every day. The management is okay some of the managers are rude i think the hardest part is keeping up on fitting rooms making sure they're clean. The most enjoyable is the people i work with making the environment a fun place to work at mostly teens my age so its nice.
good,"i loved working at Jcpenny, my co-workers were really fun to work with. it was kinda like family. and the Jcpenny i worked at was in the mall so i,ve gotton to see all walks of life and the customers were nice 90% of the time."
good,"I worked for customer service and I was also a Bra Specialist. I would check people out but, I would also help women find the perfect fit. I learned a lot about dealing with all kinds of people of all ages. The management was perfect when I first started but after a while we got newer and younger managers and it started to go downhill from there. My coworkers were awesome, I made a lot of long term friends here. Everyone was very helpful with each other and majority of us got along great. The hardest part of the job is the angry customers, especially the ones that argue. The most enjoyable part was the nice customers  and interacting with them."
good,"When i first started working there I started out as sale associate, helping customers in the junior department, our main problem at JCP was keeping an eye on people who would steal or change price tags. about 2 years later I was promoted to the salon. where i meet incredible people, the only challenge was I was going to be running the salon alone for about six months. It was a huge challenge but I got through with it."
good,"Nice co-workers, friendly atmosphere, easy job."
good,"A typical day at JCPenney varies depending on the day sometimes is slow and other times busy. I usually have the closing shift so I have to keep up with maintaining the floor clean and helping customers with their needs. What I have learned is to be a team  player and always put the customer first. Management is really helpful they work with you to make the job smooth. I enjoy my co-workers, we are team players helping each other out with our departments. The hardest part of the job would be that I close by myself the majority of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of a team and being able to meet new people."
good,I had a great manager. It made for a a great work day and work environment! I worked with a great group of people who wanted to do a great job every day.
good,"love jcpenney, was a great place to work, was able to learn new skills. enjoy making the customers happy and i also love the food that they provide to show their employees how much they appreciate them for their hard work"
good,"A typical day at subway was crzy, there were only two members at a time so teying to maintain the store and make sandwiches was a hassle. The environment was very fast paced because of that though and I loved that!"
good,"If I was on morning shift I would go in and attend the morning meeting. Head to floor and do a quick shoe count, I would open and balance my draws and await my customers."
good,great workers and pay I learned a lot about the warehouse industry and how to get along with people. Really enjoyed the structure of the company.
good,"Great place to work, great environment. Really nice people. Great team and always lots of support from team members and management."
good,Welcoming customers to the store and straightening my area on the store floor. Shipping and receiving product to replenish sales floor. Set up and break store displays according to the seasons. Assisting with inventory.
good,"Good Company to work for. Everyone is nice around the place, good management overall a good place to work at."
good,"Clean up the store and make sure it was up to core standards, and if a customer needed help that required the cash register, I would go help them, (proceed to get yelled at by a manager because I'm supposed to be cleaning). That was definitely the hardest part of the job. I learned how to operate a cash register and keep it stocked."
good,What makes JC Penny's a great place to work is the management and the people who work there. There are a lot of incentives to make sales goals. Management if very flexible and will work with you to give you a desired schedule.
good,I would come to work and go out on the sales floor help customers out when needed would replenise stock on sales floor make sure the store was clean and tiddy. I learned alot about Customer service while working there. Management was great co workers  were great to work with i would say the hardest part of working there was not enough hours were given to me for being considered full time. the most enjoyable part was working with my co workers and working with customers.
good,It really didn't have benefits. I wish it had. But over all it was a great work experience and I would recommend the job to anyone
good,"helping customers, made to measure blinds, fun loving co-workers. We had pot lucks, I learned how to a certified window specialist and a Bra specialist."
good,"On a typical day, I set up displays for merchandise."
good,"When I started working here I was only sixteen and it was my first job. A typical day at work would be me getting on the floor organizing the merchandise and making sure everything was where it needed to be. Also I worked the register a few times, I always greeted customers, I ring their transaction up in a speedy friendly manner. My co workers were amazing, they were mostly older women then me, but I loved it. The hardest part of the job was not being able to answer any questions a customer had because sometimes they would get frustrated, but I always kept calm and if a situation got too much for me I would call a manger. I enjoyed most of the job it was a great experience."
good,"I enjoyed working here in the women's department during my summer break from school. I got to help customers, organize clothes and learned how to use a cash register. even though the store is small it is still a great place to work."
good,"As a student, jcpenney is a great place for a first time job. The hours  are very flexible with your school hours and the overall environment is friendly."
good,"wonderful atmosphere, the customer come first always,friendly staff .the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying my customer."
good,Working there was great. I was a cashier and got to work with many different people. It was a good experience to have. The management there was also great. They were very helpful when it came to helping customers and also other employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  One of the perks was they had benefits which at the time most retail places didn't offer this.  They had room for some advancement.  I did like the employee discounts as well."
good,Some days work would be chaotic (mainly weekends or holidays)but with the guidance of an amazing management and accompanied by hardworking co-workers the day would run by smoothly and our goals of high customer satisfaction would be met. Hardest part of work would be not being able to help a customer find what they were looking for. Most enjoyable days were being able to bond with customers on a daily and finding what they were looking for in our store.
good,"Jcpenney is a great place to work and your coworkers are all really sweet. The managers are friendly, approachable and truly care about their employees. The company does face a lot of rude customers due to an abundance of coupons and discounts but it is never a dull moment. The company really does care for their employees and often hosts lunches or dinners to celebrate the hard work of their associates, they do monthly birthday cakes and are always willing to do charity work."
good,"It is a very tidy and well maintained store. They teach you how to use the computer system, manage money, fold properly, customer service, and very professional."
good,Easy and very flexible with college schedule. Must get credit apps. Management is very easy going as long as the job gets done and customers are happy.
good,"Assiging my co-workers to their projects having them accomplished in a timly manner,I like the retail industry because I meet a lot of interesting  clients , My associates are very nice to work with and they are very had working"
good,Great Place to work!!!! Although you need to have a good clientele already built up. there is not much of walk in opportunity Other than that it is a good place to work.
good,"Loved working there cause of the discounts and the cute clothes they have to the kids and women, location of the place was right on the beach"
good,"Good environment to work in."
good,"Through my personal experience working for this company I enjoy every time I'm at work. I enjoy assisting to peoples need and they love when you help them find what they are looking for or something close to it. Management and co- workers are fun to work with, really helpful and really friendly. I think that the hardest part of the job is to have a few days off with out working because you really enjoy the your job duties."
good,The most enjoyable day working would be having to work as a team but ending up working alone. getting the job done serving my loyal customers
good,"I loved working at JCPenney. It was filled with wonderful people who were very understanding and I hardly ever had a bad day. It broke my heart when the store was shut down, mostly for the kind people who worked there. They were all like one huge family there, and they were very proud of the works and accomplishments that they made as a group."
good,"Great parttime job. Great discounts, flexible hours, employees,and managers. During the holidays they do so much for their employees."
good,"A typical day at JCPenney was fun and enjoyable. The days were light and the co-workers there were always fun to work with. The managers and the boss were all very nice and treated all the workers there equally. I enjoyed working there as a summer job before college and learned so much because it was my very first job. Because it was a retail job, I enjoyed working with different kinds of customers and helping them. I learned to be patient with everyone. This job reflected my work ethics such as my punctuality, organized nature, and making sure my work is as perfect it can be. I became aware of my people skills. The hardest part of this job was to handle some managers who seemed to always have problems with everyone and their working abilities. I had to be extra patient when they were working. The most enjoyable part of this job was all the people. Apart from some managers, everyone there was very nice and I learned a lot from them. The way they handled tricky situations was remarkable.

Coaching and effectively training associates on daily expectations and safety rules.

Management was always friendly even if they were busy, if they couldn't help you they would always direct you to someone who would. My day was fairly simple with a set amount of tasks that would make the day go by quickly. From making sure the fitting rooms were clean and empty of clothes to organizing the clearance racks and removing clothes off the floor it kept the time between ringing customers out simple and quick. My multitasking ability was tested and improved when I worked Black Friday. Having been slightly short staffed I was placed in charge of an entire department and had to do all the tasks myself."
good,"It is a joy to go into work.  The best part is the people there.  It is a relaxed and positive environment, there is a real sense of working together and cooperation.  The supervisors have good things to say to you, and encourage us to keep up the good work.  We are expected to do well which inspires us all to not let them down.  A great example of how a business should be run.  I really do appreciate them."
good,"This is the J.C. Penney in the Wilton mall. A typical work day, even when it's busy. Was very pleasant and fairly easy to get through the day. Fellow co-workers where glad to assist either myself or other fellow co-workers. they take the golden rule seriously at J.C. Penney. I've learned that 99.9% of the time that if you treat a customer how you would like to be treated, chances are that they will treat you as such. I've run into my fair share of unpleasant customers in J.C. Penney. I simply nod, and pleasantly listen and agree, and continue helping said customer as best I can. Always with a smile, and Kind demeanor. Management was the best, for my first work experience, I believe that is true. I've never felt so welcome in my life. Store manager was very understanding concerning my physical limitations and adjusted schedule to compensate. giving me shorter shifts while at the same time keeping most of my usual hours. They loved my persistence, given my physical limitations. The co workers at this particular J.C. Penney. The only way I can explain, is that they are a-kin to old friends that even though I've only known them for a short time, it felt like I've known them for a lifetime. They are such great people. Honestly, the hardest part of the job was leaving. Everything was cake. For me anyway. Just waking up I the morning to go and work for these wonderful people. I accualy looked forward to this job on a daily basis. on my days of I'd sometimes go in and say 'hi'!"

good,"A day jcpenney was for the most part very laid back. Nice atmosphere and nice people. my staff was pretty cool to work with. we worked as a team and usually got all all our tasks done in a timely matter. I learned how to deal with all sorts of differnt people and different personalities besides my own. There was never really any hard parts to my job, i adapt pretty well with anything and anyone, so if i came to a challege in my path , I over came it on my own with no real problem. I  mostly enjoyed interacting with my customers and especially my co-workers. We knew how to have a good time while also getting our work done and keeping our customers happy and satified."
good,"J.C. Penney encouraged one to have a career with them.  They provided training, incentives, benefits (additional hours during the holidays)"

good,"I really enjoyed working here..Everyone was so nice and pleasant,,and the buddy book was awesome!"
good,A typical day at the JCPenney Lifetouch Studio was a very fast-paced day working with customers and their children.  A system of orderliness and cooperation was necessary to successfully accomplish the heavy workload of multiple appointments per hour.  A respite seemed to be working one-on-one with the customer by showing them their photos and selling packages. Another respite would be the required photo enhancements done to sell pictures. Management was decisive and took their leadership role seriously.
good,"Great environment, great hours even for part-time especially during black Friday and holidays"
good,overall i loved working at jcpenney. It was fun and all the managers were very helpful and advancement in the company was great.

good,A tipical day at work would be finding what the daily goal is for the sales and achieving them until the end of the shift. I have learned how to close a sale by creating trust and relationships with the customers to close a sales. Management was very professional by motivating and leading employees. The hardest part of the job would be achieving sales on a slow day. The most part I enjoyed about my job was the people in the  work environment .
good,"work with others, lbjlhhhhhhhhlljhkuouguoophpihipjpijpj;ijijpjp;ots of free makeup and training"

good,I enjoy JcPenney because they do an amazing job at training new employees and making you feel comfortable while there.  They work to try to let you have a flexible schedule and the managers are great.  They are all very sweet and patient.  The hardest part of the job is when you are trying to explain to people that they must have all measurements to be able to order custom windows/blinds. But the most enjoyable part is the independence and trust you get from your managers who treat you as a part of a team rather than someone to boss around.
good,Open & close all register/  open credits for jc pennys  /   work in the fine jewery dept
good,"If this had been more than a seasonal job, I would have been more than willing to stay a part of it. The managers I worked with directly were great and I loved the job of setting the sales. The hours were great also, because you could get in early and get out early, so you still felt like you had the entire day to spend however you want. Also, the store manager remembered me over a year later when I was shopping, despite only working there for 2 months with a store that employes over 100 people, easily."
good,"A day at work would be 12hrs on your feet lifting products on scales, weighing them and labeling them to be shipped off. Sometimes I loaded and unloaded trucks when needed. Also kept track of stock count."

good,A typical day at work for me would be faily easy and would go by smoothly. What you would have learned working for the retail store would be how to work well with others as well as working efficiently. My coworkers were nice and we always managed to keep a good working area and or relationships. the hardest part of the job would have been working with multiple customers at once yet you would still have to manage and stay stress free.

All I did was put clothes away, assist customers, and be a cashier. Most enjoyable part about the job was you made friends easy and a lot of people I knew worked with me so we could relate with one another. Bad part was the gossip."
good,A retail Environment with comprehensive abundance of Management and staff.
good,"A good work environment is important to me. I like the employee interactions for example, I like getting to know fellow co-workers. Having a sense of family each day coming into work. It is nice knowing that at the start of the day I say goodbye to my family only to be coming to work with my (work family). I like putting my skills that I have learned and apply it to my job and also have the knowledge that I have that may be applied to any future job.

Unfortunately they were not hiring for permanent positions at the end of December because I would have loved to have remained a part of the company.  My experience there was very enjoyable.  I learned a lot in a short time and truly enjoyed the people that I worked with.  It was a fast paced environment but that is something that I loved the most. There is always something to do, whether its waiting on customers at the register, or helping them find something in the department, to straightening up the department and keeping you work area neat and clean."

The hardest part of my job was pouring my time, love and experience into someone and have them not use it .It didnt happen often but in my many years of  being in this business,I have had to coach people into finding their passion that was not this field they had chosen. Due to lack of ability to preform services or communicate with customers.That was hard for me at first but with maturity I realized that if you don't LOVE what you do, change it ."
good,A typical day involved assisting customers at registers and on the floor. Assisted customers locating items in store or on jcp.com. Management is always there when needing additional assistance.

I was asked by one of the younger girls as I was leaving on my last day, ""What are we going to do without you Beth?  You're the one who keeps us all straight around here.""  It broke my heart.

Most of the time customers would call instead of coming in and i was always able to help my customers in store but mostly over the phone than others would. The management team was sometimes fair and positive most of them didnt really care about the customers review and the stores overall performance.

JCP has a great management team I have worked here off and on since I have been in college they are willing to work with my hectic schedule. My co-workers are awesome people too everyone works as a team not an individual to assure that the store is running well. The hardest part of my job is when I run into a difficult customer who is not willing to listen to me when I’m doing a transaction and there is an issue, it is not the best feeling when people talk down to you and that’s something I had to overcome from my years of experience in retail. Sometimes you can run into that one customer who puts a smile on your face and lighten up my day that’s what I enjoy about this job and also the kindness of the management like I mentioned I have been off and on with this job and they have stuck by my side while I have been in college."

good,This is a great Job however like most retail it fluctuates greatly
good,this company has been great for me i started out in latham back in july of 2010 but then i wanted to seek an opportunity to get into management so i transferred to another store to seek that opportunity and i haven't gotten it yet but now i am looking to expand my horizons and look for a new opportunity
good,"enjoyed the flexible schedule while i was in college, met alot people and developed a friendship"
good,I loved working for JcPenney from the people I worked with to the customers themselves. I would defiantly work there again.
good,"Everything was perfect just felt a little too much of I worked there for too long with no raises , the management was great but they expected so much of me which I wouldn’t mind if I was paid a little more"
good,"Great customers, easy learning, lots of benefits, growing opportunities, diversity work place, good training workers and teachings, hands on with customers and cashier"
good,Interacting with different customers wasine of my favorite things I loved about working at Jcpennys.  One thing I really didn't like about working there was that we really didn't get busy until around the holidays.  It's a great job just not fast enough for me .
good,"I loved working for Sephora inside JcPenney. They were and still are a great company. I had an amazing work team, and made some amazing friendships, most days didn't feel like a work day because we had so much fun too!"
good,The best part of this job is being able to help customers find what will absolutely make their day. I also love being able to solve problems and expand my own skills.

good,"It is a very lovely place to work especially because of the very friendly staff members. They make you feel very welcome "
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal sales associate and was sadly let go after the season was over, due to budget cuts. I had a lot of fun working here and really enjoyed the experience!"
good,Great atmosphere with wonderful people. I think jcpenney is a great company to work for. I was ranked third in my store for credit apps and i would have liked to have made more per hour. I had to resign because of relocation and couldn't afford the drive.
good,I like my manager. Anytime I need my schedule changed around due to having 3 children in school she will make it work so I can go to their school activities. I really enjoy working there part time. I just need a second job to work daytime hours preferably Monday through Friday from 8-5. Then go to JcPenney after I get done working that job.
good,Managers and staff are friendly.  Training was good and everyone helps new hires settle in to their new position.  Work is not difficult but can be busy during peak hours and holidays.  Employee discounts and some benefits are available for part-time employees.
good,Being part of a growing company has its ups and down. Along side loyal associates who believe the core values make everything worth it. Your skills will always be challenged and appreciated in the retail environment.
good,While working in Jcpenney I learned how to stock up the merchandise on the sales floor. I also learned how to put the prices on clothing and accessories.
good,With a clientele base that consists of so many different cultures gives the amazing ability to learn a lot about people in general and how to handle certain situations such as a customer who speaks a different language or trying to understand what is being said. It tends to get busy too so you learn to work quicker and more efficiently in a smaller space which also builds on being organized.
good,Any job is what you make it. We are not a perfect company no company is. You get out what you put in. Some people love it some don’t. Retail is difficult because you’re dealing with people all day everyday. You have to develop skills to handle a variety of personalities.
good,"Fue unas de mis mejores experiencias de trabajo ,eramos como una familia ,volvería y me encantaría volver a trabajar en dicha y excelente compañía."
good,"I really like working at JC Penney. Team members are normally full of energy and ready to work. Generally, management is helpful and engaged. I encourage anyone to join the JC Penney family if you are given the opportunity."
good,"As JcPenney being my first retail job, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I think what made it especially enjoyable was management. I had a great store manager who was very hands on. I am a people person so getting to interact with different customers on a regular was great. You build a relationship with your customers as well as your fellow employees. If it hadn't been for us having our store shut down, I'd still probably be working there."
good,By far the easiest and simplest job I’ve had in my short working life (5 years.) My first holiday job and it was everything I was looking for ay the time.
good,"JCPenney was my first job ever and it was great! I met new people and the mangers were nice. They seem a little strict but can take a little humor here and there. My job was to first handle the register and  convince people to sign up for the JCPenney credit card. After that, I moved to recovery which I liked better since it was a little less stressful. As a recovery team member, You work with a group of people working on a specific area of the store folding and hanging the clothes. In other words, you had to make the store look presentable again."
good,I loved the discount and the employess. the managemnt is the best. The pay sucks but the have incentives with credit cards which make up for it. I loved it there and will once your hired if your a good employee they welcome you back when your needed.
good,Hardest part of the job was coming up with setting sales goals for departments and then trying to meet or exceed them. Most everyone was invested in the culture and how our store performed against others. Be prepared to not spend much time at home during holidays.
good,Teamwork and great environment to learn skills. Supervisor are at hand for help or any information about your job or any work related. Flexible with you
good,"Dedicated, service focused worker with excellent multitasking skills. Compassionate and highly motivated in attending to clients in a diverse setting. Seeking a position to be part of a team that provide quality service to their clients."
good,JCPenny gives you the stepping stone to create your own business inside their business . They provide great training and supply all the tools you need to build your clientele.

good,"I have not worked for the last 20 years, so I don't know much about how the company operates now.  I am sure they have only improved since I have worked there.  I  always liked seeing all my friends every day plus getting to meet new people. The hardest part of my job was having to sit in with management when there were disciplinary actions that had to be made."

good,"Working at JCPenney was amazing, I loved to work there, the only reason I leaved was because I wasn't getting the enough hours and pay for rent, but overall, it was good"
good,"This is  very fast paced simple job. time goes by there really fast. There always something to do. I learn a lot working here. how to input check so people so customers could pay there bills. Its all about the customer and there WORTH. Lots of sales, so always had to be in tuned with that. The customers was my favorite part."
good,Employees are nice. Customers can be very nice and can be very rude. I learned how to use the Point Of Sale system. Hardest part is when customers are very rude.
good,"Top of the list management. The best. But also professional. They made sure that the workers were important to them, have not had a job that had management like this JCPENNEY here in Wichita"
good,Amazing staff and managers. It’s a great work environment and it feels like one big family. Working here is easy but occasionally stressful. The job truly is great.

And also I can notify how the team is open and willing to help at anytime needed was helpful for the success of everyday at all.

good,"This is the only job I've worked where I didn't dread going to work everyday. The company culture is one that genuinely loves and cares for its employees. They do a fantastic job of reaching out to the community through various events held throughout the year as well as charity/fundraising opportunities. They hold raffles and fun little competitions for workers to encourage them solicit credit (although its not a big deal for them if you don't solicit credit), and every once and a while they open the store early for workers exclusively to shop, and give out gift bags for employee appreciation. Our break room even had a massage chair!"
good,"This is an awesome place to work. You get to help people find their ""look"". I learned more about matching outfits with personalities. The people were great to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store neat while so many people are digging through all the clothes."

good,"I absolutely loved working here! It saddens me that i am no longer able to, since the store at the Pendleton location went out of business. While i was employed though, every day was amazing! All of my coworkers were great to be around on a daily basis. My manager was the greatest manager ive ever had! The only thing that I personally struggled with was meeting the stores required quota with credit card sign ups. I think the overall company should change their policy to make the quota numbers a bit more reasonable for rural areas. But other than that i would go back to JCPenney in a heart beat if i had the oportunity."
good,I loved working at jcpenny unfortunately my family moved and i had to leave but if i had a choice i wouldve stay for a long time the hiring manager and manger was very nice and welcoming
good,"My memories of JCPenney's are the best I miss it just saddened me when it  closed,  it but mostly my co-workers and my three supervisor who are the best people that I have worked with in a long long. My customers were all the best, I was luck that I didn't any bad issue with customers."

good,I worked at JCPenneys for 13 years I absolutely loved it. Pennys has always been fair to me and they worked with me. If I ever had any problems or issues there was always somebody I could go and talk to. The only thing that I had a problem with is in training because we just didn’t have enough people to take the time to train as far as paperwork is done and so all of the training was basically on the floor and at times that was a little difficult. All in all JCPenney’s  was a great place for me to work and learn.  I would recommend it as a Great starting job there’s room for a advancement and you learn as you go .
good,"Great place to work , they really make you feel at home."
good,"Fun energetic staff, fast paced work environment, some heavy lifting involved, must be able to multitask, encourages growth and advancement opportunities, some travel for training may be involved"

good,"In my experience in the job I liked serving people, and the continious communication with costumers.  I learned about styles and fashion.  I learned to look for merchandise online.  What I enjoyed most of the job was being a cashier."
good,"The environment was great, everyone was really friendly and The They were flexible with my hours. I did enjoy my time there at JCPenney.  I would Recommend it."
good,"The store has no night time security guards. But appears to have frequent groups of shop lfters at night, near exit doors. Sales items left unattended."

good,JCPenney is a wonderful company to work for in the field of Asset Protection. I was with them for 20 years and felt like I contributed to the program.  The training is above standard of other company's in Asset Protection. If one ever has questions or concerns there is a network of people to assist.
good,it was a relaxing even pace with occasional rushes of customers.
good,"Doing hair is a lot on your body if you have a full book. They offer a lot of training and they are fair with the commission.  However, there are a lot of stylist in the salon and it makes it hard to build your book so the potential to make money is harder.  But overall I really love the salon and our manager is great!"
good,"Maintained Jewelry department."
good,"One thing i learned was better communication with people and customers. Management is nice and understanding. The workplace is also a very positive place. The only hard part of the job is putting up with mean, crabby, rude customers and having to smile and give great customer service even if they're being mean to you. But the most enjoyable part is having good co-workers who cheer you up and work with you as a team and keep a positive attitude."
good,I was blessed with a manager that was excellent and caring. He arranged my hours according to my needs and was understanding. Good and very cooperative team willing to go all out to help one another.
good,"I learned how to count money and be more efficient with my time, I felt apart of a team, we had daily goals that were met each day. I assisted customers and helped them find what they needed."
good,I started as a seasonal employee during black Friday and thanks to the experienced/friendly staff trained me well and I picked up quickly and got hired on as a part time associate. The pay was fair for the customer interaction work and the amount of duties assigned each day. Good communication from management to the sales associates on promotions and sales. My most favorite was the discounts given to employees. Not much room for growth and development.
good,"I worked in the district office of JCPenney for 2.5 years as administrative assistant to the district manager.  During my stay there, I found the employees of the store and the district office to be very hard working, caring and happy individuals.  They took pride in their company and their respective departments within the store.  It was a fun place to work.  They offered very good benefits but I did not participate at the time because I was insured under my husband.  I only left because there was no opportunity of advancement for me and I wanted to return to the financial services industry.  Great leadership there!"
good,"Looking for a career in fashion or retail? This could be the job for you. Wasn’t for me, but the managers would work with around my schedule while I also had another job at the time."
good,"While the hours  were not desirable,  I must say  that my   co-workers were definitely a  pleasure to   work beside.  There were times when i   had first got there and they were very helpful with anything that I  needed to   know. I   had a  good  time experience working there."
good,"Very good place to work. Very flexible when it comes to school schedule and  they give you decent hours. Everyone is very friendly and supportive. Also weirdly lenient when it comes to being late, there is a five minute grace period."
good,"I worked some evenings and all weekends "
good,JcPenney is a great place to work! Everyone is friendly and they are always willing to help you if you need it. Your coworkers will become like family and it is always a great time when you are together. I definitely recommend working here if you are looking for a good part-time job.
good,Fast pace environment. If you like not knowing what your day is going to be like this is the perfect job for you. Your day changes every day even when you plan it out. Leadership is good. The company does care about its people.
good,JCPenney was  good place to work overall.  I enjoyed working with customers and management was good.  They provided great training and I got along well with co-workers.
good,"Loved working here would go back if i could, the work wasnt hard , everyone got a long and got what we needed done it really helped learn a few things working there and i enjoy cashier i found out"
good,"JC Penney was my first ever employer and I loved it! The staff and management were some of the best individuals I've ever encountered. If retail would have been my career path, JC Penney would have been my place to stay."

good,pretty good job I really enjoyed the environment and everyone that worked here. the customers were really nice as well and did not have too many issues.

good,I had a lot of fun working there. The people were very friendly and the management was amazing. The work environment really made you feel welcomed and I just felt like I wanted to go to work.
good,"As the Senior Merchandiser, a typical day would be to open the store and get it ready of opening.  The money bags out for each register, employee in each department, all merchandise from the receiving department displayed on racks, and straightening their departments before the arrival of the customers."
good,"Love JCP. People are great. Work is balanced but challenging. "
good,personally i was only a seasonal sales associate so i wasn't there for long but from what i know it was a fun quick paced environment with decent break times. you have to be able to be on your feet for a while especially with walking around the store constantly but overall its good.
good,this was a great job and a great place to work. but sadly this store was closed due to company downsizing. but would recomend the company if there is a store near you.
good,You have to work and don't get paid nearly enough to do half things you need too .... Its always busy which is fine but they want you too keep up with dressing rooms and put stuff back on the floor and be at the register and help costumers
good,"Very fast pace environment, available to pick up extra hours great benefits for employees as well as employee discount. Employees can pick up hours during holidays or special projects."

good,"There are a lot of challenges to department stores in the current environment and JCPenney is doing everything to try and keep up, which can make it a hectic place to work.  But its not personal and they try their best and they have GREAT people."
good,"I worked for jcpenney company for 27 years.In the beginning it was  a prestigious place to work . As the years went by and as corporate and society changed, it became a job and not a career .I was blessed to have been able to work in an era where customer service was truly customer service.I worked with some of the finest people and value my time while there. Today the company has realized in order to stay active that it must go back to some of the old ways to operate ."
good,"Assisting customer with purchases and returns "
good,Enjoyed working for JC Penney as  a real first retail job. Learned about the window coverings department and how to order custom drapery and blinds. Learned alot about customer service and how retail is run in general. I also enjoyed the sales discounts and the people.
good,I enjoyed my time with JCPenney and advanced to a level of management that allowed me to have stock options. The area that I worked in was the Quality Assurance division and that area was closed and sent to Taiwan and Hong Kong.
good,Retail was different i learned a lot about the company and myself! although during the holidays it was challenging because of the volume but i did grow during the the time i was there and got to learn their system.
good,managers are very understanding and flexible with hours. made working fun. they are very detailed when it comes to explaining and training for the position.
good,"I worked in the salon, which I absolutely loved. My coworkers were great, the clients are really good people and it was my pleasure to assist them. My manager is an amazing person. The culture was a family feel. I appreciated the time I spent working in the Salon By Instyle inside JC Penney. I would definitely go back if they needed me!"
good,"Jcpenney is a wonderful place to work. since I have graduated highschool, there is so many more hours you can get due to highschoolers only being able to work certain hours. the managers are very caring and do whatever then can to benefit and improve the company."
good,"Was a great company to work for , hours were just hard to come by because we were over staffed But I have nothing bad to say about the companies overall it was an fun experience management and employee were very nice and respectful."
good,Nice place to work. Management was great. Basic work day was receiving inbound calls from customers about their credit card bills. Helped troubleshoot any issues that needed to be resolved.
good,"The work life balance at JCP was great. My schedule was very flexible as long as I got my 40 hours in each week. Management cared about their teams, and there was lots of opportunities to progress."
good,"The hardest part of the job was around holiday times, trying to keep up with the customers and their orders. Having to keep the store organized and clean repeatedly ."
good,The job is very relaxed yet productive with flexibility in terms of work hours and availability. It's a perfect job for someone studying in college or needing a part-time to gain experience.
good,"checking in clients, scheduling, and maintaining salon. "
good,"That is all I really need to say. I love the people I work for and work with. It is a great environment where everyone is hard working, carries their own weight and  helps each other to complete the daily tasks when needed."
good,The company makes company standards very clear and concise. They stay up to date with industry standards by involving the guests in their visits to each location.
good,I actually love JcPenneysI Have been there 2 yrs plus and love it. I am a ppl person so things work for me.Management some are awesome.I was taught a lot.I appreciate JcPenneys.
good,Overall an amazing place to work! I've gotten to know some amazing characters over my year at JCPenney. I have made friends that will give me a lasting connection for years to come.
good,Well not all management is bad some supervisors are great some are hypocrites and some just don't know what the there doing  I work min 27hrs a week cut down to 12hrs week
good,"I really enjoyed working at JC Penny, great co-workers and good schedule. It was close to my home so that was even better for me. It was a great learning experience."
good,I loved working there and regretted leaving but the hours were getting cut and I had to find something that had more hours. so I left here to go work a 40 hour week.
good,Make sure the store was up to part at all time.I learn alot of information at jcpenny. I love all my manager that i had chance to work with at jcpenny.The workplace culture is excellent place at jcpenny. I don't recall a hardest part of the job.I enjoy everything about this job.
good,"I can say without a doubt that JCPenney was a fantastic place to work.  The environment was healthy with good teamwork, communication, and you always knew the managers had your back if you had an unruly customer."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a bunch of friendly eager customers, and a daily learning experience. Management was super helpful and eager to teach employees unknown techniques. The hardest part of the job would have to be knowing what to do next. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find exactly what they were looking for and watching them leave with a smile on their faces."
good,A typical day at work is greeting customers and making sure the store is looking nice.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers find what their looking for.
good,"always dealing with customers was a fun part of the job. Getting to know a lot of different people and where they come from as they are shopping, makes my job easier and shopping easier as well for the customer."
good,"I liked working at JC Penney's. The benefits were great, such as everything being 20% off for employees. They always have an open door policy which is very beneficial to the employees."
good,Day started by checking in at time-clock then going to a pre-work meeting to discuss which tractor-trailers were prioritized to be unloaded and loaded. Then small stretches to get us ready for the workday. After which we were assigned trailers to unload after unloading a trailers you were assigned a new one. You get 3 breaks a day 2 for to rest and one in the middle for lunch.
good,"A typical day I will go into the back, clock in, then proceed to see what part of the store I am working in. I usually work in shoes, which means I will straighten shoes, get online orders, jcpenney payments, and straighten clothes."
good,its a great place to work but when working there you have to pretty much teach yourself at some things.and also when you are trained the training is not something that is all done in a day its a overall time consuming process.
good,Retail aspect is not fun. Furniture sales on other hand is great pay and benefits. Managment is not always checking on you and sales are simple. Jcpenny cutomers are great.
good,"Creativity allowed regarding displays. Easy to communicate with management as well as coworkers. praised for good customer service, commission for every credit card created, as well as for jewelry and home."
good,"These are a few responsibilities I had at JCPenney, "
good,fun place fast paced work environment great cutomer service friendly dsiverse customers and coworkers great ways to advance in company willing to learn and train
good,"I worked my way up the ladder at this job and enjoyed it very much so. "
good,"I usually work mornings, and  I come in to do go backs or work on go backs. I am trusted to work alone and complete projects on a limited amount of time. I also help lead the team when I do work at nights to complete recovery. Very fast paced, and they give you plenty of opportunity to grow with the company."
good,Had this job during High School and they worked with my school life schedule. Gave me days off for exams and prom. Great company and fun management. Great Job!
good,"i very much well enjoyed working at JC penny's and providing good customer service , i learned how to become a better sales person and how to communicate well with others. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others while they were shopping. i was very comfortable in the workplace and got along well with my managers and co workers. the hardest part of the job for me was when things were misplaced and belonged to other parts of the story but i worked my way and made everything possible."
good,"working here at JcPenneys, it's been the best job I have ever had. "
good,The management and coworkers are like family. Very professional and friendly environment. I mostly enjoy working with my customer service team. I've always felt like I had total support of my team and managers.
good,overall it was a good experience. It provided a lot of benefits such as a nice size employee discount with many other advantages. This job was very calm and collected.
good,So far the best salon I've worked at . The compensation is above industry standard and the high management is motivating and positive. The benefits far out way the negatives. The team works together and has a spirit of oneness and we all help each other out for the greater good of the salon. The equipment is older and the salons all need a face lift but the walk in traffic is amazing and the opportunity to make as much money as you want is there .
good,At Jc penny it was fun while it lasted I didn't get much days off but the work was fun . Everyday I learned something new and meet somebody new . I would love to work for them again.
good,I enjoyed my experience as a manager with this company. The store I worked at closed and I stayed home for awhile after moving to NY.
good,While I was in high school I wanted to start working to make money and buy myself a car and this was a great opportunity given to me by family friends whom worked there. Some of the best management I have dealt with.
good,"typical day at work when a customers are not satisfy with your service. when it happens I learn to listen to the customers demand and be courteous and don't engaged the attitude, just smile and be apologetics's. I love the management and the JCPenney's had safe and clean workplace. the hardest part is trying to get a customer join into the JCPenney's Credit app. enjoyable part the jobs is when you know your serving the public helping find the customers need."
good,"I looooved working here! The people  I worked with was very fun to be around hard-working a lot of teamwork. There was a lot of employee /supervisor meetings , and training every morning ; which I thought was really cool ! I didn't really have that  at any other position. They had a lot of potlucks ,giveaways , and ways to get bonuses on your check! I really loved working there if I had any other position to go back to that will be the position I would go back to , and then work my way up to management or supervisor  position. They  have a lot of room to grow you just have to work hard be on time and you have nothing to worry about!"
good,"JCPenney is a great place to work. The management team is very hands on in making sure all departments are running efficiently and try to encourage a working ""smarter, not harder"" policy."
good,"Fast paced always busy, learned about the credit card sales, management is good as supervisors, coworkers are fun, hard part is just rude customers, and enjoyable part is interacting with customers"
good,Summary really describes it. It is a great work environment with great people! I have enjoyed every day there and seeing customers come in time and time again really shows how well run and operated the store is!
good,"Good salary, great bosses and very nice professional building with food court. A typical work day starts at 7am and end at 4:30 pm. Best part of the job is working and getting to know different people and helping figure out what our customers are looking and expecting from JCP. The worst part of the job is trying to calm the customer down once they are angry about a purchase order."
good,"I liked Jcpenney because I was able to try out different positions. I learned about every single department from kids, to women's to men's. Including sale support and enterprise. My favorite was being able to be part of sale support and enterprise. I liked all my work team everyone is so friendly."
good,one thing i disliked about this job was closing time we would have 10 min to close then you will get you late shoppers running in. also another thing was folding every pile of clothes
good,The management team is all great and talk to you as an equal rather than a worker. They hire great people and i have made plenty of new friends. I've moved into other departments and i'm learning new skills very often.
good,I regret not working there anymore. The management is so kind. The employees are friendly and caring. Everyone is so amazing at that company.
good,The management and customers at JCPenney are really what make this job worth it. This was a place I could go into every day and not dread the experience that comes with it. I would highly recommend this job for anybody looking to have a fun working experience.
good,A typical work day includes working with customers and managing the look of the store. I learned to tolerate uncertainty and to be a self-starter.
good,"I have been with the company for over two years, and the management team, and my coworkers keep everyday enjoyable. I enjoy being able to interact with customers at the register as well as on the floor."
good,I've worked here for quite a while and have gone from shoes to appliances and have done everything in between. I greatly enjoy working here. All the managers are great and you feel like you can actually talk to them about anything. All my coworkers are great too and the customers are usually enjoyable to help.
good,"JcPenny's was the most relaxing jobs I've had, the customers were friendly and so was the employees. Every day there was a blast , never a dull and boring day."
good,"awesome job , great people, great store, and even better you mess with clothes all day! what girl wouldnt love that! You have to learn to make sure and keep a smile on that face 24/7 and you will not have rude customers."
good,If you worked hard and wanted to grow then this company is great.  Unfortunately the store I worked in shut down.  But I was allowed to don many hats and learn many different skills.
good,I loved going to work from looking at the new thing on sale to the smiles on the customer face. I love everything about customer service. The hardest part was the drive to work .
good,"I worked at SiJCP for 4 years started as consultant with hard work I moved up to SEC. I LOVED working at Sephora. Only downside was it IS a part of JCP, therefore all JCP policies applied."
good,"A typical day is brief direction from our lead to begin the day. I execute some of the visual changes in the store, such as changing banners, then move on to price changes for the rest of the day. We all work together as the pricing and signing team.We respect our leadership and are challenged every day to complete our tasks in timely manner. JCP is great company to work for with competitive pay and flexable hours."
good,"Receiving merchandise, checking it in on the computer."
good,My day started at 5 AM opening boxes of merchandise sorting them by size color department brand and style. From there its off to replenish sales floor. Folding clothes making sure the customers have a great shopping experience by maintaining a clean organized store. Provide excellent customer service. Maintain a clean and well-organized stockroom. My co-workers and supervisors were awesome. They gave me rides to work and home when they found out I left home at 2:30am just to make sure I was on time at 5am because I had to walk. Another co-worker even went as far as buying me a bicycle so I wouldn't have to walk. I really enjoyed my time there and would go back anytime.
good,"JCP in Pendleton is tons of fun to work at, the management team are great at motivating you to do better at your job and can always come up with more projects if you need something to do"
good,My experience at JcPenneys has been wonderful. I work with the nicest people and we have the best clientele. Aside from those basic big corporation difficulties its a wonderful environment to work in.
good,"My duties included: handling accounts payable, cashier, customer service, opening and closing of cash register till, supervise other employees. Love working with customers and meeting new people everyday."
good,"I loved working with customers helping them buy the right products and helping them get their items delivered on time for their interst or needs, it was a growing experience. I would do it again"
good,"Great fun atmosphere where you can enjoy conversing with different people from all walks of life .great management love that you can talk to them about anything , there doors are always open. I cant say that there is a hard part of the job the only thing I can say is if your not a people person then it wont work well for you .but I loved working there I can say I got a chance to let go of fear and be confident to converse with people without feeling timid .I love being able to talk with new people each day and love being able to be great help to them as well."
good,Loved the team. It was bit hectic working here. I was very much involved in the development of most of the modules. The most tough part is memory management.
good,Pleasant place to work. Organized and there is always some work to do.Management and co workers are nice. Working in JCPenny was a great experience.
good,"Jcpenney has great growth opportunity. Your managers are trained to help you develop and they give you the tools you need to be where you want to be. Work life balance is tough. You will rarely get weekends off and you will work long hours. However, the pay is surprisingly great!"
good,It's an OK place to work if you've worked there for 20+ years.  New comers are not all that welcome.  Very in-crowd oriented and extremely resistant to change.
good,Working on the floor is fast paced and you must have great customer service.   I have learned working this job that you must be able to do several different jobs at the same time. The managers and employees are always ready to help when needed.  We always had fun while working making the time go fast.  The hardest was working over nights changing the stores floor.
good,"The fun part of retail is that every day you will experience challenges so it is never slow and your day will go by quickly. You are constantly learning new core standards, the sets change monthly and you will always be moving merchandise that will be featured in the current ad. The managers at JCPenney have a very good work ethic and are very customer orientated. Managers are taught to have an open door policy so as to take care of associate issues on the spot. There will always be associates who perform on an A, B and C  level;  consequently there are varying degrees of partnership. On the whole co-workers do a very good job assisting each other. The hardest part of the job is time management. Due to the hours that the store is open, it may be challenging to have a good work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great group of associates that JCPenney attracts. Making a customer highly satisfied is very rewarding, especially when they come back and remember the great service that they were provided."
good,My job as a loss prevention led associate is to make sure my team is on time at work every day.  I give assign the team work with a list of work for the day. We set goals and how we will accomplish them. We conduct random surveillance on shoppers that look steal merchandise for out store. Our mission is to protect our company mechanize.
good,"When I worked at J.C. Penney I helped my clients with their measurements for their window treatment. I decorated their entire homes for them. Customer service open charge accounts, and refunds. Display changes in the department."
good,"The JCP company is very good to their associates.  Providing much more than most retail stores.  I usually have the tools to do my job and the newest CEO seems to be turning a lot of things around.  In my experience with other retailer JCP provides their associates more then most.  Doing lunches, celebrating inclusion and diversity and the management staff that I work with is great."
good,I learned cash handling and I learned how to deal with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer find the product that they are looking for!
good,"In the beginning, it was difficult to get used to the various hours. After working here for a while, I got used to it. I have met several great people  here and the management understands that life does happen and they will work with you to resolve any work related scheduling issues."
good,"well i loved working their it was a chance to get to meet new people. Also, a chance to learn a lot of responsibility. I also learned its not good to get into a argument with your co-worker because it will make the job more harder."
good,"JCPenny was wonderful at identifying the needs of the employees and doing everything possible to train and aid in their skill sets to improve opportunities for advancements. "
good,"My only reason for giving two stars for Job Security is because it was a temporary position. Had I been asked to stay on, I'm sure the rating would have been higher. I learned a lot about retail sales, updated Point of Sale systems, compared to the ones I was used to. I loved working with the customers daily and really enjoyed all of my coworkers. It was a fun, energetic place to work. The management team was so encouraging to everyone and always made time to help the new employees with questions and concerns. If we, as new hires weren't sure about something there was always someone there to help, be it a member of the management staff or an employee who had been working there longer than us. I actually miss working there."
good,Jcp always have things going on to keep you wanting to come to work everyday. I have learned that everycustomer is to be handled differently based on their needs. I love jcp because there is always job advacement. I got prot=moted I my first 60 days of working there. The coaches are great and the training classes taught me everything I needed to know.
good,I really liked everything about this job but the hours were non-negotiable when I started and it didn't work out to well but i would definetly go back if i had the chance
good,Working in Jcpenney Was calm environment like my experience I have no cons about it  & the drive was achieving the months goals .
good,"good place to work for part time seasonal work, good rewards for making goals, and great staff. not a lot of room for growth. hours drop after season changes."
good,"Worked at JCP HOME Store for 1 year in Des Moines, Iowa, then many years in Salisbury, MD JCP store. The JCP culture of ""a fair price for a well made item"" was still in place while I was a part of JCP.  I was proud to be part of that philosophy of retail.  Good training and support from the top down (CEO to department supervisors).  Good people to work with.  Lots of variety in a day's time.  Some ""politics,"" but no more than to be expected.  If you did your job to the best of your ability, you were good, and usually were commended on your efforts.  Advancement was easy for me.  Loved all of the positions I held during my years at JCP."
good,"we all get an assignment to do but we all work together as well, but it was only temporary, but while it lasted it was good work place."
good,"If I am the opener- Morning Meeting, Make sure department is nice and up to core standards,check display prices, open registers, put any items back to floor/stockroom from the previous night."
good,Pleasure working with the public and using outstanding customer services skills.  Great place to use your creative and multitask abilities.   Acknowledgement
good,Jcpenney is a great company to work for. Ive found the company is great for team work. The benefits offered are great as well.
good,"Jc Penney sets very high standards for customer service. This employer taught me to bring the best customer service to the table and to keep out customers coming back for more.  may day consisted of either opening of closing the store and providing customer service and expert product knowledge. The management and co workers are a joy to be around.  The management were great at providing constructive criticism and pointing out room for improvement.  The co-workers I worked with were very friendly, and outgoing.  The one thing we all had in common was the enjoyment of bringing smiles to our customers faces.  The hardest part of the job was the holiday season as the store was incredibly busy and got fairly messy.  Keeping up with the image as well as the mass shoppers was a difficult juggling match that became very enjoyable when the day was done and we went over our daily sales."
good,"I did like my manager because this person did take the time to listen"
good,I got a long well with everyone from management on down. I never missed a day of work because I really like the work environment.
good,"I liked working in the legal department of JCPenney because the litigators were first chair in the majority of their cases.  Occasionally, litigators were assigned to manage a particular area.  Litigators did not have to bill or keep time records.  Litigators never had to be concerned with where the next client would come from - only to handle the case effectively.  The litigators helped each other and used the vast amount of documents in the system.  The other departments were helpful and professional and very cooperative during lawsuits."
good,This is a fun working environment i loved working here. great management team nice and helpful co workers. great place to work
good,"Preform the same duties as previous, also was being trained to do advance payments for orders being taking or orders  on hold"
good,Worked with a great group of co-workers and customers.  Management was on point with sales and the customers desires.  The holidays were the best with all the beautiful decorations and busy shoppers.
good,"Didn't have enough clients, great management, co-workers very friendly, required out of town classes and if you couldn't make the classes it determined your pay"
good,"Typical day at work is dealing with customers all day, makes my day very enjoyable. My management is amazing, hardest part of my job would be getting the customer to understand coupon exclusions. I enjoy dealing with different customers daily, You get to make a connection with so many individuals and make their day a little better."
good,"Worked well with others, whenever I asked for help someone was always there to explain or do a little hands on training. The one thing I liked was If there was a family issue, they would take an excuse. We could put in overtime without questions asked espciall during holidays."
good,I really enjoyed working helping customer needs.I stocked merchandise and I have a passion for achieving good customer service
good,"I love being in a department store especially working in the kids section and seeing all of the cute things. The time kind of goes by fast when you're actually doing what you need to do. Around the holidays it gets really busy, especially Christmas."
good,"JCPenney is a fun place to work. The managers are kind and work alongside you - they never pull the, ""I'm the manager"" card. You take your breaks and lunch breaks when you can or want to and it is very easy to get a schedule that works with your lifestyle as long as you talk with the HR. The discount is nice too - 25 percent."
good,"I assisted customers with furniture purchases for their children, mainly bedroom furniture.  As a store manager, I opened and closed the store and was responsible for daily operations.  I had four employees working with me whom I hired, trained and supervised to sell furniture for children.  The hardest part of the job was watching the children faces light up when them came into the store and their parents did not purchase items the children wanted.  Working at Furniture for Kids was a very exciting place to work because the store's layout was like Disney World with bedroom sets of most every kind and the atmosphere was so exciting for the children; there were princess beds, boat beds, firehouse beds, loft beds all kinds of fun furniture for children!"
good,Providing the best customer service making customers and your co workers build a special bond with you so when they come in they feel so comfortable that its a warm feeling like home when they shop.

good,"I really enjoyed the Management and co-workers I work with and for. I enjoyed meeting new customers, and seeing returning customers. Great place to work."
good,I love how we as a team can come together to make things happen and when we have have problems our manager door is always open and he always there to listen to any suggestions or problems we may face
good,This was a cool layed back job. I could wear what I wanted and make my own schedule. The managers treat you more like family than anything and they are amazing.
good,Working with others give me a great experiance to learn more about people and how to treat your customers.Enjoying the work area was great to me.
good,"JCP was a great employer that not only cared for their customers, but also their employees. They gave out great incentives for a job well done."
good,"Clock in, since I was only seasonal we had a group leader and depending what section we had that day is were we would be working at, for example, boys and girls section, men and women, shoes, accessories etc. we would have to organize and put everything back where they went, also fold clothes."
good,"Ringing customers up at the register, providing knowledge in merchandise available, keeping the clothes out on floor organized, and fitting room clean."
good,"Stylish, fun, clean environment. I consider it to be my first real job and was very disappointed that it was only seasonal."
good,"As a jewelry consultant in a customer service environment, it was a great experience. I learned about types of jewelry and how to asset their pieces throughout the store. The customers were friendly and made my job easy. Most of the work entailed cleaning, organizing and conversation with people on a daily basis, which is what I enjoy."
good,Due to moving out of the area I was forced to leave the company. I enjoyed the people and the management. My duties were to help customers place orders from the company catalog.
good,this is a fun diverse place to work.  The employees are profesional while still being like a family having things like dinners and baby showers in the breakroom
good,"At JCpenney I would cashier, clean the fitting rooms, do display, restock, inventory, meet credit card and catalog quotas, price merchandise, answer phone inquires, open/closed registers and provide great customer service."
good,"For this job you need great time management skills. You need to check fitting rooms every 10-15 minutes, meet credit application quotas, get customers to take survey and give you the best scores,while maintaining the look and feel of the departments."
good,"A typical day at JcPenney, for me would be answering the phone, ringing up customers, putting clothes back on the racks, welcoming customers and making sure they are finding what they need. A few things I've learned from working here is that you have to be very patient with customers and very understanding. Managers at jcpenney are very supportive and helpful. They are also very caring of the store, customers and associates as a team. I wouldn't say this is the hardest part of my job but rather challenging is being able to calm an angry customer. The most enjoyable part of my job being able to hear a customer tell me they appreciate all that I have done for them, and also just being around my coworkers and supervisors."
good,"Jcpenney was a good place to work at nothing to hard to really do, all was simple but lots of it..i would work there again for sure...Typical day would start out with unloading and organizing truck, running backstock, and going on the floor and folding clothes and seeing if the customers needed any help"
good,I worked part time and enjoyed it. However it is now closed. We miss it being here in town. All workers were nice to work with.
good,"I cannot put into words about how much i enjoy going to this store."
good,"I always felt that JCPenney was a great place to work. A person worked hard and at times many long hours but the company always provided meals for us to help make our jobs a bit more rewarding plus I learned to work well with the public."
good,"Opening and Closing store. Learned different sales and organization skills along with customer service skills Management were amazing, they knew their material, very helpful in every aspect and were grateful of all employees and the work we provided. Co-workers were very nice and caring, could count on them to help you complete tasks and it didn't matter what department everyone helped each other to build and have a friendly environment for the customers each day. As far as hardest part of job was the long hours put in every once in awhile but at the end of it all it was rewarding and enjoyable. Just the job as a whole was very enjoyable, work was fun everyday."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was to go above and beyond of what was required for me to do--Assisting others as needed and excellent customer service.
good,I was in charge of booking appointments and helping at the front desk while still doing clients hair. It was fun getting to learn about our merchandise and help clients find products. I got to build a lot of wonderful relationships with our returning clients. I loved taking care of laundry and cleaning and helping the salon run smoothly.
good,Love working of this company. Lots of room for advancemt and training.
good,"During my employment at JCPenney, I've gained a lot knowledge in the retail and other great techniques that will later help in my retail career.

good,Great place to work. I would highly recommend this company.
good,"I would work mostly on the register and fitting rooms. Checkout customers, put back items, etc. Management wasn't all the great. Didn't work well with out schedules when I needed certain days off or concerns. I mostly kept to myself with the co-workers. I didn't like the fact that they made us stay til 12a/1a most nights. I had school the next morning. The most enjoyable part would be working with the customers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job consisted of helping each customer and fulfilling their needs. Overall, I mostly developed cash handling experience, professionalism, and exceptional customer service skills."
good,I liked working with people and helping people find things. The people were very nice
good,"Courteously greet customers and efficiently process transactions within busy, fast-paced retail environments. Operate cash register, scanners and computers to itemize and total customer purchases; collect payments and make change for cash transactions; and balance drawer at the end of each shift. Assist with store stocking, loss prevention, floor-sets, and opening/closing procedures. Displayed a positive, helpful attitude on a daily basis that was consistently praised by customers and employers alike. I normally was in my department by myself or with one other person, unless we as busy. I was able to work well with little or no supervision and was able to get things done. I do not like standing around while working, if there are no customers and no recovery to be done, I love to start floor sets and put out stock, help with signing and pricing."

good,management is very nice they are flexable with school or whatever you have going on. downside is there is very little room for advancement. i loved it there but if you worked hard they wouldnt move you but if you was never in your department they would advance you to manager to try to keep you in one spot
good,"would come in and review goals and sales; then head to the sales floor to assist customers and maintain  the sales floor."
good,"Nice place to work. The only issue was that they wouldn't put enough people on the clock and expected everything to be done by the time of close. Sometimes very unorganized, but positive people to work with. Make it worth coming to work."
good,"*everyday was a fast pace"
good,"Answer customers' questions, and provide information on procedures or policies. "

good,Working at a portrait studio was a fun. Taking the photographs was always fun because I was able to work with so many different people and they wanted different types of pictures. The serious part was counting the number at the end of each night and making sales.
good,We would have a morning meeting. I rang people's merchandise on the register.
good,"This was a good job it was different, but it was enjoyable the days went by really fast. I didn't really meet the management but the person that was lead was so sweet and nice she made sure whatever I needed she got for me my co-workers were nice some were quite but I am a very interactive person that talks to everyone and they became close. Meeting people was the most enjoyable about this job. there was really hard about this job just the heat in the summer time.   Teamwork is a big learning skill at this job also."
good,"Management is very nice, easy to work for, "

good,"This position was more productive and rewarding, a typical day involved more customer contact and merchandising, this position actually is were I learned the jeweler business, management was superb and my co-workers all worked as a team than individual.  My must say the hardest part of my job would be an unhappy customer which, in the end was turned around and just the atmosphere was enjoyable."
good,"JC Penney is a very clean place to work at. I love fashions. There was never a day that I would not want to work there because everyone there is very nice and talkative. They made me felt like I belong there. I've learned that working at this retail store, it is a very strict place. The manager expects us to put every thing from sizes to colors so that it would be easier for customers to find what they needs. All of my co-workers are all fun to work with. They made my day/shift go by fast. They helped out a lot on the things I don't understands. The hardest part of the job is that we all need to keep everything organized and not let any of the clothes hanging wrong or not letting anything on shelf in the wrong position. And lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is working and getting along and knowing new peoples. I love how the job is easy and it had great management."
good,"At work I helped customers with any questions they had. If I did not know the answer I would find out the answer in a quick time frame. I would ensure that the fitting rooms were well cleaned and maintained, I also ensured that all of the display tables and display racks were also well kept and nothing was out of place. Every customer would be greeted with a smile and no matter how stressed the customer had gotten I would keep calm and do my best to please each customer."
good,"My co-workers were very friendly, made going into work fun and exciting. management could use a little work, but easy to work with as well."

good,i loved working for the company it was very nice and the customers were wonderful to work with i i can only say good this from this job experience
good,Fun and always eventful. The managers and associates were always willing to help me. I learned a lot from the door to floor process to the management team. My co-workers were always energetic and helpful. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable part was everyday!
good,I have enjoyed working at JCP. Love the managers and the co-workers. We work hard. Customer service is our number one priority. We take pride in our store and how it looks. We also take time to have a little fun or a pot luck luncheon. All in all it is a great place to work.

good,"I had a mostly good experience at JCP  it was fun the employees were funny and great to be around.  I even gained a few friends even after I stopped working there.  I would say the hardest part of my job was finding something to do because I worked in the home department.  I did however get to see how all the new gadgets worked and because I like to cook and I love bedding i was in heaven.  The only thing was that you couldn't stand and talk it was nothing to do the shelves were stocked and the store was dead but we couldn't stand around and talk, I had no clue what to do.  The management was a little cold  they weren't very friendly.  My supervisor was a doll though, the store manager, and his assistant not so much, but all in all it was cool."
good,"There are a lot of work every day, specially Saturdays and Sundays."
good,I started out as a optical tech and I learned so much from my manager.  She made work fun.  Working in a JcPenney good because I was able to talk not only to customers but to associates.  I was able to grow with the company.   I was sad when they closed my location.
good,"A typical day here you would always fun. You would take care of the costumers and make sure that they were finding what they needed and make sure that the store always looked nice and everything was folded right. My mangers there were the best they always took care of us and made sure that we had the days off that we needed. And they always worked around my school. The co-workers there awesome, we all got along and made sure that everyone was doing okay and everyone was willing to help each other out. There really wasnt anything hard about that job really besides if you worked black friday. The most enjoyable part of my job was I worked in the kids department and I loved it when the little kids would bring me the shirt and pay for it with there own money from the birthday or christmas. "
good,"This company is a great company to work for.  It is the only place that I have worked and not felt any type of favoritism. All staff members and members of management are friendly and it is a team environment.  If the pay was better, I would still work there over anywhere else. "

good,"Ran the register, helped customers find their needs, went around the department cleaning up, and helped the supervisor/manager with their floor plans. Learned many things at this job. "
good,"A typical work shift is always exciting because unexpected situations always happen. Co-Workers are all awesome, but management can do a better job. I learned how to function in a customer orientated environment and how to conduct sells. "
good,"In this retail job, I did cashier and assist customer with any concerens. I did go backs and did floor working such as flooding, cleaning, arranging cloths and credit application. What I learn is that customer are always right and to stay strong in hard situations. The hardest part is some customers were rude but I learn to just let it go. The joyable about this job is that we got appricated for working hard. "
good,Im a hard working and like doing my job. I start by asking customers if they would like any help finding what they are looking for and helping them if they need it. I check people out on a register or a hand held register. I work well with others and Im a very hard worker. I enjoy the most is helping people with what they are looking for.
good,"It was a great company to work for. I learned how important detail is when it comes to distributing. Manangement was good, they did not look over you as you worked but made sure that work was being done. I enjoyed my co-workers, most was friendly and made the shift a ease. To me personally, there was nothing hard about the job, and I really enjoyed getting production."
good,"I enjoy this job very much, it taught me so much, it taught me how to treat a person, it taught me how to be sociable, it taught me that customers are always right, I met so many new people so many people that was going through so much in their daily life's, it taught me not complain so much about my life because its so many others out there that is going through worst than me. it was an awesome job, and the team helped me through a lot of struggles that I went through, If I had to do it over I definitely would"
good,A typical day was answering over 300 hundred call from people with problem with their orders. I learned that we all experience the same problems every once in awhile with orders we have delivered so treat the customer exactly how you would want to be treated.Management was great and so were my co- workers. The hardest part is when the relocated. I enjoyed every thing about the job.

good,"I was hired for seasonal work and had not worked for many years, thats why I am now looking for at home work. Part time use of my computer."
good,"A typical day for me would be processing payroll, editing time sheets, ensuring paid time off is accurate etc."
good,"When I left, core values were starting to deteriorate. Many great years and experiences at a number of stores in multiple assignments. Was truly a great place to work."
good,What I love the most about my job is the fact that there is something for everyone. There are always different options. I like working somewhere fast paced. Multi-tasking between multiple clients. Room for advancement has yet to smile on me. I've been up for 4 promotions and they've been handed to someone else. Management likes to appear happy and friendly but will step on whoever they need to make themselves look better.
good,this was my first job and i had been promoted several times but i was looking to find something more challenging.
good,I really enjoyed working here. I made some great friends with the people I worked with.

good,"I started straight out of beauty school,during my time at penneys there's so much opportunity to expand your skills you can watch videos,live classes and sometimes there's the opportunity to take classes in other stores, which include paid travel time. Also all the training lets you move up in levels from designer to senior to master designer which increases your pay. The benefits are good even to part time employees."
good,"Everyday was a typical, but I loved to be around the employees and the customers"
good,As a company they are great to work for. Management is always willing and happy to help you with what ever you need. The staff makes them one of the best places to work.
good,Retail sales at it's finest. Worked with wonderful people and the company benefits are very good.
good,JCP is a great company to work for. Medical benefits are offered even if you are a part-timer. The co-workers at JCP are so cool and down to earth. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people and seeing the customers happy and satisfied with their selections.
good,I would arrive at work and put my lunch in the provided refridgerator and put on my name tag wich has all of our pin's we are awarded. I punch in using a keypad and head out onto the sales floor as i walked to my section to key into the P.O.S system i would fold and rerrange items . The rest of the day was helping costomers find and buy items they need. The most enjoyable part of being a J C Penny enployee was helping people find what they want. The hardest part of being a J C Penny enployee was when the computers were down and we could not order itams off the internet.
good,I had to work from dawn till midday because I did the price change with a very great team. They taught me signing and how to check computer generated reports for instructions on which merchandise need price adjustments and print all the new ones. The hard part is standing long hours to finish everything and waking up very early on winter days.
good,"Listening to music while working and chatting with others. Pulling items off truck/shelves in stock room convrsating and enjoying the company of others,while store assistant manager dancing and having a good time as well.....Poor management with the workers in the stock room,with the pullers with the trucks in the early morning. As well as those who come in a little later in the morning and seperate the clothes from infants to adults and in sizes. Look its a cool place to get some money but your not going far there, with that slightly off management"
good,I worked for JC Penny a month and half as an associate sales member.we spent long nights in restocking the store and reorganizing it to be ready to the next day.it was so good when we finish and see the beautiful job we've done.I always felt respectable.the managers were so friendly and supporting.
good,"Everyday working at J.C Penny was a fun filled: full of laughter, very enjoyable stock teams, and nice customers. The managers were sweet and honest, and schedules were made flexible according to the associate's availability, plus i was able to continue my normal lifestyle. A friend an I both worked for the company, and I became very comfortable when we were placed to work together on the same team. The hardest part of the job was to memorize the back stockrooms because they were so big. Working for J.C Penny, being my very first job, showed me the value of a dollar and what how good it feels to come home with a check bi-weekly. I recommend anyone to work there for starters!! :)"
good,"A typical shift at work would be about six hours or maybe a little more, depending on the schedule. I would get there, clock in, and head out to the sales floor to find customers to sell shoes to. I would greet any customers who came close to me or who were on the sales floor, and I would also tidy up wherever needed. Once I got a customer who wanted a shoe, I would go to the back where all the shoes were kept, find the right shoe, and maybe some others like it, and then run back out to the sales floor to present them to the customer. If the customer wanted them, I would then handle the transaction at one of two point-of-sale computers at the front desk, and then start the process all over again. The people whom I worked around and with were all very good people, treating me with respect and getting the same in return. The managers were always helpful and good-spirited, and my direct manager was very nice and helpful to me. The hardest part of the job for me was interacting with customers; I am not the most social person, and it was hard to go up to strangers and start a conversation. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and manager, who were all very nice and helpful to me. I learned a lot while working there, especially dealing with many different types of people."
good,"As Customer Service Specialist, a typical day at work would include attending a presales day associate meeting;open registers in point of sale program;processing all transactions for sales, returns, exchanges, credits, giftcards; assist customers with locating merchandise and other items of interest; maintain fitting rooms and organization of merchandise displays."
good,working with customers
good,- Helping customers find shopping needs
good,"Call center by design, but not a typical call center attitude. Day started by loging into phone and computer systems, taking calls from JC Penney customer either needing to place an order and/or needing asistance with a problem order. JC Penney policy for excellent customer satisifaction made this position easy and enjoyable."
good,I had a lot of regular shifts every week and ended up with amazing regular customers. I enjoyed helping them with all their apparel needs.
good,"Great work environment , great customers and easy and steady work.cash handling easy to do ."
good,"A typical day at work for me is laid back and enjoyable. I learn something new everyday or someone new and that is what I enjoy most. Management is very friendly and easy to work with. They are always around and you can always go to them to have a discussion when one is needed. My co-workers are friendly and easy to work with. There is really not much challenging about my job, but the only challenge is making sure every customer is satisfied sometime the customer makes that more difficult than it should be. The most enjoyable part of my job is the understanding of management with my school schedule. They work with everyone and there is never a problem or conflict."
good,Most days the workload was consistent. During peak season overtime was sometime required with no notice. The management was excellent and often joined the crew members so that the job could be completed timely. I enjoyed the opportunity to be able to work overtime.
good,"working in the shoe department was not easy, but i had fun and learned some things along the way."
good,first learned my customer service skills here as a seasonal employee during the christmas season. work was chaotic but always kept you busy and going. never bored with nothing to do. supervisors are wonderful people and very helpful to new employees. the most enjoyable part of working with them was satisfying the customers!
good,"Typically, I was responsible for facilitating New Hire Orientation, (partime or seasonal) that I interviewd, scheduled and ran backround check for. I was responsible for all on boarding and paperwork, certifications, and Customer First training, I-9's and benefit packets as well as orientation packets. Training lasted three days or more for specialty departments, and after class was required to Supervise the floor each day. My day also included coaching, disipline, cash handling and jewelry audits. Change requests and lunch schedules were also routine as well as credit card sales and online sales and training while on floor. Customer service was our focus while on the floor as MOD and if needed I assisted the Engagement team with associate recognition programs, trained for buddy program and prepared food for employee luncheons. My duties also included distribution and maintenence of lockers, maintain employee files, and assist loss prevention in training, paperwork required for temination and witnessing terminiation. Coaching and floor training for associates as well as Supervisors and assist Sales Managers where needed."
good,JC Penney is a very pleasant place to work with G.R.E.A.T customer service. The managers and staff are very friendly and it's a real team environment. I learned how to catalog look up and use their cash registers. The hardest part of the job is going home and the most enjoyable part is coming in. I recommend working their to anyone who love helping others and enjoy being apart of a real team.
good,"Company is undergoing changes, but from what i can tell for the better. How ever will review when changes are done."
good,"Helping customers with what they are looking for, ordering it if it is not available in the store,greeting,cashier,stookroom organization, inventory,cleaning, setting up display of the department,markdown and sale signing, making sure customer is happy when they have left, working well with others and helping the new hires,always looking for something to do and I make use of the time I have without any supervision."

good,"I really loved working with jcpenney . My manager was amazing most of the time lol my co workers were sweet and we were just able to get the job done right. I learned that a lot of people shop at jcpenneys and that they work hard to remain a great store, the hardest part was people wanting to come see me but I always said that they can't because it was my work place. the most enjoyable part was the people and the customers."
good,customer pick items
good,"The mornings' would be slow, afternoons would pickup, special sales would be over whelming. Coworkers were easy to work with, the supervisor was flexible with the schedule. I helped men pick out women clothes, the hardest part of the day was when people would take merchandise and the employee is not supposed to approach the customer. The best part about working at JCPenney is getting a discount."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company and will do so again if I get another opportunity
good,A typical day consists of customers looking for a great deal on clothing. I used a cash register and computer to complete the purchases and take payments. This was a great environment. The co-workers made me feel right at home.

good,I rate JCPenney as a excellent company to work for. I enjoy working there.  I enjoy the work environment.  I am happy to be employed by this company.  The managers are very knowledgeable and treat us employees with respect.
good,"During the first hour of work I would start with inventory. I had to clean the carts and check the dressing room to make sure products weren't left behind. As things picked up, I would help work the register and provided customer service. Lastly, during the last few hours we would have to get ready for closing of the second half shift, which would be for individuals that are working till closing so first half associates would organize clothing and shoes. If you would work second shift most likely you will have about 2 full carts, so most of night shift individuals would work on carts and cleaning till closing."
good,"Fast-paced and end result oriented. Customer service 24/7. Family-like co-workers, very open hearted. Wish there were more hours to work. Other than that, everything else is nice."
good,"I had practically no complaints about working here, manager cared about the employees, and the need for hours, still remembers me to this day when I go in shopping there"
good,I loved this job and hated when they closed the call center in my state. They were very competitive and gave incentives for high achievers. I wish there was another call center close to me that did the same kind of work!

good,"Come to work check your emails and your teams previous days numbers then make sure your team under you is doing their job at all times.  We answer escalated calls if necessary.  As far as what I've learned is how to keep your team having successful stats every week.  The hardest part of the job is having to fire people, but thats what comes with the position.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with your team, other coaches, and managers that all do their best to work as a unit."
good,"Loved working for this company, salon encouragement and co workers all work as a team. Hours were flexible and accommodating to my disability. Great managers."

good,"	Monitored cash drawers in multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply. Communicated with vendors regarding back order availability, future inventory and special orders."
good,I enjoyed my time working here. Had to leave because I was getting to comfortable in my position that it got repeatetive. I had to leave a lot because of health scares but they were friendly and understanding. I left on good terms and an offer of return. Everyone working there were polite and supportive as well as helpful.
good,"For my career as a Cosmetologist, I do feel as we ARE being paid unfairly. I believe we should be paid $9 hourly. We are currently at $8.25. Commission is made from up saling service add- ons. A lot of these stylist have a hard time reaching commission every week since every month vary on the amount of customers make appointments or walk- in clients. We work really hard to reach out to customers to come into our store and stop by the salon and shop afterwards. As more than enough customers shop right after a salon service which ic raising sales every year. Hourly salary should increase."
good,I would recommend JCP for anyone looking for a comfortable place to work temporarily. The atmosphere was very friendly and both my fellow associates and management were pleasant to work with.
good,"I was only seasonal help, but it was a wonderful time working there. They worked with both my school and other job schedule and gave me the days I needed off as well. All of the coworkers are very friendly and sweet and you grow as a family with them."

There is a lot of opportunity for management positions and career advancement with this company and the benefits are really great."
good,"It was fun place to work.Learned about different types of customers."
good,I love working from home but going into lenexa for meetings rhat where only lasting about 1hour wasn't worth the drive. And when the system failed. We had to get into the Call Center in about 45minutes which was ridiculous.. Home agent is for staying home not gping into tje center to finish your shift whenever the system wouldn't work.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the work family and the customers. You made bonds with each and everyone of them as well as the customers. Also helping the customers find a gift or something that makes them feel absolutely beautiful will make your day ten times better.
good,I really enjoy the environment and cooperation with my coworkers. Its a very quick-pace job. Customers are very pleasant to work with. The manager is an outstanding manager!
good,"A typical day working consisted of operating  point of sales, helping customers locate merchandise, organizing merchandise, and providing a friendly shopping experience and environment. I learned that there are more ways to increase the quality of a customer’s experience. I learned how to handle different personalities and I learned how to interact with all kinds of people and I learned how to make the best for customers. I enjoyed every single moment I worked and There was nothing I would change about it."
good,I loved my job at JCPenney. If our store had not closed I would still be with the company. I had great general managers and my salon staff was the best.
good,"Work independent and well with other's."
good,We're I was at in Milwaukee WI. We had a bedbug epidemic at our job so they closed the office for a couple of months. Man-made wasn't no help at all during the time of the bed bugs epidemic. They only took down our concerns and was telling us that they were going to call corporate but they never call corporate. A co-worker of mine decided to do it and Corporate came to our office and they shut it down for a couple of months.
good,"The whole mission of the company is to save people money, provide services they don't normally receive, and have something for everyone to shop for. The entire management staff was friendly, the training was very thorough, and taking time off due to issues or health problems was very easy"

good,I LOVED working at JCPenney's! We had excellent management and the work environment was always very welcoming. The employee discount is nice (additional 25% off) and JCPenney customers tend to be a lot easier to work with.
good,"I learned a whole lot working here even though some things I already knew I just became better at. Helping customers look for items in store to helping them order and cancel orders online. I learned that customers are what make a business the business. Anytime somewhere comes in to pick up and order I was more than happy to assist them with it. Making sure all clothes and merchandise were in its correct places and keeping things nice and neat. There was not anything hard about this job, there was nothing to it but to do it and it was that simple. I enjoyed everything about this job."
good,"I absolutely love working at JCPenny, I feel like it’s my second home and my mangers and coworkers are family to me. JCPenny taught me how to be a great worker and also how to interact with people. If it wasn’t for them I would probably still be in my shell. I love JCPenny but I honestly think I could be doing better as hard as I work."
good,"This company is a great fit for anyone looking for a part time job with potential to advance into full time. Flexible scheduling is available for college students, mothers, and even second jobs."
good,"JCPenney was by far my favorite place that I have worked. The hours were super flexible, and I was almost never required to work weekends. Managers were super accommodating when calling in employees, either rewarding a $5 certificate or allowing you to leave when you would like. There was a lot of freedom with this job. The dress code was not very strict. The management stood by you when customers were upset, and they didn’t talk down to you. They had a way of forming a work relationship as well as a friend relationship, which made the environment incredibly enjoyable and stress-free."
good,"district manage is very unfair. "
good,typical work day.  assisting customers.  credit applications. maintaining depaetment conditions and stock replenishing and evening clean up: making sure sales floor and dressing rooms were presentable for the next day.

good,"Loved working at this store. Very supportive and encouraging. Management are very respectful toward employees. Employees are respectful, supportive and encouraging towards each other."
good,I have worked several years intermittently with JCP; always loved my job; settling a angry customer to compliance was the benefit of working within the Customer Inquiry division.  My managers throughout the years were always helpful whenever I had questions or concerns.
good,"Typically I start loading a cart with boxes full of merchandise, scan the boxes and put the merchandise in the correct locations while stocking. While packing, merchandise gets relocated to the person whom reads the order, double checks that the contents are correct and repack the box to be shipped off to customers."
good,It was a fun place to work. Alittle crazy at times but overall a good place to work. Always keep you busy. Flexible hours. Very nice staff and everyone helped each other out. Fast pace at times
good,"I love working for Jc Penny they are willing to work with your schedule, and we treat each other like family. It's just not busy enough for me, I love that even as part time you can still receive benefits. I love all my clients and the people I work with."
good,"Like all retail places, it was an ebb and flow so when slow, you find something productive to do after making sure everything is stocked, cleaned and put back where it belongs. The people were nice and I still see some of my former coworkers from time to time and still maintain friendship. As with other jobs working in public, meeting people and making new friends was the most enjoyable part of working there! The hardest part was trying to get customers to sign up for the JCP charge card."
good,"I absolutely Loved working for this company. They were very cooperative when it came to working around my schedule. I received a 25% discount on ALL items, even if they were on sale."
good,"Any given chance i would love to work at jcpenney again. The management was amazing, the atmosphere is uplifting and the coworkers and customers are always polite."

good,I enjoyed working in the office as Accuracy Senior Detail Assistant. I entered data into the computer and maintained the Accuracy Program for the Warehouse. I sent reports to each department and to my supervisor while meeting deadlines. I have made lots of friends over the years working at JCPenney's .
good,"I really enjoyed working at JCPenney. The employees were friendly and so was the managers in all departments and of the store. They have goals that you must reach and in the McDonough location if you reached those goals they would reward you with gift cards, gift certificates or other things like makeup from Sephora. You have a chance of advancing to supervisor or management or even switching departments if you wish. You work with little to no management depending on the supervisor and their trust in your skills. You make executive decisions, within limitations, when it comes to helping customers and making them happy. Training, I found, to be easy and everything is easy to understand. You are responsible for your department as an employee. See something messed up, fix it. It is that simple."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, helping ppl was my goal, I had a lot of fun with this company, they treated their employees  with respect, great open door policies."
good,"It's a nice place to work, however some of the associates do overshare on their personal lives instead of taking it as a serious workplace. The managers are somewhat understanding when it comes to having to get another associate to cover your shift."
good,"even know i only worked for the season, it was a really fun and up beat place. the management was vary nice, and the workers where nice as well. working here is easy folding clothes and putting them in correct places and sometimes helping costumers"

good,Jcpenney is a great company work for. Stress free and reliable. They have great workers. We really are based off of the customers and meeting their needs and expectations on a daily basis. Always acknowledging the customer to make sure we are satisfying all their needs.
good,"great place to work, always giving the extra mile to make their employees happy and motivated. always respectful with our time and theirs. recommended"
good,Typical day at jcp was first opening all the registers before we opened the store. After opening the registers I would check the fitting rooms making sure they were clean. And after that things were just repetitive. If I wasn't on the register then I was folding clothes and putting them back.
good,Great place to work. Management is amazing. Job is not extremely difficult but is very fast pace and has a lot to get done. Only con is that it is hard for them to schedule around your availability.
good,"A typical day at JCP includes: cashing customers out, returning and exchanging merchandise, making credit card payments, and helping customers find what they need in the store or online while keeping the floor organized for the next customer."
good,Great workplace with great managers. They listen to you and help you when you have questions. We all work as a team and they are flexible with hours..
good,A typical day at work was working with great bunch of people. We had continueing education which was very nice to have learning new trends. We stayed partially busy.
good,"As an associate I have never felt so important, my input actually mattered and I always got a pat on the back so to speak. The only reason I left was because the amount of store closings and lack of promotions. other than that it was amazing."
good,"Always upbeat and very good at rewarding good behavior.  Good training. Teamwork was great, Helping each other in different departments when needed.  Felt appreciated"
good,My position required finding shoe sizes and organizing shoes. There was also the cashier. Some days it is very busy and some days aren't. There is always something to do no matter what your position is. Just make sure everything looks good.
good,"I had worked at JCPenneys two summers ago, as seasonal. I had to leave because of school related things. I reapplied and I am currently waiting to possibly be accepted. The managers are great and they are very flexible with hours. I had worked in the children’s department, and it was fun getting to see different people everyday and get the job done."
good,"The management is cool and very flexible with working around with what is going on in life. The lack of hours is tough sometimes, but for the duties of the job it is paid fairly."
good,My job was very fast packs and it was something i could get used to the cashier part i hated to do the ladies dressing rooms they were always a wreck but other than that the manager and team memeber were great
good,Everyone there seems friendly and easy to work work. I love the discounts as well. You also get benefits after 30 days. So many great perks. And management there is great as well.
good,I Absolutely  loved working for jcpenney's! yes it was seasonal during the holidays but it was never overwhelming. the staff was a great team to work with.

good,It was a good steady work place. We worked as a family and a team more than anything. The work environment was amazing. If someone was having a bad day it wouldn’t be shown.
good,"Very stressful but extremely fun. It is fast paced. There is always something to do. Not a lot of room for advancement though. Hardest part is during Christmas. They do not give you very many hours off. I would leave around 3 am and have to be back around 6. Those that did not want to do it, had to find other jobs. Great checks during the holidays but zero time with your own family."
good,"Learning how to unload trucks and putting all the clothes out on the color , sorting through them , actually getting new experience and meeting people"
good,Greeted costumers entering the store. Politely assisted costumers in person or via telephone. Answered product questions with up to date knowledge of sales and store promotions.
good,"Lots of company events.  Fun fast paced sales environment.  Great benefits and discounts on merchandise.  Good management, room for growth.  Great place to work."
good,The manager was wonderful. The staff was fun to work with. They were very accommodating in an emergency or with problem. Clothing discounts were amazing.
good,"Great place to work, just not enough hours anymore. very productive place and great environment. The ay was also great, but i neded more hours o pay my bills"
good,"My duties, and responsibilities on the job was not only important but being in retail was a nurturing experience. At that time, helping elderly and our elder community was important. Nowadays, it's not really important."

good,I worked there part-time as a student. The part-time hours were very flexible. management was very chill when dealing with hour concerns. I would highly recommend this place for any students looking for part- time jobs
good,"My experience at JcPenney's was a good one. This people that I worked with were my best work family that I have ever had. The pay was not the best, but to me the people I worked with with out weighted the pay rate."

good,I love JCPenny I would recommend any of my friends to work there. A typical work day was average not to busy our most busy days ran around holidays. I learned that working with a team is something I love I loved my co-workers. My manager was very understanding when it came to anything I had to say. Hardest part of the job was keeping the floor clean like keeping clothing on hangers. Also keeping clothing folded on tables especially on holidays. The most enjoyable part was becoming good friends with my co-workers and making a customers day.
good,"Jcpenney is a great way to get your foot in the door to being a warehouse house worker. The patiences the leads and managers have to showing you the proper way of handling packages, returns, and loading trucks is  knowledgeable"

good,"I love my job but it is only part time and would love to be full time. I set and change the sale signs, it is important that things are kept organized and done in a timely manner."
good,I worked here for 4 years and my coworkers quickly became like family to me.  People here are caring and understanding of most situations.  However please remember that this is a business.  Attendance policy is extremely strict and customer first is priority here.
good,"Talking to customers, helping them find what they are looking for."
good,This job has everything you could want in a perfect hairstylist world except customers. The company does very little to encourage any business outside of it's credit card base. So the pickings for new customers are slim to none.
good,"loading and unloading merchandise , checking in trucks and stocking the showroom floor , helping store associates with customer service, plus running the warehouse as a manager and running a day by day employee contract that jcpenny hires to help"
good,Was a great place to work until it closed in my area.  IT was a sad day for all.  customers that call was great and loved helping the customers with solving there problems and helping them get the items they needed

good,I enjoyed working for this company and would go back if need be.  My supervisor was amazing and always willing to help and also further educate stylists whenever needed.
good,JCPenney' is a great place to work if you have a Manager that supports your role.  The benefits are pretty good and the staff are amazing.   They'er sales plan mirrors that of K-Mart/Sears so that's a bit unnerving but it's getting better

good,"JC Penney is an excellent establishment. My seasonal position was action-packed, as it was held during the Holidays. My coworkers and I worked as a family and we supported each other to lighten the load whenever and wherever we could. The management at JC Penney continually strived to provide the very best experience for the employees, so that we could pass that positivity along to our patrons The most enjoyable aspect of the job was having the opportunity to meet and interact with members of the public. During the holiday season, every transaction was an adventure. "

They support community involvement and encourage development within each associates roles."

good,Store is no longer in operation. The Eastland Mall Branch closed in May of 2015 and I worked until the last day it was open. I will say that the company did treat me fairly.
good,"Worked at JCPenney seasonally in the jewelry department and loved it! Management team was one of the best I've worked for in Alpena, MI. Only complaint is that I was told I'd be working more hours even after the holiday season, yet my hours were cut almost in half."

One of my former bosses left a thought with me that said '' Stay consistent'' and another boss left a thought  with me that's said '' Inspect what you expect '' though out my career I found those quotes to be proven. As a manager you only what you expect."

I love people and lifting others up whether it be coworkers or customers/clients. In my field of work, I have learned to have a positive attitude and it is better to make lemonade than to have just sour lemons on a bad day. I try to reach out to others in a positive manner by finding something positive in each person that the Lord brings in my path. I love all my co-workers and get along with everyone.

The Management Is Awesome, They Definitely Know What They Are Doing and They Try Their Hardest. I Loved Working There. The Hardest Part Of The Job Is When It Is Really Busy. It Can Get Very Stressful But In The End, Its Worth It. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Is Being Able To Talk To The Customers.

good,"A typical day at J.C Penney would include breakfast in the morning before clock in. After clocking in my team and i would do stretching exercises while being brief on the task of the day. My supervisor would explain if there was anything broke, damaged, late or just not arriving. If there were any known issues my supervisor would let us know and explain what the proper response should be to solve them while making a few jokes on what we should not do. After being updated i would check the board to see what job i would be doing. I was originally trained to pack,so if i was a packer i would got to my work station to make sure i have everything i need to get the job done safely and correctly. if it was unsafe or not properly stocked i would get what i needed or inform my supervisor. Once i had what i needed i would unload my bin and lay the merchandise on the table according to where it was being shipped. After sorting i would begin packaging each order in order (this way i would confuse myself).after completing one bin i'd go to the next repeating the exact same steps.There where a total of 6 bins in 1 station.After being with the company for a year i moved up to 12 bins which was 2 stations.If I was not packing that means i was either on the tower which i was trained on after a few months or in primary i learned that a little after my first year. My supervisor would also send me to learn other jobs in other departments like shipping, receiving,""W"" areas and "" area 6"". The hardest part of the job was dealing with new supervisors every year who didn't understand fully what it took"

good,respects employees they try and find you work when things are slow so your not sent home or just standing around. summer and fall are the busiest times of the year. Evenings and weeknd work is required.

good,A typical day will be to make sure you greet all customers and stay on task at all times. You always want to try your best to make a sale and find something a customer is looking for because you always want them to come back. By doing all of this you want to keep up with the sales floor by keeping it neat and putting away any merchandise that is needed.
good,"I loved working for J.C. Penney's. I learned a lot while I was an employee at J.C. Penney's, J.C. Penney'sis located in Houston Tx, in the willowbrook mall. Working in a retail enviroment I get to meet a lot of diffrent people from all diffrent state."
good,"A typical work day was to sign on the computer and take catalog orders over the phone.  If an item was out of stock I would suggest other items such as a shirt pants it depended on the items that were ordered.  I learned too work with people of all different ages and skills and I trained people to do take the on like orders.  I did not find the job hard, in fact they subbed me out too different people and learned 3 different computer systems.  I love working with the public, I enjoy hearing about different peoples life's.  I loved running the United Way Meetings, and taking on new tasks"
good,"Everyone is always nice and extra hours are always offered, early morning shifts were always the hardest and you are always given the opportunity to learn more"
good,"I really enjoyed working at JcPenney. A typical work week would consist of 50 hours of working. At the time, I did not have any kids I was just married so working the nights, weekends, and missing some holidays did not really bother me. I at one time had about 150 addociates and 3 supervisors under me which became challenging because I liked having one on one time with each associate to get to know them and let them get comfortable with me so they can ask me questions. With having that many associates made their experience less personal/warm feeling."
good,while I was working here the most enjoyable part of the job was when black Friday came and we gained a huge rush. once the rush came everyone joined up as a team and wrung the customers up swiftly and professionally.
good,"A typical day consisted of hair product recommendation, booking of appointments by telephone/walk-in, and confirmation of appointments by telephone. What I learned was what products work best of what hair type and also what developers/colors to use achieve a desired result (color). Management did need to learn how to speak to their employees. She tended to scold or yell at her employees in front of customers. My co-workers were friendly with a select few who did have a catty attitude, but that is found at every job. There wasnt really anything hard about the job other than dealing with the managers attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and seeing the satisfied looks on their faces after they got their hair done."
good,my coworkers are great the hours not so much wish i could get more hours so i won't have to look for a 2nd job since my job requires that i do have to get up early for work every morning.
good,"A typical day at work required me to organize the juniors and misses department, work at the cash register, and greet customers. Over time I learned exactly where all of the clothes went including the name brands we carried. I also learned in training how to work the cash register (adjust prices if needed, pay a bill, credit applications, refund money back on a credit card, and how to close the registers at night). The managers and store manager were all awesome. They made the job enjoyable to make everybody move fast but have fun at the same time. The co-workers were just as nice and fun to work with. We all would help each other clean if we saw that a section was completely trashed. Every one worked very hard and made the store look spotless by night time even around Christmas time. This job wasn't difficult but it was challenging when a lot of cleaning needed to be done when merchandise was on sale or clearance. I enjoyed helping customers find the perfect outfit and best deals."

good,"I loved working at JCPenney and I enjoyed working with everyone . I would love to work there again honestly. My only problem was that, whenever you called out whether it’s something important such as me being sick, it’s like they didn’t want me to call out."

On busy days management would always make sure there was enough associates working on both floor and register so that the customers were being attended in an fast and orderly manner. The most enjoyable part is changing up the store for either upcoming holidays, season, or just style of clothing. The hardest part of the job would the amount of returns the closing team had to clean up and put back."
good,"This job helped me step outside of my comfort zone, also taught me new skills. A typical work day was kind of a struggle due to the fact that I worked during the holiday season (seasonal).

good,Depending on the time of the year the environment could be slow or fast. Easy to learn customers who always shopped. The benefits were a bit expensive but the discounts were better.
good,Productive and a great experiencing workplace. The company's culture was welcoming and family orientated. The work was balancing and stress free. Hours was reasonable and helping due to my school schedules. The challenging part was finding  my way around the stock rooms. I really enjoyed working for the company because I was able to help customers look and feel their best once leaving the store.
good,"Great Place to work, management benefit were great. Had no problems with this place actually miss working here. People were great as well made alot of friends here."
good,"go to a every register and empty the trash then take it up stairs to sort it "
good,The company is amazing and the management is great. I love working there but some days we aren't busy enough. I love doing hair and making people feel better about themselves.
good,Typical day at this job was always dynamic and unexpected. Each day there brought something new. Customer service can be challenging at times specially when dealing with an unhappy customer which can be hard. In the end is a win/win situation because we want to make the customer happy and customers want to leave the store happy. Being able to do that for a customer was what I enjoyed best. Management was always willing to work with my schedule and I loved being part of the team.
good,"Worked for J.C. Penney for a whole year. Enjoyed all of the stylists there. Each has the very on little ""nugget"" of wisdom they provided to help me succeed. Monthly training class were really informative."
good,As a freelance contractor I'm only at JCPenney a couple of times per month but everyone I've met there has been super friendly and helpful. The job can be demanding but everyone is respectful and gives you plenty of time to get your work done.
good,"This company is very good. I love working for this department store. They have different departments where you can work at. I've worked for Jcpenney jewelry department.. in this department you have a quota, have to know at least a little bit of jewelry."
good,I worked at the call center.  It is now closed.  Has been closed for over 10 years.  It was fun helping people make their purchases. There were no surprises with management. Workplace culture was straight forward. Sound management. The most enjoyable part was getting honored for your sale accomplishments
good,Started in july with a slow start. Managers were always helpful when it came to questions. Never felt belittled. They push credit cards and online orders but reward you. $2 for every credit app and a $50 bonus if you are in the top 10% of company for online order at the end of a quarter. Not a lot of room to go up. Have to wait till someone else leaves or they are forced to promote. Managers recoginze good employees none the less and are defensive of their employees with rude cuatomers. Work most holidays but you can request them off. Also got almost a max raise dispite only being here for 6 months
good,"JcPenney was a great place to learn about customer service, and fashion trends. Most management was fair and well trained. The work didn't seem hard because I liked the company."

good,I had a great time working at JC penny up to me retireing on 5/1/17. JC penny is great place to work..The associated and management staff are friendly. The environment is Multi culture friendly. The associated are hard working and delectation to what they do.
good,"It was a great environment with very friendly coworkers. The hardest aspect of this job was the lack of training in the beginning. The best part was the atmosphere, as well as brightening other's day."
good,"Will almost make a year of working there. LOVE the people in my department we all work with each other to get tasks done which makes the day go faster. Since I'm a cashier I ring people up, try to get people to sign up for credit cards and when it's empty I put away clothes brought to the register. Around the holidays the store looks a little crazy but it isn't so bad."
good,"It was a very fine place to work, the supervisors and the management in general were very professional. I had to resign because I got to a point that I was working only 8 hours per week"
good,I was my own boss and I set my hours. My pay was according to the work I conducted during the day..I also did my own accounting and records..It was what I needed for my kids days and events..LOVE IT.......I had to leave because I needed more health insurance for my kids.

good,"I enjoyed working there with all the associates. I learned how to redesign a floor plan, how to manage money. Computer skills was a big one that I picked up on. I was in charge of making sale signs as well as updating signs. The hardest part of the job was making sure all signs were made correctly. The most enjoyable part I would have to say were the customers. I had multiple customers request for me. The management there was divided by categories. Management there was very good about working with home life and work life. They made everyone comfortable that  I could talk to them and feel welcomed."
good,"its a great company, you have a huge lunch room, tv to watch during lunch. i learned that working together as a team you can get so much accomplished. and its like a family atmosphere. the management team is very patient and always willing to train you. the hardest part of the job is when you have to go home and you were not able to complete a task .the most enjoyable part is being able to help your customers and they walk out happy, to work with and train your team. jcpenney believes in advancement from within. they are always looking to see their associates elevate."
good,"Having come from other retail jobs, this one was the absolute best. The bosses would always give a heads up on schedule changes if you could not check yourself and they were always willing to help."
good,"very productive work place and fun place to work, meeting new people everyday gave me a chance to work with them one on one and learn more about the customer"
good,The salon is a fun place to work because of all the different people that you meet. It is fun getting to know the hair stylists that you assist and learning how they interact with each of their clients.
good,This has been the best job I've ever had. They definitely work hard to make sure there is a good work life balance and fair pay for employees. They also understand that life happens and don't hold things against them when things aren't there fault. It's also very easy to advance in this company so long as you are doing the work. I saw many people move up and around during my time in the company.
good,"a day at work would be to make sure every costomer was fully satisfied. got the help they needed and always with a smile. i learned how to make someones day just by listening and helping them find what it was they came in for, the management was amazing and would work with you instead of leaving you alone in a busy area. we all worked together and everyone got alone great. i cant say i ever really came across the hard parts to much with this job, if i had to say something i guess it would be doing invotory but i never really did that part toi much. i enjoyed this job because im a people person and love being social."

good,I have used the Sephora products for over 10 years. I am definitely ready to learn the different products. I keep up with new products. I have extensive work with the public wth my public school administrative work. I would love for you to give me a chance
good,I would go to the register I was scheduled to be in. I would take care of customers that needed help picking out clothes and accessories. I would also help them check out the items and get a feedback on their experience while shopping at the store. I would also answer the phone to deal with customers that needed help with looking up items or directing them to the right department. I would also take of the go-backs (items that were left at the register) and organize them to make it easier on my co-workers to take back and to finish it faster so we can go back and take care of the customers.
good,it is nice place to work. people very team work oriented and are very helpful if you get problem and do not know how to solve it. I have very nice experience for 10 years or more working for JC Penney.

Having different responsibilities is the most enjoyable part of the job, I like staying busy and being productive."
good,"A typical day at Instyle salon, our first priority is the clients and the company. We make sure our station and the salon is clean and presentable to the client. I learned so many new skills with the clients and my techniques. The management team makes everyone feel welcome and known that if we have an issue we can come to them and discuss it. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the latest trends, but everyone there is so open to helping. The most enjoyable part of this job is the environment and faces."

Daily tasks included projects working on the floor, rearranging different fixtures, maintaining a clean work space and making sure fitting rooms were clean. What I learned while working at JcPenney's was how to come out of my shell, how to multi-task and how to gain other co-workers/managers trust in getting tasks done. The hardest part of the day would be when it's close to closing time and there are still customers you are trying to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships that I gained while working at JcPenney's, I enjoyed the people I worked with and being able to interact with the customers."
good,"JCPenney's, we came and went to store meeting meeting before the store was open, Then picked up the cash bags went to department counted the money in bag  and open registered and were ready to take care of customers who walked in or called in. We stocked the floors with merchandise, made sure the register quad was clean and neat. We spend as much time as needed with customer to help them chose the best product to accommodate the results they wanted. showing samples and color choices. Explained different products and the result they accomplished, and found out what exactly the customer wanted to achieve. Color, price, privacy, versatility of product. We had window covering training, at least 3 times a year to keep up on  the new product that were coming on the market for our store. Mangers had open door policies.  The store manager were the nice people to work under. Was a great place to work. I so enjoyed working with my co-worker as a team member, in the Window Covering Department. We respected each other customer and did orders when necessary for each other took phone messages and help customer get satisfactory results as a team. In the last year we had some new members who no longer respected other people sales and were taking sales and from other members of the team. This is just before the commission ended (I left about a mouth before this happened). We also went out one year for having the best displays in the district. I have lasting friend from my years at Penney's. Still keep in touch with many of them. We were provided a half hr lunch break and if we worked 7.5 hr"
